It was another mode of transportation- carriage- had an entire building dedicated to its storage on Cumberland Island. The two-story building featured a mechanical elevator to lift carriages to the second story for storage and bring another down to use. Models included 1-2 seat \"piano box\" carriages and covered 4-seat \"buckboard\" carriages. Automobiles were later stored here as well. The south wing included stalls where prized horses were kept and cared for.<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service uses the Carriage House as a maintenance facility. Visitors to Cumberland Island can marvel at the size of the building and get a glimpse into how the Carnegie family got around Georgia's largest barrier island. Several Carnegie carriages are on display at our Mainland Museum in downtown Saint Marys. The Mainland Museum is open daily from 1:00PM to 4:00PM.",

What distinguished these launch centers, was that they were surrounded by fences, and they were highly secured areas. So, you couldn’t just drive up and go in like you might be able to do with someone’s house in the American West, where you can sort of show up and they’ll invite you in for dinner. But, beneath this house, is actually what was really interesting.\" ~ Historian Gretchen Heefner</p> </blockquote> <p><span>Delta-01 occupies an open, grassy tract of land on the west side of a county road, approximately one-half mile north of Interstate 90’s Exit 127. The complex occupies approximately 6.4 acres of the South Dakota landscape with approximately 1.85 acres located within the security fence. Approaching the site from the interstate highway, it looks like a lone ranch house in the open grassland. Over the years, most travelers on the nearby Interstate probably did not give the site a second look or even know what military capabilities lay within the South Dakota plains.</span></p> <h3><span>Launch Control Facility (Topside)</span></h3> <p>This building functioned as topside support for the underground Launch Control Center which lay 31 feet below the Launch Control Facility (LCF). It acted as a multi-purpose facility. <br /> <br /> The topside supported the missileers stationed underground in carrying out their mission. Equipment such as a backup generator for auxiliary power, and environmental control provided backup support in the event of a power outage or an attack. There were always eight people on the topside, all enlisted Air Force personnel who were stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, 60 miles to the west. These personnel included a Facility Manager (top ranking Non-Commissioned Officer on-site), a cook and six security police. They worked three straight days on, followed by three days off.<br /> <br /> In addition, the site had bunk housing for visitors, such as maintenance teams who were required to remain over night at the nearest LCF if they exceeded 16 hours in a work shift at one of the missile silos. They would spend the night at the nearest LCF before driving back to Ellsworth Air Force Base the following day. The building also contained a Security Control Center, where all security activities were coordinated and personnel would be processed when coming on site. Other areas on the topside included a day room, dining area and recreational room that Air Force support personnel used while at the facility.</p> <h3><span>Launch Control Center Delta-01</span></h3> <p>For every 10 Minuteman nuclear missiles (known as a Flight) there would be an underground Launch Control Center (LCC) that remotely commanded and controlled the missiles. Since there were 1000 Minuteman Missiles across the upper Great Plains from the early-1960s up until the mid-1990s, there would have been 100 Launch Control Centers. The LCC at Delta-01 was 31 feet beneath the ground of the Launch Control Facility.</p> <p>Two missileers worked and lived on 24 hour alert duty shifts within the LCC. There was an eight ton blast door that had to be opened from within before an oncoming Missile Combat Crew could enter the LCC. The two person crew would spend most of their time monitoring the status of their 10 missiles. Among their other work duties was authenticating message traffic, remotely monitoring maintenance at the silos and assisting with the dispatch of security police if any motion sensing alarms were tripped at the silos. When the missileers were not performing work duties they would pass time by reading, watching television or studying for master's degrees through a special Air Force educational program. There was also a bunk provided for one missileer to sleep while the other crewmember kept an eye on the weapons system. Former missileer, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/davidblackhurst.htm\">David Blackhurst</a> remembered that missile duty was \"hours and hours of sheer boredom, punctuated by seconds of panic.\"</p> <p>Missileers waited and waited over several decades for a launch command they hoped would never arrive. If the command to launch was given, it would have come in the form of an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/ewo-countdown.htm\">Emergency War Order (EWO).</a></p> <h3>Visiting Delta-01</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/mimi-mobile-tour.htm\">Take a mobile phone tour of the exterior of Delta-01</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/photosmultimedia/virtualtour.htm\">Virtually explore</a> Delta-01's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/photosmultimedia/delta-01_topside-virtualtour.htm\">topside rooms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/photosmultimedia/delta-01_supportbuilding-virtualtour.htm\">support area</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/photosmultimedia/delta-01_lcc_virtualtour.htm\">underground control center</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/planyourvisit/launch-control-facility-delta-01-tours-and-tickets.htm\">All ranger-led tours of the interior of the Delta-01 facility require advanced reservations.</a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </span></p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Launch Control Facility Delta-01 site occupies an open, grassy tract of land on the west side of the Jackson County Road CS 23A, approximately 0.5 miles north of Interstate Highway 90, Exit 127. The entire site is 6.4 acres with approximately 1.9 acres located inside the security fence. Delta-01 is located in a rural setting and the site's access road, Jackson County Road, is an improved gravel road. The landscape surrounding Delta-01 is open agricultural land of native grasses. A couple of small agricultural outbuildings are located to the east of the site. From the site, a distant view of Interstate 90 and a billboard is visible to the south. Delta-01 includes fourteen contributing resources - the Delta-01 site, Launch Control Facility support building, Launch Control Center, heated vehicle storage building, hard HF transmit antenna, hard high-frequency (HF) receive antenna, hardened ultra-high frequency (UHF) antenna, survivable low frequency communication system antenna, cathodic protection rectifier, sewage lagoon, helicopter pad, ICBM super-high frequency satellite terminal antenna, television satellite dish, and HICS. Delta-01 does not include any noncontributing resources. Terrain at the site rises gradually toward the north. A chain-link security fence, topped with strands of barbed wire, encloses the site's buildings and structures. Access to the site is provided by a gently curving gravel driveway on the west side of the county road. The driveway passes over a steel cattle guard and through a remote-controlled, chain-link, sliding gate in the security fence. The Launch Control Facility support building and the vehicle storage building are located just inside the security fence, and an asphalt drive and parking area are located in front of them. The Launch Control Center, accessed from the Launch Control Facility support building, is located below ground and is not visible. The remaining area inside the security fence is covered with native grass that was routinely mowed by the Air Force. The area inside the security fence includes a variety of electronic, mechanical, and recreational features to support the facility, including a volleyball court, horseshoe pit, underground diesel storage tank, aboveground diesel storage tank, water well, gas pump, basketball hoop, flagpole, and utility poles. A code burner is located in the grassy area near the volleyball court. This open metal drum mounted on metal legs was used to burn security codes. These associated features and landscape elements provide insight into the use of the facilities by the Air Force and are significant elements of the site. The HF transmit antenna, hard HF receive antenna, hardened UHF antenna, survivable low-frequency communication system antenna, ICBM super-high-frequency satellite terminal antenna, and television satellite dish are located within the security fence. The cathodic protection rectifier is located outside the security fence along the access road. The underground HICS is not visible at the site. A concrete helicopter pad and two sewage lagoons are located outside of the security fence to the south. The area outside of the security fence features native grasses. A barbed-wire fence with wooden posts surrounds the facility's two sewage lagoons in the southeast comer of the site. The Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Facility Delta-01 contains a wealth of historic objects, furnishings, and technical equipment that reflect the successive use of the facilities by the Air Force. Delta-01, complete with its contents, was transferred from the Air Force to the National Park Service. The historic objects, furnishings, and equipment provide valuable insight into the use of this facility by the Air Force. The contents of Delta-01 are important and are considered associated features of the site.",

Forming a backdrop to the area are two coastal mountain ranges, the stark glaciated Barbazon Range and the heavily vegetated Deception Hills. Beyond these tower the highest coastal mountains in the world, the Fairweather and St.Elias Ranges. Less than twenty miles from the Gulf, 15,300 foot Mt. Fairweather rises prominently over the area.</p> <p>Five miles from sea, the Alsek River breaks into meandering channels fanning out over an 80 square mile delta, know locally as Dry Bay. The name \"Dry Bay\" derives from the fact portions of the delta became dry at ebb tide and when river levels are low. The Alsek is becoming shallower due to silting and glacial rebound which causes the land to rise.Where large ocean-going cannery tenders could sail 60 years ago, Dry Bay fisherman must navigate carefully or risk running aground in small skiffs.</p> <h3>Sport Fishing and Hunting</h3> <p>Sport fishing and hunting remain popular activities in Dry Bay for local residents and visitors alike. Unlike National Parks where hunting is prohibited, the taking of game, in accordance with state laws and federal regulations, is <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">authorized within the Preserve</a>. Sportsmen may utilize any of the three lodges that provide accommodations, or make reservations for the Park Service public use cabin located on the banks of the East Alsek River. A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/getinvolved/dobusinesswithus.htm\">commercial hunting guide</a> provides services to interested parties, while others may choose to camp. Three <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/getinvolved/dobusinesswithus.htm\">commercial lodges</a> operate in the preserve.<br /> <br /> *Location note: The location indicated here is for the Dry Bay airstrip, and is for illustrative purposes only.

But beneath the empty prairies and forested hills the gyroscopes are eternally spinning; these are the master navigators of jam-proof guidance systems, each ready to steer holocaustal destruction to a pre-selected target.”<br /> ~ John Hubbell, “The Missile That Closed The Gap,” Readers Digest, October 1962.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is no better place to witness the Minuteman’s role in the Cold War than at Launch Facility Delta-09. From 1963 until 1991 Delta-09 contained a fully operational Minuteman Missile. The Delta-09 silo was one of 150 spread across western South Dakota. In total there were 1,000 Minuteman missiles deployed from the 1960's into the early 1990's. These nuclear sentinels waited silent and deadly to perform their destructive duty at a moment’s notice.</p> <h3><span><strong><span class=\"subheading\">The Minuteman – Technological Wonder</span></strong></span></h3> <p>The first Minuteman housed in Delta-09’s silo was the IB. The IB was part of the second evolution of the system. An improved encasement for the missile’s motor led to an effective increase in range from the 4,300 miles of its predecessor, the IA, to over 6,000 miles for the IB. The IB weighed over 65,000 pounds yet could travel at speeds in excess of 15,000 miles an hour. To put this speed into perspective, consider that a person driving across the continental United States will average 50 hours for the trip. If they instead piggybacked on a Minuteman their travel time would be cut to five minutes. A Minuteman could strike its intended target within the Soviet Union in less than 30 minutes.</p> <p>In the early 1970's Minuteman II’s replaced the Minuteman IB in the 44th Missile Wing across western South Dakota. The missile housed in the Delta-09 Launch Facility today is a replica of the Minuteman II missile. The Minuteman II was considered a technological wonder at the time of its deployment. Upgrades had been made in order to improve precision and range of America’s existing ICBM force. The Minuteman II had a range of up to 7,500 miles, effectively placing it within reach of almost anywhere on earth. It had the capability to strike within 900 yards of its intended target.</p> <h3><span><strong><span class=\"subheading\">The Minuteman – Technological Terror</span></strong></span></h3> <p>Each Minuteman II carried a 1.2 megaton warhead. This singular weapon could wreak untold devastation upon an enemy, making it truly a technological terror. A 1.2 megaton warhead is equivalent to one million, two hundred thousand tons of dynamite. The Minuteman II’s warhead was sixty-six times more powerful than the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima, Japan and killed 140,000 people just before the end of World War II. One the most shocking statistics is that the Minuteman II’s warhead was more powerful than all the bombs the Army Air Force dropped on Europe in their successful bombing campaign that led to American victory in World War II.</p> <p>A Minuteman II warhead's 1.2 megaton explosion would release an unprecedented amount of energy. Any structures at or near ground zero are immediately vaporized. The blast fireball is a mile in width. Those witnessing such an explosive force see a blinding light many times brighter then the noon day sun. A tornado like vortex with wind speeds of over 150 mph engulfs the surrounding area for miles. The residual effects of radiation contaminate not only the blast area, but also send radioactive particles swirling into the atmosphere. The destructive effects of a Minuteman’s warhead are so great that the United States vowed to only use these weapons if all other policy measures failed.</p> <h3 class=\"subheading\">Learn More</h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/planyourvisit/directions.htm\">Information and directions for visiting Delta-09</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/mimi-mobile-tour.htm\">Take a guided mobile phone tour of Delta-09</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/photosmultimedia/d9-virtualtour.htm\">Virtually explore the interior of Delta-09</a></li> </ul> <hr /> <h4><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Launch Facility Delta-09: The Early Years - From Minuteman IB to Minuteman II</span></h4> <p>Official construction of Delta-09 began in the latter part of 1961. Two years later Delta-09 was turned over to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 1 November 1963, making it one of the first Minuteman sites to be activated at Ellsworth. The Launch Facility housed a Minuteman IB missile from 1963 until the early 1970's. Between 1971 and 1973, facilities at Delta-09 were modified slightly when Ellsworth replaced its arsenal of Minuteman I missiles with the more advanced Minuteman II.<br /> <br /> The most important changes associated with this conversion were contained within the missiles themselves, since Minuteman II featured a more powerful propulsion system and a more accurate guidance system than its predecessor. Changes included installation of new electronic ground-support equipment in existing racks at the Launch Facility; and the installation of electronic filters, seals, and circuit-breaking equipment at both sites to protect the facilities against damage from the electromagnetic pulses released by atomic blasts.</p> <h4>Security System Upgrade</h4> <p>The improved minuteman physical security system (IMPSS) antenna was installed at the launch site in 1989. IMPSS is a microprocessor-based surveillance system designed to detect outer zone intruders. It replaced troublesome older security systems so sensitive that they could be set off by \"elk, rabbits, even high-jumping grasshoppers.\" A hardened UHF antenna, installed in 1968 to link the Launch Facility with the Strategic Air Command's airborne launch control center, is located a few feet to the northwest of the silo opening. It rests atop a thirteen-foot-diameter, reinforced-concrete base, shaped like an inverted saucer. The antenna itself is housed inside a cast-steel frustum capped with a conical, gray fiberglass weather dome.</p> <h4>Always Ready, Always Waiting - Ready For Launch</h4> <p>24 hours a day, seven days a week for 365 days a year Delta-01 was operational. No matter if there were white-out blizzards or 110 degree heat, operations at Delta-01 went on around the clock. Literally thousands of personnel lived and worked at the site for nearly three decades. This record of constant vigilance is astounding.</p> <h4>Delta-09 & Minuteman Missile National Historic Site - Preserving the Cold War</h4> <p>In September 1991, all 450 of the nation's Minuteman II missiles were taken off alert. Delta-09 was deactivated in early 1993 and placed on \"caretaker status.\" Deactivation included the removal of classified electronic equipment, hazardous materials, environmentally sensitive materials, and equipment saved for use at other sites from Delta-09. <br /> <br /> In 1993 the United States Air Force and the National Park Service initiated studies to determine whether Launch Control Facility Delta-01 and Delta-09 could be preserved as a unit of the National Park Service. On November 9, 1999 Congress designated Delta-01 and Delta-09 as Minuteman Missile National Historic Site and the bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.<br /> <br /> Slight modifications have been made to Delta-09 to prepare it for interpretation as a static display. The launcher closure has been permanently fixed in a partially open position, in agreement with the START Treaty, and a glass and aluminum viewing enclosure was installed over the opening in 2001. A deactivated training missile was installed in the launch tube in 2001. The glass viewing enclosure allows visitors to see into the launcher to view the training missile.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Delta-09 site is located approximately 10 miles west-northwest of Launch Control Facility Delta-01. The Launch Facility occupies part of an open, grassy tract of land straddling a Pennington County Road, about 0.6 miles west and south of Interstate 90 Exit 116. The 90 acre site includes 10 acres that were in exclusive use by the Air Force including 1 acre within the security fence and 80 acres that were in concurrent use by the Air Force. The Delta-09 site includes nine contributing resources—the overall site, the missile launcher, the Launch Facility support building, the improved Minuteman physical security antenna, the hard UHF antenna, the cathodic protection rectifier, two azimuth markers, and a HICS cable marker. Delta-09 is surrounded on the north, west, and south sides by Buffalo Gap National Grassland property under ownership of the United States Forest Service. The launch structures are concentrated inside a rectangular area surrounded by a chain-link security fence. A double gate is located on the east side of the security fence. A gravel access drive leads from the double gate to the nearby county road. The area inside the enclosure has been graded to form a level, earthen platform that is elevated a few feet above the surrounding terrain. The platform has a gravel surface, and was specifically planned to provide maneuver space for the truck-like transporter-erector vehicles that hauled and emplaced the Minuteman missiles. The area surrounding the platform is native grass and the area was routinely mowed by the Air Force. The missile launcher and soft support building are located near the southern end of the maneuver space platform, with most of their structural elements underground. A smaller rectangular area at the north end of the platform outlined by four, low, small concrete corner pylons served as a landing pad for helicopters. Floodlights mounted atop two wooden utility poles at opposite comers of the maneuver space provided illumination for nighttime maintenance activities at the site. Two remnants of the concrete-base pad from the earlier outer zone security system antennas remain at the site: a square concrete pad with four reflector mount pedestals is located to the southwest (rear) of the missile launcher and a clutter monument and footing of the antenna pedestal are located to the rear (south) of the Launch Facility support building.",

All plants are labeled and grouped by habitat. The gardens are open seasonally every morning until dusk. There is no additional fee to view the gardens; you only need your park entrance pass.   </p> <h2>History of Wild Gardens of Acadia</h2> <p>In the early 1900s, Charles W. Eliot and George B. Dorr recognized the natural beauty of Mount Desert Island and the need for its preservation. Dorr purchased the Sieur de Monts Spring area in 1909 and named it the Wild Gardens of Acadia.<br /> <br /> On July 8, 1916, Sieur de Monts National Monument was established, and at this time encompassed 6,634 acres, including four lakes and ten mountains, within a contiguous boundary. George Dorr was appointed the park’s first superintendent, and that same year formally established the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation to acquire land for public use and for educational study and scientific research. He placed his private holdings in the corporation which included the Sieur de Monts Spring parcel and much of the Great Meadow, with the<br /> intention of donating them to the monument at a future date. Notably, the monument’s boundary did not include the Tarn, which had been transferred to the Trustees in May of the previous year.<br /> <br /> In 1918, the Wild Gardens of Acadia was recognized by the American Society of Landscape Architects. The following year, on February 16, 1919, Sieur de Monts National Monument became Lafayette National Park. Over the years, Dorr had apparently begun surveys for a “garden approach” to the entire Sieur de Monts Spring area. This approach corresponds to a 1926 donation of a north-south linear tract of land (Tract 11-114) that was conveyed from the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation, Sieur de Monts Spring Company, and George Dorr to the U.S. Government on May 1, 1926.<br /> <br /> On August 11, 1930, Tracts 11-113 (120.3 acres) and 11-120 (25.7 acres) encompassing the Great Meadow and the Sieur de Monts Spring area were transferred from George Dorr and the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Land and easements associated with the Museum property, Tract 11-121 (2.3 acres), were transferred from the Sieur de Monts Spring Company to Lafayette National Park Museum of Stone Age Antiquities on July 22, 1930. On August 12, 1930, this same land and easements, and the right for<br /> expansion, was conveyed to the U.S. Government. Nearby, Tract 12-107 (32 acres) that encompassed the Tarn was transferred from the HCTPR to the U.S. Government on July 22, 1931 (Land Ownership Record, 1944).<br /> <br /> Over time, various attempts by Dorr and others led to multiple plans for paths and gardens in this area. In 1961, Superintendent Harold A. Hubler offered space to the Bar Harbor Garden Club to develop an exhibition garden dedicated to the display and propagation of the island’s native wild flowers. The gardens and their winding gravel paths were laid out just north of the spring building [Nature Center] amongst “a tangle of maples and blackberries” damaged in the 1947 fire. The project gestured to the many wild gardens plans envisioned by George Dorr. As part of the arrangement, the park agreed to maintain the irrigation system and provide supplies. In 1985, the Wild Gardens of Acadia was acknowledged as a “Significant Contribution to Horticulture” by the Garden Club of America.<br /> <br /> In 2010, the Wild Gardens of Acadia became an official committee of Friends of Acadia and formalized this new standing through a partnership with Friends of Acadia and Acadia National Park—ensuring continued success and support from the park as an educational resource. The Wild Gardens of Acadia committee received the park's Partnership Award in 2011 in recognition of the “Wild Gardens of Acadia Volunteers for 50 years of devoted stewardship” from the National Park Service.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Located 15 miles inside Denali National Park, Savage River is accessible by bus (summer) or private vehicle (spring, summer, and fall).<br /> <br /> It is at this point that Denali's sole road changes from pavement to dirt, and traffic beyond the river is only possible by bus or under human power (e.g., bicycle).<br /> <br /> In summer, rangers are at Savage River throughout most of the day. Several trails in the area offer visitors a chance to go for a short or long hike. All visitors should be wildlife-aware and know how to behave in case of an encounter with a bear, moose or wolf. <h3>Geology</h3> <br /> Savage River is one of several braided rivers in Denali that are characterized by transitory channels meandering across wide beds of sediment over time. However this behavior is not the result of glacial melt, as is the case for most braided rivers in the park, because no glaciers remain in the Savage River watershed. Savage River is braided because of high sediment input from brittle rock, and from a relative lack of vegetation stabilizing its headwaters.<br /> <br /> An important transition zone that illustrates the glacial history of this area is located about halfway between the Savage River vehicular bridge and the Savage River Loop Trail footbridge to the north. Upstream (south) from this point, Savage River runs wide and shallow in a U-shaped valley typical of glacial scouring. Downstream (north), Savage River runs fast and restricted through a V-shaped valley typical of river erosion. Look for these distinctive shapes as you cross the vehicular bridge. While more extensive glaciations have affected the topography of the canyon in the past, they occurred over two million years ago. The river has therefore had substantial time to erode the V-shaped canyon that we see today.<br /> <br /> The Savage River canyon is one of the few places where erosion has exposed the Yukon-Tanana Terrane bedrock along the road. Take a closer look and you’ll notice large amounts of mica-quartz schist, a shiny rock that gets its sparkle from the flaky mineral sericite and quartz veins. The varieties of metamorphic rock in the Yukon-Tanana Terrane, along with the degree to which they have been folded and faulted, attest to the terrane’s age and dynamic history.<br /> <br /> Savage Rock, the jagged outcrop that you can walk to just uphill from the Savage River parking lot, is a surprising stumper. Why this outcrop is so prominent compared to its surroundings—despite being made of similar rocks—remains a mystery. One theory is that faulting caused the rock to protrude from the surrounding topography. A second is that it slid down from above. Or Savage Rock could be made of more resistant schist than the surrounding metamorphic rock. Further studies are needed to resolve this enigma.<br />  ",

            "audioDescription": "Bunker Hill monument is a cream-colored granite obelisk. It is 221 feet tall. At the base, it is 30 feet square. At the top it is 15 feet square with a pyramid topper pointing 13 feet high. An enclosed spiral staircase built inside the monument provides access to a viewing deck at the top. Seven small rectangular windows are only on the north side of the monument in the stairwell, visible at each pass of the spiral staircase. Square windows are on all four sides of the monument at the viewing deck level. In the center of the monument is a circular newel that runs from the base up to the viewing deck. At the base of the newel, behind an iron gate, is a marble Tuscan column about 8 feet high as a memorial to Joseph Warren. The monument stands at the peak of a hill. The park is largely green space with symmetrical pathways leading from the streets up to the monument. The monument is surrounded by an iron picket fence. Immediately to the north of the monument is the Bunker Hill Lodge, a relatively small, one story granite structure with its primary outdoor feature being six fluted granite columns supporting a pediment that forms the entry point. Inside is a domed entry vestibule with yellow and cream Italian marble and a white marble mosaic floor. To the left is an information desk. Entryways to the left, right, and ahead are arched. To the right is a corridor with closed rooms and closets and a water fountain. Ahead is a room that comprises the full width of the building and half the depth of the building with a white marble statue of Joseph Warren in the center of the room against the back wall. Flags flank Warren. Portraits and seating line the walls.",

            "bodyText": "Around the time of Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, soldiers of the Presidio of San Diego began building their homes outside the adobe walls of this fortified settlement. One the finest example of these homes is the Estudillo House, a National Historic Landmark located in the Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. Built between 1827 and 1829, the Estudillo House, or the La Casa de Estudillo, is one of the oldest surviving examples of a typical large Spanish-Mexican one-story town house in California. Since its construction, the house has served as a residence, a town hall, a chapel, a shelter, an early 20th-century tourist attraction, and a museum.<br /> <br /> Construction of the house began in 1827 on a land parcel that overlooked the Old Town San Diego plaza and under the direction of Captain José María de Estudillo, a commander of the San Diego Presidio. The great U-shaped one story house is built around three sides of a large patio and originally contained 13 rooms set in a straight line. The rooms are connected only by an external veranda. The adobe walls, averaging three to five feet in thickness, are coated with white plaster and gave protection in heat and cold. Originally a small round wooden cupola, used by the family and guests to watch the bullfights and festivals in the plaza, topped the house. When José María de Estudillo died in 1830, the house passed to his son, José Antonio Estudillo and his son’s wife, María Victoria Dominguez de Estudillo. <p> </p> <p>The house was to become the social center of life in Old Town San Diego. The building was so central to town life that, from the early 1830s to 1856, a large hall in the house served as the town chapel and as a school. José Antonio and María Victoria fostered within the Estudillo House an atmosphere of social, political, and community involvement in what was considered at the time to be one of the finest houses in Mexican California.<br />  </p> <p>Both José Antonio and his wife María Victoria were active and influential members in their community. By 1829, José Antonio owned three ranches in California, and as his wealth grew, so did his importance in the community. From 1828 until his death in 1852, José Antonio held many public offices in San Diego. He served as revenue collector, treasurer, mayor, justice of the peace, judge of San Diego under Mexican rule, and later as treasurer and assessor of San Diego County under American rule. While José Antonio played an active role in the development of early San Diego, his wife fully participated in the life of the Mexican pueblo and the new American city.</p> <p>María Victoria lived in the Estudillo House for over 40 years until her death in 1873. Known for her charm, compassion, and hospitality, María Victoria and José Antonio entertained some of the most brilliant and aristocratic citizens of Upper California in the Estudillo House. During the Mexican-American War, instead of joining her husband at one of their homes in El Cajon, María Victoria remained in San Diego. While the “Californians” held the area, María Victoria gave courage and spirit to the women and children of San Diego providing them with refuge behind the thick walls of the house.</p> <p>In the early 1850’s, when peace had returned to California after the war, unexpected deaths in the Estudillo family left nine children orphaned. María Victoria immediately welcomed these children into her home, and she bore the responsibility of raising this new family alone for José Antonio passed away shortly after in 1852. For the next 21 years, María Victoria continued to live in the Estudillo House, raising her new family, taking care of the sick, and performing acts of charity where she could.</p> <p>The Estudillo House remained in the Estudillo family until 1887, when family descendants moved to Los Angeles and left the home with a caretaker. Around this time the house gained prominence through its association with Helen Hunt Jackson's popular 1884 novel <em>Ramona</em>. Set in Southern California, the novel painted a romanticized portrait of Mexican colonial life, and it effectively generated a nationwide interest in the region. Publication of <em>Ramona</em> coincided with the opening of railroad lines to the region. This provided interested tourists with the means of transportation to see the locations discussed in the novel. While the novel was a work of fiction, tourists flocked to the Estudillo House nonetheless, because they believed it was likely the location of Ramona’s (the beautiful half-Spanish and half-Indian heroine) marriage. The Estudillo House became known as “Ramona’s Marriage Place” and was converted into a commercial venture.<br /> Due in part to tourist vandalism and the caretaker selling off pieces of the house as <em>Ramona</em>-related relics, the house sat nearly in ruins by 1906. Nat R. Titus purchased the worn-down house and sold it a year later to the San Diego Electric Railway Company, owned by sugar magnate John D. Spreckles. In 1910, Spreckles financed its restoration under the supervision of Architect Hazel Waterman. Restored to a condition closely related to descriptions in the novel, the Estudillo House remained a <em>Ramona</em>-related tourist attraction for many years to come. On one day in 1940, “Ramona’s Marriage Place drew 1,632 visitors.<br /> <br /> Donated to the State by Mr. Legler Benbough in 1968, the house became part of the California State Park System. Restored as a house museum identified with the Estudillo family, the museum now features furnished rooms, including a living room, master bedroom, child’s bedroom, workroom, dining room, chapel, a working kitchen, and a large courtyard. Through self-guided or docent lead tours of the Estudillo House and the many other historic sites throughout the Old Town San Diego Historic Park, visitors can experience the transformation of San Diego from a Mexican <em>pueblo </em>to an American settlement.<br /> <br /> Estudillo House (La Casa de Estudillo), a National Historic Landmark, is located at 4000 Mason St., San Diego, CA.</p>",

On the ground level facing Smith Court, the African Meeting House has four archways. From left to right the first arch has been filled in with brick inset about three inches into the building, the next two are matching green doors and the last arch is also filled in with brick inset about three inches into the building. Between the two arches with green doors there is a black iron lamp that is on an iron bar connected to the brick wall. Hanging from that iron bar is a wooden sign with a depiction of the African Meeting House. Above the iron bar is a small concrete marker within the brickwork that honors Cato Gardner. Above this first level are four evenly spaced large arched glass-panned windows that are connected between the second and third floors of the building. These windows have green trim with a white frame. Moving into the walkway between the Abiel Smith School and the Meeting House, on the far-right corner there is a small plaque that identifies the building as a site on the National Register of Historic Places. To the left of that is a small window that is not transparent, with green trim and a white frame. There are three evenly spaced glass-paned windows with green trim and a white frame. On the second floor there are four glass-paned windows, evenly spaced out, with green trim and a white frame.

Completed in 1914 as the “New Theater”, the theater originally catered to a primarily white clientele as a burlesque house. The New Theater was in operation until 1934 when the building was purchased by two white businessmen, Frank Schiffman and Leo Brecher, and renamed the Apollo Theater in 1935. Under their direction, the theater presented a permanent variety show format which featured leading black entertainers. The Apollo later became the premier performance hall for black American performers and a symbol of the movement to promote black cultural awareness in the 1930s. Its contribution as a nurturing force and a showcase of black talent ranks it as one of this country's most significant cultural resources.<br /> <br /> Nearly every Black American performer has played the Apollo, from blues singer Bessie Smith in the 1930s, to jazz greats Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington, to Dinah Washington, Sam Cooke, and the Supremes, through soul singer Aretha Franklin and James Brown in the 1970s. The Apollo became the center for Harlem's popular entertainment and one of the nation's most important arenas for the display of leading black performing talent.<br /> <br /> Throughout its history, it displayed every form of popular black entertainment, including comedy, drama, dance, gospel, blues, jazz, swing, bebop, rhythm and blues, rock and roll and soul music. In programing such a variety of Black entertainers, the Apollo's management contributed to the development of Harlem into the major urban cultural and intellectual center in the United States. The Apollo Theater remains as a building of great significance in the history of American culture, as it is a physical representation of the contribution of Harlem and Black Americans to the entertainment of New York City and the nation.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/75319263\">Link to Apollo Theater File</a>",

            "bodyText": "The Booker T. Motel was listed in the National Register on July 25, 2018 and is significant in African American history and commerce in Humboldt, Tennessee. Constructed in 1954, the motel and barbeque restaurant accommodated African Americans who were traveling from Memphis to Nashville. The motel had the distinction of being advertised in the <em>Green Book</em> and featured in Ebony magazine. The period of significance ends in 1970, when the owners, Alfred and Velva Pulliam sold the business. Mr. Pulliam was well known for his pit barbeque and special sauce sold in the motel’s restaurant and coffee shop.The motel’s barbeque restaurant was also one of the only places in the area where African-American guests did not have to enter through a segregated back door and is an important example of a Black-owned barbeque restaurant.<br /> <br /> During this period accommodations for traveling African Americans were few and far between. Strategically, the motel was located near the intersection of U.S. Highways 79 and 70A in the midst of Humboldt’s business district. The establishment became one of the few places African Americans could stop and stay while traveling.Much of the early-twentieth century roadside history does not hold much for African-American travelers who, due to segregation nationwide, were forced to plan trips carefully as accommodations and even places to stop and eat could be hard or impossible to find. Up until 1964 and even later, African Americans feared traveling because of the possible dangers that awaited them on their route. Stopping to use the restroom or grabbing a bite to eat was out of the question. Meals had to be packed in ways so not to ruin and roadside restroom stops were very unpleasant. Finding motels they could stay in made travel for African Americans more enjoyable.<br /> <br /> The <em>Negro Travelers Green Book</em> originated in New York by mail carrier Victor H. Green in 1937 to give African-American’s direction on where they could stop or stay along their route to avoid unwanted dangers.This book became a survival guide to direct those individuals to “havens” along their journey. In Tennessee, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s, accommodations remained hard to find for African American travelers staying outside urban areas. In the 1942 <em>Travel Guide of Negro Hotels and Guest Houses</em>, there are only sixteen entries for the entire state. In the<em> Green Book</em> the complete Tennessee listing for 1949 takes up less than a page with 12 tourist homes and 16 hotels spread throughout the state. Opening in 1954, the Booker T. Motel was quickly a success because by May 1955, owners had added the second motel building bringing the motel up to fifteen rooms, and completed the coffee shop, restaurant, and beauty shop. Even after segregation ended and the ownership changed in 1970, the motel went on to house, feed, and entertain people in the town while retaining most of its integrity including the original motel room plan and barbeque restaurant building.<br />  ",

The house’ significance was enhanced by the renown of some of its famous African American guests, who stayed at the Guest House while performing in the seaside resort town of Old Orchard Beach. Old Orchard Beach was one of a string of seaside resorts in Maine that became popular at the end of the 19th century and became increasingly accessible via rail and then automobile in the early 20th century. Along with the requisite grand hotels, sandy beaches, eateries and amusements Old Orchard Beach became known for its extensive pier and boardwalk, which at one point in time stretched 1800 feet into the water and featured its own miniature passenger rail line along its length.<br /> <br /> The Cumming's Guest House was owned and run by Rose Cummings along with her husband and her seven children. Rose Cummings kept a leather-bound guest register in which the names and addresses of all her guests and their length of stay were recorded. The first guest arrived in 1923 and the last left in September of 1993. Hundreds of names appear in the register, some of which reoccur year after year for several decades, and with addresses ranging from Oklahoma and Minnesota to Washington DC, New York City and the Boston suburbs. Although the business was successful, the Cummings Guest House was never mentioned in the vast number of promotional materials for Old Orchard Beach. It was never listed in Manning’s town directory or the Maine Register under Hotel, Guest House, or Boardinghouse. No formal name was found for the hostelry, it was commonly referred to by family and members of the community as a boarding house or guest house, or simply as ‘110,' a reference to its address. The house was frequently booked from May to September for decades on end, the Cummings’ Guest House is one of several facilities in Maine that catered to African American tourists via a network that relied initially on word of mouth and personal references, and eventually propagated through specialized touring guides like <em>The Negro Motorist Green-Book</em>. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/88687668\">Link to Cummings' Guest House File</a>",

Formed on January 20, 1898 by John Y. King and Colonel John B. Pinner, the Suffolk Peanut Company was the first successful peanut company in the region. The company was initiated by Pinner, an attorney and realtor, who was the company’s first president before later entering a partnership with King for his experience running a small peanut cleaning plant in Windsor, Virginia. The Suffolk Peanut Company was the first peanut business in Suffolk to be successful after the Farmers Alliance of Nansemond County opened the first peanut cleaning, grading, and shelling mill in 1890. This was the beginning of what would eventually make Suffolk the largest peanut market in the world, the “Peanut Capital.”<br /> <br /> The first commercial production of peanuts in the United States is believed to have been accomplished by Dr. Matthew Harris near Waverly, Virginia, in 1844. But it was after the Civil War that the peanut soared in national popularity. By the late nineteenth century the “Virginia peanut” had become the most popular type in the country. To improve marketing and profits, peanuts also began to be graded: in 1877 peanuts were sold as fancy, prime, ordinary, and inferior. Buyers wanted uniformity in peanut purchases. Cleaning and shelling peanuts also improved marketability. Initially much of this was done by hand, often by African American workers, but much of the process was standardized and mechanized in large facilities, like the Suffolk Peanut Company. The Suffolk Peanut Company warehouses and processing buildings represent the full range of functions historically associated with the site and result in a property with a high degree of integrity and significance. The Suffolk Peanut Company is a rare intact peanut processing facility and representative of an industry which once dominated the economy of southeast Virginia.",

            "bodyText": "Winks Panorama is a historic African American resort in Pinecliffe, Colorado. The property was used between 1925-1965 as a peaceful mountain oasis that offered African American vacationers’ leisure. The lodge was built by the original landowner of the area, Obrey Wendall \"Winks\" Hamlet in 1925. Early Lincoln Hills property owners came not only from Denver and other Colorado cities and towns, but from the neighboring states of Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas and New Mexico, as well as more distant states including Missouri, Florida, New York, Tennessee, Illinois, Virginia, Indiana, Michigan and Texas. Winks Lodge offered a dignified vacation retreat for African Americans to relax and enjoy themselves without fear of discrimination and abuse.  <br /> <br /> Winks Lodge remained open for business despite the Great Depression. In the late 1930s and 1940s, Hamlet advertised in Ebony magazine, one of the first aimed at an exclusively African American audience. The June 1952 issue of Ebony featured Winks as part of a \"Summer Vacation Guide\" of destinations friendly to its readership.  According to oral tradition, notable guests included musicians Duke Ellington, Lena Horne, and Count Basie as well as writers Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Segregation practices meant that after performing at jazz clubs in Denver's Five Points neighborhood, these highly esteemed artists often could not find suitable accommodations in the city, so they would travel the extra hour to stay at Lincoln Hills instead. As a result, Winks Lodge played host to some of the greatest African-American musical talents of the twentieth century. Guests were often treated to private readings and improvised musical \"jam sessions\" at the Lodge or at nearby Winks Panorama Tavern. <br /> <br /> Paradoxically, the end of segregation also meant the end of an era at Winks Lodge. Attendance declined as the Civil Rights movement demanded integration of whites-only facilities. In parallel, the appeal of an African-American enclave faded. The passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 brought a formal end to the era of legal discrimination in the United States. With greatly expanded options, many African-Americans chose to take their rightful place alongside their fellow Americans in newly desegregated public accommodations, rather than to continue visiting oases of the past.<br /> <br /> In 2006, the Lodge was purchased with the intention to reopen Winks as an outdoor education and events center that highlights the significance of Obrey Hamlet's mountain retreat for African Americans during the segregation era. Winks Lodge is an intact symbol of Lincoln Hills, a significant western enclave of African American culture in the years of Jim Crow. Winks Lodge offered a dignified vacation retreat for African American families to enjoy without the realities of discrimination and segregation. The story of Winks Lodge offers a window into an expanded view of the larger African American freedom struggle. African Americans fought not only to obtain the same legal rights as whites but to expand their opportunities for relaxation and enjoyment. The Winks Lodge represents the successful efforts of African American community in overcoming barriers and creating safe “black spaces” for nature and recreation.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=ba4afee3-a6df-4da6-ba53-8c10c18132f5\">Link to file on Winks Panorama</a>",

Most of Pueblo’s motels of the period were located along Lake Avenue, Santa Fe Drive, or Elizabeth Street, following the route of the highway. In the 1940s the Coronado was affiliated with the United Motor Courts referral chain and advertised in tourist publications. A 1954-55 brochure for Pueblo motels showed the motel with twenty-seven units, slightly larger than the twenty-five room 1951 national average for such reported facilities. In its height, the Coronado regularly drew in overnight travelers as well as offered units for extended stays.<br /> <br /> The Coronado Lodge is also significant for its association with the history of African American travel and tourism during the era of segregation. The motel offered accommodations to African American travelers since at least 1946 and advertised from 1957 to 1967 in <em>The Negro Travelers’ Green Book</em>, publication historian Gretchen Sullivan Sorin described as “the bible of every Negro highway traveler in the 1950s and early 1960s.” Most Colorado Green Book lodging facilities were small “tourist homes” in existing residences. The Coronado in 1957 became the second Colorado motel to be listed in The Green Book under owners Arthur H. and Hattie L. Copley and remained one of only three motels listed in it through 1967. The facility was integrated, welcoming both whites and guests of color prior to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",

            "bodyText": "The Ebony Guest House listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2021, is a historically Black lodging establishment located in the North Florence neighborhood of Florence, South Carolina. Developed in the early twentieth century as an African American neighborhood during segregation, the tourist home was operated by the local Holmes family, who lived in the adjacent property to the north on Wilson Street.The Ebony Guest House is recognized for its role as a Jim Crow era tourist home for African Americans in the area. Established in 1950, and operating until 1972, the Ebony Guest House exemplifies the alternative spaces that African Americans created and maintained for their communities in a society defined by segregation. They adopted the name “Ebony Guest House” so that its Black association would be clear without requiring any additional signage explicitly indicating it served African Americans. <br /> <br /> For Black locals and others who traveled through Florence, Ebony Guest House offered convenient lodging and a safe haven from the humiliations and potential physical danger that accompanied codified and customary racial discrimination. Initially, Ebony Guest House opened its doors only to traveling ministers, who were especially subject to white harassment if they were known to use their pulpit to criticize white supremacy. However, the listing of Ebony Guest House in <em>The Negro Traveler’s Green Book</em> a few years following its opening created a new clientele seeking safe lodging. Ebony Guest House is the only known extant property in Florence to have provided service as an African American tourist home. ",

Cornwell Tourist Home in Columbia, South Carolina, is a surviving example of an alternative space created by an African American family that provided other African American families a place to rest as they passed into town. Each month between 1940 and 1960 several guests arrived at the house, and they were only required to pay what they were able. Besides having a bed to sleep in, guests received one meal a day, which was usually breakfast. Harriet's nephew, Reginald Scott, lived at the house quite often during its time as a tourist home, and he recalls a wide variety of people staying in the home. Frequent guests included musicians and teachers. Reginald Scott remembers the house feeling like a college dorm in the fall with everyone hurrying around getting ready for school. During segregation the Cornwell home looked like every other house on the block. No sign hung out front advertising the house as a tourist home for blacks.<br /> <br /> During the era of segregation, African Americans across the country carefully planned their travel to coordinate overnight accommodations or arranged their travel so the destination would be reached during the daytime. While most large cities were known to have at least one hotel opened to black travelers, other accommodations were frequently used. Accommodations with local families who operated their homes as a “tourist home” was a common practice that many travelers incorporated in their journeys. These alternative spaces offered multiple options for African American travelers looking to minimize the indignities of racism and harassment that came with traveling through unknown cities. The Harriet M. Cornwell home was advertised nationally as a “tourist home” in the prominent <i>Negro Travelers' Green Book and the International Travelers' Green Book</i>. The house’s exterior facades looked like every other house on the block. There were no advertising signs that indicated the house’s use as a tourist home. However, outside of being listed in the Travelers’ Green Book, many of the guests who stayed in the home heard about it through word of mouth.<br /> <br /> <b><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118996580\">Link to the Harriet M. Cornwell Tourist Home File</a></b>",

Founded in 1900, the SPMDTU served the fraternal and social needs of its Hispano membership. SPMDTU arose at a time when ethnic mutual aid societies were springing up across the nation. In the early 20th century, Hispanos often formed mutual aid societies such as the SPMDTU to combat prejudice and exploitation: The primary function of these organizations was to build solidarity within the Mexican and Spanish American communities, to educate their members about the laws and institutions of the United States, to welcome new arrivals to the communities, and to plead cases of injustice before the appropriate authorities. Reacting to discrimination against Hispanos in labor, agriculture, politics, and land and water rights, the preamble to the SPMDTU’s 1911 constitution committed the organization to protect each other against the injustices. Members of the organization viewed one another as hermanos (brothers) and pledged to aid one another in times of need. The SPMDTU’s original charter limited membership to Hispano males between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five. The group played an important social role in the Colorado community.",

The bay was formed by the rapid retreat of the Guyot, Yahtse, and Tyndall Glaciers. The protected, blue waters surrounded by spectacular glacial scenery and an abundance of wildlife are ideal for sea kayaking.</p> <p>Most kayakers access Icy Bay by chartering a small bush plane to drop them off at Kageet Point on the eastern edge of Icy Bay or Pt. Riou, located on Chugach Alaska Native Corporation land southeast of Icy Bay. Before flying into Pt. Riou, visitors should request permission by writing Chugach Alaska Corporation, 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Suite 1200, Anchorage, Alaska 99503.</p> <p>Access to Icy Bay is restricted to small bush planes only, so many parties use collapsible kayaks. There are air taxis in Yakutat who are approved to operate in the park, which you can find by visiting <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/locations/alaska/services-wrangell-st-elias.htm\">kayaking services</a>. These air taxis fly planes that are capable of landing on the bush strip at Kageet Point, which is the most common point of access for Icy Bay kayakers. It's a raised beach strip, and makes for a lovely initial camping spot while you set up your gear. There are many <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/be-bear-aware.htm\">bears</a> throughout the area, but those using Icy Bay before you have been diligent in practicing proper food storage techniques and there have been no adverse human-bear interactions in recent years. Exercise proper caution as you would in bear country throughout Alaska.</p> <p>There are lodges in and around <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/yakutat-and-coast.htm\">Yakutat</a> that offer lodging and Alaska cuisine as well as guided kayaking, hiking, beach combing, wildlife photography, and fly fishing. There are many beach camping opportunities throughout the bay, but there are no officially designated camp sites. We ask that you pick areas that seem suitable to your needs, spread your use away from areas that show signs of use, and practice <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/getinvolved/supportyourpark/leavenotrace.htm\">leave no trace</a> of your camping when you depart. \"Pack it in, pack it out!\"<br /> <br /> <strong>Latitude: </strong>59.9900016784668 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-141.39027404785156</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Icy Bay and Dwarf Fireweed\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/images/Copy_of_Icy_Bay.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Icy Bay and Dwarf Fireweed\" /></figure> <p> </p>",

A National Historic Landmark, the Sierra Bonita Ranch continues to support cattle ranching, and Hooker’s descendants still occupy their ancestor’s adobe house.</p> <p>Arizona became a U.S. possession after the Mexican-American War in 1848, but civilian American immigration to the new territory was slow at first. During the Spanish Colonial and Mexican Republic eras, Arizona’s Spanish and Mexican settlers were unable to suppress the region’s powerful American Indian nations. After the Civil War, the United States ordered soldiers to occupy Arizona and New Mexico in order to colonize the Southwest, where they fought a series of American-Indian Wars that lasted into the 20th century. The military presence in the western territories provided American ranchers and mine prospectors security to settle the region. The American soldiers also created a demand for resources. In the late 19th century, cattle rancher Henry Hooker (1828-1907) capitalized on these violent conflicts and the growing Arizona economy by founding Sierra Bonita Ranch, the first American cattle ranch in Arizona.</p> <p>Colonel Hooker, a descendent of Rev. Thomas Hooker who founded the Connecticut colony, moved west as a young man in the 1840s. After working for the Indian Department in Kansas and at a mine in California, Hooker began trading livestock when he herded 500 turkeys between California and Nevada. In 1867, he received a contract with the United States government that made him the leading beef supplier to the American troops and government administrators in the Arizona territory. As he drove his cattle through the Sulphur Valley that year, the rich land so impressed him that he decided to settle there, and he founded the Sierra Bonita Ranch in 1872. During Hooker’s reign, the Sierra Bonita Ranch peaked at 250,000 acres and held up to 30,000 head of cattle. The ranch became famous for Hooker’s hospitality and his organized ranching techniques. Unlike other ranchers who let their herds run free with little oversight, Hooker fenced-off ranges to control breeding, kept a separate herd of milk cows, and provided medical care for sick or injured cattle. He carefully managed his herds to maximize profit and quality.</p> <p>The historic Sierra Bonita Ranch headquarters is located at the site of an 18th century Spanish estate that Apache Indians destroyed in the early 1800s. Not much is known about this early settlement and it had been long-abandoned when Hooker arrived in Sulphur Valley. The ranch is at an elevation of 4,000 feet and the weather is relatively mild, compared to the extremes in the nearby mountains and the low valleys. Hooker named his ranch “Sierra Bonita” after the beautiful wildflowers that cover the Pinaleño Mountains northeast of the ranch. In the 19th century, Apache Indians used a trail that cut through the valley near the ranch compound to travel between the United States and Mexico, but Hooker worked with the Apache to ensure they rarely troubled his ranch. He designed and built his main ranch house to be a residence for his family as well as a fortress to protect the Hookers and the ranch laborers from local gangs.</p> <p>The National Historic Landmark is 320 acres at Sierra Bonita Ranch that contain the historic ranch buildings, which are the main house, bunkhouse, adobe corrals, and barns. The main house is in the Spanish Colonial style. Made of adobe (straw and clay) bricks, the house is a three-sided U-shaped building that wraps around a central patio enclosed by a wall. A well and root cellar that was in the patio area was later filled and the patio planted with grass. The exterior walls are made of two rows of adobe bricks, 16 feet high and 20 inches thick. Initially, the house had no doors or windows on its exterior walls with access only from the patio, but the Hooker family added exterior openings after the threat of marauders and the Apache subsided. On the opposite side of the patio wall is a courtyard surrounded by a stable, storerooms, and workroom.<br />  </p> <p>Other historic buildings beyond the main house include the original barn, built mostly of wood, decorated with the words “Sierra Bonita Ranch 1872,” which the family added in 1972 in honor of the ranch’s centennial. North of the main house is an adobe bunkhouse with a tin roof and a large adobe corral for storing hay. Other historic corrals at the ranch are made of adobe and wooden planks.</p> <p>Sierra Bonita Ranch was the first permanent American cattle ranch in Arizona and, still operational, is one of the oldest ranches in the United States. Descendents of the Hooker family reside in the historic adobe house, the site of an 18th century Spanish colonial settlement, and operate a 39,000-acre ranch at Bonita for grazing cattle and growing alfalfa. In popular culture, Hooker is perhaps best known for his role in the Wyatt Earp saga. In March 1882, Hooker allowed Wyatt Earp and his posse to rest at the Sierra Bonita ranch house during their escape from the Arizona authorities, and even agreed to speak to the governor on their behalf. Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan stopped at the ranch during his hunt for Earp, but Hooker refused to help him. Notably, Academy Award-winning actor Charlton Heston played the character of Hooker in the movie <em>Tombstone</em>.<br /> <br /> Sierra Bonita Ranch, a National Historic Landmark, is located on W. Ash Creek Rd. in the Sulphur Valley approximately 27 miles north of Willcox, AZ.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The San Bernardino Ranch is the site of two historic cattle ranches in southern Arizona’s San Bernardino Valley, a region that did not see permanent European settlement until the late 19th century. Apache Indian raids throughout the region prevented the Spanish from building a garrison there in the 1770s and forced a Mexican rancher to abandon his land in the 1830s, but in the 1880s, an American rancher and “wild west” sheriff – John H. Slaughter – settled San Bernardino with his family and founded a successful cattle ranch. At their borderlands ranch, the prominent Slaughter family experienced the end of the Apache era, New Mexico statehood in 1912, and the tumultuous Mexican Revolution. The San Bernardino Ranch today is a National Historic Landmark district located about 15 miles east of Douglas, Arizona, near the U.S.-Mexican border.</p> <p> </p> <p>Mexico secularized the Spanish colonial mission districts after it won its independence from Spain in 1821 and granted large tracts of land to men loyal to the new Republic. In the San Bernardino Valley of southern Arizona, the Mexican government sold Lieutenant Ignacio Pérez over 73,000 acres that included valuable, water-rich lands in present-day Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. The son of a prominent Sonora mine owner, Pérez was a soldier and a veteran of the Mexican War for Independence. He started at the San Bernardino Ranch with 4,000 head of cattle, purchased from Mission San José de Tumacácori. Though it was never completed, Pérez’s payment for the cattle was crucial in funding construction of the San José mission church. Pérez raised cattle at San Bernardino for over a decade, until Apache raids on his ranch forced him to abandon the operation in the mid-1830s.<br />  </p> <p>The land was unoccupied for about 50 years, with the ranch land split between the United States and Mexico according to the terms of the treaties that followed the Mexican-American War. A Texan native and Cochise County, Arizona sheriff, John Slaughter purchased a 99-year lease on 65,000 acres of Pérez’s original grant in 1884. Six years later, a U.S. claims court ruled that only 2,300 acres north of the Arizona-Mexico border belonged to Slaughter, but he eventually controlled nearly 100,000 acres of American and Mexican land around his ranch by leasing public land and purchasing private homesteads. In addition to raising, buying, and selling cattle, Slaughter oversaw the cultivation of over 500 acres with fruits and vegetables. The ranch workers included Hispano, Mexican, Indian, and Chinese American tenants and laborers. During its peak years, about 150 people lived and worked at the San Bernardino Ranch.</p> <p>The Mexican Revolution upset the peace at San Bernardino Ranch in the 1910s and ‘20s, and General Pancho Villa, one of the revolutionary leaders, led raids on American and Mexican settlements near the border between 1915 and 1916. During those years, Villa’s northern army entered the San Bernardino Valley and took supplies from the Slaughter ranch on its Mexican side. The American side of the ranch never came under attack; the U.S. cavalry kept a garrison at Douglas, Arizona, and held a small outpost at the San Bernardino Ranch to defend American lands. Abandoned in 1933, the cavalry camp was located on a hilltop across from the House Pond. Though the ranch survived the threat, the revolution nearly reached it when the opposing Mexican sides met in 1915 at the battle of Agua Prieta, Sonora, right across the border from Douglas.<br />  </p> <p>The historic Slaughter ranch compound today is composed of late 19th century buildings, built after the 1887 Sonora Earthquake destroyed earlier infrastructure. Historic buildings at the compound include the family ranch house, ice house, wash house, kitchen, water tank, car shed, corrals, and granary. The ranch house is of adobe, a Spanish-Mexican technique that uses mud brick and plaster, and has wooden floors, stone fireplaces, and stone buttress. Other buildings are of stone. Formed by natural springs dammed by Slaughter for irrigation, the large House Pond creates a green oasis for the ranch house compound in an otherwise arid environment. The site of the ruins of the failed 18th century Spanish garrison is unknown, but Ignacio Pérez likely built his ranch hacienda on the garrison. In the 1820s, the Pérez ranch headquarters took up two acres that included an hacienda with a courtyard and adobe wall. South of the border, the Pérez hacienda today appears as adobe mounds beneath desert sand and brush.</p> <p>Cattle ranching continued for nearly 60 years at San Bernardino after the Slaughters left the property in 1922. After a succession of owners, the ranch house compound became a museum in 1982 when the Johnson Historical Museum of the Southwest purchased the property. The ranch museum, also called the Slaughter Ranch Museum, keeps the adobe ranch house decorated and furnished as it could have been during the Slaughter era. The museum provides visitors with a chance to learn about American ranch life in the southwest inside the ranch house as well as with an outdoor recreational area by the pond, where there are trees for shade, picnic tables, and charcoal grills. Near the historic Slaughter ranch district, over 2,300 acres of the original Mexican land grant are now part of the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, a unit of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, that offers seasonal hunting, hiking, and bird-watching.<br /> <br /> San Bernardino Ranch, a National Historic Landmark, and Johnson Historical Museum of the Southwest are located at 6153 Geronimo Trail in Douglas, AZ. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>As Spanish colonists moved northward from Mexico into present day Arizona claiming more land for New Spain, Jesuits founded a chain of missions along the Sonoran Mountain range. The San Xavier del Bac Mission, a National Historic Landmark, was founded in 1700 by Father Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit explorer who worked to spread Christianity in New Spain. Completed by the Franciscans in 1797, the historic white stucco church stands on the site Father Kino chose. Often called the “white dove of the desert,” the mission is located in the San Xavier Reservation, part of the Tohono O’odham nation, southwest of Tucson in Pima County, Arizona.</p> <p>During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Catholic missions were an integral part of Spanish colonization. Missions, usually run by Jesuit or Franciscan friars, created European settlements that allowed colonization to expand the boundaries of Spanish culture and influence. The missions intended to Christianize and Hispanicize Native Americans. At San Xavier del Bac, Jesuits first introduced the Tohono O'odham, a Piman-speaking group, to domesticated horses and cattle. The Spanish also brought European crops, like wheat. Missionaries transformed the lives of semi-nomadic Native Americans with animal husbandry and permanent, rather than seasonal, settlement. The settlement of San Xavier del Bac near the Santa Cruz River was a Tohono O'odham town called Wa:k, a Piman word for water. The mission’s name reflects the mixing of Spanish Catholic and O'odham desert cultures.</p> <p>The mission’s founder, Father Eusebio Kino, was a leader of the mission system in New Spain. Born in Italy and educated in Germany, Father Kino was an explorer and a cartographer as well as a Jesuit missionary. He entered the Jesuit order at Freiburg, Germany, and soon chose a missionary life. He arrived in Mexico in 1681 and worked to spread Catholicism, by way of Spanish colonization, throughout the region. Prior to his death in 1711, Father Kino hoped to take up residency at San Xavier del Bac Mission. At that time, he was the resident priest at Mission Dolores in Magdalena, Sonora. He was still waiting for his replacement to arrive when he passed away. For his work in bringing European culture to southern Arizona, his statue sits in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. Pilgrims still travel each year to Mission Dolores in Sonora, Mexico to celebrate the feast of Father Kino’s patron saint, St. Francis Xavier, and to honor Kino’s contributions to O’odham life and culture.</p> <p>The mission church that still stands at San Xavier del Bac was completed around the time that the Spanish Empire in North America waned. Construction began in 1783 under the residency of Father Juan Bautista Velderrain, a Franciscan. A loan of 7,000 pesos provided the funds to build the mission. In 1821, Mexico became a Republic after 11 years of revolution, and the new government demanded allegiance from the Franciscan priests. In 1828, San Xavier del Bac’s resident priest, Father Rafael Diaz, refused to align himself with what he believed was an anticlerical regime and left his church. Father Diaz was the last priest to reside at San Xavier del Bac for 36 years.</p> <p>The middle decades of the 19th century were an unstable period for San Xavier del Bac. In 1853, the Gadsden Purchase land treaty between the United States and New Mexico made the mission a U.S. possession. In 1859, the Catholic Church placed the church under the jurisdiction of the Santa Fe diocese. The diocese, under Bishop Lamy, repaired the church’s exposed adobe brick, and in 1864, Jesuit Father Carolus Evasius Messea resided there for eight months. During Father Messea’s time at San Xavier del Bac, he founded the first public school in Arizona, but the local Pima community lacked interest in the church and limited funding forced the parish to close. In 1874, the U.S. government established the San Xavier Reservation.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Bishop Henry Granjon ordered renovations and new construction on the church and oversaw repairs to the church façade and mortuary wall, which were damaged by an earthquake in 1887. Granjon had the entire church replastered and repainted. He also built a wall along the front of the convent and placed an arch at its east end. Grotto Hill, three hundred feet east of the church, is a small hillock topped by a white cross. On the north side of the hill is a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes. Bishop Granjon oversaw the construction of this shrine to the Virgin Mary in 1908.</p> <p>The church received its first priest since Father Messea in 1913, a Franciscan and native of Tucson named Father Ferdinand Oritz. Since the arrival of Father Oritz, California Franciscans have run the church and served the San Xavier Reservation. In 1947, they founded a school for local Pima children. In 1949, they installed new floors within the church, repaired the roof and walls, and improved living conditions within the convent.</p> <p>Unlike many other historic Spanish missions from the era, the architecture of the current church at San Xavier del Bac Mission is entirely European. It has no Piman influence on its Baroque style, a mix of Byzantine and Moorish architecture, aside from the desert materials and aspects of the interior imagery. The main building is in the shape of a Latin cross. Two octagonal towers topped with belfries stand at the front of the building. One large dome covers the transept crossing, and smaller domes flank it to the north and south. The mission property includes the main church, mortuary chapel, dormitory, patio, garden, and convent.</p> <p>Built by O’odham laborers, the main building is composed of adobe bricks set in lime mortar. The exterior walls are painted white stucco. The interior is decorated with intricately painted and carved religious imagery, which covers the walls and vaulted ceilings. Wooden statues of Saint Xavier and the Virgin are set into a molded background behind the altar, and throughout the church there are carved wooden statues of Native Americans and other saints. Frescoes depicting the lives of Catholic saints decorate the choir loft and main chamber.</p> <p>The beautiful Spanish colonial church at San Xavier del Bac endures. The Secretary of the Interior designated the mission a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The church continues to serve the residents of the San Xavier Reservation. The church is open to visitors daily, except during special services, and the public is welcome to join the San Xavier community for regular masses.<br /> <br /> San Xavier del Bac Mission, a National Historic Landmark, is located at 1950 W. San Xavier Rd., Tucson, AZ. </p>",

Due to segregation in public accommodations, the Manse Hotel and Annex became a destination for African Americans visiting Cincinnati. The Manse Hotel and Annex was a central space for Cincinnati's Black community. The hotel was a popular spot for local African Americans to celebrate weddings and other special events for African American clubs, fraternities, and sororities.<br /> <br /> The Manse is also notable for its role in African American civil rights history. The hotel provided a place for national African American groups such as the NAACP, the National Dental Association, the National Bowling Association, the Housewives League, and the National Negro Business League, to gather, celebrate victories, and strategize next steps. The period of significance is from 1931 to 1961. In conjunction with less segregation in Cincinnati, 1961 marks the beginning of the Manse’s decline. The legacy of the Manse Hotel and Annex represents owner Horace Sudduth’s philosophy and methods of overcoming discrimination in Cincinnati. Sudduth established the Manse as an integrated facility to serve not only as a hotel for celebrities and dignitaries but as a gathering spot for leading figures in business and civil rights activism. The Manse Hotel and Annex allowed ordinary African Americans to experience a lifestyle usually reserved for whites through its society functions and events. The Manse Hotel is a testament to its founder’s creativity and business prowess in overcoming prejudice through black enterprise.",

            "bodyText": "As the Spanish Empire sought to gain control of New Mexico, we can see different agendas at work. The Spanish governors sought wealth, but the Franciscan missionaries sought converts. Between 1617 and 1621, the Franciscan missionary Padre Ortiz oversaw the construction of the first church, located too far from the pueblo to make it successful. By 1625, the Franciscans were allowed to build a new Mission Church just six-hundred feet south of the pueblo. The attached Convento acted as storage, work rooms, and living areas for the missionaries and any Pueblo converts. Construction of the Mission Church and the Convento were supervised by the Franciscans, but Pecos people provided the labor; the Pecos received no pay for their work, raising questions today about the nature of slavery in the Southwest.<br /> <br /> An illegal slave trade promoted by officials of the Spanish Crown, exploitation of Pueblo laborers, poor treatment of Pecos religious leaders and interference in the traditional religion, along with the forced tributes of food and goods led the Pecos people to join nearly thirty other pueblos in a successful revolt against the Spanish Empire in 1680. During the revolt, the Church and the Convento were burned, and the adobe walls were reduced to mounds. The Spanish left New Mexico until DeVargas returned to re-establish the colony in 1693.<br /> <br /> The church that stands today was completed in 1717. This church was built on the rubble of the 1625 church destroyed in the Pueblo of Revolt, and is noticeably smaller. Though the Franciscans did convert many to Christianity, they did not stop traditional religious practices. The religious customs and traditions live on today at Jemez Pueblo and at other extant Pueblos throughout the Rio Grande Valley. At certain times of the year these Pueblos host Feast Days that demonstrate the cultural blending unique to the region. They often include Mass and traditional Pueblo religious dances.",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, The Rossonian Hotel was one of the most important jazz clubs between St. Louis and Los Angeles from the late 1930’s to the early 1960’s. Jazz greats such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, George Shearing, and Dinah Washington stayed at the Rossonian Hotel and entertained at the Rossonian Lounge between major engagements in Denver or enroute to other cities. These major African American entertainers were denied lodging in most Denver hotels due to the racial segregation practices of the period. The Rossonian Hotel welcomed the entertainers who not only stayed in the hotel but performed in the main floor Rossonian Lounge. These shows were often staged after the performers finished their scheduled commitments at the same Denver hotels who were unwilling to offer them lodging. The Rossonian did not discriminate and welcomed a mixed clientele of music lovers who enjoyed popular jazz by black and white musicians in the same venue.<br /> <br /> In addition to housing nationally recognized performers, the Rossonian building and site at the intersection of Welton, Washington, and 27th, was locally a physical, social, and commercial center of the Five Points community, the primary Black community of Denver since the 1920’s. Denver’s Five Points neighborhood is one of city’s oldest African American neighborhoods as the 1920’s saw a transition to a Black majority in the Five Points area which has continued to the present.<br /> <br /> Between 1930-1950, a separate Black culture in Five Points coalesced, developing a strong sense of community and cultural identity, a largely self-contained community with services and commercial establishments catering to African Americans as well as other ethnic groups in the area. This culture centered along the neighborhood’s \"Mainstreet\" between 22nd and 29th Streets. As the jazz phenomenon of the late 1930’s spread in popularity across the county, the loose and rhythmic music was alive and bopping in Five Points-and the Rossonian was the place for jazz in Denver.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/84129887\">Link to Rossonian Hotel File</a>",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2020, the Mission Cultural Center (later Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts) is a large and diverse neighborhood in the east-central portion of San Francisco. The building was constructed in 1947 as a furniture store and converted into the Mission Cultural Center (MCC) in 1977. The property was first identified as a significant Latino institution by California’s 1988 statewide survey published as, Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California. The publication identified the Centro Cultural de la Misión (Mission Cultural Center) as one of the ninety-nine most significant properties associated with Mexican American history in California.<br /> <br /> The Mission Cultural Center’s origins reflect a confluence of influences associated with Latino/Chicano culture in San Francisco. Its creation is intrinsically tied to the ascendancy of the Mission District as the city’s most concentrated Latino enclave during a vital period of political, social, and artistic foment. The Mission Cultural Center focuses on supporting and promoting the full spectrum of Latino arts, including visual and graphic arts, music, theater, dance, writing, poetry, and cultural festivals. The building’s exterior highlights the artistic spectrum through a mural titled, “Spirits of the Arts.” The mural is the building’s most significant exterior character defining feature. Painted in 1982 by Carlos Loarca, Manuel Villamor, and Betsie Miller-Kusz, the mural covers the entire upper Mission Street façade and partially wraps the secondary façade. It features Central American motifs blended with allegorical images of activities that are typical within the MCC, such as dancing and playing drums. The dancers also include skeletons in homage to Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). As described by the San Francisco Arts Commission, the mural was inspired by Incan, Mayan, and Aztec symbolism and was intended to celebrate the many arts presented within the Center. Since its founding, Mission Cultural Center has exhibited and supported thousands of artists worldwide and has gained national recognition for its graphics department as being among the most significant Latino portfolios in the country.",

On October 28, 1967, the two countries transferred land as stipulated in the 1963 Chamizal Treaty, dividing Cordova Island and shifting the boundary to the new channel of the Rio Grande. The boundary markers and fence around the former “island” became obsolete since all Mexican land north of the river channel passed to the United States.</p> <h2>Interpretive Panel Text</h2> <p>The \"Defining A Border\" wayside panel presents text in both English and Spanish.</p> <blockquote> <p>If you were standing here prior to the Chamizal Treaty of 1963, you would have been on a Mexican ‘island’ looking into the United States. Referred to as Cordova Island because it was completely surrounded by the United States, this parcel of land was given to the U.S. by Mexico in exchange for land to the west. Cordova Island’s original international boundary was defined using evenly spaced cement fence posts and cast iron markers such as the one before you. This 600-pound marker was one of nineteen that identified the US-Mexico border around Cordova Island.</p> </blockquote> <h3>Primary Photo Caption</h3> <p>The main panel image shows a wire fence running along a row of obelisk-shaped posts. To one side of the fence is a paved street. The other side is covered with trees and shrubs. The image is captioned, “Taken on Paisano Drive in the 1940’s this photo shows Cordova Island and the fence posts that once surrounded it.”</p> <h3>Inset Photo Caption</h3> <p>The interpretive panel has an inset photo of two men shaking hands in front of a shiny obelisk and group of people. It is captioned, “U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Mexican President Gustavo Diaz unveil a commemorative boundary marker at Chamizal in October 1967.”</p>",

There is a line of cement obelisks, which are historic fence posts, running along the outer edge of this section of the trail and a drainage ditch and city street beyond it. There is an international boundary marker and interpretive panel between the fence line and the trail, with a bench on the opposite side of the trail.",

Often the ridge tops and south-facing hillsides are clear of snow, a result of wind and sun.</p> <h2>Managing Elk Populations</h2> <p>Until the mid-1960s, park managers actively managed the elk and bison of Yellowstone. Elk population limits were determined according to formulas designed to manage livestock. When elk reached those limits, park managers “culled” or killed the animals to reduce the population. Bison were likewise heavily managed.</p> <h2>Modern Management</h2> <p>In 1963, an advisory group made of prominent scientists released a report recommending national parks “maintain biotic associations” within the context of their ecosystem based on scientific research. The recommendations, known as the Leopold Report, established the framework for park management still used today throughout the National Park System. By adopting this management philosophy, Yellowstone went from an unnatural managing of resources to “natural regulation”—today known as Ecological Process Management.</p>",

The university was established shortly after the University of South Carolina barred African American students from attending the school. Allen University was created to help fill the need for black education in South Carolina. Allen University was founded in 1881 and established by the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Named after Richard Allen, Allen University grew out of Payne Institute, established at Cokesbury in 1871 by the Abbeville District of the African Methodist Church. In 1880 the Columbia and South Carolina Annual Conferences of the church merged Payne into Allen University, which was opened in Columbia the following year. Founded primarily to provide an educated clergy for the A.M.E. Church, Allen University also offered law and vocational degrees. Beginning with sixty students and a faculty of six, the school graduated in its first nine years seventy-five students. Allen University was among the few southern colleges for black students that had a law department, which lasted until the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> <b><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/118998330\">Link to Allen University File</a></b>",

The Hotel was constructed as a necessary reaction to the advent of the medical practice of the Doctors Mayo and the growth of the city of Rochester as a national and international medical center. In conjunction, local hotels and guest house business expanded to serve vast numbers of transient Mayo Clinic patients in the area. The Avalon Hotel became the only hotel available in Rochester for Black patients at the clinic, a function it performed for several decades until the end of color barriers. It also served as the only hotel available for other prominent Black visitors including among its clientele Duke Ellington and his band, the Ink Spots, and boxer Henry Armstrong. In a variety of ways, the Avalon Hotel represents the ethnic, social, and geographical diversity of people brought to Rochester by the presence of the Mayo Clinic, as well as representing the nature of the social interaction between this population and an otherwise typical Midwestern farming community. Today the Avalon, renamed Broadway Square, continues as a rental facility, offering apartments to all visitors, and is undergoing interior remodeling to provide modern commercial sales space.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/93202421\">Link to Avalon Hotel file</a>",

During and after the Second World War many African Americans who moved to Las Vegas faced racial segregation as a matter of law and social practice. Boarding houses became one of the few options available for African Americans who were new arrivals to a community or were traveling through the region. In Las Vegas, a section of the town referred to as Westside developed as a distinctly African American neighborhood during the 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>Boarding houses like Harrison’s arose from a nation-wide need to house traveling African Americans in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In cities across the country, segregation in public accommodations required the creation of separate facilities and social networks to inform travelers of those facilities. Despite the need, accommodations were notoriously limited throughout the country into the 1950s, especially in the West, and continued to be limited until the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. In many communities, boarding houses provided the only overnight accommodations available to African Americans traveling between cities in the West. Throughout the western United States, boarding houses such as the Harrison’s Guest House that addressed this need were often in low-income areas that suffered from neglect. Redevelopment has changed many of these neighborhoods and many former boarding houses have been demolished. Harrison’s Guest House stands as the only known example of its type remaining in Las Vegas, and potentially the only remaining guest house in Nevada.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=812bd181-5df8-4d0f-88b1-0c555be55a6c\">Link to file on Harrison's Guest House</a></p>",

In 1940, long after Harlem had become a predominantly African American community, the Hotel Theresa dropped its discrimination policies, went under new management, installed an African American manager and catered almost exclusively to a black clientele. As a result, the Theresa went on to become the most famous African American hotel in the nation. At its height, the Theresa was known as the “Waldorf of Harlem,” playing host to many of America’s most prominent black social, political, entertainment, and sports figures, as well as to many foreign dignitaries. In addition to its historical importance, the hotel is a major work of the noted architectural firm of George & Edward Blum. The building’s architecture exemplifies the firm’s singular approach to ornamentation and inventive use of terra cotta.<br /> <br /> The Theresa was also home to important Harlem institutions, including the March Community Bookstore and Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity. The Theresa entered the national limelight in 1960 when Cuban premier Fidel Castro chose to stay at the hotel while visiting New York to speak at the United Nations General Assembly. Since the Theresa was the largest hotel in Harlem and one of the few hotels in New York City that welcomed black guests, it became a major social center for New York’s black community and a mecca for America’s black elite.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/75319604\">Link to Hotel Theresa File</a>",

While the date of construction for the home is unknown, it is estimated to have been built around the turn of the 20th century. The tourist home was run by Eugene Latimore and his wife Cora Wilson Latimore. The Latimore house catered to people looking for a place to stay short-term rather than long-term, specifically, to railroad workers in the area and travelers who were passing through. It was the only overnight accommodations in Russellville that catered to African Americans, and the only one that was listed in the 1949 Green Book. The house stayed in business until the 1970s, even after the Civil Rights Act was passed and legal segregation was abolished. Today, the Latimore Tourist Home is vacant, but it is still a vivid reminder of the era of segregation that affected Arkansas travelers in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. From Arkansas's largest cities to its smallest towns, facilities specifically for African American travelers were the norm, and the Latimore Tourist Home is an outstanding example of the types of accommodations that were prevalent in the Green Books. There are plans to move the building from this location to nearby James Park.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/26140253\">Link to Latimore Tourist Home File</a>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Leevy’s Funeral Home built in 1951, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2020 for its significance in African American history and the system of segregation in Columbia, South Carolina. The funeral home was part of a community effort by the city’s Black citizens, to create alternative spaces to gather and provide one another with essential services, including funerary services. The building’s significance expands beyond funeral services as it was also a site for politics as it assisted in African American voter registration and education. The funeral home was owned and operated by Isaac Samuel Leevy, a prominent local political activist and community leader. The funeral home was Leevy’s home, place of business, and the center of his political actions. Leevy was heavily involved in South Carolina politics as a registered Republican who advocated for the two-party system and voter registration.<br /> <br /> I.S. Leevy first acquired the Taylor Street sitein 1928. Initially, Leevy opened a gas station on the property since, according to him, “nowhere in Columbia…were Negroes engaged in the filling station business.” In 1951, Leevy had the service station property razed and constructed this purpose-built funeral home. One illustration of Leevy’s Funeral Home’s broader importance for African Americans was its listing in The <em>Negro Motorist’s Green Book</em>. Traveling through or to unfamiliar towns or areas was often a fraught endeavor for African Americans who lacked local knowledge of what businesses were safe for them to patronize. Despite the demolition of Leevy’s gas station by 1951, this location was listed in <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em> each year from 1950 through 1955 under the guide’s “service station” category. Even though the property at that point was used exclusively as a funeral home, its continued listing in the Green Book suggests that I.S. Leevy was still considered a valuable local resource for Black travelers, and that the funeral home likely remained a place where African American out-of-towners could stop for general assistance or guidance.</p> <p>On a local level, the home played a vital role as an important alternative public space for Black Columbians during Jim Crow and as a center for grassroots political organizing among local African Americans. As segregation took hold in Columbia in the decades after Reconstruction, African Americans were either excluded from local white-owned businesses or relegated to designated “Colored” spaces. They subsequently took it upon themselves to create their own businesses and community institutions where they could provide one another with services they were otherwise denied. Funeral homes were arguably among the most important services local residents offered one another, given the particular sensitivity of caring for the deceased, as well as funerary practices’ close relationship with religious belief. As perhaps the most widely known Black-owned funeral home in midcentury Columbia, Leevy’s provides an important physical connection with African Americans’ determination to prosper and care for one another despite the city’s prevailing Jim Crow order.</p> <p caretat=\"true\">Black-owned funeral homes like Leevy’s that emerged in the early twentieth century did so out of both necessity and a desire for the African American dead to be afforded the same respect as whites. Around the turn of the twentieth century, few American communities had a Black-owned funeral home. African Americans who sought out mortuary services therefore had to seek the services of white undertakers. Some simply refused to serve African Americans altogether, while black funeral homes offered African Americans the full range of services associated with caring for the dead, including embalming, burial, and, in some cases, even casket manufacturing. Leevy’s itself was ultimately among the few Black funeral homes that placed emphasis on the local community and the respectful services they deserved.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, the Limerick-Frazier House in Austin, Texas, is a modified l-plan house with a century-long connection to African American history. The house was built in 1876 by Anglo immigrant stonemason Joseph Limerick and purchased in 1905 by African American Professor John W. Frazier. Professor Frazier was a successful educator. In 1886 Frazier secured a teaching position at Victoria, Texas where he taught for fourteen years before he was appointed to teach mathematics at the new campus of Samuel Huston College, now Huston-Tillotson College, in Austin in 1900. While at Samuel Huston College, Frazier worked closely with the school’s President to develop the college and served the institution for twenty-eight years.<br /> <br /> Throughout his career in education Professor Frazier, like many African Americans during this era, were faced with legal and systematic segregation of most public spaces and resources. Schools, restaurants, hotels, were some of the segregated spaces that many African American people were excluded from or offered limited services. Throughout the early half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century a large demographic shift forced many African American Texans to move into East Austin neighborhoods. As the production of automobiles became more accessible to African American families, traveling further distances became an exciting but equally challenging experience. During the 1930s and to the early 1960s, Professor Frazier and his wife Mrs. Laura Allman Frazier operated their home as lodging for African American students and travelers who were excluded from white-owned hotels in Austin during the Jim Crow era. The Frazier House was listed in travel guides as lodgings for \"Negroes\" in both the <i>Chauffeur's Travelers Bureau Official Information of Places for Recreation and Accommodation for Negroes</i> book, as well as the <i>Negro Motorist Green Book</i> under the name of Mrs. J.W. Frazier. The Limerick-Frazier House is a rare surviving example of the lodging accommodations in Texas for many African American travelers through the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/40970350\">Link to Limerick-Frazier House file.</a>",

As a location of contestation, the property is also associated with the broader American Civil Rights narrative--in this case a demanding of access to, and proper enjoyment of, public trust resources. Sometimes derogatorily referred to as “the Inkwell,” noting the skin color of its patrons, the beach was self-selected by the local African American community as a place of recreation and leisure where its visitors felt relatively safe from harassment. In the Jim Crow era, California’s lax enforcement or overlooked civil rights laws dating back to the 1890s and Los Angeles’ de facto white supremacist policies manifested as restricted housing, employment, and often access to public lands or facilities. The area became a recognized extension of Santa Monica's African American community life and a leisure destination for the region’s larger Black population. The period of significance for this historic district begins in 1908 when the Phillips Chapel Colored Methodist Episcopal (later Christian Methodist Episcopal, CME) Church building was purchased from the Santa Monica School Board and relocated to the corner of Fourth and Bay Streets, creating an anchor for local African American spiritual and community life. The period of significance ends in 1965 with passage of the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA). The VRA, together with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, removed federal and state discrimination barriers in public places, housing, employment, and voting, ending most Jim Crow policy as an era of de jure discrimination and segregation. Today the beach is enjoyed by all local and traveling visitors as a natural ground for relaxation and recreation.",

            "bodyText": "Businessman John Roesink had long been interested in sports when he funded the construction of Mack Park (the precusrsor to Hamtramck Stadium) on the eastside of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/traveldetroit/index.htm\">Detroit</a> in 1910. Originally from Grand Rapids, Michigan, Roesink moved to Detroit around 1900. In addition to owning several stores in the downtown area, he also owned sports teams. A number of shop owners participated in the practice of owning or funding athletic teams as a way to advertise their businesses. Roesink funded the construction of a park, built of timber and tin-sheeting, to house his teams. Located at the corner of Mack and Fairview Avenues, the park seated approximately 6,000-10,000 spectators.1  <br /> <br /> As the auto-industry expanded in the early 1900s, Detroit became an ideal place to   <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/series.htm?id=556D954F-EAF6-1374-7AB6C80FAA4B3854\">find work</a>, especially for Black Americans seeking opportunities outside the South. Census data helps historians study this movement of African Americans from South to North in the early 1900s, a trend referred to as the Great Migration. According to census data, Detroit was home to approximately 5,741 African Americans in 1910. By 1920, over 41,000 Black Americans lived in the city. Detroit’s Black community grew by 614% in ten years. Baseball became an important part of the Black culture of Detroit, especially after the establishment of the Detroit Stars in 1919.2 The team was part of the Negro National League, the first Black baseball league in America.<br /> <br /> While Mack Park was located over four miles from the Black Bottom Neighborhood, where many of the city’s Black residents lived, the park become a hub of the African American community.3 Oral accounts speak to the excitement that fans felt when visiting the park. John Glover and his family were one of the many that left the South as part of the Great Migration. Moving from Alabama to Detroit in 1919, Glover spent his childhood at the ballpark. He recalls the exciting trips to Mack Park:   <br /> <br /> <i>“At the time, Mack Park was way out of town…We used to take the Mack </i><i>streetcar down, and if you were the least athletically inclined you could hop off the car before the conductor came through and collected fares. I don’t know how many the park officially held…But it was always filled when I was there. You even had a few whites in the crowd.”4 </i><br /> <br /> On July 7, 1929, the Detroit Starts were scheduled to play the Kansas City Monarchs at Mack Park in a doubleheader. Heavy rains soaked the field, postponing the games. Fearing a loss of profit, Roesink doused the base paths in gasoline to dry it out. (Setting the dirt on fire to dry up soggy ground was not unusual in baseball at the time.) But the fire raged out of control. The blaze engulfed the wooden bleachers, injuring hundreds of fans.5  <br /> <br /> To make up for the loss, Roesink built Hamtramck Stadium (also known as Roesink Stadium) several miles northwest of Mack Park’s original location. Completed in 1930, the new park is located in Hamtramck, a small city surrounded by Detroit. Hamtramck, originally founded in 1798, was incorporated as a village in the early 1900s. At the time, Hamtramck was a predominately Polish community.6 Author and Detroit native Richard Bak speculates that Roesink built the stadium in Hamtramck to attract both Black and white patrons.7 Even after the new stadium’s construction, Mack Park continued to operate as an informal sandlot.<br /> <br /> Hamtramck Stadium became the new home of the Detroit Stars and eventually the Detroit Wolves. The park saw some of Detroit’s finest players, including Norman “Turkey” Stearnes, one of the leagues best pitchers. He played for the Stars from 1923 to 1931.  <br /> <br /> While fans remained loyal to their team, patronage dropped in the early 1930s due to the Great Depression. Black baseball faced added challenges with the death of Negro National League founder Rube Foster in 1930. The league fell apart shortly after his death, and the Detroit Stars disbanded in 1931. They were replaced by the Detroit Wolves, a Negro baseball league that only played for the 1932 season.  <br /> <br /> Hamtramck was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. A State of Michigan Historic Marker was dedicated at the site in 2014.  <br /> <br /> In 2020, the Friends of Historic Hamtramck Stadium, a nonprofit group, restored the infield and successfully petitioned City Council to name the field Norman “Turkey” Stearnes Field at Historic Hamtramck Stadium.8  <br /> <br /> Want to learn more about baseball? Explore some of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/teachingwithhistoricplaces/index.htm\">Teaching with Historic Places</a> resources, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/series.htm?id=FC037BBF-BA0B-A0F0-F511E9A1B4D706AE\">Black Baseball Curiosity Kit</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/teachingwithhistoricplaces/lesson-plan-162_robinson-ballpark.htm\">Jackie Robinson lesson plan</a>.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <sup>1 Richard Bak, <i></i><i>Turkey </i><i>Stearnes</i><i> and the Detroit Stars: The Negro Leagues in Detroit, 1919-1933</i>, (Wayne State University Press, 1995), 57; Larry Lester, Sammy L.

She and her husband, Stephen Symonds Foster, lived on the farm from 1847 until 1881.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{495cd8d9-f247-46ad-980a-c6f658159c5e}{189}\" paraid=\"797398924\">Born in Pelham, Massachusetts in 1811, Abby Kelley’s Quaker upbringing influenced her outlook on life. In addition to opposing slavery, many Quakers believed in equal educational opportunities for men and women. Kelley received an advanced education, including instruction in spelling, grammar, botany, and astronomy.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{495cd8d9-f247-46ad-980a-c6f658159c5e}{207}\" paraid=\"730182029\">In 1838, Kelley made her first public speech at an anti-slavery convention in Philadelphia. At the time, it was unusual for a woman to speak in public, let alone address a crowd of male onlookers. Her speeches were so effective that she become a highly sought-out lecturer.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{495cd8d9-f247-46ad-980a-c6f658159c5e}{217}\" paraid=\"389037187\">Kelley married fellow abolitionist Stephen Symonds Foster in 1845. Several years later, the couple jointly purchased Liberty Farm in Massachusetts. The Kelley Foster family aided freedom seekers traveling the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/index.htm\">Underground </a>Railroad. They used their home to hide those fleeing bondage. Liberty Farm also served as a meeting place where Kelley Foster hosted other abolitionists.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{495cd8d9-f247-46ad-980a-c6f658159c5e}{250}\" paraid=\"1490830140\">Abby Kelley Foster was often ill in her later years and did not travel or lecture. She did, however, continue to advocate for women’s rights. As Kelley did not have the legal right to vote on how her tax money was spent, she refused to pay property taxes from 1874 to 1879 as a form of protest. As a result, her house and cows were seized by the state and auctioned off several times. To show their support, Kelley’s friends purchased Liberty Farm and gifted it back to her.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{5c391248-de56-4872-9344-4e0c58a430d1}{9}\" paraid=\"317492296\">Abby Kelley Foster lived at Liberty Farm until her death in 1887.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <sub>Bibliography:<br /> Sterling, Dorothy.

            "bodyText": "<p>While Detroit, MI is known as the “Motor City,” not every influential Detroit business has revolved around the automobile industry. Before the first car rolled out of a local factory, the Parke-Davis and Company Pharmaceutical Plant was home to one of the most important pharmaceutical firms in America. Parke-Davis introduced new methods for producing drugs, such as a technique for standardizing doses, and discovered medicines that included the first treatments for diphtheria and epilepsy. Diphtheria is caused by a bacterial infection and results in a sore throat, fever, and blockage of the airway due to inflammation of the lymph nodes. Epilepsy, a neurological disorder, causes seizures and other medical issues. These diseases were even more serious before the development of vaccines in the late nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Operating a small drug store in Detroit in 1860, doctor and pharmacist Samuel P. Duffield partnered with Hervey Coke Parke and George S. Davis to expand his business. Duffield retired shortly after, but Parke and Davis went on to establish a company that became one of the world’s largest sellers of Pharmaceuticals. In the 1870s, Parke and Davis established their business on Joseph Campau Street along the banks of Detroit River to take advantage of convenient transportation provided by water rail.<br /> <br /> Parke-Davis flourished at the turn of the century. Between 1891 and 1955 the company built 26 buildings in Detroit that still stand, including the 1902 pharmaceutical research laboratory. This was the first structure designed for that purpose in the United States.<br /> <br /> Parke-Davis also hired a number of talented doctors and chemists. Organizing excursions to Central and South America in search of medicinal plants, the company needed a talented team of workers to innovate new medicines and remedies. Dr. Andrew Lyons, for example, consulted with Parke-Davis in the 1880s and brought his skills in chemistry and botany. Born to missionaries in Hawai‘i, Lyons was fascinated by the medicinal power of plants. In the 1950s, notable scientist Dr. Jonas Salk worked at Parke-Davis. He is famous for developing one of the first successful polio vaccines. Due to their efforts, these workers helped make Parke-Davis a successful and innovative pharmaceutical company.<br /> <br /> In 1982 Parke-Davis sold its property to a real estate developer. Today the complex, now known as River Place, has been converted into offices, retail space, residences, and a hotel.<br /> <br /> The Parke-Davis Research Laboratory and Company Plant is located at Joseph Campau St. along the banks of the Detroit River. The laboratory is a National Historic Landmark<br /> <br /> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-79a3c986-7fff-5312-24e4-2266e7ce27e6\">Discover more history and culture by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/traveldetroit/index.htm\">Detroit travel itinerary</a>. </b><br /> <br /> <sub>Sources:<br /> Leake, Paul.

            "bodyText": "<h3>Make Do or Do Without</h3> <p><br /> The upstream section of the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve is a different landscape from the more iconic lower gorge. This is the transition zone of the New from a broad river bordered by wide, flat bottomlands, to a narrow mountain river roaring through its deep, boulder strewn gorge. This section offered early peoples more than a transportation corridor and exposed coal seams; these flat river bottoms provided rich farmlands.<br /> <br /> American Indian archeological sites are common throughout this area, but it is the heritage of European and African settlers, specifically the Richmond family which lends the name to these lands. This side of the river has traditionally been known as “Richmond’s Bottom” and many direct descendants still live on these lands.<br /> <br /> This site offers a glimpse into the traditional lifestyle of early settlers in the New River Gorge area before the coming of the railroad, a life of self-sufficiency.<br /> Subsistence farming, “living of the land,” was a full-time job. The basic needs of food, shelter, and water were not bought; they were produced by all members of the family and guided all aspects of daily life. Chopping wood, carrying water, tending the crops and farm animals, preserving and curing food, spinning, weaving, and sewing raw flax and wool into clothing were everyday activities. Hunting wild game and gathering seasonal wild plants for food and medicinal use was a way of life. Bartering with neighbors and a few area merchants for items you could not produce on your own was a common practice. Trading a hog, eggs, or apples for coffee, lead shot, and gunpowder; or giving a share of your corn crop to the grist mill operator in exchange for ground corn meal was also a vital part of the lifestyle.<br /> <br /> The basic layout for a subsistence farmstead included the house, usually an original log cabin modified over the years with attached additions and a painted clap-board exterior, numerous outbuildings, barns, sheds, springhouse, and outhouse. Surrounding the farm, the forest was cleared and planted with corn fields, garden plots, and often apple orchards.<br /> <br /> Barns and other outbuildings provided shelter to the many domestic animals vital to the subsistence lifestyle. A horse or mule was needed to pull the plow and wagons, cows and chickens supplied milk, butter, cheese, and eggs, and beehives provided honey. Hogs, which were allowed to roam semi-wild through the forests, provided a basic source for meat, and the wool from sheep was sheared, spun, and woven for clothing.<br /> The Richmond-Hamilton house and farmstead you see today is one of several examples in the park of the final evolution and remains of the old subsistence lifestyle. The original Revolutionary War veteran land grant in this area of the New River was granted in 1796, to William Richmond, on a tract of land near the present-day Sandstone Falls (originally called Richmond’s falls).<br /> <br /> Through generations the original lands were broken up and divided amongst married children and their descendants. The last residents of this site were a railroad worker and his family who operated the farm part time to provide a secondary income.<br /> <br /> The River Road section of the park still consists of many privately owned properties which have evolved from the subsistence farmlands of the original European and African settlers from the early 1800’s. The Richmond Hamilton historic site is located two miles down the ten-mile long River Road, accessible off of Route 20 at Hinton, that dead ends at the Sandstone Falls boardwalk and day use area.<br /> <br /> River Road and Sandstone Falls covers the upper ten miles of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve and is the longest scenic riverside drive in the park. There are several public picnic, fishing, and river access areas along the way, including the Brooks Falls day use area and Big Branch trailhead. Sandstone Falls marks the dramatic transition for the New Rivers final fifty-mile rush through the New River Gorge to its confluence with the Gauley to form the Kanawha River.</p> <h3><strong> Visiting Richmond Hamilton Farm</strong></h3> <p>To get to Richmond Hamilton Farm, exit I-64 at exit 139. Take Route 20 south towards Hinton. Follow Route 20 for 10 miles south to Hinton. After reaching a traffic light, turn right on Route 20 and cross the New River. At the other side of the river turn right onto River Road. Richmond Hamilton Farm is located about two miles down River Road on your left. Watch for a break in a stone wall. There is a parking lot and vault toilet at the entrance. You can walk from there to visit two barns, an outbuilding, and the farmhouse.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2020, Ruth's Beauty Parlor in Columbia, South Carolina is significant for its association with Black beauty culture and entrepreneurship. From the late-1930s to 1943, the home was used by Ruth Collins Perry as a beauty parlor that served Waverly’s African American residents and Columbia’s broader Black community. The period of significance is based on the home’s listing in <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em> from 1939 to 1943. In 1989, the home was listed as a contributing property in the Waverly Historic District nomination alongside 136 other contributing buildings.<br /> <br /> Waverly became a destination for Black families looking to settle near the city’s Black commercial and educational institutions. Waverly subsequently came to be home to a locally prominent class of African American community leaders, entrepreneurs, and activists, who found ways to prosper despite the prevailing social and political order of white supremacy. Among the Waverly residents who assumed positions of prominence in Jim Crow Columbia’s African American community was Nathaniel Hamilton Collins, who first owned and oversaw construction of the building which later housed the beauty parlor run by his daughter, Ruth Collins Perry. Nathaniel Collins was a successful tailor and had a substantial influence on the professional interests and careers of Ruth Collins Perry as well as her sister Etienne Collins, both of whom became involved with the clothing and fashion industry as seamstresses and designers. The interest and entrepreneurship that Ruth ultimately exhibited in opening her beauty parlor undoubtedly stemmed in part from the example set by her father, under whom she directly worked before opening her parlor.<br /> <br /> While little documentation remains of the specific activities that unfolded at the parlor, it likely served a similar role for Black Columbians as did other beauty parlors and barber shops across the city and state. The parlor provided a valuable sanctuary from the aesthetic and cultural dictates of white society, and a space in which African Americans could freely converse and provide community support. Ruth’s Beauty Parlor is an example of a long historical effort among African American women to create spaces for cultural and aesthetic expression in a society where beauty norms were defined by white standards, and where public space was often divided into distinct “black” and “white” spheres. In many cases, beauty parlors also served as vital spaces for Black social activism, allowing African American women to discuss and strategize on the political issues of the day and empowering shop owners to become influential leaders in their own right. Black beauty culture was a key component in combating racism during Jim Crow segregation, because it empowered African American women to become independent entrepreneurs, free from the confines of white business owners. These women in turn provided spaces of community shelter and activism through their beauty salons and clothing shops.",

Along the Echo Park Road, a sign directs visitors down a short trail where a sheer cliff stands opposite a creek. Carved into the cliff about 35 feet (10.5 m) above ground level are several figures. The Fremont Culture created these petroglyphs approximately a thousand years ago. But how did they place their designs so high up? Back when these petroglyphs were first carved, the ground's surface extended to the level where the petroglyphs are now. Over the last thousand years, water flowing in the creek channel on the west side of this canyon eroded that access, leaving the petroglyphs where we see them today.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't touch!</strong> Petroglyphs and pictographs are fragile, irreplaceable records of the past that many still hold sacred. Touching them can leave skin oils behind, and tracings or rubbings can ruin the designs. Federal law protects all artifacts, including these sites. Do your part to respect and protect the past, and report any vandalism you find.<br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "In the area where you park, the Echo Park road is a rust red color. A sign that says \"Petroglyphs\" has an arrow directing visitors down a short dirt trail surrounded by trees. Be careful! At the end of this trail, there is a small creek with no fence. Beyond it, a sheer red rock face stands tall. It is stained with gray-black streaks, known as \"desert varnish.\" Approximately 35 feet (10 meters) up the rock face from where the ground is today, several clusters of organized pockmarks form images. Upon careful inspection, they appear to be human-like figures with ornate clothing. These are the Pool Creek petroglyphs. There are two waysides in this area. The one on the left is larger. The main image is a black and white drawing of two indigenous people using tools to create the petroglyphs. The person on the left stands, while the one on the right kneels on a large rock. The main text reads: \"Out of Reach. Carved into the cliff face high above are several human-like figures, each with what appear to be elaborate headdresses or necklaces. Approximately a thousand years ago, the Fremont Culture created these petroglyphs. How did they do it? Today the petroglyphs are inaccessible, but this wasn't always the case. When the Fremont made these images, the ground surface extended to the level of the petroglyphs, approximately 35 feet up the cliff face. Over the last thousand years, the water flowing in the creek channel on the west side of this canyon has eroded that access, leaving the petroglyphs high above human reach.\" On the right side of this wayside, there's closeup image of one of the petroglyphs. It's a cluster of carved dots, which branch out on either side. Beneath it are several etched squares arranged in a semi-circular pattern. A label pointing to the dots says, \"Dot-pattern design.\" A label pointing to the squares says, \"Chipped design.\" Below it, more informational text reads: \"Each of these petroglyphs includes many small holes drilled into the sandstone cliff. Within Dinosaur, this dot-pattern design is only found here at Pool Creek. Fremont Petroglyphs were often made by chipping away sections of rock to create a shape or an outline. This style can be seen in the lower part of the petroglyph above.\" In the lower right of this same wayside, a black bar issues the warning: \"These fragile designs can never be replaced. Do your part to protect them. Do not touch: the oils on our hands erode the petroglyphs. Do not trace or rub the petroglyphs: the soft sandstone rock is easily damaged.\" To the right of the larger wayside, a smaller, older one displays a map. It indicates the relative locations and shapes of the petroglyphs in the rock face 35 feet above where the sign's viewer would stand.",

            "bodyText": "This small barn once housed a prized Shire draft horse named “Leeds Lion.” He was a vital part of the Kohrs-Bielenberg ranching and breeding operations during the early 20th century.  The building was originally constructed in the early 1870’s and it’s believed that it housed several other stallions before Leeds Lion arrived around 1906-1907.  <br /> <br /> Shires originated from central England and are descendants from the English “great horse,” which carried men in full battle armor and pulled heavy equipment into war. They are one of the tallest and strongest breeds of draft horses, and average 17 hands, or roughly 68 inches height and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds. They first arrived in the United States in the mid 1800’s and quickly became popular with farmers and ranchers for their tremendous power and ability to haul heavy equipment and loads over rough roads.<br /> <br /> While most of the day-to-day operations of the Kohrs-Bielenberg Ranch were oriented towards beef cattle, the breeding and selling of thoroughbred and draft horses became an integral part of their business.  Both Conrad Kohrs and John Bielenberg had previously worked with Clydesdales, but apparently felt that Shires could outperform them and began a new breeding program. In 1907, Kohrs imported Leeds Lion, who was a descendant of a well-known sire that was tough, smart, and hardworking to bring new stock into his herd of draft horses.<br /> <br /> In the 1930’s, Conrad Warren took over the family business and continued the tradition of breeding draft horses on the ranch. He never preferred Clydesdales or Shires though and purchased Belgian stallions. By 1936, Warren had the largest breeding herd in Montana, but the demand for hard working draft horses was quickly replaced by tractors and other",
            "audioDescription": "This historic barn is one and half stories tall and is rectangular in shape. The barn is constructed of logs and is located on the south west side of the historic lower yard area of Grant-Kohrs Ranch. The buildings ground level or first story is roughly 10 feet tall and is constructed of logs beams that are notched in the corners. There are many large cracks and gaps between each log beam that is filled with cement. There is a door located in the middle of the north wall of the building that serves as a point for people to enter the building. On the west side of the building is a much larger door that exits into an adjacent field and was used by large draft horses to go in and out of the building. This door is typically closed and does not provide access for visitors. remains closed. The front section of the barn, where visitors enter the building has a wooden floor. Beyond the wooden floor most of the building has a dirt floor where horses would have been housed. On the right-hand side of the entry way is a large storage bin. On the left-hand side of the entry way is a small manger, enclosed by a 3-foot-tall wooden fence. This manger would have held hay. There is a hole in the ceiling above this space where stored hay above could be thrown down. Above the entry way that leads into the dirt floor pin is a small sepia toned photograph taken around 1910 that is believed to show the Shire draft horse named Leeds Lion standing in front of the main Ranch House. Next to this image is a copy of the certificate of sale for Leeds Lion to Conrad Kohrs. There is an opening in the south end of this small enclosure that allowed horses to reach the hay from their enclosure. Inside of the dirt enclosure are several interpretive displays about the history of draft horses and equipment that was used by draft horses on the ranch. In the middle of the room is a small, glass enclosed rectangular case that houses draft horseshoes and interpretive information. On the entire length of the southern exterior wall is an interpretive display on the different types of draft horses and images of draft horses on the ranch. Against the western wall are a pair of wooden fences that are covered with a blanket that represents a draft horse. On top of the blanket is displayed the types of bridles, saddles, and other equipment that draft horses would have worn while doing hard work on the ranch. The ceiling separates the first floor from a half-story hay loft above. The roof is constructed of heavy planked wood. On the north side of the building, above the main entrance is a small door that provides access to the upstairs hayloft and where hay would have entered the building. The outside wall of the east side of the building has a small access hatch near the eaves that is made of braced vertical boards. The exterior and interior log walls of the entire building have been whitewashed. The main door on the north side of the building is stained red. In the center of the south facing wall there is fixed six paned, wood sash window. The window sash is stained red and the trim bars are stained white. The outside of the building has a gable roof that is oriented north and south. The roof is covered in wooden shingles with a metal flashing along the ridgeline.",

As you heave yourself out of bed your feet hit the cold wooden floor, adding insult to your injury. Your breath creates a frozen vapor as you walk over to the furnace. You realize that you didn't put enough wood in the stove, as you open the furnace and only see the dying red embers. Slowly you put on your boots, jacket, mittens, and walk out into the eerily white darkness of a February West Virginia morning. It's been a long winter. The fruits and vegetables your family canned during autumn have sustained everyone to this point, but how much longer can they last? Deer meat was frequent in November and December, but it's been too cold lately to see any deer. Too much snow; the deer aren't able to forage like they usually do. The firewood pile keeps getting smaller too. At the beginning of the month, you'd figured you had enough to last at least until March. But alas, February is cruel, and a family has to stay warm. You'll fell a couple of locust trees today, and spend the day chopping wood. That is of course after you feed the animals and inspect for any signs of game.</em><br /> <br /> Many visitors coming to New River Gorge National Park and Preserve have never experienced the harsh realities of subsidence farming. As the colonization of the United States lead to Western Expansion, most immigrants passed right by West Virginia. It's not a slight against the area, but simply a reality that a flat crop field in a place like Iowa or Ohio is more suitable for living than a harsh mountainous area such as the Appalachians. The people who stayed became mountaineers: tough durable people who lived off the land. They didn't thrive, and quite frankly some died. But their legacy is living through droughts, harsh winters, and practical starvations, to create farms, then towns, and eventually the State of West Virginia. Here at New River Gorge National Park and Preserve you have a chance to visit one of these special homesteads. The Trump-Lilly Farm is primarily preserved, and if you're ready, it's ready to take you back to the days of subsistence farming.</p> <p>The property title of this building can be traced back to the early 18th century. The earliest land owners of this tract of property were probably Samuel L. Hopkins and Alexander Stuart Both of these men were recipients of huge land grants given out during the infancy of the United States. The roots of settlement of the Trump-Lilly farm can be tied directly to Peter Davis. Davis bought the parcels of land from Alexander Stuart and settled down on the New River between 1810 and 1815. In 1850, Davis sold 150 acres to man named William Richmond. William Richmond was the patriarch of the Richmond family. It was under his stewardship that the Richmond family built a grist mill and established a post office and general store around the area of Richmond Falls. (Sandstone Falls today). In 1888, Richmond gave the tract of land which is officially Trump-Lilly Farm to his daughter Mary E. (Richmond) Trump. The 1880 census reports that Mary Richmond (Trump) was a 28 year old unmarried female. It is believed the first homestead on Trump-Lilly farm was built at this time. From 1905 to 1912, the farm land was sold various times, until finally Aden J. Lilly purchased the property from the New River Land Company. The subsistence farming practices of the Lilly family are what are preserved today by the National Park Service.</p> <p>Just a county over in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, there were scores of large farms at the time. They provided their owners with subsistence and a crash crop. Aden Lilly did not have the luxury of creating a cash crop. Everything grown was for subsistence, either for consumption or for trade. The family harvested timber to meet their building and heating needs, and to also create new crop fields. They planted apple orchards and had rows of vegetables. They raised sheep. The lambs that they would sell in the fall provided income to pay the farm's taxes and to buy school books for the children. Wool from the rest of the sheep provided clothes and additional money to buy supplies for the winter. They were not isolated. Theirs was one of many farms around the area. Farmers helped each other with their harvests. They shared cane mills to make molasses, and if they needed something they couldn't make themselves, they would make the trek to Hinton on horseback to trade their harvest items for sugar, salt, and farm equipment. Livestock were fed each morning before breakfast. Aden Lilly raised Poland China hogs, chickens, and three to four milk cows. The pork meat was always salted so it would be preserved.</p> <p>Growing up on the farm would be a vastly different experience than growing in today's technologically advanced society. Instead of electric heat, the house was heated by wood stove. There was not refrigerator or electricity until the 1940's, and the family would store their food in root cellars. The Lilly children entertained themselves with spelling and arithmetic drills. There was a Croby battery radio and an organ case piano on the property. The Lilly's attended regular church devotions.</p> <p>Today the Trump-Lilly farm is not entirely what it once was. Some of the fields have been taken back by nature. When Aden Lilly sold the farm to his son Oba in 1963, Oba did not live at the farm. He planted crops, but visited the farm irregularly. Oba sold the farm to David Rosenberger who used the property as a vacation rental. Rosenberger sold it to the National Park Service in 1989. The house and other structures have weathered over time, and the wide open fields of crops no longer remain. Today only a glimpse exists of what the Trump-Lilly was, but that glimpse is an eye opening experience into the strife and struggle of the Lilly's and other early Appalachian subsistence farmers; a collage of vegetables, fruits, and livestock flourishing in early 20th century Sewell Mountain.</p> <p><strong>To visit Trump-Lilly Farm:</strong></p> <p>To reach Trump Lilly farm use WV county road 26 (River Road just outside Hinton) north approximately fifty yards from its intersection with State Route 20, then follow a gravel road (the first left after crossing Madam's Creek Bridge - marked Freezeland Mountain) along its winding ascent through second growth forest to the site. The rugged unpaved road is characterized by a number of sharp turns, steep grades and panoramic views of Hinton and the New River below. There is a small parking lot at the farm. It can be a bit tricky to find both the gravel road and the farm (at this time there are no signs at the farm). It is recommended that visitors stop by the Sandstone Visitor Center to talk to a ranger and get directions and up to date road conditions.</p> <p><br />  </p> <br />  ",

The area within and around Upper Lehman campground is a rich wetland fed by Lehman Creek, home to non-native brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout. The increased level of moisture, largely due to snowmelt in the spring, allows larger trees to thrive, including ponderosa pines, mountain mahogany, and white fir. Birds you may encounter include American robins, Townsend’s solitaires, and mountain chickadees. </p> <p paraeid=\"{37e124ef-4d15-4cd8-8ab2-41020f8b9263}{249}\" paraid=\"598825491\">Enjoy the babbling of Lehman Creek from the fishing dock across from campsite 7 or relax underneath the shade of the trees at the picnic areas.  </p>",

The regiment, resplendent in their elaborately braided blue jackets and baggy red trousers, boasted a high number of college educated and professional men as they departed for war.<br /> <br /> On August 30, 1862, during the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run), the 5th New York, the regiment found itself in the path of Longstreet's massive Confederate counterattack. Together with the 10th New York, the 5th found themselves supporting a lone artillery battery (Hazlett's Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery). Posted to the left rear of the battery, the 5th New York was struck by several thousand Confederates of Hood's Texas Brigade. Vainly trying to hold their position against overwhelming numbers, the 5th New York was virtually wiped out in a few minutes of combat. The regiment lost 124 men killed/mortally wounded and 223 wounded out of 594.

The 5th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment monument is a three-tiered gray granite stone monument with a rectangular bronze plaque and a round bronze state seal on its western, or front, face. The monument is approximately eight and a half feet wide and three feet thick at its base. The top twenty inches of the approximately ten-foot-tall monument is a Maltese Cross with a bronze numeral five in the middle of the cross. The 5th New York was a unit within the Union Army’s Fifth Corps and the Maltese Cross was the Corps badge of the Fifth Corps. The entire stone and bronze artwork is surrounded by a three foot tall wrought iron fence. It stands here to commemorate the unit’s participation in the Civil War and, in particular, their heroic stand here atop this knoll on August 30, 1862. The rectangular bronze plaque has the following inscription: “Erected by the State of New York, September 29, 1906, to commemorate the heroic services of the 5th Regiment New York Volunteer Infantry (Duryee Zouaves).

            "audioDescription": "The View: To the left of the wayside exhibit is a large rock with mortar holes embedded into it, where Native American people once pounded acorns into meal. Each hole is between 4 and 12 inches wide, in a conical shape. On the left side of the rock, is a Bay Laurel tree, with long, dark green, pointy leaves. The leaves are aromatic when crushed. Overhead are Canyon Live Oak trees, with oval leaves that are jagged and pointy on the outer edge. A large Sumac bush on the right has olive green leaves that are oval with a pointed tip. From this site, you can often hear the river flowing through the canyon below this exhibit. The text reads, This site once served as a busy kitchen for a village. It provided Native American people everything they needed for cooking: rocks and sticks to shape into bowls and utensils, river water, and nutritious acorns from oak trees. Women chipped the hollow bedrock mortars into these rocks to pound acorns into flour. Baked into cakes or boiled to make mush or soup, acorn meal sustained the village. The main image is a black and white photo of an older American Indian woman seated crossed legged in a printed dress, with an apron around her waist. Around her are three deep rounded baskets made of woven grasses or reeds. Two are striped and one has a zigzagged pattern. Two long narrow sticks rest atop the largest basket. To her right is a large cloth laid out on the ground. Two shallower plain baskets lie on the cloth. A building made of upright slatted wood boards is seen behind her. The caption reads, Western Mono tribe member Hi a inh, also called Jane Whaley, sits with traditional baskets and stirring tool (1929 to 1930). Another black and white photo shows a middle-aged American Indian woman at work. Her dark hair pulled back in a bun and she's wearing a dress with a ruffled collar, seated on a blanket on a large flat rock. With arms bent, she holds a conical shaped stone the size of a bread loaf above a round hole in the stone next to her. The caption reads, Women used a shaped stone to pound acorns into meal or flour. A time-consuming process, preparing acorns gave friends time to talk, laugh, and socialize. Yokuts tribe member Mary Pohot, 1925. Below there is an image of an acorn- a brown thumb sized oval nut with a light brown textured \"cap\".",

The Second Bull Run (Groveton) Monument is an approximately thirteen-foot-tall native brownstone, or red sandstone, square-shafted columnar monument situated upon a pyramidal earthen pedestal of approximately five feet in height. The monument was built by Union soldiers in the spring of 1865 to commemorate the Union soldiers who had died in the Second Battle of Manassas, also commonly referred to at that time as the Battle of Groveton. Like the fraternal twin First Bull Run monument, this obelisk was once embellished with artillery projectiles at the top and around the base of the monument, but unlike the First Bull Run monument, the original iron projectiles on the Second Bull Run (Groveton) monument have disappeared in the hands of vandals and have not been replaced with facsimiles. An approximately two-foot-square marble plaque on the northwest, or front, face of the monument contains the following inscription: “In memory of the patriots who fell at Groveton. August 28, 29 and 30, 1862”. The monument sits atop a prominent plateau of ground approximately thirty yards south of the Deep Cut of the Unfinished Railroad and several hundred yards west of Featherbed Lane.",

Tate, Kitty Hawk Postmaster, in a letter to Wilbur Wright dated August 18, 1900.<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: Landscape-oriented rectangular panel featuring a black band across the top. The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The panel features a large black and white image on the background, text in two columns across the top and 1 small black and white photograph to the right of the text.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: In the distance, to the left is the hill with the Wright Brothers Monument atop it. To the right is the First flight sculpture. Directly behind the wayside, about 20 feet is the parking area and road.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND IMAGE: A large black and white photograph of the 1903 flyer as it rests on the launching rail on the slope of the sandy dune. Behind the flyer to the right is a group of people. From left to right there are 2 men stand with a dog between them and a small boy stands next to them. Farther behind them is another man and a small boy, and finally a lone man stands farther to the right.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wilbur and Orville Wright accepted Tate’s invitation and found that the Outer Banks of North Carolina not only provided hospitable people but also the conditions that they needed to fly – wind, sand, and solitude. While solitude was important to get the work done, the Wrights did not work alone. From 1900 to 1903, families from the local communities and the crews from the local life saving stations provided much-needed assistance to the Wrights. On the morning of December 17, 1903, the Wrights signaled for help and “John T. Daniels, W.S. Dough, A.D. Etheridge, W.C. Brinkley of Manteo, and Johnny Moore of Nags Head arrive,” wrote Orville. With their help the Flyer was moved to the launch rail. The men then cheered as the Flyer lifted off the ground.The “First Flight” sculpture captures the Wrights’ historic achievement and the hospitable people who supported them. Local families and descendants of the first flight witnesses continue to welcome visitors to the Memorial and the Outer Banks.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph of a family posing for a picture on a porch. On the left side, a man wearing a hat, a light-colored jacket, and dark pants, sits in a chair with a small child in his lap.  On the right side, in front of a window, an older woman in a dark colored dress is sitting in a chair. A younger woman in a white shirt and dark skirt stands just behind her right shoulder and a small girl stands in front of the woman, resting her hand in the woman’s lap. On the ground in front of them is a medium sized white dog with dark spots looking off to the left.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Tate family, on the porch of the Kitty Hawk Post Office.",

Mule deer, turkeys, ground squirrels, Clark’s nutcrackers, and hermit thrushes are common sights in this area contrasted by the much rarer Mountain Lion.

Up the trails you’ll see groves of aspen trees, and even further up the Great Basin Bristlecone Pines. </p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{166}\" paraid=\"1614655359\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/identifying-bristlecone-pines.htm\">Bristlecone pines</a> are the oldest single living organisms on earth, and they cut a striking image among the rocky landscape.

Begin at the Bristlecone trailhead and hike the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/hiking-information.htm\">2.8 mile out-and-back trail</a> to see these ancient trees and be reminded of humans’ short time on Earth. </p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{180}\" paraid=\"964859589\">While the Bristlecone Trailhead is the start of many adventures, it is also the end of the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive. This tour took you from dry, salty sagebrush at low elevations all the way up to rich mountain ecosystems bustling with life. Pick either the Bristlecone/Glacier trail or the Summit trail, both of which start here, and follow it above the tree line to experience the splendor of the alpine life zone.  </p>",

The cemetery, while modest in overall design conception, has a considerable connection to the historic development of Kingsbury. The Moss Street Cemetery is one of the oldest dedicated burial grounds in the Town of Kingsbury. The cemetery contains the final resting places of countless prominent early town residents, among them veterans of the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. Established around the time of the Revolution, the earliest grave within the cemetery is believed to be that of a Native American veteran of the French & Indian War, his identity unknown, but was buried there as early as the 1780s.<br /> <br /> Although burials had been established at the site previously, it was not until 1804 that a group of Kingsbury residents, serving collectively as trustees, purchased the land from Simeon Moss for the expressed purpose of establishing a cemetery, a use which continues to the current day. This original purchase consisted of over an acre of land before it was augmented by purchases made during the 1870s, which added additional land on the south and west sides of the original core area. The cemetery is believed to be the third oldest burial yard established in Kingsbury. Settlers in this area faced tremendous tribulations during the American Revolution, particularly during the year 1780, when British raiders laid waste to much of the area, leading local residents to recall it as “The Year of the Great Burning.”<br /> <br /> In addition to the cemetery’s historic context, the Moss Street Cemetery retains a representative collection of funerary art dating from the early nineteenth century. The earliest extant grave stones, dating to the first decade of the nineteenth century, exhibit Neoclassical-inspired design vocabulary, which found full expression in the material culture of America at this time, such as in the Roman-inspired architecture and decorative arts of the Federal style. The cemetery overall contains a characteristic array of funerary art spanning the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and continuing to the present day.",

            "bodyText": "WAYSIDE TITLE: 12 Seconds that Changed the World<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: Cream colored, landscape-oriented rectangular panel featuring a black band across the top. The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior”. On the right side of the band is the NPS Logo. The panel features text in the top third of the panel. The bottom third of the panel features a large artistic rendering of the first flight, including the two camp buildings. Next to the painting, is a black and white photograph of the actual first flight.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The First Flight Sculpture is about 50 yards behind this wayside. The sculpture is on a sandy surface and surrounded by green grass. About 40 feet to the left of the sculpture is a small tree with a bench beneath it.<br /> <br /> TEXT: 12 Seconds That Changed the World. After more than four years of hard work and experimentation, it only took the Wright Brothers 12 seconds to change the world. On December 17, 1903, at 10:35 a.m., Orville wright made the world’s first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight.The photograph that documented the Wrights’ success was taken by John T. Daniels, a Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station surfman, who had never used a camera before. It was not until the Wright Brothers returned to Dayton, Ohio, that they developed the photograph and saw their first flight captured on film. The Daniels’ photo, however, only gives one perspective of that historic event – from the back of the airplane.Stephen Smith’s “First Flight” sculpture, unveiled during the 2003 Centennial, and Frank Wootton’s painting help us see the first flight from different angles. Just as the Wright Brothers’ success depended on viewing the problems of flight in novel and creative ways, perhaps these new perspectives will inspire us to change the world and explore new horizons.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph of the first flight. The 1903 flyer is centered flying away from the viewer, just getting liftoff from the rail below it. A man, Orville Wright, is seen lying on his stomach in the center of the flyer. Another man dressed in a dark suit is standing to the side of the flyer’s wings on the right side of the photo.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: John T. Daniels, a Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station surfman, took this photograph (above), documenting the first flight. Stand beside the sculpture of Surfman Daniels to see if you can capture this image.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A gold framed painting of the first flight, as depicted from the front of the flyer. The sky is blue and patched with grey, fluffy clouds. The painting is set farther away than the photograph, showing the witnesses much smaller. The two camp buildings can be seen close by to the flyer and the witnesses on the left.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Frank Wootton’s painting (right) of the first flight offers another view of the historic event.",

The woman on the left wears a black and white hooded jacket that extends to her waist and a dark colored mid-calf-length skirt. A basket hangs down her back, supported by a strap that wraps across her forehead. She carries a brown and black satchel. She is barefoot. The second woman wears similar clothing with the addition of a long, brown fur draped across the front of her body. She holds a walking stick in her right hand. She is also barefoot. The women stand upon a green and white section of ground. Plants rise up in the foreground of the image and a mountain range spans the background underneath a blue sky. Text on the left side of the panel reads: Mountain Travelers. Why did you come to the mountains? People have been traveling to these peaks for millennia. Ancestors of local tribes hunted elk and deer and collected plants for food, fiber and medicine across these ridges. Tribal elders tell of using the mountains as travel routes, and for spiritual and social pursuits. People have come to these slopes for centuries for the same reasons that visitors journey to Hurricane Ridge today. Wilderness that provided survival necessities like food and tools also nourished the soul. The mountains continue to offer solitude and renewal to anyone who travels here.",

Deer trails criss-cross the hillsides; excavations are marmot burrows. Listen for the whistle of the marmot or the booming sound of the male blue grouse. Below the text is a drawing of the top half of a standing Marmot. Its horizontal, oval shaped head faces right. A small ear sits far back on the side of its head and a dark oval eye sits high and centered. It has a flat nose and a wide closed mouth. Its body is stout, and its two front legs and four-toed feet hang in front of its belly. On the left side of the panel, is a larger drawing of a forward-facing bear standing on all four long-clawed feet. The bear has dark fur, a broad, bulky body and a small round head with two upright oval shaped ears. Closely spaced eyes are set on either side of the snout which extends out from its face. At the tip of the snout is a large black round nose and the bear’s mouth.",

            "audioDescription": "Cirque Rim Overlook. 3 minutes Along the curved two-foot-high stone wall are two three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panels about 15-feet apart. Beginning with the wayside on the left, a color photograph of the tree filled valley and distant mountain landscape before you fills the panel. On the right side of the photo, a mountain ridge is on fire, whitish-gray smoke rising cloudlike into the sky. Inset on the left, a color photograph taken deep inside a mountain forest shows standing and downed trees fully engulfed in red and yellow flames. Text across the top reads: Fire and Rain. Fire in the Olympics. Even in a park drenched by over 12 feet of rain each year, summers are dry. When lightning strikes, small fires can spread. This creates a natural patchwork of burned and unburned meadows, forests and silver snags like those at Hurricane Ridge. In September 2003 lightening ignited a fire near Griff Peak, two-mile northwest of here. It was too dangerous for the firefighters to dig a fire line on the steep slopes, amid falling trees and rocks. Instead, crews used sprinklers, helicopter water drops and bare ridges to limit the fire’s spread. October rains had the final word, extinguishing embers that lingered in the 820-acre Griff Fire. As woodpeckers probe the drying trees, and nutrients released by the flames return to the soil, researchers will be watching. How many sun-loving tree seedlings sprout in new openings? Which wildflowers colonize the slopes? What changes can you observe from this fiery renewal? The wayside panel on the right has a color panoramic illustration of the valley, mountain, and water landscape before you with 16 features labeled. Text under the photograph reads: International Views. When weather permits, you can see the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Canada’s Vancouver Island, Victoria, and British Columbia Coast Range. The Strait and other waterways isolate the Olympic Peninsula. When clouds cover the lowlands, imagine the white layer as thick ice sheets that also isolated these mountains thousands of years ago. As a result, island-like Olympic National Park protects plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. The labeled features along mountain ridges from left to right are Hurricane Hill Trailhead; Hurricane Hill Trail; Hurricane Hill, 5,759 feet with Little River in the valley below; Unicorn Peak; Unicorn Horn; and Griff Peak. Then, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island, Salt Spring Island, Port Angeles, Victoria, Haro Strait, San Juan Island (US), and British Columbia Coast Range in the background fill the right side of the photo.",

            "audioDescription": "(523 words) The Frederick Douglass House is located in the southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. bordered by W Street SE to the north, 15th street to the east, and 14th Street to the west. The house sits high atop a steep hill and the property encompasses the entire block. A black iron gate set atop a cement retaining wall surrounds the area. A visitor center is located at street level at the corner of W and 15th Streets. A parking lot to the north of the visitor center is accessible on W Street. Stairs to the right of the visitor center entrance lead up to a road that winds up to the house at the top of the hill. A red brick sidewalk lines the south side of W Street and stairs lead straight up to the house at the middle of the block. A road leads into the property from 14th Street at the intersection with W Street, passes by the front of the house at mid-level up the hill, and continues to rise as it winds around to the back of the house at the top of the hill. Two metal railings line the brick center stairs that rise from street level through a grass hill lawn on both sides to the front door of the house. The tan-painted, two-story home features a sweeping forty-foot long porch with four white round columns. The double-hung white front door is bracketed by two floor-to-ceiling windows on each side with dark gray shutters. Tall evergreen trees are set on both sides of the house and the view from atop the hill provides sweeping views of downtown Washington including the Capitol building. Immediately behind the house is a white, fifty-foot long, one-story cottage home with a red roof and porch on the west side, closest to the main house. Three windows line the east and west sides of the house. Two windows sit along the back with a half-moon window above. Red brick walkways lines both sides. On the wall left of the front door, under the porch, is a one by two-foot bronze plaque with a gold border. An engraving on the plaque reads: In Loving Memory of \"The Guardian Angel of Cedar Hill\" Gladys B. Parham 1906-1983 In recognition of her steadfast dedication to the preservation and maintenance of the Frederick Douglass Home Erected by Frederick Douglass Memorial And Historical Association 1987 Behind the house is an eighty-foot long stretch of grass lawn that leads back to a circular paved road loop with a tree in its center. The road from 14th Street winds up to this location. About thirty feet east of the circle is a small one-story stone building, twelve feet wide and nine feet deep with a chimney on its right side. The building is bracketed by trees and shrubs. To the south of the circle set on a hill in front of a grass field is a partially constructed brick wall, about twenty feet across, five-feet-tall and the depth of two bricks. A smaller wall about ten feet long and two feet tall sits at the southwest corner of the circle. END OF DESCRIPTION",

The panel on the right shows an illustration of a hiking boot with deeps treads about to step on grass, wildflowers, a hidden mouse nest, and an adult mouse. Text reads: Meadow Damage. Your feet are a threat to meadows. Without realizing, people crush fragile plants and flatten nests and small creatures hidden in the grass. Help preserve the meadows. Please stay on maintained trails. Shortcuts leave lasting scars.",

Text at the top right reads: Forest Fire Scars. Across the valley below you the lighter-colored vegetation defines the boundaries of old burns, which have occurred over the last two centuries. Lightning probably sparked most of the fires. Gradually at this elevation, new trees re-covered the ridge. The landscape’s pattern of colors, different shades of green, can be hieroglyphics of natural disasters, part of the forest’s life-cycle. Other scars mark the slopes: the narrow, vertical clearings of winter avalanche, and the landslide above the lower end of Long Ridge. Below the text is a black and white drawing of a man in profile from the waist up. He has a dark beard and moustache and wears a hard hat and jacket.

Text at the top left reads: Glaciers in Peril. Abundant snow and cool summers create ideal conditions for Pacific Northwest glaciers. These rivers of ice, once considered permanent, are disappearing in our warming climate. A healthy glacier receives enough snow in winter to offset its summer melt. Now this sustaining snow often falls as rain. Olympic Mountain glaciers lost over 30 percent of their surface area from the 1970s to 2010. Blue Glacier retreated three football fields in length and lost over 74 feet of thickness, the height of a seven-story building, between 1987 and 2010. Some smaller glaciers in the park have completely disappeared. Glaciers have carved and adorned these mountains for millennia. Their meltwater feeds rivers that nurture life downstream, from forests to fish to people. As we continue to change our climate, the choices we make today will affect the future of these icy Olympic icons. To the right of the text, are two small, stacked photographs with the caption, Lillian Glacier, near Obstruction Point, was nearly gone by 2010. The image on top dated 1905 shows a mountain area with a large glacier filling in a wide bowl-shaped expanse between two peaks. In the bottom photo dated 2010 the bowl-shaped area is empty except for a few areas where snow clings to the sides of the bowl. Below the text are two larger side-by side black and white photographs showing a wide mountain range with Blue Glacier on the left and Carrie Glacier on the right. The photo on the left dated 1889 has an arrow pointing to the end of Carrie Glacier. In the second photo dated 2009, the arrow remains in place, but the end of Carrie Glacier has retreated up the mountain. Blue Glacier has also been reduced in size. A caption reads: From Hurricane Ridge, you can see Blue Glacier on Mount Olympus and Carrie Glacier to the southwest. The historic late summer photograph of Carrie Glacier shows a thick, healthy glacier. By 2009 the glacier had thinned dramatically and retreated far upslope.",

Research shows that wetter summers beginning in the 1940s allowed subalpine firs to invade open meadows in this area. In 100 years, this scene may be a dense forest. In national parks, processes like climate, wind, fire, and avalanches are the directors. The result is a dynamic landscape where the line between meadow and forest is in constant flux. Below the text, the image on the left, dated 1945, shows the mountainside with one dense area of trees and several thin lines of trees.

            "bodyText": "<p>At time of construction, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/nrgbridge.htm\">New River Gorge Bridge's</a> arch made it the longest steel arch bridge in the world, a title it held until 2003 with the construction of China’s Shanghai’s Lupu Bridge. It is currently the longest single-span steel arch bridge in the United States and the third highest bridge in the country. Though the bridge itself employs a fairly conventional design, its construction represents a number of construction achievements. The engineers and ironworkers overcame major obstacles due to its enormous scale and the then-remote Appalachian location.<br /> <br /> The New River Gorge Bridge is located in a once remote area of West Virginia just north of Fayetteville in Fayette County, West Virginia. The bridge is situated in the northern section of the 53-mile long New River Gorge National Park and Preserve – a unit of the National Park Service – and is surrounded by lush Appalachian Mountain forest. It carries U.S. Route 19 across the deep gorge of the New River which runs 876 feet below. A rail line runs along each side of the river at the bottom of the gorge while Fayette Station Road (State Route 82) winds its way down the steep terrain and under the bridge on both the north and south sides.<br /> <br /> The bridge is a continuous-span, open-spandrel, arch truss bridge constructed of steel. The overall length of the bridge is 3,030 feet, 6 inches (measured from center-to-center of end bearings) and the arch, the longest steel arch in the United States2 , measures 1,700 feet. The width of the bridge is 73 feet 5 inches to the outside of the parapet walls. In total, the massive structure weighs in at 88 million pounds including 21,000 tons of structural steel, 1,700 tons of reinforcing steel, 17,000 cubic yards of substructure concrete, and 6,000 cubic yards of superstructure concrete.<br /> <br /> The bridge includes four 12 foot vehicular lanes, a 6 foot 10 inch median with barrier, and two 8 foot wide shoulders with safety parapets. All structural steel for the bridge is \"COR-TEN B,\" a weathering steel that rusts when exposed to the elements for several years and eliminates the need for painting. Its chemical makeup also increases its resistance to corrosion. High-strength bolts, conforming to the standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials, were used in connections. <br /> <br /> The bridge was not only an engineering feat but also a great improvement for the economy and lives of local residents. The drive across the gorge at this location was reduced from a 45 minute drive on winding and often treacherous roads to less than a minute. Once it opened to regular traffic, the bridge completed the link to connect areas north and south of the gorge. Traffic along the route increased 140 percent with the opening of the bridge.<br /> <br /> The bridge opening had almost an immediate impact. For example, by April 1978, one trucking company reported an estimated savings in fuel and wages of approximately $3000 a day by cutting off 500 miles a week. Area hospitals located south of the bridge reported an increase in patients from north of the gorge including a 21% increase at Oak Hill Hospital, located about 15 minutes south of the gorge. Without the New River Gorge Bridge, such a trip would have taken about an hour. Prior to its opening, patients north of the gorge found it faster to get to Montgomery or Charleston for their health care needs.<br /> <br /> Every fall since 1980 festival goers converge on the small community to attend Bridge Day, the only day of the year when it is legal to walk on, as well as jump and rappel from the bridge. The festival has grown from its humble beginnings with five parachutists and a few thousand onlookers to welcome an average of 80,000 spectators every year watching nearly 400 B.A.S.E. jumpers and 300 rappellers.</p>",

The Plains Depot was built in 1888 in the center of town, after a railroad employee, Milton Leander Hudson donated the land. Residential neighborhoods soon developed around the depot and despite several changes in railroad management, the town prospered. Although the depot closed in 1951, it was reopened on April 18, 1976 to serve as the Presidential Campaign Headquarters for Jimmy Carter. During that time approximately 10,000 people a day came to Plains to find out about candidate Carter. Many state primary victories, as well as the Presidential victory, were held in the streets around the depot. The depot now contains a self-guided museum with exhibits focusing on the 1976 Presidential campaign.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br />  ",

In 1785, Pinckney commissioned a stone for his father’s grave at St. Philip’s Church Cemetery in Charleston. The stone’s inscription had an error, so he ordered a new stone for the grave and had the original stone sent to Snee Farm (Matthews 2004:xiv). It was moved from the farm to the yard of the nearby Christ Church in the late nineteenth century. The replica cenotaph was placed by Thomas and Alexandra Stone, who owned the farm from 1943 until the 1960s.<br /> <br /> It has a large, bas-relief urn flanked by arching willows in the upper half. The first three lines of the inscription on the slab are split vertically by the urn and read “Parri Dilecto, Carolo Pinckney, Ob. 22d Sept. 1782 Aetat 52.” Below the urn is the rest of the inscription, which reads, <br /> <br /> What is grandeur!

The downward sloping meadow has clumps of purple and white wildflowers and short, green grasses. On the far edge of the meadow, lines of pine trees descend down slope. Then, snow-free forested mountains in the near distance and snowcapped mountain peaks in the far distance. Nineteen peaks are labeled by name and elevation. Below the mountain peaks in two valleys separated by a ridge are the Lillian River on the left and Elwha River on the right. Text below the illustration reads: The Olympic Mountains. On a clear day you can gaze far into the Olympic Wilderness, from deep valleys to deep ridges. This young mountain range is made of basalts and sedimentary rocks uplifted from their birth on the seafloor and later sculpted by glaciers and erosion. Winter snow lingers on the mountains well into summer. By autumn, only permanent snowfields and glacial ice cling to the highest peaks. From left to right, the names and elevations of the mountains read: Steeple Rock 5567 feet. Obstruction Peak 6450 feet. Mt. Deception 7788 feet. Mt. Cameron 7190 feet. McCartney Peak 6784 feet. Mt.

            "audioDescription": "Ira Trailhead Exhibits. 461 words At the left side of the path that leads from the parking lot to the towpath is a tall graphic panel flanked on both sides by touchable models of animals common in the marsh. Two models are on the left of the panel – a beaver at left and an otter at right. The beaver is 18” long, faces to the right, and sits three feet high on a model of a beaver dam made of logs. Notice its wide, flat tail hanging down behind. To the right is an otter sitting on a two-foot-high boulder, facing left. Its thin body is 19 inches long with a long tail hanging down the back of the boulder. A fish lies on the rock by the otter’s front feet. To the right of the panel is another boulder, 2-foot high. There is a hollow cavity on the front of the boulder where a muskrat sits, facing left. His nine-inch-long body has an equally long, hairless tail. Near his left front paw is a cattail head. Flat cattail leaves lie on top of the boulder. The bottom of the graphic panel has a photograph of Beaver’s Marsh, the flat, still water broken by patches of marsh grasses. A low ridge shrouded in mist lies behind the marsh. Text at the top left reads, “From Salvage Yard to Beaver Marsh. Follow the Towpath Trail ahead to Beaver Marsh – one of the best places to view wildlife in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Only a quarter-mile north, a boardwalk crosses this 70-acre wetland, transformed from an old salvage yard. Humans and beavers turned this site back into a marsh in the 1980s. Volunteers organized by a local Sierra Club removed cars and materials from the old business site. About the same time beavers flooded the area by building a dam across the Ohio and Erie Canal. The waters awakened long-dormant seeds of wetland plants -- a stunning example of nature recovering an area if given a chance. You may see a beaver nibbling on a willow branch, turtles sunning themselves on logs, and, if you are fortunate, otters at play. In spring and summer, frogs and songbirds sing in an exuberant chorus.” To the right of the text is a photograph of a small garage surrounded by rows of junk cars. The caption reads, “Burrell Tonkin’s auto repair shop and salvage yard were full of car bumpers, tires, and other auto parts.” Across the middle of the panel are four smaller photographs. From left to right they show a great blue heron surrounded by lily pads, a beaver crouched near reeds, a pair of otters side-by-side on a wetland stump, and two park volunteers making notes as they observe wildlife in the marsh.

Standing 13,063 feet tall, Wheeler Peak and the surrounding area offer the park's best example of an Alpine Life Zone. Windswept and rugged, the alpine zone serves up a harsh existence to the life it supports. Above the tree line, the only plant life to be found are grasses and low perennial herbs and wildflowers. This is the domain of bighorn sheep, rosy-finches, and the American pipit, but even these are rare sights at such altitudes. Covered in snow for large parts of the year, Wheeler Peak stands in stark contrast to the dry, salty areas where the scenic drive began.  </p>",

            "bodyText": "Built near water, with access to food, and along trade routes, Pecos Pueblo thrived from around 1350 C.E. until 1838 C.E. Archaeologists believe the pueblo site, comprising a north and a south pueblo unit, had around 1000 rooms and at its height was home to about 2000 individuals. Spanish records describe Pecos as a bustling community that hosted trade fairs drawing people and goods from the Plains Nations and the Rio Grande Pueblos. Archaeological finds of shells from the Pacific Coast and Gulf of Mexico and flint arrowheads from sources now in Texas give us an idea as to how far these trade routes ran.<br /> <br /> In 1540 C.E., the Coronado expedition encountered Pecos Pueblo and described the community as having 500 warriors who could subdue other people at will. In the 1620s, Franciscans oversaw the Pueblo construction of a Mission Church close to the south pueblo. In 1680 C.E., Pecos was one of the nearly thirty pueblos that revolted and pushed the Spanish influence from the area. The Spanish returned to, and reconquered New Mexico in 1692.<br /> <br /> Over a number of years, due to disease, decreasing trade, increasing attacks from the neighboring Comanche, and the theft of land, the population of Pecos Pueblo decreased. In 1838 C.E., the last inhabitants left Pecos to join the Pueblo of Jemez. We ask that you visit respectfully and that you leave things as you see them.",

South to north tour ends here.The Painted Desert Community Complex is a mid-century architectural treasure that is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built as headquarters for the park, visitor center with concession, but also as a complete community for the folks who worked at the park. Designed to resemble the historic pueblos with a modern twist, the complex featured houses, apartments, a school, post office, and community building where they had dances and get togethers. Today, the Painted Desert Community Complex is still home to many of the employees. You can ask for a brochure for a self-guided exploration of this historic district built by Richard Neutra in 1962.<br /> <br /> As you leave the complex and continue through the north entrance station, you are traveling across Headquarters Mesa. Do you know the difference between a mesa and a butte? It has to do with ratios. A mesa tends to be wider than it is tall whereas a butte is taller than it is wide.

In 1882 Secretary of War Robert T. Lincoln authorized the building and erection of the monument and the stone was cut in Concord, New Hampshire. On three sides there are inscriptions carved into the stone including the names of the fallen.<br /> <br /> The monument was transported by train to Dillon, Montana and brought the rest of the way to the battlefield in a wagon pulled by oxen. A detachment of soldiers under the supervision of First Lieutenant J.P. Thompson of the Third US Infantry Regiment out of Missoula, Montana would put the monument in place.<br /> <br /> In the ensuing years the monument would see vandalism from souvenir and relic seekers and in 1909 a wrought iron steel fence was placed around it to protect it. In 1967 the fence was taken down and the monument still stands in the Siege Area.",

            "bodyText": "Colonel John Gibbon the post commander of Fort Shaw in 1877 was ordered to pursue the non-treaty Nez Perce during the Flight of 1877. He chose to bring a “mountain howitzer” along on this campaign, but because the 7th U.S. Infantry assigned to him was not an artillery unit, a raw crew of six enlisted men was assembled to travel with the howitzer. This crew was composed of Sergeant Fredrick, Sergeant Daly, Corporal Sale, Privates McGregor, Goale, and Bennett. Traveling with the crew were two civilians, William Woodcock, a black manservant leading a pack mule and Joseph Blodgett, a guide.<br /> <br /> <br /> Colonel Gibbon’s report of the campaign states; “…The howitzer could not accompany the column in consequence of the quantity of fallen timber obstructing the trail and the noise which would have been made in removing it. Orders were therefore given that at early daylight it should start out after us with a pack mule loaded with 2,000 rounds of extra [rifle] ammunition.”<br /> <br /> <br /> The howitzer and crew arrived on the steep hillside south of the Nez Perce camp late morning of August 9, 1877 and fired two ineffective rounds at the encampment 1,200 yards away. Taking advantage of the inexperienced crew, a group of warriors, among them pıyopıyó·t̉alıkt and hotó·to, overran them. In the ensuing struggle, Private Bennett was trapped beneath the mule he was holding, both sergeants were wounded, and Corporal Sale was killed. At the first sign of trouble, Privates Goale and McGregor ran. All surviving members of the party were able to escape.<br /> <br /> <br /> Mountain Howitzer No. 111 was captured by the Nez Perce along with the rifle ammunition and mules. The warriors disassembled the carriage, rolling the wheels down the hillside, “burying” the bronze tube and scattering the contents of the limber. To this day the Nez Perce sing of the bravery of their men in a song called “The Duck and Dive”.<br />   <br /> <br /> After the arrival of General Oliver O. Howard on August 11, soldiers recovered the howitzer and took it with the wounded soldiers and civilians to Deer Lodge, Montana, 80 miles away where the territorial prison is located. The prison infirmary, staffed by a doctor and nurses, tended to the wounded. When the command departed Deer Lodge, they left the howitzer behind and in an unsigned letter from prison files it states the howitzer was a gift to the penitentiary. The howitzer sat in the courtyard of the prison for 31 more years before it was returned to Big Hole Battlefield<br />  ",

Therefore, a suitable construction date for the extant ruins, according to this evidence, could be circa 1872-1875.</p> <p>Whatever the exact construction date for the John H. Allstadt House, it is clear that Mr. Allstadt and his wife lived out the remainder of their days there. After passing through the family, the house then was used for housing the tenants of the Standard Farm until it was abandoned at an unknown date. In 1986, a fire destroyed the building’s interior and part of its exterior.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Baltimore & Ohio (B & O) railroad bridge was once a majestic wood covered bridge that spanned the Potomac River and carried train traffic on the B & O Railroad for 23 years prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. In 1859, John Brown, a staunch abolitionist, launched a raid across this bridge to capture the United States Armory and start a war to end slavery. Brown failed at his attempt but made a major impact on the Harpers Ferry area. With the secession of Virginia in April, 1861, the bridge became a tenuous connector between the Confederacy and the Union. The bridge was over an important border, the Potomac River, and constantly had to worry about attacks from both sides of the war. During four years of Civil War, the bridge would be built and destroyed nine times - four times by war, five times by floods.<br /> <br /> On June 14, 1861, as the Confederates were leaving Harpers Ferry, Brig. Gen. Joseph Johnston ordered the burning of all bridges on the Potomac under Southern control. The bridges that were destroyed were Point of Rocks, Shepherdstown, and Berlin. The Berlin Bridge is called Brunswick today. The Harpers Ferry region was a dangerous border area for the next eight months, disallowing rebuilding of the bridge. When the Union army occupied Harpers Ferry in February of 1862 and B & O bridge builders accompanied them. A new iron trestle was completed atop the original piers in less than three weeks, which allowed for supplies to be sent to the Union forces in Harpers Ferry and further south.<br /> <br /> The Confederates regained Harpers Ferry on September 15, 1862 but just a few days later they would abandon that post. On September 18, 1862, the bridge was destroyed for a second time by Confederates when they left Harpers Ferry due to the outcome of the Battle of Antietam in Shepherdstown. B & O bridge builders returned with the Union army a few weeks later and had the bridge operational once again by early October.<br /> <br /> The third time the bridge was destroyed was during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863. This time, the retreating Union forces had destroyed the bridge to ensure the Confederates could not use it to support their invasion into the North. Union forces would reoccupy Harpers Ferry during the third week of July of 1863, following the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg. Once the Confederates had retreated, the B & O bridge builders arrived to rebuild the bridge.<br /> <br /> The fourth and final time the bridge was destroyed occurred during the final invasion of the North in July of 1864. Once Confederate Jubal Early's forces withdrew from Maryland by mid-July, the B & O railroad rebuilt the bridge once more. In the fall of 1864, the Union used the bridge to transport an immense amount of supplies across the Potomac and into the armory depot for use by Philip Sheridan's army during its Valley Campaign. The Valley Campaign conquered the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley and the B & O Railroad was the artery of life for Sheridan's army.</p>",

A sidewalk follows the entire edge of the parking area back toward the entrance, where there are two vault restrooms on one side and a picnic table on the other. The trail itself curves through a mostly-level area of cinders, irregularly-shaped volcanic rock, low sagebrush scrub, and small, windswept limber pines. A trailhead sign reads: “Two thousand years ago, nearby volcanoes erupted so violently that they tore themselves apart. Rivers of lava floated huge chunks of crater wall down to this spot. Time passed. Rocks crumbled. The seeds of rabbitbrush and limber pine took root in the sparse soil. A hundred years ago, a visiting minister declared this jumble of rocks, shrubs, and trees to be a garden fit for the devil himself. Welcome to Devil’s Orchard. ‘What you see depends mainly on what you look for.’ –Richard J. Vogl, biologist.”",

            "bodyText": "<p>Known also as the Boston Naval Shipyard and the Boston Navy Yard, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/cny.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a> was a shipyard for the U.S. Navy for 174 years.</p> <p>Long before the United States established the Charlestown Navy Yard, the tidal flats of this area provided seasonal sustenance to local indigenous communities for thousands of years. These communities, whose descendants are the Massachusett, called the land <em>Mishawum</em> or \"Great Springs.\" These flats also became a landing for British infantry transports in the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.</p> <p>In 1800, the U.S. Navy established the Charlestown Navy Yard as one of the nation's first six navy yards. Over time, the Navy Yard grew to cover nearly 130 acres with over a hundred buildings, three dry docks, numerous piers, its own railway, and more. In 1974, the federal government closed the Navy Yard and set aside 30 acres of it as a national historic site; the remaining acreage became privately owned.</p> <p>Thousands of workers in the Charlestown Navy Yard built over 200 ships and repaired thousands more over its 174-year history. Dry Dock 1 helped make this work possible. Built in 1833, and one of the first in the country, it provided a dry area to build and repair ships. The building that now houses the <a href=\"https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/\">USS Constitution Museum</a> once contained huge steam-powered pumps that moved seawater in and out of the granite Dry Dock. Today, workers still use Dry Dock 1 to repair the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-cassin-young.htm\">USS <em>Cassin Young</em></a>.</p> <p>Two other outstanding features of the Charlestown Navy Yard are the Ropewalk and the Chain Forge buildings. Workers in the Ropewalk made all the rope needed by the U.S. Navy; they could make fiber or metal rope the length of the Ropewalk, or about four football fields long. Ironworkers in the Chain Forge made links of anchor chain for ships, using a unique process called Die-Lock. This process made links used for anchor chains incredibly strong. The Ropewalk and the Chain Forge buildings are repurposed now and privately owned.</p> <p>The most productive years of the Charlestown Navy Yard were during war time, particularly World War II. Over half the ships workers ever built in the yard were built during this war when the Yard had over 50,000 employees. During this time of crisis, the Navy Yard opened its doors to women and people of color. For the first time, the opportunity to make livable wages was available to thousands of people. While these workers provided critical labor and many excelled in their positions, some experienced racism, sexual harassment, and discrimination. It was the job of the U.S. Naval officers who ran the Yard to resolve these problems as well as issues involving wages, working hours, conditions, and apprenticeship programs.</p> <p>The Navy Yard was like any other industrial plant and it had a mostly civilian workforce. To these workers, the Yard was a workplace that they commuted to, but for Naval personnel, the Yard was the source of their everyday needs such as food, shelter, medical care, recreation and more.</p> <p>The residential areas of the Navy Yard include some of the oldest structures in the Yard. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/officers-quarters-cny.htm\">Officers' Quarters</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/commandants-house.htm\">Commandant's House</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/marine-barracks-cny.htm\">Marine Barracks</a> seem untouched by time. These buildings now provide housing and office space for National Park Service employees.</p> <p>The USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, part of the National Parks of Boston since 1980, brings back memories of World War II and the Cold War to the Charlestown Navy Yard. Although workers in the Charlestown Navy Yard made destroyers, they did not build the <em>Cassin Young</em>. However, these workers developed sonar technology which was installed in the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> during the Cold War.</p> <p>In 1934, the U.S. Navy made the Charlestown Navy Yard the permanent home for the USS <em>Constitution</em>. This 54-gun frigate has long been associated with the Navy Yard; Edmund Hartt built the USS <em>Constitution</em> nearby in 1797. The USS Constitution Museum has been a partner to the ship since 1972.</p> <p>Many U.S. Navy ships and Naval personnel have left the Yard to protect and supply U.S. interests around the globe. From the Charlestown Navy Yard, the USS <em>Jamestown</em> delivered food to the people of Ireland during the Great Famine in 1847 and Admiral Richard Byrd's Antarctica scientific expedition sailed from the Yard in 1933.</p> <p>Many sitting U.S. Presidents and Secretaries of the Navy have visited the Charlestown Navy Yard including one person who held both positions over his long public career, Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p> <p>From the age of sail to the age of steel, tens of thousands of civilian workers and U.S. Naval personnel in the Charlestown Navy Yard kept the Navy supplied with ships and equipment for 174 years. By preserving a portion of the Charlestown Navy Yard, the National Park Service memorializes their contributions.

            "audioDescription": "The Charlestown Navy Yard occupies about 130 acres of waterfront land on the Charlestown side of the Charles River as it opens up to Boston Harbor. Its borders extend to Chelsea Street. Most visitors enter from the southwest at Constitution Road, which leads them to the original main entrance of the Yard, Gate 1. Gate 1 has a one-story mid-century style unoccupied guardhouse. Continuing down the street brings visitors to the main campus of the Navy Yard, which is mostly asphalt with some green space to the north. To the immediate right is the entrance to the Visitor Center, which is a long brick building. Visitors must go through a security hut next to the Visitor Center to access the USS CONSTITUTION (behind it). The Visitor Center contains bathrooms, a small theater for films and events, a gift shop, and some exhibit space about the Navy Yard. Most of the rest of the campus is asphalt with numerous brick and stone buildings, most notably the USS Constitution Museum (stone building directly facing the Visitor's Center) and the Commandant's House (brick building on the north side of campus close to Chelsea Street). There are at least six piers as well as two dry docks. Continuing past the security entrance to the Visitor's Center is Pier 1, which has the USS CASSIN YOUNG, a fletcher-class destroyer, docked there. In between Pier 1 and Pier 2 is dry dock 1. Behind the USS Constitution Museum is Pier 3 and Pier 4, separated by dry dock 2, which is currently filled. The water shuttle runs from Pier 4. The red Freedom Trail enters and exits through First Avenue from Constitution Road and leads to the entrance to the Visitor's Center, the USS CONSTITUTION, and the USS Constitution Museum.",

Continue past Lost Arrow Spire on the Bumblie Trail, then join South Fork Circle Creek Trail heading back up to complete the loop.

            "bodyText": "<p>Following the Civil War there were over 30,000 newly freed slaves in the Shenandoah Valley. Recognizing the need for education, the Freedmen’s Bureau, the Freewill Baptists of New England and John Storer came together and Storer College was born. The school survived for 88 years, enriching the lives of hundreds of students.<br /> <br /> Of the four million people freed by the 13th Amendment at the end of the Civil War, most wanted two things—find family members and get an education. A small school in Harpers Ferry soon became a shining example of educational outreach and accomplishment. What began as a one-room missionary school for former slaves grew into a college open to both sexes and all races. <br /> <br /> The driving force behind the mission school was Nathan Brackett. With his wife and four teachers, all possessed with boundless energy and missionary zeal, and Lockwood House as a base of operations, Brackett set up primary schools throughout the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. By 1867 Brackett supervised 16 teachers and schools for 2,500 students in the Shenandoah Valley.</p> <p>The mission grew despite some stiff local resistance. White people tried everything from mob violence to vandalism and slanderous newspaper articles to pulling political strings to shut down the schools. One teacher wrote, “It is unusual for me to go to the post office without being hooted at and twice I have been stoned on the streets at noonday.” Nothing seemed to stop the teachers and their students from going forward. Fifty years later Nathan Brackett’s daughter, also a teacher, said, “Though storms of misunderstanding might rage outside the gate, within the campus all was calm and quiet. It was a little heaven.”</p>   <h4>A New Beginning</h4> <p>The Freewill Baptist mission school in Harpers Ferry came to the attention of John Storer, a wealthy businessman in Maine. Storer offered a $10,000 matching grant to the Freewill Baptists. An intense effort to raise donations, mortgage assets and seek government funds added up to $10,000 the day before Storer’s offer expired. <br /> <br /> Storer College created a safe place for education in a world where none had existed before. It was a place to learn to read and write, to teach others, and to develop marketable skills. By 1869 the college expanded across Camp Hill in Harpers Ferry and added three more government buildings. Fundraising slowly resulted in more campus buildings as enrollment grew and African American teachers and ministers joined the faculty. <br /> <br /> Of all the benefits that Storer provided to its students, perhaps the most valuable was a sense of community. The college owned land in and around the town and profited from a summer boarding house business. By leveraging funds and selling surplus property to graduates and their families, Storer College enabled 75% of Harpers Ferry’s black citizens to own real estate. In 1892 the school newspaper declared, “When the time comes that the colored people of the South live in their own houses, cultivate their own farms, and read their own ballots, there will no longer be a race problem.” Another valuable sense of community extended far beyond physical property. As one former student put it, “Here you will gain new understanding of community living and of friendships.”<br /> <br /> Students’ children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren found a haven of hope in the dark days of segregation. Graduates left Storer with the education, training, and perhaps most importantly, a sense of self-worth to make their way in an unsympathetic society.</p> <h4>The End</h4> <p>In 1954, the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board decision ended segregation in public schools. The next year West Virginia’s Board of Education recommended ending the $20,000 annual stipend for Storer. The board preferred to support state sponsored schools that were centrally located with modern buildings and more students, and without debt and religious overtones. Finally, Storer College closed its doors in 1955. The school had provided an education to more than 7,000 students.<br /> <br /> It’s hard to convey the immense effort it took to open, grow and sustain Storer College for nearly 90 years. Storer is a heroic story of overcoming seemingly insurmountable problems, and it is a testament to the courage, faith, vision and hard work of its founders, administrators, students, alumni and supporters.</p> <h4>The Legacy of Storer College</h4> <p>A very small school started in 1865 with a straightforward mission: to provide an education to former slaves. For 25 years Storer College was the only school in West Virginia where any person of color could get an education beyond the primary level. In a quiet though important way, Storer symbolized something seldom seen today; the epitome of selflessness and a willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of mankind. The students and staff embodied the Storer College motto:<br /> <i></i></p> <p><i>Labor Omnia Vincit</i><br /> (Work Conquers All)</p>",

A planning effort is underway to determine the future of the site. For more information, call the Falls of the Ohio Visitor Center at (812) 280-9970. </strong><br /> <br /> The George Rogers Clark Home Site is a 7-acre tract of land that makes up part of the Falls of the Ohio State Park. George Rogers Clark, a revolutionary war general, the town’s founder, and William Clark’s older brother, built his home here in 1803 as a place to spend his retirement years. He stayed here until 1809, at which time he suffered a serious burn that resulted in the amputation of his leg. As a result of the injury, he was forced to move in with his sister at her farm outside of Louisville, Kentucky. </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{103}\" paraid=\"23007673\">Although his younger brother, William, would go down in history as part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, George was a noted hero of the American Revolution in his own right. He was a skilled surveyor and used those skills to take the fort at Kaskaskia, Illinois, as well as Prairie du Roche and Cahokia. He also convinced several Indian tribes to stop allying with the British.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{119}\" paraid=\"793605974\">Clark’s home served as an important stopping point for those traveling along the Ohio River. On October 15, 1803, Meriwether Lewis stopped here to meet with William Clark. Together, the two recruited nine men, thus forming the Corps of Discovery that departed from this location on October 26, 1803. </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{141}\" paraid=\"252058547\">Today, a replica of George’s cabin sits on the site of the original, which was destroyed in 1854. Situated atop the lower end of a 24-foot limestone drop, the home commands beautiful scenic views of the river and the falls.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{171}\" paraid=\"197801599\">Directly behind it is a replica of the McGee Cabin. This structure isn’t in its original location, as the McGees lived in Guinea Bottoms, one of the first freed African-American communities in the Northwest Territory. It was erected here to tell the story of Venus and Ben McGee, who were George Clark’s indentured servants.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{203}\" paraid=\"343181420\">Visitors can tour the home site daily from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. The cabin itself is open seasonally on weekends. For more information, call the Falls of the Ohio Visitor Center at (812) 280-9970 or visit the website at <a href=\"https://www.fallsoftheohio.org/portfolio/outdoor-activities/george-rogers-clark-home-site/\">https://www.fallsoftheohio.org/portfolio/outdoor-activities/george-rogers-clark-home-site/</a>. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<b>Note: Be aware that the ruins are too dangerous to enter and should be observed at a safe distance while remaining on the trail.</b><br /> <br /> The ruins along Beaver Creek offer a glimpse into the storied history of the Brandywine Valley. With the establishment of Pennsylvania as a British colony under the proprietorship of William Penn in the late 1600s, English, Welsh, and Irish Quakers began to settle in the Brandywine Valley in large numbers. While the area had been home to groups of the Lenni-Lenape people for thousands of years, and had seen small scale settlement by earlier waves of European colonizers, primarily Swedes and Finns, these newcomers had the largest impact, shaping the landscape into the Valley we see today. While most of the farms, mills, and other buildings that these settlers built from the late 1600’s-mid 1800’s are lost to history, some examples remain, including the ruins of a house, a mill race, and the foundation of a saw mill along the northern bank of Beaver creek. The ruins of a two-story house, built in the late 1700s by the Green family, are the most prominent.<br /> <br /> The Green family were typical of these largely Quaker settlers, building up a combined farming and milling operation through the 1700s and early 1800s. Beaver Creek provided the power source for the saw mill, the foundations of which are visible in colder months when vegetation dies back. The water of the creek was channeled through a mill race, the remains of which can be seen to the south from the trail. There are also the remains of several small dams along Beaver Creek, which when active kept water pooled up in mill ponds, ensuring a steady flow to power the mills. By the mid-1800’s, due to rapidly advancing technological breakthroughs, the once cutting-edge mills that had lined Beaver Creek were outdated and entered into a steep decline. Many were torn down or left to rot, leaving us with only a few physical reminders that the Industrial Revolution in the United States had begun in places like the Brandywine Valley.",
            "audioDescription": "NOTE: The ruins along Beaver Creek are extremely unstable and dangerous. Appreciate them from a safe distance by remaining on the trail. The trail along Beaver Creek from the junction nearest the parking lot is wooded on both sides, and in the summer is dense with vegetation. The trail itself is rocky and uneven in places. Approximately 700 feet down the trail you will see the remains of the mill race to your left, parallel to the trail, with Beaver Creek on the other side. Continuing down the trail there are stone foundations and remnants of a wall to the right of the trail, though these can be hard to spot when covered by green plants in warmer months. The house that was built by the Green family in the late 1700s will now be visible on your right. The remains of the structure compose outer walls, approximately 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep. To the top of the remnants of the chimney is approximately 40 feet. The remaining stone walls are mortared loosely. There are spaces that were once windows on all sides, and there are two visible fireplaces left in the chimney. The 2nd floor is gone completely, and there are stone debris scattered inside the footprint of the ruins, as well as on the ground outside. Approximately 50 feet further down the trail, on the left, are the remnants of a 3rd structure, possibly the mill itself. These consist of a low stone wall and foundation, which are also easy to miss when the vegetation is thick. It is made from the same grey stone as the house, and has dimensions that have not been properly measured.",

Mica, kaolin, and feldspar were all mined at various locations, with the product then shipped out to ceramic factories in Philadelphia and Wilmington. Feldspar and kaolin were used in the production of porcelain glazes, while mica was used as an insulation agent in the ceramic production process, as well as later on in the production of spark plugs. Usually all three minerals would be mined side by side or within successive waves at the same site. <br /> <br /> This pit in particular was active from approximately 1850-1910. You can still see large amounts of mica flakes spread around the ground surrounding the pit and the remaining spoil piles. It was the production of mica and other minerals from this pit and others like it that served to elevate the Brandywine Valley into one of the first centers of the American industrial revolution. Combined with the mills of various types that dotted the banks of the Brandywine River, this area of northern Delaware was able to position itself as a major producer of both raw materials and finished products.",
            "audioDescription": "The mica mining pit area is located down a short trail in a heavily wooded area north of Ramsey Road, at the top of a steeply rising hill in the Brandywine Valley. The ground around the pit, out for some distance, is covered in mica flakes, which look like glassy plastic. There are trails surrounding the pit, and it is not unusual to see hikers and bikers using the area. The trees surrounding the pit are mostly tulip poplar and American beech, and the vegetation is very lush and green in the warmer months. The remains of the pit are roughly triangular, with sides measuring approximately 40-50 feet. It is approximately 10 feet deep, with one lip of the pit lower than the other two. There are still remnants of spoil piles visible surrounding the pit. The soil is somewhat sandy and loose when dry.",

As the years passed, English colonists (primarily Quakers) would begin to settle throughout the area. The Quakers took advantage of the fast-moving creeks by building mills that produced wool, paper, and other goods to generate a profit. They also cultivated agricultural fields to support their small village and ship goods up to far destinations. While the mills are no longer visible, you can still see a variety of agricultural fields that have existed for centuries and continue to provide food for the Delaware Valley.   </p> <p data-ogsc=\"black\">As you explore more of the Brandywine Valley we ask that you explore safely and practice Leave No Trace principles so this beautiful cultural landscape can remain intact for future generations to enjoy.

The walls, both interior and exterior, are made of wooden slats to aid in the air flow. <br /> <br /> To deter rats, field mice, and other animals from accessing the corn, the Corn Crib is raised above ground on brick columns that are strategically placed to support the frame. In addition, its elevated height prevents corn from drawing any moisture found in the soil. <br /> <br /> The interior of this Corn Crib has a central passage. This could serve as a workspace, such as for shelling corn. The passage also provided extra air flow for the two narrow chambers at each end of the Corn Crib. <br /> <br /> It is very important that each chamber is small. Corn that is buried too deep is susceptible to rot if there is not enough air flow for it to dry.",

Many of the tobacco barns used throughout the area still stand today, evidence of their importance to the area's economy. Most of these barns have been repurposed as houses and outbuildings. <br /> <br /> Most tobacco barns, like the one at Thomas Stone National Historic Site, were large, wide sheds with sloped and shingled roofs. The sides were made of alternating rows of boards or logs that had open slits, allowing air to circulate through the building. A series of beams in the barn's ceiling allowed the tobacco plants to hang upside down from sticks to dry and to \"cure\" or preserve the tobacco. <br /> <br /> Tobacco farmers in the Chesapeake region would have been forced to light fires in the tobacco barns for the curing process if it were a particularly rainy autumn. Though the heat of the flames assisted in the drying process, it could be dangerous. Thomas Jefferson once noted that \"...great care is necessary as it [the tobacco] is very flammable, and it takes fire, the whole, with the house [tobacco barn], consumes as quickly as straw would.\"<br /> <br /> The trick to curing in a tobacco barn was to produce a tobacco leaf neither too dry nor too moist. Excess moisture might cause the tobacco to rot during the shipment across the Atlantic. Leaves that were too dry became brittle and disintegrated before reaching Europe.<br /> <br /> Tobacco barns stand today as a tangible reminder that while the crop could bring great wealth to its planters, it could also cause financial ruin if the crop did not survive its transport across the ocean. ",

The trailhead is across the street and marked by a brown sign with an icon of a hiker inside a white square outline.<br /><br />Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, this is snow country, where plants and wildlife must cope with a high-mountain climate that brings winter snow that can remain until June. Here, the summers are short, cool, and moist. Only specialized species can survive. The red fir is one such hardy tree that can handle snowloads that exceed 30 feet. This tree grows in pure stands in the upper montane zone. <br /><br />Illustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road.

From the bottom to top of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). <br /><br />Caption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, The plants and animals of the habitat around you are uniquely connected. Interdependence is the only way to suvive within this extreme environment. One important interrelationship involves fungus, flying squirrels, and owls. Root fungi absorb food from trees, while simultaneously improving the roots' water and nutrient absorption. Truffle-like mushrooms growing from this fungus provide a food source for flying squirrels. In turn, owls prey upon the flying squirrel. In this circle of dependency, one missing link might threaten the survival of all.<br /><br />Illustration: A tree above ground and its roots below ground are a part of the main focal point of this illustration. A squirrel digs into the soil and reaches an oval-shaped object that is growing on the tree's roots underground. An owl is hovering in the background.",

            "audioDescription": "The small, paved, parking area for Mono Pass Trailhead is located along the south side of Tioga Road. It is marked by a brown metal sign that has a white icon and text. The sign reads, 'Mono Pass,' and has an icon of a backpacker and an arrow that pointing to the right.In the parking area, there are two green recycle bins, two brown trash bins, a row of food lockers, and a small, brown facility, which holds a vault toilet. Two small signs that read, 'no camping,' and 'no dogs,' line the curb, near the trailhead. A wooden fence separates the parking area from the wilderness area.Six signs line the dirt path at the Mono Pass Trailhead. The first sign is a wayside exhibit titled Yosemite Ghost Mines, and has a faded black and white photo of a log structure, too shabby and small to be a cabin, but very cabin-like. Text reads, as early as 1860, prospectors explored Mono Pass in search of rich rock. Here, among the glacially carved granite and craggy peaks of the Sierra crest, these hardy men discovered silver deposits and went to work in hopes of fortune.Buildings of the Past - five log cabins mark the location of the Golden Crown and Ella Bloss miners near Mono Pass. This windswept site was established in 1879 during the Tioga silver boom that also produced Bennettville and the Great Sierra Mine near Tioga Pass. Significant wealth was predicted, but around 1890, the mines were abandoned.A Past Preserved - The cabins are increasingly fragile reminders of mining on the Sierra crest. Please help preserve these valuable historic resources by not using them as campsites or fire shelters. It is illegal to damage, deface, or remove archaeological objects or features from federal land. The second sign is separated into five sections. Two small square panels on top, a large map in the middle, and two small square panels on bottom. The Top left panel is maroon with white text and reads, Mono Pass Trailhead, follow the path of Yosemite's first people, the Miwok, over their trade route to the east.Mono Pass is 3.7 miles and Parker Pass is 5.2 miles. The entire watershed of the Dana Fork of the Tuolumne is closed to overnight camping to protect water quality.The top right panel is blue with white text and reads, Wilderness Regulations, the natural integrity of Yosemite's high country depends on you. Help protect the wilderness, and avoid a citation, by following these regulations.Camp at least four trail miles from all developed areas.Pets, firearms, and bicycles are prohibited in wilderness.Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks kills vegetation and causes erosion. Maximum group size for cross-country travel is eight people.Avoid disturbing wildlife and other visitors by keeping quiet on the trail and in camp.Use a gas stove for cooking; wood fires are allowed only below 9,600 feet in existing fire rings using dead and downed wood.Leave campsites as you find them; do not build windbreaks, fire rings, hitch racks, chairs, drainage trenches, or other \"improvements.\"Pack out everything you carry in; do not burn trash.Wilderness permit required for all overnight use.A series of three white circles containing three different icons are outlined in red and have a red diagonal line slashing through the middle. The three icons are of a gun, a dog, and a person on a bicycle.The large middle panel is a detailed map of the eastern portion of the park. Roads, trails, peaks, and lakes are labeled. For more information about Yosemite maps, please call 209/379-1035.The bottom left panel is blue with white text and reads, Water Quality - clean, sparkling water is one of the joys of the high country. Wildlife, wilderness visitors, and people downstream all need clean water to stay healthy.Protect your water suppy by following these regulations and suggestions:Camp at least 100 feet (40 steps) from water.Deposit human waste in a six-inch-deep hole at least 100 feet from water; carry out toilet paper.Wash dishes and yourself at least 100 feet from water; even biodegradable soap pollutes.Carry a large water container and limit your trips to collect water; eroded stream banks and lake shores contribute to poor water quality.Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks increases erosion and leads to silt-filled streams.Giardia lamblia is a disease-causing protozoan that can be present in all Sierran water; treat all water before drinking. The bottom right panel is yellow with black text and reads, Black Bears - the health and well-being of Yosemite's bears depends on you.Bears are intelligent, curious, adaptable, and hungry. Human food, however, is harmful to bears and other animals here. Keep wildlife wild by using these food storage methods.At the trailhead: Remove all food, ice chests, and scented items from your car. Store them in food storage lockers where available. Never feed bears or other wildlife.In the backcountry: Store food, garbage, and scented items in bearproof canisters, available at front country locations. Keep items s",

            "audioDescription": "A roadside turnout with limited parking on the north side of Tioga Road hosts views of a large open meadow and surrounding peaks and domes. A trail to the west of the parking area leads around the outskirts of the meadow, to Pothole Dome, a smooth granite dome that would allow for a slightly higher panoramic view. In the distance, a forest lines the perimeter of the meadow and pointed peaks rise above the tree line. Several signs are posted at the parking area and the start of the path. The first sign in the parking area is a brown sign, outlined in white, and has white text that reads, no camping or overnight parking.The second sign is a small, white, metal sign on a wooden post located on the meadow side of long, large, logs used as barriers to separate the dirt parking from the meadow. A photo on the upper right side of the sign shows several bright, tall, wildflowers in a lush green meadow with a snow covered peak rising above the pine treeline in the distance. The sign reads, meadow restoration in progress. Trails that pass through sensitive habitats, such as Tuolumne Meadows, can have an impact that reaches far beyond the trail. We are currently working to restore this area. Please stay on the main trail shown in blue on the map. Please stay on designated trail.Photo: Two people walk off-trail through a large meadow. In the distance, mountain peaks rise above a dense forest. Map: In a square frame, the Tioga Road is indicated by a blue and white tick line that leads from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner. Above that line, sandwiched between the road and a large white area that indicates the granite of Pothole dome is a meadow, a wetland area represented by an upward-turned, banana shape filled with blue marks. A yellow star and text that reads, \"you are here,\" along with an icon of a hiker inside a red square, which is a trailhead, are along the Tioga Road, one quarter of the way from the top. A blue solid line, which is the Pothole Dome Trail, makes its way around the left side of the banana-shaped wetland area then leads to the right, all the way to the right side of the frame. A red, solid line cuts through the meadow from Tioga Road to Pothole Dome and forks out into two paths, they are marked closed.A wayside exhibit titled Sub-Alpine Zone, is located on the parking side of long, large, logs used as barriers to separate the meadow from the dirt parking area. Text on the left side of the panel reads, the plants and animals in this zone sometimes have only two and a half months to complete a year's work. At this elevation, the snow can be on the ground well into June, only to return as early as September. Bevause this sub-alpine meadow ecosystem is so fragile, even one person crossing it can cause serious damage - especially if it is wet. By following the trail to your left on your hike to Pothole Dome, you can protect plants and animals during their active season.Illustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of both labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.'

On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). Caption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. At the start of the Pothole Dome Trail, a brown sign outlined in white has white text that reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible.

            "audioDescription": "This paved roadside turnout is on the west side of Tioga Road and has five wayside exhibits. The area is surrounded by different pine and fir trees and has an open view looking westward.\\n\\nThe first wayside exhibit is titled, Cones and Needles. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, Because of its wide range of elevations, Yosemite encompasses several life zones determined by elevation, moisture, temperature, and exposure to storms. Sometimes, conditions vary significantly within a zone and allow for a micro-climate, a place where the climate contrasts with that of the entire zone. You are in one such micro-climate. Around you, trees that typically grow at higher or lower elevations live in close proximity. Stroll around this area and discover stories of four common Yosemite trees, their relationships with wildlife, and struggles to survive. \\n\\nIllustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of the first two labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). \\n\\nCaption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. \\n\\nText on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, cache crop - ever forget where you left your keys? Chipmunks, ground squirrels, and many birds have the same problem. They bury small caches of seeds here and there, and then forget where they put many of these food caches. Consequently, forgetful birds and animals planted many of the trees nearby. \\n\\nA series of four photos show different types of trees. \\n\\nPhoto one is a Red Fir forest, shown with their long branches drooping from the weight of snow that covers them. The trees are tall with pointed tips and reddish bark. \\n\\nPhoto two is a single Lodgepole Pine, which has a conical shape that tapers, and grey bark. \\n\\nPhoto three is a single Jeffrey Pine, which has several large branches shooting off a rather bare trunk. Smaller secondary pine branches shoot off the large primary branches. There is no conical shape to this tree, it is randomly fanned out in all directions. \\n\\nPhoto four is a single Western White Pine, which is a tall, very narrow, slender conical shape, with branches that are arranged in neatly layered horizontal tiers.\\n\\nThe second wayside exhibit is titled, Red Fir, abies magnifica, and has a close-up photo of Red Fir bark on the entire left, one-fifth side of the panel. The bark is reddis-brown and has deep striations. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, the red fir is a spectacular tree, impressive for its height and girth. It can sometimes rise above 200 feet tall, and be nearly 10 feet in diameter. The bark of mature trees is deeply furrowed with a distinctive reddish hue. \\n\\nIllustration: A brown pine branch shows green needles that are rounded off at the ends, growing directly out of the branch. A rounded pine cone, which has layers upon layers that closely overlap each other, appears to be closed and smooth. Cone size is 9 inches (23 cm).\\n\\nCaption: Tree ID hint - How can you tell a fir from a pine? Think \"F\" for friendly fir. The needles of a fir are soft, and they grow from the branch instead of in bunches. \\n\\nWhen Lightning Strikes - Lightning often hits the tallest of these red firs, leaving snag-topped crowns. These damaged areas provide fertile foraging areas for woodpeckers and sapsuckers looking for grubs. The snags also provide homes for nesting owls and squirrels. \\n\\nIllustration: A speckled owl with horn-like pointy ears sits on a snaggled tree trunk that seems to have snapped apart.\\n\\nThe third wayside exhibit is titled, Western White Pine, pinus monticola, and has a close-up photo of Western White Pine bark on the entire left, one-fifth side of the panel. The bark is brown and looks like square plates or bricks that are stacked vertically. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, look beyond the red fir log in front of you. The tree with square-like plates on its bark is the Western White Pine. Their trunks are usually straight, and typically their branches are arranged in neatly layered horizontal tiers. They cannot tolerate deep shade and generally grow in open spaces where they can soak up the rays of the sun. The Western White Pine is a hardy tree, thriving under conditions produced by ground fires that create the ide",

            "audioDescription": "A small, paved, roadside turnout on the south side of Tioga Road has an open view of the area's iconic peaks through meadows with flowing streams. There are also two wayside exhibits and three portable restrooms, one of which is designated accessible. \\n\\nOn the west side of the driveway, an open meadow that has large boulders scattered about, transitions into a dense pine forest. A wayside exhibit titled, Disappearing Meadow, sits at the edge of the meadow and paved driveway. Text on the left side of the panel reads, as recently as the 1960s, this area was an open wet meadow that dominated the foreground in this view of the Cathedral Range Mountains. However, the meadows are beginning to dry up, providing better conditions for trees to grow. Current science is documenting the increase in Earth's temperature which is advantageous for trees due to longer, warmer growing seasons. While scientists are still investigating other possible reasons for the changes you see, climate change is likely a primary factor. \\n\\nPhoto: An open meadow has small saplings growing throughout it. In the distance, mountain peaks rise above a line of mature, tall trees. \\n\\nCaption: 1963 view of Cathedral Range from this meadow. \\n\\nPhoto: A small grassy area has a dense stand of pine trees.\\n\\nCaption: In 2009, young trees dominate the same view. \\n\\nBlack and white photo: a man, dressed in a long sleeved shirt, long pants, and cap, stands among hundreds of sheep bunched together in a meadow, with tall trees surrounding the open pasture.\\n\\nCaption: In the late 1800s, cattle ranchers and sheep herders drove their herds into these lush grassy meadows to graze. Human occupation and use increased to accommodate the silver mines established in the Tioga area during the 1870s. These human impacts to vegetation and hydrology may accentuate the effects of climate change. \\n\\nOn the east side of the driveway, a stream snakes through an open meadow that also transitions into a dense forest. A reddish peak rises on the left while a grey, granite peak rises to the right. A wooden sign by the stream reads, domestic water supply - do not contaminate. A wayside exhibit is also stationed here titled, The Core of Volcanoes. Text on the left side of the panel reads, rising before you are two of the highest peaks in Yosemite, Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs. Their reddish-brown color hints at a different origin than the white granites of the other mountains in the park. The metamorphic rocks forming the summit areas of Mounts Dana and Gibbs are the exposed core of an ancient volcanic mountain range that once graced the Pacific coast. Once miles beneath tall volcanoes, they were slowly revealed as erosion stripped away the overlying rocks. \\n\\nPhoto: Two peaks rise above a treeline. The silhouette of the two mountain peaks that are labeled Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, is outlined with a red dotted line.\\n\\nIllustration: The cross-section illustration of the inner and outer workings of a volcano are shown, below and above ground. In the ground, a layer of reddish-orange, oval-like chambers of magma lay horizontally, overlapping and connecting to each other. Thick vein-like paths of magma extend upward through a layer of earth, connecting with the layer of oval chambers above. A small portion of the upper part of the reddish-orange oval chambers is white and is labeled Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, and is noted as crystallizing granite. Above the chambers is a brown area, labeled as metamorphic rock, that slopes up into a peak. A red, thin, vein-like line leads from the magma chambers to the peak and exits as a plume of smoke. Other peaks are in the background.\\n\\nCaption: Magma, or lava, that erupted at the surface created the reddish-brown metamorphic rock of the volcanoes core. Magma that cooled deep beneath the surface crystalized and formed the white granite of the other peaks and domes you see here. \\n",

Major fracture zones dictate where water flows and thus where trees and plants grow. Water in the cracks decomposes the rock and forms soil, creating the conditions for life to grow in this harsh environment. \\n\\nTwo photos: One photo shows a large mature tree growing out of a granite slab. The second photo shows a one-foot tall sapling growing out of a granite fracture.\\n\\nCaption: Only the hardiest vegetation is able to grow in this rocky terrain.

Along the Tioga Road, about three-quarters of the way to the right, a red dot indicates, \"you are here.\" The rest of the square is covered with tree canopies, that look like splotchy dark spots, and a web of lines that crisscross each other. A heavy diagonal line that extends downward and slightly to the left from the red dot is labeled Yosemite Creek. \\n\\nCaption: This aerial view of the Yosemite Creek drainage shows that the granite is fractured into a network of cracks, or joints, trending in relatively straight lines. These joints result from tectonic stresses associated with uplift of the Sierra Nevada. Linear joints such as these dictate where the major streams flow, and also control the general shape of the landscape. \\n",

A wayside exhibit titled, Glacial Moraine, is near the turnout area. \\n\\nText on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, The hill in front of you is a clue to how nature shaped Yosemite's mountains and canyons. Look over your left shoulder, where the road cuts through the hill. Unlike water-deposited debris, which is layered and sorted by size, this hill is made up of a jumbled mix of sand, gravel, and boulders. Geologists call this deposit a glacial moraine. Material eroded and transported by the Snow Creek Glacier was left here as the glacier receded. Imagine the power it took to move this much earth. \\n\\nPhoto: A hill along a roadside is covered with many different-sized granite boulders. A red dotted line outlines the entire hill. Many trees grow out from the top of the hill. \\n\\nCaption: Where the road cuts through the moraine, you can see the debris left behind by the glacier. \\n\\nIllustration: An ice-covered mountainous terrain is shown in a square frame. A few of the peaks popping up over the icefield are Mount Conness in the upper left corner, Mount Dana in the upper right corner, Mount Hoffman, which is midway down and left of center, and Cathedral Peak, which is one-third of the way down and right of center. The majority of the terrain is white, representing the Tuolumne Ice Field, which travels downward and splits into the Tenaya Glacier on the right and the Snow Creek Glacier on the left. Just to the left of the Snow Creek Glacier, near the bottom of the illustration, a red dot indicates, 'you are under here,' and a dotted line represents Tioga Road. \\n\\nCaption: Twenty thousand years ago a vast ice sheet covered most of the Tuolumne Meadows area. This ice sheet fed glaciers that flowed east toward Mono Lake, west toward Hetch Hetchy, and southwest toward Yosemite Valley. One of these glaciers, the Snow Creek Glacier, left behind the moraine you see here.",

            "audioDescription": "This paved parking area allows open views of the high country. A large, open meadow surrounds the parking area. A pond reflects the reddish-brown mountains that are Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, which rise up over the treeline to the left. To the right, grey granite peaks rise over the treeline in the distance. Large granite boulders are scattered here and there across the flat, open meadow. In the parking lot, a brown sign with a white outline and text reads, no camping or overnight parking. \\n\\nThe meadow area is roped off from the parking area and two small signs are bolted to knee-height wooden posts. The first sign reads, give plants a chance! Please stay off. An illustration of a foot hovering over small plants is inside a red circle with a diagonal line slashing through its center. The second sign reads, area closed - restoration in progress, Yosemite National Park, and has a silhouette of Half Dome.\\n\\nThree wayside exhibits line the curb of the parking lot. The first wayside exhibit, located to the far right of the parking area, is titled, Alpine Zone, and has a faint background photo of a large, smooth, granite peak. Text on the left side of the panel reads, you are now near the alpine zone, which includes the highest elevations in Yosemite. Look a few hundred feet higher, and you can see that trees cannot grow because the rugged terrain is windy, dry, and intensely sunlit. To survive such harsh conditions, plants here lie flat against the ground or crouch between stones. Special pigments in their leaves filter out harmful rays of sunlight. Some plants grow in little pincushion-like bunches. If they stand too tall the wind will dry them out or tear them apart. Their vibrant blossoms burst forth in an extra effort to attract insects. \\n\\nIllustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the far right of the road is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). \\n\\nCaption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. \\n\\nTwo photos show two different kinds of wild flowers. The first wildflower is called Davidson's penstemon and is light purple. They are growing in a bunch, out of a crack in a granite rock and are short in stature. Their small flowers are a bit long and flute-like, curving outward at the ends. The second photo shows a wildflower called Sky Pilot, which is purple, and has a spherical bulb of multiple flowers that shoot out of an erect stem. They are growing in a bunch in a rocky area. \\n\\nText on the right side of the panel reads, pikas need to get out of the sun periodically to cool down or they risk lethal overheating. These small mammals live in rock piles at high elevations. They gather plants for winter food in nearby areas, frequently returning to the shade of the rocks. As Earth's temperature warms, they will have to spend more time in the rock piles cooling down. If they have to spend too much time cooling down, they won't be able to harvest enough food to survive the winter. \\n\\nPhoto: In the bottom right corner, a small, greyish-brown, furry pika faces left and is leaning forward on a rock. It has black beady eyes, large round ears, and long whiskers. \\n\\nThe second wayside exhibit, located near the middle of the parking area, is titled, High Sierra Stories, and has a faint background photo of a mountain peak that has patches of snow on it. The text reads, these mountains have stories to tell. American Indians have made the journey across the Sierra for thousands of years. Tioga Road existed for decades as a winding, treacherous, single-lane dirt road. Then, in 1961, the National Park Service completed this modern highway which significantly improved visitor access to Tuolumne Meadows and Yosemite Valley. Along this road you will pass countless plants, animals, and evidence of the geologic processes that have shaped the land. \\n\\nIllustration: Four adults and three children walk on a path near gnarled trees, walking toward mountainous terrain. Three of the adults carry large, filled, burden baskets on their back. A child uses a walking stick.\\n\\nCaption: American Indians traveled by foot along this trade route between the east and the west side of the Sierra Nevada. \\n\\nPhoto: A man and two women sit on an open-topped, horse-drawn wagon, on a dirt road that leads",

Panel text reads, Shrinking Reservoir - The Sierra Nevada is California's reservoir - nature's storage tank of water in the form of winter snow and ice. As the snow gradually melts, it releases the stored water into streams and rivers. The depth of the annual snow pack indicates how much water we will have each year for necessities like drinking water and crop irrigation.

Take care on this crossing early in the season when the creek is high. Continue on the trail to Ten Lakes Pass, overlooking the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne and the Sierra Crest. Then descend 693 feet (211 m) into the Ten Lakes Basin, which contains a series of beautiful High Sierra lakes.<br /> <br /> <b>Yosemite Creek Trailhead</b><br /> This is a beautiful path that mostly follows Yosemite Creek to the rim of the Valley and Yosemite Falls. This trail drops about 2.6 miles through lodgepole pine stands before joining the trail from the Yosemite Creek Campground. The trail continues to parallel Yosemite Creek for another 3.3 miles before intersecting with the Yosemite Falls Trail which originates in Yosemite Valley, 3.5 miles below. Follow the signs to the overlook at Yosemite Point, a short distance to the east, for a glimpse of the breathtaking drop into Yosemite Valley and across the High Sierra.

            "audioDescription": "The paved parking area for Yosemite Creek and Ten Lakes Trailhead is on the west side of Tioga Road and has two green recycle bins, two brown trash bins, four brown food lockers, a facility holding two vault toilets, one wayside exhibit and one map. Trees and granite bedrock surround the area. A dirt lot is located across the street, which is also where the trailhead for Ten Lakes is located. The trailhead for Yosemite Creek is at the north end of the parking area, marked by a metal sign that reads Yosemite Creek Trail and has an arrow pointing forward.<br /><br />The wayside exhibit shows a faded, black and white, close-up, background photo of a full waterfall. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, rocks, ice, and water - standing here near Yosemite Creek, one feels only a hint of the power that this busy but unassuming waterway will possess by the time it reaches the floor of Yosemite Valley.<br /><br />The rocky Yosemite Creek watershed, which slopes downhill to the rim of Yosemite Valley about eight miles away, encompasses some fifty square miles of Yosemite's high country. Carved by tributary glaciers about 20,000 years ago, the V-shaped Yosemite Creek drainage was enlarged by the heavy volume of water and `ice which rushed through as the glacier retreated. Today, as spring snow melts, an average of 2,400 gallons per second of icy runoff is funneled through this hanging valley before plunging over the vertical cliff 2,425 feet to Yosemite Valley below. <br /><br />Photo: A river with white water flows toward a precipice. Granite bedrock and trees are along the banks. A rock formation blanketed in snow is at the far end of the river. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Creek plunging over the top of Yosemite Falls.<br /><br />Text on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, Yosemite Creek Trail, for hiking and trail information, please visit a Visitor Center or Information Station. This strenuous 16-mile out-and-back trail drops about 2.6 miles through lodgepole pine stands before joining the trail from the Yosemite Creek Campground. The trial continues to parallel Yosemite Creek for another 3.3 miles below. Follow the signs to the overlook at Yosemite Point, a short distance to the east, for a glimpse of the breathtaking drop into Yosemite Valley and across the High Sierra. Use caution, wet rocks can be slippery. <br /><br />Map: A tall, rectangular map of the surrounding area, shows a horizontal, squiggly, grey line near the top of the map, crossing from left to right, and is labeled Tioga Road. Along the Tioga Road, about three-quarters of the way to the right, a red dot indicates, \"you are here.\" A dotted diagonal line extends downard and slightly to the left from the red dot, representing the Yosemite Creek Trail. Along the trail, Yosemite Creek Campground and the top of Yosemite Falls are labeled. At the bottom of the dotted line is Yosemite Valley. Upper Yosemite Fall and Lower Yosemite Fall are represented by a series of three blue lines stacked on top of one another, each line shorter than the one above it. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. <br /><br />Photo: A black and white aerial photo shows a three tier waterfall coming over a large rock wall. The upper fall is the longest of the three, the middle cascade the shortest. The lower fall is half the height of the upper fall.<br /><br />Caption: V-shaped Yosemite Creek watershed and Yosemite Falls.<br /><br />A map labeled, The Tioga Road, is on a sign board inside a wooden frame. The map shows the entire park with emphasis only on the Tioga Road, which is a red, solid, squiggly line that crosses the map from left to right, midway down the map. Major areas, beginning from the left include Crane Flat, which has icons indicating restrooms, groceries, gas, campground, and two sequioa groves that are in the area. A bit to the right is Tamarack Flat Campground. A quarter of the way across the map is White Wolf, which has icons indicating a campground, dining, and hiking are in that area. About one-third of the way across the map is Yosemite Creek, which has a red dot and text that reads, \"you are here.\" This area is labeled with Hiking, restrooms, and picnic icons. Halfway across the map are Olmsted Point, which has no services, and Tenaya Lake, which has multiple hiking, picnic, and restroom icons in the area. About two-thirds of the way across the map is Tuolumne Meadows, which has icons indicating camping, dining, restrooms, groceries, a wilderness center, and hiking, which includes Cathedral Lakes and Lembert Dome. Near the right side of the map, past Tuolumne Meadows, Mono Pass, a hiking destination, and Tioga Pass, the east entrance and exit to the park, are found along Tioga Road. The road then continues down to the first town outside the park, Lee Vining. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035.",

His children and grandchildren helped work the garden, pulling weeds and harvesting its fruits and vegetables. FDR's memories of the garden helped shape his values and sense of identity.</p> <p>Large home gardens like the Roosevelt's garden were typical features of the diverse, self-sustaining Hudson River estate farms. These farms grew a variety of crops in gardens, fields and orchards and maintained livestock like chickens, hogs and cattle to provide meat as well as eggs and dairy products for the table.</p> <p>When the Roosevelts originally bought this property, the vegetable garden occupied a small bed in the present-day rose garden and gravesite. Although they were only a family of three, the garden expanded continuously throughout their time at Springwood, even after FDR’s departure for school and James Roosevelt’s death in 1900.</p> <p>The Home Garden was an integral part of Roosevelt family life. Frequently mentioned in letters between the Roosevelts, it was clearly important not only as a source of food, but as a part of their home—a part they made an effort to enjoy no matter where they were staying. When the Roosevelts weren’t living at Springwood, they would have produce shipped from their garden to wherever they were—to their property in Campobello, to New York, and to FDR at school in Massachusetts.</p> <p>The current vegetable garden is designed to replicate the Roosevelts’ garden with as much historic accuracy as possible. Minor adjustments are introduced to ensure its health and accessibility, including deer fencing around its perimeter and porous pavement paths. In addition, although the heirloom vegetable varieties grown in the garden today remain the same as during the Roosevelts’ time, they are cultivated using modern organic practices. Bug traps, black biodegradable film, white row cover, and kaolin clay are all examples of these modern strategies used in combat typical garden pests.</p> <p>The Home Garden is maintained through the support of volunteers who help plant, maintain, and harvest the crops. Produce is donated by the park's philanthropic partner, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Hyde Park Foundation, to Dutchess Outreach in the city of Poughkeepsie. In addition to being a food resource, this garden is used for a variety of educational programs, and is free and open for the public to enjoy.

The cemetery has nine burials inside its fenced-in area. The earliest burials date to 1787, when Margaret and Thomas Stone died within four months of each other. The last burial occurred in 1913, when one of the last Stone owners of the property, Margaret Graham Stone, died. Six other markers of extended Stone family members who died between 1841-1873, including two children, are also there.<br /> <br /> Outside of the fenced-in area, arranged in a rectangular pattern are four small stone markers. Oral tradition states that the stones mark a separate cemetery, a cemetery comprised of the enslaved who died in bondage and were buried next to the family cemetery. When the Stones sold the property in 1936, they put a stipulation in the sales contract that permitted one future burial, that of a former enslaved person, in the area outside the fence, but no burials inside. A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) study done here shows evidence of 19 burial shafts in this area but does not indicate how many people are actually buried in this location, nor if they were burials of enslaved persons.<br /> <br /> This theory is problematic, however. In the Chesapeake region, enslaved people were rarely laid to rest near those who claimed ownership over them. It was more common for the enslaved to have their own burial grounds near their quarters or in undeveloped ground close by.<br /> <br /> Do these four stones outline an enslaved cemetery, or an extended cemetery for other Stone family members who did not reside here? More research needs to be conducted before the answers can be revealed.</p>",

On the first day, elements of three Union divisions manned the line along a little-used farm road that ran through the Joseph Duncan property. Duncan and his family worked a small cotton field that bordered the road to the south. With its open fields of fire and road cover, there is little wonder that the Duncan plot became one of the most important localities on the battlefield.<br /> <br /> This position, atop a small rise and fronting an almost impenetrable undergrowth, became the target of the numerous Confederate attacks on April 6. Heavy fighting raged in the area of the Hornets' Nest on the first day, with no less than eight distinct Confederate attacks turned back by the determined defenders of the Sunken Road. Attesting to the fury in the area, Confederates so named the location because, they said, the enemy's bullets sounded like swarms of angry hornets.<br /> <br /> Confederate General Daniel Ruggles, after having witnessed the unsuccessful attacks against the position, formed a line of artillery consisting of as many as 53 big guns and concentrated its fire upon the Federal line. With the aid of these cannon, the Confederates were able to form a circle around the Hornets' Nest, surrounding and capturing General Prentiss, with nearly 2,200 troops, late in the day on April 6.</p>",

            "bodyText": "The Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were both signed in this room. Later, the room became a shrine to the founding of the nation, proudly displaying the Liberty Bell and original paintings of the Founding Fathers. That was the scene when President-elect Abraham Lincoln visited the Assembly Room and praised the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Following his assassination, Lincoln's body lay in repose here for two days. Visitors today can ponder their own role in the on-going experiment in self-government.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Second Continental Congress</strong><br /> The Pennsylvania legislature loaned the Assembly Room of the Pennsylvania State House out to the men of the Second Continental Congress in May 1775. Meeting just a month after shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord, the men prepared for war. They approved the nomination of George Washington as Commander in Chief of the newly created army, and they approved the resolution creating the Marine Corps. They also pursued peace, drafting the Olive Branch Petition. King George III never responded to that petition and talk began to grow of seeking independence. On July 2, 1776, the men voted to approve the resolution for independence. On July 4, 1776, they voted to approve their document, the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence was signed in this room on August 2, 1776.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Constitutional Convention</strong><br /> The Pennsylvania legislature loaned their room out again in May 1787 to the men of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories.htm\">Constitutional Convention</a>. The nation's first framework of government, the Articles of Confederation, had proven unsatisfactory. In a climate of great concern, delegates arrived in Philadelphia to address the inadequacies of the Articles. In four months, they created the U.S. Constitution, a feat George Washington called \"little short of a miracle\". The debates of the Constitutional or Federal Convention were heated at times, over issues like the power balance between large states and small states as well as the slave trade. During the debates, Pennsylvania delegate and elder statesman Benjamin Franklin looked at the chair where Washington was seated as the presiding officer. Carved into that chair is a sun. As the men signed the Constitution, Franklin said that he had the great happiness to know it was a rising and not a setting sun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Transition to Shrine</strong><br /> The state capital left Philadelphia in 1799, moving on to Lancaster and then Harrisburg. In 1818, the state sold this building to the city of Philadelphia. Philadelphians welcomed the war hero Marquis de Lafayette to the Assembly Room in 1824 during his triumphant return visit to America. The committee preparing for his visit first referred to the Assembly Room as \"the hall of Independence\". It would be decades before the entire building became known by that name. The room took on the appearance of a shrine with the 1854-55 redecoration. The Nativists rose to power at that time, a political party that used Revolutionary era rhetoric and symbols in their campaign to exclude immigrants from holding public office. President-elect Abraham Lincoln stepped into this shrine-like room in 1861 as he journeyed to Washington D.C. for his inauguration. Standing in the Assembly Room, he said that he would rather be \"assassinated on the spot\" than give up the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. After his assassination in the nation's capital in 1865, his body returned to the Assembly Room for two days. Upwards of 85,000 mourners passed by the casket.",

The Liberty Hotel was constructed in 1928 in the black “Northside” neighborhood during the heyday of Atlantic City’s resort tourism. The five-story, brick, Italian Renaissance Revival-style building provided modern, comfortable lodgings, food, and entertainment to African American visitors and residents when nearly all of the City’s other hotels were closed to black lodgers. The Liberty Hotel was regularly and prominently listed in popular African American-focused travel guides and newspapers of the time, including The Negro Motorist Green Book, Ebony Magazine, and the Baltimore Afro-American. It was a popular choice of lodging for prominent African American entertainers and public-figures, such as boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, singer Mahalia Jackson, entrepreneur Billboard Jackson, and locally significant individuals like Claiborn Morris Cain.<br /> <br /> Atlantic City’s identity as one of the most popular seasonal resorts on the East Coast began in the late nineteenth century and reached a peak in the early twentieth century. The City’s world-famous Boardwalk, beaches, luxury hotels, and nightlife scene provided endless opportunities for relaxation and entertainment for individuals and families alike. Atlantic City’s black population grew in parallel with the Great Migration. As African Americans moved out of the South in large numbers many found employment in the City’s tourist establishments. The number of hotels, motels, resorts, restaurants, and entertainment venues that catered to African American tourists who flocked to the City’s Boardwalk and beaches grew in tandem with the City’s African American population. In a city that experienced great loss of its urban fabric in the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries, the Liberty Hotel is among the few surviving examples of a mid-sized hotel that catered to African American tourists. ",

            "audioDescription": "As you make your way along a narrow path through the plants, the Deluge Shelter spur of the Jones Hole Trail leads you to a vertical sandstone rock face. The rock is rough and ranges from tan to reddish in color. In many of the petroglyphs, the paint has faded, but the etchings are still visible. In areas where the rock is shaded by ledges, some pictographs are still vibrant because the pigment has not been faded by the sun. The ledge extends alongside the narrow trail and features many humanoid figures, animal figures, abstract shapes, and pockmarked designs. There is a wayside exhibit here, titled \"Sheltering Ancient Images.\" The main picture shows a line drawing of two people, one standing, one kneeling, creating petroglyphs and pictographs. The text reads: \"Approximately 800 to 1,400 years ago, this area was home the Fremont people. They left evidence of their presence in the form of petroglyphs, patterns chipped or carved into the rock, and pictographs, patterns painted on the rock. Few Fremont structures remain, but known dwelling sites range from natural shelters, such as rock overhangs or shallow caves, to small villages.

They may have used this site, Deluge Shelter, in this way. For a thousand years, this rock overhang has shaded these pictographs from the strong midday sun. This limited exposure to sunlight may have helped to preserve the vibrant colors in these ancient images.\" On the right side of the exhibit are photos of the images on the rocks. The first is of a red pictograph. It features an animal-figure resembling an antelope with long frond-like horns sweeping back over its body, followed by another small dog-like animal. The text reads, \"Are these original colors? Yes, the Fremont created these colors using pigments made from minerals, clays, or other natural materials.\" The image immediately below is of a reddish-brown pictograph featuring three humanoid figures, standing shoulder to shoulder. Each has six thin protrusions sticking up from the crown of its head. The text reads, \"Why have the colors lasted so long? The ancient pictographs that have survived are generally located in protected areas, like rock overhangs or shaded ledges. Weather, rockfall, and vandalism can affect their appearance. The final image shows a humanoid figure with two large, curved protrusions emanating from the crown of its head. The text states, \"Why did they make these designs? Archeologists have several theories: the images may have related to hunting, identified clans, served ceremonial or religious purposes, or simply expressed the artist's imagination.\"",

Beginning in 1779, several attempts were made to grow wheat but failed due to storms and seed germination. The first successful harvest of wheat was in 1794 at Mission San Jose. The same year the mill was completed.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{126}\" paraid=\"910138816\">The gristmill at Mission San Jose was the first mill in Texas and it was powered by water from the acequia. The mill was likely built into the quarried area after the lime kilns were discontinued.  The lime kilns can still be seen today at the back of the mill. There you will see three circular indentations into the wall.  These are remnants of the lime kilns.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{168}\" paraid=\"1567351437\">The mill you see today was restored in the 1930’s.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{178}\" paraid=\"635439960\"><strong>Acequias: The Lifeblood of the Missions </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{0cc0d2d0-3439-4ef2-9cb7-00c873f94e36}{34}\" paraid=\"2000980281\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Acequias not only irrigated crops but they also powered machinery.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{190}\" paraid=\"808912478\">The acequia water was diverted through a ditch and sluice gate to the gristmill forebay. The Miller would open the gate when he was milling the wheat. The water would flow through the sluice gate to the forebay, a containment area to hold the water. The forebay gate, located at the bottom of the forebay, would be closed. Water would fill the forebay. Once filled, the miller would open the forebay gate to allow water to flow through the forebay channel to move the horizontal wooden water wheel. Water flowed out of the forebay channel and powered the wooden water wheel pushing the wheel counter clockwise. Once the water had powered the wheel, the water would flood a field behind the mill. Water continued to flow from the acequia into the forebay during milling operations to maintain a steady flow of water to the water wheel. </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{200}\" paraid=\"645572537\">Inside the mill house you can see the two mill stones. The wooden water wheel below moved the grind stones in the mill house. The miller would pour flour into the wooden hopper, then the wheat would spread between the two mill stones and be ground into flour. Flour would pour out the bottom as the finished product. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Located outside the mission walls is a reconstructed gristmill. In front of the mill is a cement lined acequia, or irrigation ditch. The acequia diverts to a ditch that leads to the gristmill. At the front of the mill building is the forebay, a cement water holding tank. The one-story mill building is made from sandstone. Inside the building is one room with three windows that houses the milling equipment, including the two mill stones and hopper. Below the mill building is a vaulted tuffaceous limestone room where the wooden water wheel and other milling mechanisms are located. Stone stairs lead down to the water wheel and mill race.",

With the establishment of Pennsylvania as a British colony under the proprietorship of William Penn in the late 1600s, English, Welsh, and Irish Quakers began to settle in the Brandywine Valley in large numbers. While the area had been home to groups of the Lenni-Lenape people for thousands of years, and had seen small scale settlement by earlier waves of European colonizers, primarily Swedes and Finns, these newcomers had the largest impact, shaping the landscape into the Valley we see today. While most of the farms, mills, and other buildings that these settlers built from the late 1600’s-mid 1800’s are lost to history, some examples remain, including the ruins of a house, a mill race, and the foundation of a saw mill along the northern bank of Beaver creek. The ruins of a two-story house, built in the late 1700s by the Green family, are the most prominent.<br /> <br /> The Green family were typical of these largely Quaker settlers, building up a combined farming and milling operation through the 1700s and early 1800s. Beaver Creek provided the power source for the saw mill, the foundations of which are visible in colder months when vegetation dies back. The water of the creek was channeled through a mill race, the remains of which can be seen to the south from the trail. There are also the remains of several small dams along Beaver Creek, which when active kept water pooled up in mill ponds, ensuring a steady flow to power the mills. By the mid-1800’s, due to rapidly advancing technological breakthroughs, the once cutting-edge mills that had lined Beaver Creek were outdated and entered into a steep decline. Many were torn down or left to rot, leaving us with only a few physical reminders that the Industrial Revolution in the United States had begun in places like the Brandywine Valley.",
            "audioDescription": "The ruins are located along a hiking trail, approximately a half mile from the small gravel parking lot located on Beaver Creek Road, in Chadd's Ford, Pennsylvania. The trail leading to the ruins is rocky and steep in places. The ruins are surrounded by dense forest. The house is two stories high, though the floors are long gone. The brick chimney rises above the remaining outer walls, which are made of flat grey stone. There are fire places still visible in the red brick chimney.",

            "bodyText": "As Tulelake receded in 1917, farm units for homesteading were made available after World War Two. The last groups of homesteaders were drawn in lotteries from 1946 to 1949.<br /> <br /> The pickle jar became the choice for homestead lotteries after the fish bowl became too small. The 1946 drawing held at the armory in Klamath Falls included one thousand three hundred and five names typed on the slips of paper, put into capsules and placed into this three gallon pickle jar. Only 86 names were drawn.<br /> <br /> This pickle jar was filled for the last time in 1949 in the American Legion Hall in Tulelake. Eighty six out of five thousand names were drawn.<br /> <br /> With these drawings they had to have drawings for them because there were so many more applications than there was plots of land available. In the halls was always full. There is always there full of people who are sitting in a desk, people, a lot of them on the edge of the seat, hoping that their name would be the next one drawn out. But the ones that were there, why, they let out a good yell. The tension was there and everybody was just waiting to because they knew it was an opportunity there. They were getting an opportunity for new life in a new community. And it was really something to see.<br /> <br /> When we got down there where we had guys that came next to us were navy. 'Course we were all army men, two Navy.<br /> <br /> The morning at the we went to move out on our site, when it snowd, and when I got out there close to it, I put the car in second gear and opened it wide open and headed out. And when I hit the yellow post-it, mark my land the phone to the right of it out on the land, And where it got stuck, that was home.<br /> <br /> We spent some time in the tent. The wind blew and mercifully that spring and that poor old tent, what kind of rock and it wasn't real, real comfortable. The dirt came in, of course, and we had our grain stored, our seed grain stored in the tent so it wouldn't get wet.<br /> <br /> Move on to the Korean War display.<br /> <br /> Members of our community served under the command of General MacArthur to help protect South Korea from conquest by North Korea, when war broke out in 1950.<br /> <br /> When I got to Korea, they put us in some high walled camps for a while. Then they were building the Quonset hut barracks after a fashion. We were being woken up at night, sometimes with the small aircraft flying over the runway, dropping hand grenades, which they call bed check Charlie. I never did figure out why they didn't go after that guy, but they just let him do it night after night, probably a couple of nights every week.<br /> <br /> Between August 5th, 1964, and April 30th, 1975, three point four million military personnel served in the Vietnam War.<br /> <br /> The minute that door opened and you started walking towards the tarmac, the heat was just beyond anything, I'd and I'm a Phenix, Arizona boy, and this was a heat like I've never experienced, the humidity was up 105 percent, was probably 108 degrees, and it was eight o'clock at night.<br /> <br /> I think there was one period of over three months that we weren't without any fresh meat or fresh vegetables. A typical breakfast was one spoonful of eggs. What are sort of green dehydrate would have been reconstituted out of powdered eggs at one spoonful of square dehydrated potatoes and possibly two little small Vienna sausages and one piece of bread without any butter or jam.<br /> <br /> Rarely ever did you get to see the bad guy because his whole mission in life was to just Pick at you and run. They said we lost the war. We didn't lose the war. We fought it the best way we could. We were just as proud and dedicated to our own brothers as they were. We were just dealt a different kind of card.<br /> <br /> The official end of America's direct involvement in Vietnam was April 30th, 1975.<br /> <br /> Step over to the farming and ranching display.<br /> <br /> Just as the United States is a melting pot of people from all parts of the world, so is this region. Sharing of education's travel experiences, agricultural knowledge and skills have created these diverse communities. <br /> Where have you found Nettles growing? You knew it was the finest soil. And as you know, we have lots of wild metals in this country, and it was also an indicator of water.<br /> <br /> I had my first job when I was seven and Ray was nine. We delivered papers in the morning and milk in the afternoon and we got along fine. But I always wanted to ever do was be a cowboy.<br /> <br /> The tractors gradually came in and replaced the horses in our area has a beautiful soil. Some of the best soil actually in the world.<br /> <br /> You should now be standing in front of our current issues. This concludes the indoor segment of your audio tour.

            "bodyText": "In 1891, Nathan and Nancy Merrill purchased one hundred and fifty two acres of land for three thousand dollars. They develop 80 of those acres into a town recruiting businesses. Soon the town flourished, and by 1909, Mel was known as the flower city because of its large flower mill.<br /> <br /> A major fire in 1911 destroyed almost an entire block. New buildings soon replaced those lost cinders from Lava Beds were barged across Tulelake and up Lost River. The boats were tied at the town's docks and the cinders were spread on the streets of Merrill.<br /> <br /> Another major fire struck in 1920.<br /> <br /> Again, the town rebuilt.<br /> <br /> By the 1930s, there were improvements to the town's volunteer fire department. But in 1949, the elementary school was lost to fire.<br /> <br /> Two railroads by the early 1930s aided Merrill's economic growth. Today, Merrill remains a viable agricultural community. It's one hundred and thirty six foot flagpole memorializes American prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action. It represents a strong, patriotic commitment by the proud citizens of Merrill.<br /> <br /> Continue stopping next at the section for Malin.<br /> <br /> In 1909, a barren sagebrush covered land on the northeastern shore of Tulelake was shown to the three scouts from the Bohemian Colonization Club.<br /> <br /> They saw past the rabbit infested sandy terrain that rimmed the Tule bordered late. Their insight, ambition and determination led the way for early pioneers who followed them to purchase land, grub the sagebrush, build homes and plant crops.<br /> <br /> And they had rabbit drys, and that really turned out to be a pretty good thing because Klamath County was paying five cent bounty on jack rabbit ears on a pair of jack rabbit ears. And the first guy they killed over 2000 jackrabbits. Why, Frank Adams, he would loan him equipment, and they only record they kept was just on the back of the barn door. People would write up well such and such got this piece of equipment there that when it was brought back, it be scratched off. Yeah. Farmers way back in the early forties knew with all the ditches and stuff around, was worried about the young kids drowning without a chance to learn to swim. And so the farmers got around and they built the swimming pool at the land. That aside, why cut a tree down, we got all these trees in the park and so started putting lights on in the trees in the park, and first few years they put two or three on and then they were five or six and then people started buying the lights and putting them on. And it got up to where I think this last year, 80 some trees decorated in the park. But we always had a community spirit where the people were helping one another and working together instead of against one another.<br /> <br /> And my dad always said my uncle said the same thing. They didn't speak the native tongue at home. They want to be good Americans. They had to learn English. And the children were learning at school, so they had to pass it on to them.<br /> <br /> The dances were held in a Malin Broadway hall. And box killing, who also like to dance, was able to get some of the best dance bands. And I especially remember Phil Harris and his dance band. And we danced till 2:30 or 3 in the morning.<br /> <br /> Next stop, Butte Valley.<br /> <br /> This area of over a hundred and thirty square miles is located in north central Siskiyou County, in a high desert valley surrounded by mountains. Arid lands of sagebrush and blowing sand give way to lush timber, fertile green meadows and crystal clear creeks. Majestic Mt. Shasta towers above the area, creating a spectacular landscape.<br /> <br /> Legendary Modoc chief Captain Jack is said to have been born at Jack Springs near the Oklahoma Flats. White men settled the region in the early sixties.<br /> <br /> Many changes have occurred in Butte Valley, but the spirit of survival continues. The largest flagpole this side of the Mississippi, towers two hundred feet above the streets, greeting travelers with a show of patriotism.<br /> <br /> Butte Valley is a fertile country and lots of different things, potatoes and alfalfa and things like that, and cattle are raised there. It's just a good place to live. I've lived here all my life. Sheepy Creek was named after Indian by the name Sheepy, and he had this property that press doors told him the government was wanting to buy the property and he offered him a dollar for it which Sheepy took. Captain Jack and his Modoc tribe wanted this as a home for their tribe. Captain Jack lived right at a spring at the head of Sheep Creek, and that is called Jack Spring. To this day, prosperous school was established in 1918 and Sheepy Creek.<br /> <br /> A lot of your country and Western singers, you know, like Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, all the old country and Western singers, a lot of them would hit the Red Bar, you know, and come there. And it would be a great place, you know, to go and is also a good place to get in a fight. If you want to get in the fight.<br /> <br /> Continue walking to the next town.",

These have been recreated from actual petroglyphs.<br /> <br /> You are invited to visit Petroglyph Point, just southwest of the peninsula and about 10 miles south of Tulelake. Here is one of the largest panels of rock art in the United States.<br /> <br /> Next, meet Modoc Indian Ivan Jackson, descendant of Captain Jack. <br /> <br /> (Modoc language). Hello, how are you, my friend? My name is Ivan Jackson. The language I just spoke if of the ancient Modoc. Professional from all over the world, came here in the mid eighteen hundreds to study my people. Our real name in the Modoc dialect is (Modoc language) \"The people of the ancient time\". The language in the Basque country separates the Modoc culture from any other in the world. I welcome you to the world at the age of Modoc. (Modoc language)<br /> <br /> Step forward to learn about the Lava Beds.<br /> <br /> Known as the land of burnt out fires, the Lava Beds national monument occupies over forty six thousand acres on the northeast side of Medicine Lake Volcano. The landscape offers outstanding volcanic terrain and more than four hundred and thirty six lava tube caves. The greatest concentration in North America.<br /> <br /> In addition to its geologic features, the monument encompasses Petroglyph Point and the main battlefields of the Modoc War.<br /> <br /> Located about 12 miles southwest of here. The monument offers long and short hiking trails through very important geological and historical areas. Interpretive exhibits, lava tube caves and develop trails await your exploration. Further information is available in the museum's gift shop. <br /> <br /> Please continue to the immigrant trails display where you will find a map and pages from an immigrant's journal.<br /> <br /> It began as an unconnected series of trails used by Native Americans and was expanded in the eighteen twenties and thirties by fur traders. American explorations and westward migration began in the 40s in 1843. The first large wagon train made the five month journey on what was then known as the Oregon Road.<br /> <br /> The Applegate family was part of that first large wagon train. Two of their children drowned when a raft overturned on the Columbia River, making the Applegate brothers determined to find a safer route.<br /> <br /> The Applegate trail that followed the northern shore of Tulelake was blazed in 1846. It passed by Merrill, then across the southern shore of lower Klamath Lake and on to the Willamette Valley.<br /> <br /> That area was settled as a direct result of the the Appalachian Trail. Most days, 10, 12 miles is what they would make per day. And they basically they went waterhole to waterholes. For one thing, most people walk. Most people think that they they rode the wagons, that the wagons were not the kind of stogel wagons that are portrayed in the movies. These were much smaller wagons. And, you know, the box might be six or eight feet long at the most length, four feet wide. And oftentimes they would carry feed inside those wagons. It would be stacked when they came across grasses. They would cut the grasses and place them inside the wagons. And of course, they had their possessions in there. They used oxen, no horses.<br /> <br /> Move on to the display of the Modoc Indian War. You should now be standing in front of Gillems camp.",

Klamath Basin grown potatoes were the focal point of the event. A modest barbecue was offered in the basement of the Merrill Community Hall. I<br /> <br /> n 1936. The tradition of crowning a queen began. And soon, the event included a barbecue, parade, displays, football game and a dance. During the World War two years, the event was scaled back to only include a late harvest dance.<br /> <br /> Those humble beginnings fostered the growth of the yearly celebration known as the Klamath Basin Potato Festival.<br /> <br /> Celebrations remain a part of the community of Malin.<br /> <br /> We had the national so-called celebration and then went into the elementary school in the football field that we have out there now.<br /> <br /> In nineteen twenty eight, we had a West Coast conference to select conference here, and they had people come all the way from Chicago. They had to make your own entertainment. They had dances, special events, special occasion, anything that can be celebrated. My dad used to tell me they used to have this the spring festival when the ice would break on the lake, they'd have a celebration for that. They would have all kinds of celebrations. They had the pioneer days, which started in the 30s. Pretty soon, the city started having regular celebrations there, 40 or 50 or 60, a diamond jubilee. And we have a car cruise that has been going for several years to celebrate the Fourth of July. And different groups have put different affairs on, and they're always tied into the park.<br /> <br /> Turn to see the Buffalo head.<br /> <br /> The Tulelake Butte Valley Fair is an event that symbolizes the pride of the region, where families and friends join together to celebrate, to socialize and to remember.<br /> <br /> I have never known better, sharper, more dedicated group of people in my life and that there more have been for the Rotary Club, have you ever had to write. It's always here. And I did listen to her kids in family.<br /> <br /> The wind blew and they had an electric cord or something that went into this cover that they had , and it started a fire. So they had to help those poor ladies there. They had their beautiful cakes of white icing and the dust then covered everything. Oh, it was that way. But, you know, we made it. We made it through the fair.<br /> <br /> Now, enter the first maze behind you to visit Merrill, Oregon, 10 miles north of here.",

An important building in the history of St. Louis and the history of Civil Rights, the Old Courthouse is currently closed to the public. <br /> <br /> St. Louis' Old Courthouse is listed in the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm\">Network To Freedom.</a> The Network to Freedom recognizes sites, programs and facilities with verifiable associations to the Underground Railroad. The phenomenon popularly known as the Underground Railroad has been broadly defined by the National Park Service as the \"historic resistance to enslavement through escape and flight.\" The Old Courthouse is linked with the story of the Underground Railroad, and with that of slavery, as a property associated with legal challenges to slavery. It was a public forum as well as a courthouse. Enslaved people were auctioned from its steps in estate settlements, while one man's suit for freedom helped plunge the country into Civil War. The Old Courthouse was the site of over 300 suits for freedom, but one gained notoriety. In 1847, Dred Scott, with his wife Harriet, sued for, and were granted, their freedom. After many appeals, the case was decided upon by the Supreme Court. The decision stated that slaves were property, and as such, had no right to sue. The Dred Scott Decision hastened the start of the Civil War.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost point of land on the North American continent, forms the western tip of the Seward Peninsula and the eastern edge of the Bering Strait. The Wales sites are strategically located at the point where the Russian mainland lies within reach by umiak (a large Inupiaq skin boat) from North America, about 68 miles. In the past, Wales was the hub through which people, their material culture, and ideas would have passed from Siberia to Alaska since the submersion of the Bering Land Bridge by the Bering Sea.</p> <p>The Wales Sites National Historic Landmark is made up of two archaeological sites that spans the period from the Birnirk culture--the earliest recognizable manifestation of modern Inupiaq culture in Alaska--to the present Inupiaq residents of the modern settlement of Wales, Alaska (Wales, Alaska, is originally known as Kiŋigin in Inupiaq). People have been living in Kiŋigin, Wales, Alaska since at least 500 A.D.</p> <p>When the Wales sites were first designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962 it included three archeological sites, the Kurigitavik Mound site, the Hillside site, and the Beach Mound site. Since then, the Beach Mound site has eroded into the Bering Sea and no trace remains.</p> <p>The Wales sites hold an important place in the history of Arctic archeology. It was at the Kurigitavik site, the Hillside site, and on the Diomede Islands in 1926, that the archeological excavations of Diamond Jenness from the National Museum of Canada brought to light the first evidence of the successive stages of precontact Inupiat culture in northern Alaska. This work represented the first systematic archeological investigations in Alaska north of the Aleutian Islands.</p> <p>Henry Collins, who worked for the Smithsonian Institute, continued the archeological excavations at Wales in 1936. His findings represented another great advance in the documentation of Alaskan precontact history. The Kurigitavik site was identified as the first Thule material culture site studied in Alaska. Prior to this new discovery in Alaska, archeologists had identified the Thule culture in the Central Canadian Arctic and had postulated an Alaskan origin for it. At the time it was only a hypothesis that Thule culture had developed in Alaska and then spread east by at least a thousand years ago. However, until the discovery of Thule at the Kurigitavik site, there were no known Thule sites in Alaska.</p> <p>Collins’ work at the Kurigitavik site also produced stratigraphic evidence that he believed to be a confirmation of the transition between Birnirk culture and Thule culture in Western Alaska. Collins felt that the Birnirk-Thule relationship was shown by the distribution of harpoon heads and ceramics in the site’s midden. The midden’s stratigraphy contained Birnirk artifacts at the base, a Birnirk to Thule transitional phase in artifacts in the middle levels, and Thule artifacts in the upper levels of the site. Collins also saw influences on the Thule material at the Kurigitavik site from the Punuk archeological culture of St. Lawrence Island.The presence of Birnirk, Thule, and Punuk artifacts at the Kurigitavik site, which are not found in the Canadian Thule cultural record, were interpreted by Collins as evidence that the eastward migration of Thule culture must have originated from some point farther east, such as the Point Barrow area.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p>Toward an archaeology of late prehistoric Eskimo bands in coastal northwest Alaska, <i>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, </i>2013, by Roger Harritt</p> <p>Variations of late prehistoric houses in coastal northwest Alaska: a view from Wales, <i>Arctic Anthropology, </i>2010, by Roger Harritt</p> <p>Henry B.

The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.<br /> <br /> They were serious. They had air raid wardens. Every block, they had blackouts, they had anti-aircraft guns. Everything had come under ration, you had to have stamps for meat, for sugar, coffee, gasoline, clothes. I think we could buy one pair of shoes per year.<br /> <br /> Step over to Paul Christie.<br /> <br /> You have to go back to the time places, circumstances. These things happened. That after Pearl Harbor, people on the West Coast particularly were terrified Japanese was going to attack. People don't realize this, but our intelligence lost the Japanese fleet and they didn't know where they had gone, it was sometime around the Battle of Midway. And they thought the Japanese were headed for the West Coast. Gave us p38 lightnings and sent us down the Orange County Airport. Only five of us. We were defensive Southern California, and we will fly out from there. And every day we expected to see the state, the whole Japanese fleet out. We were six weeks out of flight school. We were flying airplanes we didn't know anything about. And to this day, I don't know if we had any ammunition.<br /> <br /> They were just building the hangars there because it was a B-24s. For some of them, we put tail turrets and some we had sideturrets and come to this and that and put a lot of oxygen lines. And we did everything on the planes.<br /> <br /> Our base had nothing but B-17 flying fortresses. Most of them had 13 guns to those 50 caliber. I was over there twenty seven months. When I came home I got to see my son for the first time.<br /> <br /> Move on to Hank Christianson.<br /> <br /> They shipped us out a few at a time on different ships, and I went on a converted freighter and by the way, over there, they were terrible storms. Ship, you know, real strongly to the right. And I have steel hill plates on my shoes, so I slept on the deck. Well, and it was I was going under the lights and I was on my back. I reached up and caught the lifeline on my hands that hung over the side of the ship. So I slowly worked my way down and waited to the lul of the storm and reached around the stanchion with one hand and got a hold the cable on the other side and reached up, got a hold of the station and slowly inch by inch pulled myself back up on the ship and I laid there. I had my arms around the cable on one side of that, my legs are all over on the other side. And I debated about whether trying to lay there all night until there was help in the morning. And then I thought, well, it was cold too, February, if a wave hit get me hypothermia, would I have to do something? So I decided to try to crawl on my hands and knees up to the hole. When we got back to the States, I took a roll call and they found that they were short eight people.<br /> <br /> Herman Bell speaks of Bird Fairclough.<br /> <br /> He first went to Africa and he told me, walk most of the way around the shoreline of Africa, then to Sicily and from Sicily he want to Anzio. And he laid on that beach for 63 days without a bath or anything. And then he went further into Italy and was sent up on a hill to clean out some some nest gunness up there. And Finally was shot through the arm and he went down into one of those cellar like things. And I just they just shot in there with their machine guns and the bullets were going everywhere. But then he said they didn't hit him with had his helmet on and held up pretty bad. And they said the next morning somebody said, anybody in there better come out because we're going to blow it up. And he said it was an American's voice. And he said, boy, don't I'm in here. And so they came in and got him and took him down and had his arm treated. And they said they were going to shipping out. And I said, no way, you're going to ship me out. He said, I know every one of those places, I'm going back up. So he cleaned out several places up there. So that made it safer. And he went a lot of medals and he earned every one of them.<br /> <br /> Paul Christie speaks of Al Kongslie.<br /> <br /> North African campaign al Kongslie landed with the troops to the south of Casablanca when the ships landed there and you marched all the way across North Africa to Tunisia. And even he fought for ground support for Patton. His orders and now as one of the troops that ambushed the German Hakone. And I was came in as ground support for Al and went all the way through the African campaign, And Cicilia came around and was in the Landingham DayDay and all of the war always Hartmut. Hitler and Tojo had to be stopped<br /> <br /> Dud Lemke.<br /> <br /> We had a cause because we knew the person we were fighting what his intent was.<br /> <br /> Continue to the mural of fourteen hundred and fifty two buildings.",

            "bodyText": "Some of the most fertile soils in the world were reclaimed after the shallow waters of Tulelake receded. Ten years of redirecting water resulted in 11 homesteading periods. The town of Tulelake has a rich and colorful history from the early boomtown days following the first rounds of homesteading through the World War two years of a Japanese American internment camp and German Italian P.O.W. camp.<br /> <br /> It has been molded by veteran homesteaders, farmers, ranchers and merchants who collectively provide for its economy. Instead of giving up when things get tough, the citizens persevere and overcome to preserve an agricultural, rural lifestyle in a land full of history, beauty and wildlife.<br /> <br /> I had the greatest life growing up, hunting, fishing, working hard in a family with my dad.<br /> <br /> The schools pretty much followed the homesteaded. When a group of homesteaders that moved in, there's no time delay had kids of their own and there was no place for them to go to school. So they built a school or moved one in.<br /> <br /> And I had a job right after the interview because Mrs. Jacobini was leaving. So I was the teacher, the principal, the janitor, the art teacher, the music teacher, the PE teacher and every kind of teacher at our school. We had to make do. And when you do that, your kids become creative. And the milk cans were frozen over in the winter time and we had to chop the ice out of the milk cans to get the big dipper in, to get a drink of water. And you'd think the children would have gotten diseases, but they were healthy little rascals. They were never absent simply because they had to work too hard when they stayed home. So they'd rather come to school.<br /> <br /> When we got here in 1927, there was no little town of Tulelake. Yeah. Oh, I think the railroad probably was started, gone through and they had a plan for the Tulelake, but we had to go to town of Malin for groceries for the first few years. So they would actually put down a bunch of lumber to hold so their cars could drive through. They would all sink into the ground. So it's probably a lot of lumber up in the main street anyway.<br /> <br /> The town of Tulelake was a rip-roaring frontier town of all things. There were seven saloons and Tulelake at that time. This was at the end of the dustbowl days. And migratory labor came in Tulelake in great numbers at harvest time, especially for the potato picking.<br /> <br /> Up on the hill. Deer went past us and that touch the heart of the hunter. The church was made up, first of all, homesteaders, but everybody was very, very friendly, the whole area.<br /> <br /> And we had lots of community spirit in those days. Everybody got out in helped. And they had dances every Saturday night in the old Legion Hall where we started our school.<br /> <br /> Now exit the first maze in turn left into volcanoes and natural wonders.<br /> <br /> We invite you to take your time in this area to learn the processes that took place to create this landscape. Notice our spectacular geological formations, except for a few deposits of muddy sediment washed upon the basin floor, almost all the rocks in this region erupted as molten lava.<br /> <br /> There are 17 volcanoes in the subduction zone known as the Cascade Range, extending from British Columbia to northern California.<br /> <br /> Among them, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta are some of the world's best known.<br /> <br /> Our own Medicine Lake volcano is the largest in size in the cascade range. The result is a landscape where a great variety of volcanic features can be seen in a relatively small area.<br /> <br /> Now enter the next maze on your left.",

He was on the ship for 14 days. He was on guard duty. The full time is on.

He was glad to be home.<br /> <br /> Continue to the CCC camp.<br /> <br /> Formed in March 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, was one of the first of President Roosevelt's New Deal programs. It was a federal public works project to provide needed jobs.<br /> <br /> The CCC operated under the Army's control, camp commanders had disciplinary powers and corpsman were required to address superiors as sir.<br /> <br /> By September 1935, over 500,000 young men had lived in CCC camps. In all, nearly three million participated in the CCC. The discipline and experience gained soon proved helpful in World War Two.<br /> <br /> Locally, the CCC was very active, instructing most infrastructures that the Lava Beds National Monument and Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge.<br /> <br /> Now see the P.O.W. camp displayed behind you.<br /> <br /> During World War Two, the CCC camp on Hill Road, west of Tulelake was used to house prisoners of war. In May 1944 the first P.O.W.s to arrive were Italian. In June, German prisoners replaced them.<br /> <br /> The purpose of the camp was to provide workers to relieve the farm labor shortage.<br /> <br /> As the first P.O.W.s proved successful in their work, more were ordered with the number peeking at one thousand in September 1945. Tents on a vacant lot in Tulelake were also used to house them.<br /> <br /> We couldn't get help, and of course, they set the high school down and all the high school kids at work, and then we worked with German prisoners over there from the hill there to grab some Mexicans come in. There was another CCC camp down at Gillems camp on the edge, a little bit national monument and the tore this camp down and was one of their functions. And they were trucked back and forth to the camp there on the west side. And they took all the nails out of the board and bent them in a triangle so that if any vehicle tire ran over, it really popped up, and if you didn't get your front tire, you got your rear tire. This provided a tremendous problem over these German prisoners who would scatter these nails out of these truck.<br /> <br /> My mother was the crew boss at the time, and so my grandmother would be cooking lunch and there was never a single thing left.<br /> <br /> The last three hundred and eight prisoners departed the camp November 1945.<br /> <br /> Directly in front of you is our tribute to local war veterans.<br /> <br /> To our courageous men and women in uniform, past, present and future.

The stronghold, the Modoc's one half mile square natural fortress of deep crevices and jagged boulders of molten lava is in front of you to the left. The Peace Commission's meeting place tent is to the right.<br /> <br /> Modoc in the Tulelake region in the eighteen forties, began objecting to an increasing stream of immigrants. Many pass through, but some stayed, and by the eighteen sixties had ranches or settlements in or near the basin. The Modoc felt crowded and threatened. The settlers feared the Modoc.<br /> <br /> Federal officials persuaded the Modoc to leave their land and live with their neighbors, the Klamath Indians.<br /> <br /> Though the tribes were similar and related, there was friction, so the Modoc returned to their traditional land on Lost River. Here Modoc leader Captain Jack wanted a reservation.<br /> <br /> Instead, settlers pressured the army to move the Modoc back with the Klamath Tribe. On November 29th, 1872, the cavalry from Fort Klamath entered the Modoc camp, ordering them to disarm and return to the reservation.<br /> <br /> Words, then shots were exchanged. One soldier was dead and seven wounded. The Modoc headed for the Lava Beds.<br /> <br /> At the same time, another band of Modoc, led by sub chief hooker Jim, was attacked. One Modoc was killed, so in their retreat along the north and east shores of Tulelake, the Indians killed every man they met. A total of 14. The Modoc met at the stronghold and waited.<br /> <br /> The army gathered strength, finally moving near and set up Gillems camp on January 16th, 1873. The next day, they attacked the stronghold, but because of the rough terrain and dense fog, the attack failed. The army suffered thirty seven casualties. Yet no soldier even saw an Indian.<br /> <br /> Modoc lost no one.<br /> <br /> The army reinforced while public opinion in the east forced the president to attempt reconciliation. A peace commission consisting of five men under General Canby was formed.<br /> <br /> Captain Jack's cousin, Toby Riddle, was married to a white man. She acted as interpreter.<br /> <br /> Little progress was made. The army was unable to promise Captain Jack a reservation.<br /> <br /> Captain Jack refused to surrender the Indians who killed the settlers. During a council in his stronghold, Hooker Jim and his followers taunted Jack into swearing he would kill Canby. At the next peace meeting, despite warning by Toby Riddle, General Canby and Reverend Thomas were killed, Meacham was shot and half scalped but survived when Toby Riddle yelled that soldiers were coming.<br /> <br /> Three days later, the Army attacked again, supported by mortars and howitzers.<br /> <br /> After two days of fighting, the Modoc situation was serious. They were cut off from water and harassed by shelling at night. During darkness, the Modoc withdrew and were loose in the Lava Beds.<br /> <br /> Pursuit brought more fighting and bloodshed.<br /> <br /> Hungry and divided by conflict over leadership, Modoc men, women and children began surrendering in small groups. For nearly five months the Modoc with fewer than 60 fighting men held off in Army 20 times their strength.<br /> <br /> It was the most expensive Indian war in the U.S.<br /> <br /> It was the only major Indian war in California.<br /> <br /> It was the only Indian war in which a general officer was killed.<br /> <br /> Continue on to view murals representing local landscapes.",

Clear Lake, Tulelake, Lower Klamath Lake and Mece Lake host the more than 400 species of wildlife.<br /> <br /> I realize that we live in one of the finest places on the planet, and one of the reasons for me is the abundance of wildlife that exist here, And also this beautiful symbiotic relationship between the farmers, ranchers and and the wildlife as being caretakers of the wildlife, if you will. But this is the heart of the Pacific Highway, and it's the greatest highway we have in the entire United States. And autumn here it is a sight to see with with millions of geese and ducks. Just to be in a swirl of geese, snow geese, cacklers, Canada geese and ducks and Springer odd animals. One of the finest sounds and sites that you can ever experience in a lifetime. Many times growing up and even recently, I've seen the sun literally darkened down here by geese, thousands upon thousands of them.<br /> <br /> Now, exit and turn left into the reclamation section.<br /> <br /> Established May 15th, nineteen oh five by the Reclamation Service, the Klamath project encompasses about two hundred and ten thousand acres of farmland and thirty thousand acres in the Tulelake and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuges.<br /> <br /> Included in the system are the Frank Adams Canal and then Brimmer Ditch, purchased by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1906.<br /> <br /> This was the twelfth reclamation project in the United States, but the largest of its time. Purposes included reclaiming land, storing and diverting water for irrigation and controlling flooding.<br /> <br /> The first water flowed to project lands on May 16th, 1907, while the Klamath Reclamation Project is very complex, its system is one of the most efficient in the world.<br /> <br /> The project initially cost the government fourteen point seven million dollars. That cost has been repaid by the users through their annual operation and maintenance bill. The economic benefits of the project continue to far exceed its original expense.<br /> <br /> Continue on to the World War One display.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Boston boomed after the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> opened in 1827. A cluster of outdoor exhibits features Boston’s canal era businesses, including its role in boat building. Boatyards produced the long, barge-like boats that carried passengers and freight. A play structure in the exhibit cluster lets people experience a scale model of a partial canal boat.<br /> <br /> This exhibit cluster is also a good location to see some basic features of the canal. The exhibits are adjacent to the towpath. Today, it is a popular <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">recreational trail</a>. Historically, mules and horses walked the towpath to pull canal boats. These sure-footed animals powered the boats, which did not have motors. The now-dry canal ditch is on the other side of the towpath from the exhibits. Workers dug it by hand to be 40 feet wide and four feet deep.<br /> <br /> During the canal heyday, about half of the boats on the canal were built in Boston and Peninsula. Boston had three boatyards in 1856, the year featured in a bird’s eye drawing of the village in the exhibits. The drawing shows a bustling boatyard on the far side of the canal from the exhibits, a blacksmith shop, and a lumberyard.<br /> <br /> Canal boats included passenger packets and cargo boats. The latter are featured in the exhibits. The size and shape of a canal boat was determined by the smallest lock, which on the Ohio & Erie Canal is 75 feet long by 15 feet wide. The wide, flat-bottomed hull of the boats provided maximum space for cargo while allowing the boat to operate in the canal’s shallow water. Crew and passenger cabins were located at the bow and stern of the boat, while a structure in the middle served as stables for the mules.<br /> <br /> Other businesses took advantage of the canal boom. Julian Edson had a sawmill and gristmill. Jim and Lucy Brown owned the Commercial Hotel, which stood in the location of MD Garage, as well as a small store.<br /> <br /> The Boston Land and Manufacturing Company opened across the street along the towpath in 1835. Notice how the building is not square. Its side façade parallels the canal. Its front façade parallels the road. As a result, it has a rhomboid shape. Today, it houses a store with food and gifts operated by the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>.<br /> <br /> Bring yourself into the past by imagining how the sensory experience of Boston would have been different from today. Imagine the banging hammer of a blacksmith; the smell of wet, steamed wood coming from a boatyard; and the sight of work men loading a canal boat and well-dressed passengers hurrying into Commercial Hotel.<br /> <br /> Fortune is fickle. While the town boomed in the 1830s, competition from trains had made an impact by the 1850s. By 1860, the Browns’ business ventures were over and a decade later, Edson’s had crashed as well. Boston would boom again. To learn more about that boom, cross the street to the exhibit adjacent to Boston Store or follow Boston Mills Road west over the Cuyahoga River to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>.<br /> <br /> To explore more canal era history, walk the towpath north less than 0.1 mile to Lock 32. An exhibit describes the role of locks in the canal system. Stumpy Basin, where boats could turn around or park, is one mile south along the towpath. Find comprehensive, family-friendly exhibits about the canal at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a>, located nine miles north along the Towpath Trail. It is open seasonally.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Boston Village. 439 words At this location the towpath crosses Boston Mills Road which runs through the village. As you face the street, to the right are three wayside graphic panels next to a half-size canal boat play structure. To the left is the wide, dry canal bed. The historic Boston Store is across the street on the right side of the towpath. The canal boat structure lies parallel to the path with its stern to the right. It has a single cabin at its left end and features a wheelchair-accessible cement deck. The panel at the side of the path closest to the structure is titled “Bustling Boat-Building Village.” It features a drawing of a bird’s-eye view of the village in 1856 showing a bustling boatyard on the far side of the canal from your current location, a blacksmith shop next to the road on that side, and a lumberyard across the canal from the Boston Store. Boston has three boatyards at that time. During the canal’s heyday, about half of the boats on the canal were built in Boston and Peninsula. The panel to the left of that one is titled “Building a Canal Boat” and has two touchable models of canal boats along its bottom edge. The model at left has only the hull, so you can feel the keel and ribs on the inside of the boat. The model at the right is a completed cargo boat with three cabins spaced along its deck. Text on the panel explains that the size and shape of a canal boat was determined by the smallest lock, which on the Ohio and Erie Canal is 75 feet long by 15 feet wide. The wide, flat-bottomed hull of the boats provided maximum space for cargo while allowing the boat to operate in as little as 36 inches of water. Crew and passenger cabins were located at the bow and stern of the boat, while a structure in the middle served as stables for the mules that powered the boat. The final panel is titled “Fortunes Rise and Fall” which discusses booms and busts of Boston and its citizens. Julian Edson built a business empire here that included a sawmill, a gristmill, and major land parcels. Across the street, next to Boston Store where the current-day M.D. Garage is, was the Commercial Hotel and tavern owned by Lucy and Jim Brown, who also owned a small store on this side of the street. By 1860, their business ventures were over and a decade later, Edson’s had crashed as well. By 1880 he was a saloonkeeper in Boston without any property. End of description.",

Under his leadership, The Morton Town Company filled articles of incorporation in 1877 and the site was selected (Section 27, Township 22, Range 23). The town was about fifty miles south of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nicodemus-kansas.htm\">Nicodemus, Kansas</a> another black homesteading community.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Thomas P. Moore led the migration and settlement of the town. On March 24, 1878, 107 black Kentuckians from Lexington and Harrodsburg arrived in southwest Kansas. Upon arriving in Kinsley, the nearest town with a railroad stop, they walked 30 miles to the future location of Morton City.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The group of Exodusters made land claims under the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/home/learn/historyculture/abouthomesteadactlaw.htm\">Homestead Act of 1862</a>, but the town never materialized. According to <em>The Republican</em>, by 1879 they had “put up a commodious frame building for a store and built half a dozen sod houses and dug-outs on the town site. But they could not make their farms and raise crops and build the town at the same time. They could not comply with the town site law…” (June 18, 1879, page 2)<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Some of the migrants moved to Jetmore, Larned, Kinsley, and other towns along the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad. But a second group of around fifty settlers joined the homesteading colony in April 1879.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Mrs. George Perry stated she “never could have imaged that there could be so beautiful and broad and free a country in the world, so different from anything she had ever seen or thought of in Kentucky. It seemed as if God had prepared it for colored people that they might come out from a land of trouble and live and enjoy it forever.”<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Subsistence farming was the goal of the community. Because of this the black homesteaders tended to plant less cash crops and had larger gardens than their white neighbors.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> A dream of free land spurred them on, but the lack of rain during 1878-1880 meant it was a tough time to be farming in southwestern Kansas. The drought was even more devastating for these new settlers since they had missed the bounty of 1877. It had been a great year for crops and the reason the had chosen the location.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Over time, most of the settlers moved away though some remained and lived out their lives on their farms. Many of the colonists saw the Hodgeman settlement as the first step toward freedom and economic improvement.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In 1932, the <em>Hodgeman County News</em> reported “one by one the ranks of our early day Colored Settlers are being thinned out until but few are left to recall their hopes and aims of earlier years, but, as we look back over the life of Mr. Harris we can well say, ‘Another Good Man has Gone.’”</p> <hr /> <h3>Additional Information</h3> <ul> <li>\"KANSAS.

As you walk, you will pass the ruins of Jarboe’s Store on your right. Lockhouse 25 is on the towpath which intersects with Edwards Ferry Road about 100 feet from the parking lot. Once you walk 100 feet, look for the dirt towpath on your left. If you reach the wooden bridge that spans lock 25 you have gone too far. The lockhouse will be 100 down the towpath on your left. The rectangular structure is made of bricks which are painted white. The door sits in the center of the wall facing you and is framed by two shuttered windows.

            "audioDescription": "(330 words) Lock 71 is located in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the parking lot off of Green Spring Road SE. The parking lot is laid out as a circle, but the parking spots don’t start until about 100 feet in from the turn off from Green Spring Road. In the first row of parking spots, on the side closest to the parking entrance within the circle, is a park bulletin board. Just to the left, is a little dirt walkway with a slight incline that veers to the left. This little 20-foot path leads to a grassy area along a watered section of the canal. Once on flat surface, walk about 20 feet forward and the canal will be about 30 feet away from your right. About 50 feet straight ahead is Lock 70. There is a small, 15-foot wooden bridge that crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Once across the bridge, walk about 5 more feet to get to the gravel towpath. Turn right to head upstream and walk 0.34 of a mile. Lock 71 will be to your right. It is about 5 feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge puts you on the other side of the lock on a grassy berm with the remnants of a bypass flume a few feet from the downstream edge of the lock. Across from the lock, on the other side of the towpath, is a two-and-a-half story white framed lockhouse. It is about 10 feet away from the towpath. End of description.",

At the lower left corner of the panel, a small black rectangle with the words, “You Are Here,” points to your location on the South Rim near the Village. The canyon extends north across the entirety of the rest of the panel, with the Colorado River winding top to bottom across the face of the panel. The rugged topography of the canyon walls, peaks, creeks and inner canyons continue all the way across to a small white dot in the upper right-hand corner, Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim. Text at the top left of the panel reads: Edge of Vastness Gazing upon this view, one is struck by the canyon's vastness. The mind struggles to comprehend it. Try to describe the canyon's size in words. Try to measure in your mind the canyon's depth, width, and length. Measurements like 1 mile (1.6 km) deep, 18 miles (29 km) wide, and 277 river miles (446 km) long leave us scratching our heads. Perhaps the best we can do is just feel the canyon's enormity. Measure yourself up against it. We are minuscule in comparison, but still, through the keen receptivity of our sense, we can appreciate Grand Canyon's immensity. A second aerial photograph inset at the bottom right shows an even wider view of Grand Canyon. The branch-like arms of the inner smaller canyons extend from the snaky path of the Colorado River. A small section of the map along the river has been highlighted in orange. A caption reads: Standing here, your view (shown in orange) is only a sliver of the whole Grand Canyon. Each Grand Canyon overlook you encounter offers fresh insight, from detailed close-ups of side canyons to sweeping panoramas. Search out and reflect on your favorite view.",

            "bodyText": "<p>On Sunday morning, September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Klan bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four girls. This murderous act shocked the nation and galvanized the civil rights movement.</p> <p>Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley were dressed in their \"Youth Sunday\" best, ready to lead the 11:00 adult service at the church, which since its construction in 1911 had served as a pillar for Birmingham's African American community. Only a few minutes before the explosion, they had been together in the basement women's room, excitedly talking about their first days at school. The bombing came without warning.</p> <p>Following the tragic event, white strangers visited the grieving families to express their sorrow. At the funeral for three of the girls (one family preferred a separate, private funeral), Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke about life being \"as hard as crucible steel.\" More than 8,000 mourners, including 800 clergymen of both races, attended the service. No city officials braved the crowds to attend.</p> <p>News stories circulated about symbolic incidents that occurred at the time of the bombing. For example, the image of Jesus' face was knocked cleanly out of the only surviving stained-glass window in the church's East wall, and the church clock stopped at exactly 10:22 a.m.</p> <p>The deaths of the children followed by the loss of President Kennedy two months later gave birth to a tide of grief and anger - a surge of emotional momentum that helped ensure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.<br /> <br /> In January 2017, it was named a part of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument by President Barack Obama. In October 2019 the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church was chosen for inclusion in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> for its enduring connection to the black freedom struggle. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors can walk in the basement where the 4 little girls gathered before the bomb detonated. Now, exhibits cover the walls, providing information on the history of the church, Jim Crow, segregation in Birmingham, and the lives of the children that were so suddenly and horrifically torn away. Sitting in the pews, visitors can appreciate the majesty of the enormous pipe organ. At the back of the church is the Wales Window - a gift from the country of Wales to the church after the terrorist attack on September 15, 1963. The stained glass image depicts a Black man with his arms spread wide, one hand pushing away, symbolizing the Black community's efforts to stop oppression and injustice. The other hand is palm-up and open, symbolizing the unfathomable ability to forgive in the face of so much hate. Outside the building, a commemorative plaque delineates the exact location the dynamite detonated all those years ago. Docents lead visitors on guided tours to the many spots of significance in and around the church. Pending completion, visitors soon will be able to enter a new, state-of-the-art museum exhibit in the former parsonage.<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network (AACRN) recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements. <br /> <br /> A project through the </em><a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/civilrightsgrant\">African American Civil Rights Grant Program</a><em>, which works to document, interpret, and preserve the sites and stories related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights, funded rehabilitation work at the 16th Street Baptist Church in 2018.</em></p>",

The committee met for the first time at the home of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-ingersoll-bowditch.htm\">Dr. Henry Bowditch</a> at 8 Otis Place on September 30, 1846. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/samuel-gridley-howe.htm\">Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe</a> became its first president. This group resolved to aid freedom seekers “declaring it to be the first duty of all governments to guarantee the safety of every individual on their soil, and that the abduction of a man from Boston should be felt as an alarming menace to the safety and personal rights of every citizen.”<sup>1</sup> This short lived committee assisted seventeen freedom seekers between November 1846 and April 1847.<sup>2</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>William Siebert, \"The Underground Railroad in Massachusetts,\" <em>American Antiquarian Society</em> (April, 1935) 40-41. <a href=\"https://ipswich.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/underground-railroad-massachusetts.pdf\">https://ipswich.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/underground-railroad-massachusetts.pdf</a></li> <li>Dean Grodzins, “Constitution or No Constitution, Law or No Law: The Boston Vigilance Committees, 1841-1861” in Matthew Mason, Katheryn P.

Stories and traditions of the Klallam and Quileute people tell us that American Indians maintained a long and intimate association with Lake Crescent. The lakeshore served as a meeting place, and area tribes gathered here to trade and join in ceremonies. On the right, a woman facing left stands on the lake shore. She has long dark hair pushed to the back, light brown skin, dark eyebrows and high cheekbones. She stares forward with a look of determination on her face. She wears a brown and black woven shawl, a mid-calf length skirt of the same material, and dark boots. A large open weave basket holding a piece of wood hangs down her back, supported by a decorated strap wrapped across her forehead. To the woman’s right at the water’s edge is a wooden canoe. Beyond, is the green-blue lake and mist shrouded mountains in the distance.",

These quick-growing trees add valuable nitrogen and humus to forest soils and prevent erosion. Eventually, western hemlock and western redcedars will tower above these short-lived hardwoods. Several centuries from now, a mature old-growth forest could stand here. The image shows two short, dark tree stumps, one on the left and one on the right, partially covered with green moss. The top of each stump is flat and horizontal exposing the reddish- brown wood on the inside. On the right-side edge are jagged, vertical splinters ripped from the tree as it fell. Reddish-brown wood chips are piled up at the foot of each stump. On the forest floor, green ferns grow around remnants of fallen trees.

Text on the right reads: Primeval Fir. Before it crashed to the ground, this Douglas-fir measured 35 feet in circumference. Can you guess how tall it grew? Across the trail, its contemporary still stands. Both trees took root in the ashes of fires that burned here 500 to 700 years ago. Douglas-fir seedlings often sprout after fire or wind has swept through the forest. The image shows a stormy forest scene with heavy rain falling diagonally. On the left, the trunk of a dark brown tree has split away from its base and is dropping to the right. At the break, the inside of the tree is revealed, its tan wood splintering under the force of the collapsing trunk. In the background, stand trees with long, thin branches and green needles.",

The trail has a flat gravel surface and winds its way through low growing ferns and tall trees. Along the trail is a three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel titled, Moments in Time Trail. The color image background on the panel is a lake with still water flanked on the right by a hill with tall dark pine trees and on the left and rear by the slope of a tall mountain. Text reads: Moments in Time Trail. Shaped by time and water, Barnes Point punctuates the south shore of glacially carved Lake Crescent. This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits. A trail map is provided below and at four other entry points. Please return it after use. These interpretive exhibits were provided by the Rob Reed and Lena Sharpe Memorial Foundation.",

Going left, it leads to a semicircular area bounded by a low stone wall with a wayside sign, titled \"Prairie Highway.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon pulled by oxen. The sign reads in part, \"Over 100 years ago, the gentle grassy depression in front of you was one of the most important highways in North America. Here, you'd see wagon trains on the Santa Fe Trail winding through a rolling landscape covered with thick, waist-high prairie grasses. Imagine thousands of trade wagons rumbling and creaking back and forth between Missouri and New Mexico. Wagons - and the hooves of the oxen and mules that pulled them - wore this road into the earth. By the 1840s, emigrants bound for Oregon and California Trails wore it even deeper. Here, the prairie is gone. Wind and rain have smoothed the rough dirt road into a gentle swale - a subtle reminder of a once-great highway.\"<br /><br />By moving around the stone wall and walking out onto the grassy lawn you may be able to feel the swale that crosses from left to right, although it is very shallow. About 40 feet out, on the other side of the swale, is a cement post with a small marker for the Santa Fe Trail.",

Average hiking time round trip is one and one-half hours. The path takes you to the edge of the Olympic wilderness. From a human-shaped world you are about to step into terrain dominated by other forces. There are five other short, easy Touch of Wilderness hikes in the park at Staircase, Pioneer Visitor Center, Soleduck, La Push and Ozette. Each trail enters a different environment: coastal, river and lowland forests, waterfalls and tidepools. To the left of the text is a black and white drawing of a tall waterfall cascading down a dark rocky slope to a pool below. Below the text, is the black and white pine branch and pinecone graphic logo for touch of wilderness.",

Text reads: Moments in Time Trail. Shaped by time and water, Barnes Point punctuates the south shore of glacially carved Lake Crescent. This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits. A trail map is provided below and at four other entry points. Please return it after use. These interpretive exhibits were provided by the Rob Reed and Lena Sharpe Memorial Foundation.",

Text on the left reads: Spruce Railroad. Imagine the continuous clank of steel upon steel echoing across Lake Crescent. To secure spruce lumber for World War 1 warplanes, a railroad was built in 1918 along the far shore of the lake. Soldiers and civilians toiled for five months, cutting two tunnels and laying rails in record time. The war ended just weeks before the railroad was completed, but it was used to haul timber until 1954. Today, a hiking and biking trail follows this route. On the right side of the panel, the front of a gray metal tube-shaped steam train emerges from a dark tunnel cut through a brown rocky mountain slope. The tunnel opening is framed on the top and sides with thick wooden timbers. The train travels towards us on two metal rails atop many squared off wooden beams laid perpendicular to the rails. On top of the train, a smokestack belches thick dark grey smoke. The flat face of the train is round with a smaller round door and headlight in the center. Below, is a platform with handrail, both the width of the train. On the bottom, a forward angled metal grill with vertical bars, slightly wider than the train tracks, almost touches the tracks. On the left side of the panel is the lake, its blue water and surrounding mountains partially obscured by thick light gray mist.",

Crowning the birds entire head is a cap of bright red feathers that end at the back of the head in an upward pointing crest. Its round eye is yellow, and its tan beak is long and pointed. Above the eye is an upward curving white stripe. Below the eye, beginning at the beak, a bold white stripe runs to the back of the head, then curves downward ending at the chest. Under this stripe on the bird’s cheek is a patch of red, then below this, another white strip on the underside of the head.

Here, a brown river otter crosses the stream from right to left, its two front feet in the stream and its hind feet on the stream bank. The otter is long and narrow with a long thin tail, flattened head with a small dark oval shaped eye, and a small, rounded ear set back on the side of the head.

            "audioDescription": "Station Road Bridge River Access. 244 words The Cuyahoga River Water Trail access at Station Road Bridge is located on the west bank of the river. The mowed path to the river access starts in the southeast corner of the parking lot at Station Road Bridge Trailhead. There is a sign at the beginning that states vehicles are prohibited. Closer to the river access is another sign that provides directions on “River Use and Hazards.” The access point is to the left of the sign. There are large rocks to use as stepping stones down to the riverbank. The terrain is flat through the field and becomes uneven as you approach the river access. The path does get muddy after wet weather. When you reach the access point, the river will be in front of you. The ground is dirt with different sized rocks along the bank. The area to the direct right and left of the access point is steep and has grass and trees. The Towpath Trail is visible directly across the river. Station Road Bridge is visible downriver to your left. To your right is an open flat area with loose rocks and dirt with Chippewa Creek beyond. To the right and behind you is a dark blue sign that has the Cuyahoga River Water Trail logo with “Station Road Bridge.” Underneath the text on the sign is a lighter blue shaded area with the number “21.0” indicating the river mile.

A chalkboard notes the cost to rent a boat. A wooden and concrete pier, stretching out into the lake, has a railing on each side up until the last 10 feet.

            "audioDescription": "Storm King Ranger Station. 4 minutes From the parking lot, a flat path leads to the log cabin Ranger Station. The building is two-stories with two second floor A-shaped dormers sitting midway up the wooden shingled roof. A red brick chimney extends above the roof in the center of the building and a grey, stone chimney on the cabin’s right wall rises above the roof line. A raised front porch with four steps and handrails provides access to the centrally located front door. Windows trimmed in white are on either side of the door. Attached to the cabin and directly adjacent to the door on the right and left, are wooden boxes holding park brochures and other information. Inside, the wooden walls of the cabin are reddish gold in color with prominent dark scattered knots. The wood floor is similar in color. In the center of the room, interpretive material such as tactile casts of animal footprints and touchable animal pelts are laid out on a table with chairs. Hanging on the wall is a black and white historic photograph of nine women and five men aboard a long white wooden boat sitting low in the water. A canopy covers two-thirds of the boat. The boat engine’s chimney rises above the canopy. The women wear ankle length, high collared, long sleeve patterned dresses and wide brimmed hats. The men wear white long-sleeved shirts, dark vests, and pants. One woman holds a guitar. A sign below the photograph reads: Lady of the Lake. Ferries were the only means of transportation at Lake Crescent during the turn of the century. Lady of the Lake, one of the ferries, transported passengers and goods from the East Beach area to Fairholme. It could reach a speed of eight miles per hour and frequently stopped at resorts around the lake. Ferries remained in service until shortly after 1922, when the road around the south shore was completed. A taxidermied trout also hangs on the wall, its pointed mouth opened, exposing sharp teeth. The skin of the trout is gray on top, pink and lightly spotted on the side, and light tan on the belly. Along the spine are two fins and along the belly, four fins. The V-shaped tail fin is spotted. A sign below the fish reads: Beardslee Trout. The Beardslee trout brough considerable acclaim to lake Crescent as early as the 1890s. A subspecies of rainbow trout, it is unique to the lake. The tout is named after Admiral Lesley A. Beardslee who initiated scientific interest in this species. The trout on display weighed 16 ¾ pounds. The largest Beardslee ever caught tipped the scales at 23 pounds. Next to the text is a small black and white photographic portrait of a man from the shoulders up facing slightly left with the caption, Admiral Beardslee. He is light complexioned with a dark, bushy moustache, thick dark eyebrows, close cut gray hair, and dark eyes. His dark jacket has a tall collar adorned with two white stars and an anchor. His black hat has a round side band with military insignia on the front, flat crown, and short front brim. Next to the sign is a taxidermied owl with brown and white feathers, big, round, dark eyes, and a short yellow beak.",

Other exotics were accidentally introduced and now nearly a quarter of the Olympic Peninsula’s plant species are non-native. Park biologists monitor the spread of these plants and try to remove those that present the greatest threat to natural ecosystems. The man has dark hair and beard and wears a green National Park Service ballcap, a white sweatshirt, green pants, brown boots and leather gloves. He is grasping the top of an orange, long handled tool with a horizontal hook at the end. Standing with his feet apart, he hooks the trunk of the small tree at its base.

She stands under a tall, wooden-lattice gate-like structure looking out toward the ferry. At the top of the structure is the word, Rosemary, reversed, so it may be read correctly from the water. Text reads: Imagine yourself here in 1920, traveling by paddle wheel ferry across lake Crescent. From the deck you view a gateway announcing “Rosemary,” a rustic inn bordered by several handcrafted cabins. Today, Rosemary houses Nature Bridge, and educational facility offering environmental learning programs for students of all ages.",

Text on the left reads: Early Logging. Can you find the clues? Notched springboard holes and flat-topped stumps indicate these ancient giants were cut during the early 1900s. Using only hand tools, woodsmen relied on springboards to lift them above the buttressed bases of large trees. Steam donkeys, horses or ox teams pulled the downed logs along greased skid roads. The image shows two men, one on each side, of an extremely large reddish-brown tree, standing on boards that have been inserted into the tree above ground level. The men wear brimmed hats, button-down long-sleeved shirts, pants, and brown leather boots. Each man holds one end of a long saw that spans the inside of a large, angled notch cut into the tree. Scattered on the ground in front of the tree are pieces of wood sawn from the notch. To the left of the men is a tree stump, its top smooth on one side and jagged on the other. Bits of woods lay around the stump. In the background is a dense forest of uncut trees, green moss hanging from the limbs.",

Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with a slot for dropping one of two registration payment receipts into an individual square. Low and to the left of the board is a brown box with a lid holding campground registration envelopes. Standing in front of the board on the left is a 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing the envelope with payment. On the face of the cannister, at the top, is a slot for slipping in the envelope.",

            "audioDescription": "466 words<br />Along the dirt path near the south wall of the fort there is a slanted graphic panel mounted on the side away from the wall. Standing facing the panel gives a view back across the remaining bit of the original open space at this end of the fort which is now partially taken up by the long mound which is the sand and vegetation-covered front of Battery Pensacola. Along the left is the line of arched openings along one of the fort's south walls, ending at the bastion located at the west-facing point. Sitting on top there, pointing to the west, is a huge black cannon mounted on a rust-red metal carriage.<br /><br />At the bottom of this panel is a historical photograph showing a group of men around a large cannon mounted on a large metal carriage and pointing to the left. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"A gun crew at Fort Warren in Boston, Mass., loads a Rodman. The cannon, designed by Thomas Jefferson Rodman, was first cast in 1860.<br /><br />Labels on the photograph identify the different elements. One stands at the rear of the large cannon, where its diameter is almost equal to his height. He leans over to look at a small rod sticking up for the top of the cannon. The label reads, <br /><br />\"Gunner using sight to aim cannon.\"<br /><br />At the front of the cannon one man holds a long rod with a round black sponge on its end. Next to him two other men pass a white sack which holds the powder charge. Another man stands waiting below the cannon's bore holding the long ramrod. Near the rear of the canon four men hold a metal bar, two at each end, with a large cannon ball attached to the middle.

            "bodyText": "<p>By the late 1700s and early 1800s, Spain extended its New World Empire by establishing permanent settlements on the west coast of North America. In order to colonize Alta (Upper) California, the Spanish constructed presidios (forts) and missions. In total, the Spanish established four presidios and 21 missions throughout Alta California. The Carmel Mission (San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo Mission) was the second of Spain’s missions and is today a National Historic Landmark. As at many of the historic Spanish missions that still exist throughout California, visitors can tour the restored Carmel Mission.<br /> <br /> On June 3, 1770, Captain Gaspar de Portola and Franciscan Father Junípero Serra founded the Carmel Mission and the Presidio of Monterey beside Monterey Bay. Over the course of the next year, presidio soldiers often mistreated the local American Indians living in the area. The American Indians, who associated the mission with the presidio, became leery of Father Serra and his attempts at converting them to Christianity.<br /> <br /> In August of 1771, Father Serra moved the mission to nearby Carmel because it offered better agricultural land and a safer political environment for the growing mission. In this new location, the mission thrived. It was closer to fresh water and land more suitable for growing crops. Importantly, it was removed from the tense environment surrounding the presidio. While construction progress was slow at first, the mission eventually had temporary structures including dwellings, a storeroom, and a wooden church.<br /> <br /> Carmel Mission became the headquarters for Father Serra and Spain’s expanding California mission system. From Carmel Mission, Father Serra directed the building of seven other missions in California. Father Serra passed away at the mission on August 28, 1784. Today, visitors to the restored Carmel Mission can see the room in which Father Serra slept and where he passed away. Father Serra’s grave is below the mission’s present church altar.<br /> During Father Serra’s time at Carmel Mission, the mission buildings were of wood and mud and then eventually of adobe. These first structures were temporary and lasted only as long as their roofs could protect them from the elements. In 1793, Father Lausen, Father Serra’s successor, supervised the construction of a more permanent stone church, which visitors to the mission can see today.<br /> <br /> Laborers quarried sandstone from the nearby Santa Lucia Mountains to construct the church on the site of the original adobe church. The church has two dissimilar towers flanking a round-arched portal. The bell tower, which exhibits Spanish-Moorish influence, has a dome surmounted by a wrought iron cross. At the height of its use, the church had as many as seven large-scale side altarpieces, over 20 statues, and a large crucifix flanking statues of Our Lady and St. John. The church’s interior wooden tunnel vault, shaped in a parabolic arch, is unique among the California mission churches. The church is also unique because it was the first of three California mission churches built from stone – the rest of the mission churches are of adobe.<br /> <br /> The mission continued to thrive under Father Lausen’s leadership. He directed the construction of additional adobe buildings around the property. Today, the reconstructed mission buildings sit on top of the foundations of those Father Lausen directed to be constructed. Father Lausen passed away in 1803 and rests beside Father Serra.<br /> <br /> By the early 1820s, a series of events negatively affected life at the mission. Sickness, death, and depredation by the military overwhelmed the mission throughout this time. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and Alta California became a part of Mexico. The Mexican government did not have the necessary financial resources to maintain the mission system as the Spanish had done. By 1834, the Mexican government secularized the mission system and began the process of converting church property to private property. Mexican citizens who were helpful during the war for independence and new settlers coming to California bought most of this property. Due to the secularization of the missions, the American Indian converts and Spanish Fathers left Carmel Mission and the mission’s buildings faced deterioration and decay.</p> <p>Many of the mission’s adobe buildings returned to the earth, becoming piles of mud, while the church’s roof collapsed leaving the interior exposed to the elements. By 1859, the United States government, which was now in control of California, returned the missions’ lands to the Catholic Church. Carmel Mission lay in ruin. Restoration of the mission began in 1884 when private funds provided a new roof for the church. By 1936, private funds and church funds became available for a full-scale renovation of the property. Over the next two decades the mission’s buildings were rebuilt and restored, and in 1961, it was designated a Basilica. A Basilica is the highest honorary rank for a church and implies great historical and artistic importance.</p> <p>Today, visitors to the restored and reconstructed Carmel Mission will see the mission, with its complete quadrangle courtyard. Only part of the mission buildings date from the 18th and 19th centuries while others are of more recent construction but still in the California mission style. Many of the church’s interior furnishings are original. In 1851, Monterey Pastor Father Villarasa removed the church’s statues, paintings, and other artifacts when the church’s roof showed signs of collapse. The Old Presidio Chapel in Monterey then used the furnishings until the early part of the 20th century when they returned to Carmel Mission. Visitors to the mission will also see California’s First Library (founded in 1770) that contains Father Serra’s 400 year-old Bible.<br /> <br /> Carmel Mission, a National Historic Landmark, is located at 3080 Rio Rd. in Carmel, CA.</p> <p> </p>",

The pluton started out as an intrusive body of magma and has a convoluted contact with the Green Creek Complex. It is the youngest rock at City of Rocks and formed about 28 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike the granite of the Green Creek Complex, the Almo pluton has an equigranular texture. Notice in the photograph the small uniform size of the crystals in the Almo pluton in contrast to the variety of sizes in the Green Creek Complex. <br /> <br /> Both types of granite are cut in many places by dikes of pegmatite, a very coarse-grained granitic rock that usually forms during the last stages of crystallization of a large granitic pluton. The pegmatites at City of Rocks contain large quartz and feldspar crystals about the size of a fist. </p>",

When this happens, the rock fractures. <br /> <br /> The presence of joints allows water to infiltrate the rock and makes the granite vulnerable to weathering.

The name comes from not only the bloodshed, but also the 'dead space' offered by the angle, meaniing that anyone in this postiion would not be visible to those in the earthworks above. Still visible today, this bulge or 'salient' in the Confederate defenses was where roughly 8 regiments (over 1,000) of Union soldiers concentrated their attack. Making it past the various field fortifications, the Federals make it to the top of the 8 foot tall earthen works and the fighting dissolves into hand to hand combat, with men using their muskets as clubs. Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry writes \"My pen is unable to describe the scene of carnage and death that ensued in the next two hours...talk about other battles, victories, shouts, cheers, and triumphs, but in comparison with this day's fight, all other dwarf into insignificance.\"<br /> <br /> Despite the 'carnage', the Confederate line held. Lieutenant Thomas Maney of the 1st Tennessee writes 'the word passed down to us to hold the works at all hazards, and it did look as if we would be pushed back by sheer force. But stand we must, and stand we did.\" The Union soldiers attacking both sides of the angle would fall back, but the ones assaulting the angle itself would dig in directly below the works, taking advantage of the 'dead space'. Today, the Illinois Monument marks that position. <br /> <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "Walking along a wide dirt path, low earthen mounds run along the left side. At this location, the mounds begin to curve in the opposite direction, creating an 'angle. Directly opposite of the 'angle' is an informational wayside sign describing the location, with a painted depiction of the battle. Just beyond the sign is the 25ft high marble Illinois Monument. This location is located at the peak of a gently sloping hill, which overlooks a large field at the base. Around the trails and field is heavily wooded.",

While many of the other soldiers who perished here were reinterred in soldier's cemetaries, this young man's remains were missed. They were discovered in the trenches near this location in early 1934 by the Work's Progress Administration (WPA) as part of a trail building project. His remains were moved to this current location in order to be closer to the trail. A ceremony was held to honor his service and memory on July 1st, 1934 and his casket was lowered into the grave draped in both a U.S and Confederate flag. His grave sits directly in between in what was both the Union and Confederate lines.<br /> <br /> From an exerpt reflecting on the 'Unknown' by Walt Whitman: \"And everywhere among these countless graves - everywhere in the many Soldiers Cemeteries of the Nation ... - as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories of slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles - not only where the scathing trail pass'd those years, but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land - we see, and see, and ages yet may see, on monuments and gravestones, singly or in massess, to thousands or tens of thousands, the significant word..

They found Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on the Outer Banks to be the right area to test their gliders.<br /> <br /> COLUMN OF IMAGES:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph that shows two men standing, in dark clothing, holding their hats to their head, another man sitting on the ground wears much lighter colored clothing and is to the right. In the background, is the shadowy figure of another person in the distance. The men are looking towards the sky as a large glider flies past them overhead. The area close to the men is hazy, indicating that the sand is being blown by a strong wind.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Wind helped with lift.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph of a pilot lying prone on a glider as it sits on a sandy surface.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Sand provided a soft landing.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #3: Black and white photograph of the sandy dune. There is a lone group of trees in the distance and a few patches of grass in the foreground.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The isolated location offered privacy from the public.",

Spanning the width of the panel, at the bottom, is a graphic depiction of the first four flights, their times and the distances they traveled.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: In front of you is a flat, grassy area. The entire first flight line, with markers, can be seen from this spot. Looking towards the left is the large first flight boulder. Straight ahead are the markers for the first 3 flights, spaced relatively close to one another. Looking towards the right, in the far distance, is the 4<sup>th</sup> and last flight marker.  <br /> <br /> TEXT: The Wright Brothers made four successful sustained powered flights the morning of December 17, 1903. The commemorative granite boulder and replica monorail mark the lift-off point of those four flights, the numbered markers the terminating point.Since soft sand prohibited launching with conventional wheels, the Wright Flyer was place on a 60-foot monorail with its landing skits resting on a wheeled truck. Once the engine started, the Flyer was released and slid down the rail until it gained enough speed to lift into the air.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: A black and white photograph showing the 1903 Flyer in preparation for flight on the launching rail. In this image, the full flyer can be seen, and a man dressed in a suit and wearing a hat is standing at the front of the flyer.<br /> <br /> GRAPHIC IMAGE: This graphic shows each flight and its path with different types of lines with small rises and falls in elevation. The path for the first flight is small dots and shows the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 120 feet. The path for the second flight is a small dashed line showing the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 175 feet. The third flight path is a longer dashed line showing the flight lasting 15 seconds and traveling 200 feet. The fourth flight path is a heavier, longer dashed line showing the flight lasting 59 seconds and traveling 852 feet.",

When the Wright Brothers were here, Big Kill Devil Hill – the hill in front of you- was a massive sand dune. Thousands of times, the brothers trekked up this and three nearby dunes to conduct glider experiments.Climbing the hill was strenuous. Deep, soft sand caused every step up the slope to slip part-way back down. The Wrights were also burdened with carrying their heavy gliders up the hill for each flight. Their tireless efforts paid off as they mastered their flying skills and refined their flight controls.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph showing a glider with a pilot flying from the dune. The flyer is angled, as if turning. A big sand dune can be seen in the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Wrights mastered flight controls with their 1902 glider.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph showing a man pushing a plow behind a donkey. They are working on a sand dune. In the foreground is bunches of grass ready to be planted.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Starting in 1929, workers planted grass to stabilize Big Kill Devil Hill so the Wright Brothers Monument could be built on top.",

The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The top half of the panel features a large black and white photograph that fills the whole background of the panel. The bottom half of the panel has 3 columns. The first column has text and the next two columns each have a black and white photograph with a caption.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Behind this wayside is a paved pathway up to the Wright Brothers Memorial. The hill is covered in grass and shrubs. The view is looking up the hill towards the side of the monument.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND IMAGE: A black and white photograph of 4 men carrying a glider up a sand dune. Two men are holding the gliders wings, while the other two are holding the front and read sections of the glider. A fifth man stands to the left of them in the image. He is wearing a dark suit and a hat. Waves are crashing into the shore in the distance behind the men.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Friends and surfmen from the nearby US Life-Saving Station helped the brothers carry their gliders up the dune.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Big Kill Devil Hill. When the Wright Brothers were here, Big Kill Devil Hill – the hill in front of you- was a massive sand dune. Thousands of times, the brothers trekked up this and three nearby dunes to conduct glider experiments.Climbing the hill was strenuous. Deep, soft sand caused every step up the slope to slip part-way back down. The Wrights were also burdened with carrying their heavy gliders up the hill for each flight. Their tireless efforts paid off as they mastered their flying skills and refined their flight controls.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph showing a glider with a pilot flying from the dune. The flyer is angled, as if turning. A big sand dune can be seen in the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Wrights mastered flight controls with their 1902 glider.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph showing a man pushing a plow behind a donkey. They are working on a sand dune. In the foreground is bunches of grass ready to be planted.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Starting in 1929, workers planted grass to stabilize Big Kill Devil Hill so the Wright Brothers Monument could be built on top.",

The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” There is text across the top third of the panel and the wayside background is a photograph of the First Flight sculpture with callouts describing the statues surrounding the flyer.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: This wayside overlooks the back of the first flight sculpture, which is positioned on a sandy surface and surrounded by green grass. From here, the sculptures of the 5 witnesses can be seen. From left to right the sculptures closest to this spot are Johnny Moore, Adam Etheridge, W.C. Brinkley, Willis Dough, and John T. Daniels (standing next to a sculpture of a camera). In the near distance, closer to the flyer are Orville Wright (on the flyer) and Wilbur Wright (next to the flyer).<br /> <br /> TEXT: Among Friends. Resourcefulness, tireless work ethic, dedication, and importance of family – these words describe both the Wright Brothers and Outer Banks residents. Through these shared traits, the Wrights and their Outer Banks neighbors developed mutual respect and lifelong friendships.They worked and dined together, socialized, and even discussed flight theories. When the Wrights achieved flight, their friends were there to lend a hand and witness history. The descendants of the first-flight witnesses still live in the Outer Banks and are active in the First Flight Society, the long-time park partner.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: A colored photograph fills the panel. The view is from behind the flyer in the sculpture. From left to right, the statues surrounding the sculpture are Johnny Moore, Adam Etheridge, W.C. Brinkley, Willis Dough, Orville Wright (on the flyer), John T. Daniels (Standing behind a camera), and Wilbur Wright. In front of John Daniels is a small bench, where the flyer’s wing rested before taking flight.<br /> <br /> TEXT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT:<br /> <br /> Johnny Moore. A sixteen-year-old boy who lived his whole life on the Outer Banks as a hunting and fishing guide.<br /> <br /> Adam Etheridge. A member of the US Life-Saving Service at Kill Devil Hills. He became a life-long friend of the Wright Brothers and took care of their camp buildings when they left Kitty Hawk in 1903.<br /> <br /> W.C. Brinkley. A lumberman from Manteo. He happened to be at the Kill Devil Hills US Life-Saving Station when the Wright Brothers signaled the crew to come over and assist with the flyer.<br /> <br /> Willis Dough. A member of the US Life-Saving Service at Kill Devil Hills. He witnessed and assisted the Wright Brothers in their later 1908 flights when they returned to Kitty Hawk for the last time together.<br /> <br /> Orville Wright. Orville piloted the first flight on December 17, 1903: 12 seconds, 120 feet.<br /> <br /> John T. Daniels. A member of the US Life-Saving Service at Kill Devil Hills, he took the famous photograph of the Wright Brothers’ first flight.<br /> <br /> Wilbur Wright. Wilbur steadied the wing, then let go as the flyer lifted off.",

The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The panel features full panel image of an artistic rendering of the 1903 flyer as if the viewer is looking down the rail at the back of the flyer taking off. On the bottom left is a small block of text and on the bottom right is a large block of text.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Directly in front of the wayside is the reconstructed launching rail. Forty feet ahead is the first flight boulder and in the distance the first flight line.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: The panel is filled with a large colored drawing of the 1903 flyer as if it were in motion about to lift off. The view looks down the length of the launching monorail at the rudder and rear of the flyer. The propellers are blurred, indicating movement. Orville can be seen lying down, piloting the flyer in the center, while Wilbur is running along the right wing, holding on as it takes off. There are callouts pointing to the dolly, located below the flyer, and the Launch rail, which is below the dolly.<br /> <br /> TEXT #1: The Launch Rail & Dolly. The soft sand was not a good “runway.” The brothers build a 60-foot wooden rail with metal stripping to provide a hard and smooth surface for takeoff. A dolly of wood and bicycle hubs was placed on the rail to hold the flyer above the sand as it accelerated forward to liftoff.<br /> <br /> TEXT #2: Getting off the Ground. After four years of scientific research and rigorous experimentation, and with their 1903 Flyer on the rail, the Wrights are set to fly. In unison, they each pull down on a propeller. The engine roars to life and the propellers whip through the air; only a restraining wire keeps the flyer in place. Orville climbs onto the machine and positions himself into the hip-cradle. He releases the restraining wire and the machine slowly moves forward. Wilbur runs alongside to steady the machine. After traveling 40 feet down the rail, the flyer lifts into the air, ushering in the Age of Flight.",

Ripley, between 1847-1864. With a gabled slate roof, segmental arched openings, and louver blinds, the building is considered one of the best surviving examples of the American Cavalry Caserne Style.  <br /> <br /> Building 19 had multiple purposes including stabling horses and housing an x-ray lab and cryptography unit for sending and receiving coded messages, but its main purpose was storage of lumber. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{119de09f-ead7-491f-9a90-088a3b1541ba}{93}\" paraid=\"1500787812\">Making gunstocks was a tedious process that required the wood be air dry for 2-8 years, until it reached the proper moisture level, to ensure that when they were carved or worked on the lathes the wood wouldn’t crack or warp. At the Armory the primary wood used to make gunstock blanks was Black Walnut as it is a hard, dense wood that is resilient and when it is seasoned (dried) it doesn’t shrink much and isn’t prone to splitting. Because of the length of time necessary to season the wood, thousands of blanks needed to be properly stored for drying at a single time. At full capacity Building 19 could hold up to six hundred thousand gunstocks.  <br /> <br /> As warfare and the manufacturing of arms changed, research labs, workshops, garages, machine shops, engineer branch, and housing for mechanical systems were added.  <br /> <br /> Built in four separate phases, the Long Storehouse I, Long Storehouse II, Stables, and West Addition were added as the need for storage increased. After each addition the name of the building changed to represent the new purpose and design. Names included “Brick Timber Store House,” “New Store House,” and “Gun Stock House.” By early winter of 1863 construction was completed bringing Building 19 to its current length of 764 feet. <br /> <br /> When the Armory closed in 1968, the building remained vacant until Springfield Technical Community College (STCC) took over the building and used it for storage. Between 1981-1983 the Springfield Police stabled their mounted unit in the building. In 2018 the building was renovated into a student center in 2018 the STCC.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{74f7b0d7-9442-447b-a162-6cb60523de67}{2}\" paraid=\"1250495411\">Today while the building serves a different purpose, one can still hear the individuals milling about and experience the beauty of a building that was essential to the operation of Springfield Armory.  </p>",

            "bodyText": "Confederate artillery, especially in this position, played a key part in the defense of Cheatham Hill. Major General Benjamin Cheatham (for whom this location is named) planned his defense very strategically. As early as June 24th, Cheatham would order the batteries \"to be closely masked with brush and under no circumstances to reply to the artillery of the enemy'. This strategy would be effective in essentially keeping the Federals in the dark as to where the Confederate artillery was and what kind of artillery they had. As a result, when the thickly amassed column of Union infantry approached during the battle on the 27th, they made it to within 60 yards of this position without knowing any cannons were there at all. Cheatham writes \"The advance was nearly all swept down by the first volley, the remainder being driven in confusion into the ranks of the assaulting mass\". Also, this and the batteries on the right and left of it created a deadly crossfire for the upcoming infantry, creating chaos. This 2 gun section was commanded by John W. Mebane, under Liutenant J. W. Phillips. The guns in this section were most likely 12 pound Napoleans, just like the ones that sit here today. ",

Closer to the cannons is a small wayside interpretive sign giving some information on this position during the battle.",

First, the bars were heated in a reverberatory furnace to make them malleable. Next, the bars went through pairs of rollers, dense iron cylinders with a small gap between them. This reshaped the bars into flat stock. These \"flats\" could be used to make wagon tires, saw blades, and other products.<br /> <br /> Many of the flats were sold as they were, but others were reheated in the reverberatory furnace and put through the next set of machinery; the slitters. The slitters are a pair of interlocking discs that spin in opposite directions. When a heated flat is forced between them, the discs break it up into many smaller rods of iron. These products were primarily used for making nails, and were therefore called \"nail rods.\"<br /> <br /> Both flats and nail rods were semi-finished goods that helped a blacksmith save a lot of time, and therefore save money.</p>",

MWSA originated as a stand-alone organization that worked closely with regional and national organizations. By the 1880s, towns and neighborhoods across Massachusetts created smaller branches that reported to the main organization in Boston.<sup>1</sup> First headquartered at 3 Tremont Place, the MWSA offices moved several times throughout its long history; later office locations include 3 Park Street, 6 Marlborough Street, and 585 Boylston Street.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>MWSA members used a variety of tactics to garner support for the suffrage cause, from petitioning the state legislature and speaking at hearings to creating broadsides and holding lectures. Its early efforts led to the success of women gaining the right to vote in school committee elections in 1879.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the MWSA stood as one of the largest state organizations in the country. New leaders shifted the organization’s tactics to more public and direct action, such as outdoor rallies and suffrage parades.<sup>4</sup> One of these actions included “Suffrage Bluebird Day” in 1915, during which suffragists posted thousands of metal bluebirds on fences, trees, and public spaces in towns and cities across the state to gain support for their cause.<sup>5</sup></p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/22bff295-5e9e-455c-b400-5a83c54e0178\"><img alt=\"A suffrage bluebird that reads votes for women nov. 2\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/22bff295-5e9e-455c-b400-5a83c54e0178/thumbxlarge.png?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 20%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Suffrage Bluebird, MWSA's symbol in 1915.

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2021 St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church, now New Calvary Baptist Church is locally signifiant as it tells the story of Ukrainian immigration to Wilmington, Delaware at the turn of the 20th century. It futher holds distinction as the first purpose-built Greek Catholic Church in Wilmington. The building also illustrated the experience of an Affrican American congregtion in Wilmington after the disruption of slum clearance, failed urban renewal development, and related demographic transitions in the Southbridge neighborhood over the course of the 20th century. St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church is an excellent example of early 20th century vernacular Ukrainian religious architecture in Wilmington, Delaware. The church was constructed in imitative materials, using ornamental concrete block and decorative pressed sheet metal. The building’s period of significance begins with its construction in 1909 and extends to 1970.<br /> <br /> St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church served as the focus of religion, life, and culture for much of Wilmington’s Ukrainian immigrant community from 1909 until 1968 and functioned as the backdrop for religious, political, and identity-related battles waged at the local level--but with origins in national and international developments. Following World War II, many ethnic Ukrainians moved away from South Wilmington, leaving the Southbridge area for newer housing subdivisions on Wilmington’s outskirts. With swelling membership, St. Nicholas sought space for a new church out of the city core and closer to the population centers of its parishioners. The congregation purchased property at the corner of Miller Road and Lea Boulevard in 1963 and completed construction and moved into their new church in 1968. In 1969, the St. Nicholas parish sold its building on South Heald Street to the African American congregation of the New Calvary Baptist Church. Soon after the New Calvary Baptist congregation purchased the building and began to adapt it to suit the requirements of their worship practices. The new location offered New Calvary leadership the opportunity to expand its ministries for the church and surrounding community, including programs for children of the church and services for the community in Southbridge and beyond.",

            "bodyText": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The dominating feature of Springfield Armory National Historic site is the Main Arsenal (Building 13) with its clock tower and overview of the Armory Grounds. Springfield Armory was established as a Federal Armory in 1794 under George Washington. <br /> <br /> As Springfield Armory underwent the transition from an Arsenal to an Armory after the American Revolution, the Armory began expanding as it was no long just storing firearms, but manufacturing them. Additional buildings were added to the Hill Shops, the Water Shops were built and development occurred at Federal Square to aid in the production of firearms. <br /> <br /> Constructed between 1847-1850 under Major James W. Ripley, the Main Arsenal faced scrutiny during its construction; it cost $86,066 to build the Arsenal.  It was built to be centered between the Paymasters Residence and the Master Armorer's Residence, making it just askew from the walkway to the Administration building across the Green. Ripley would plant trees to make it less obvious. The Main Arsenal was built to reflect the power of the United States Military and it expressed an authoritarian and practical nature ensuring the building would command the Green and the Armory complex, as it does today. <br /> <br /> The Main Arsenal, with its expansive interior, was used to store firearms. A unique feature of the clock tower is the self-supported spiral staircase that goes up six floors to the base of the flagpole. The staircase has no central support column, but rather the supports for the staircase are built into the walls.  Before automobiles, the main entrance allowed for horse-drawn carriages to drive through the tower where Armory workers would load and unload firearms. In 1941 the wood doors were shortened when a loading dock was added to allow delivery by trucks. <br /> <br /> In 1960 the Main Arsenal was designated as a contributing building to the Springfield Armory Historical Landmark and in October 1974 it became a part of the National Park Service as Springfield Armory National Historic Site. Today the Main Arsenal serves as a museum which tells the story of the workers, technological innovation, the evolution of firearms, and the impact the Armory had on Springfield, the surrounding communities, and the United States. <br /> <br />  In 1852, when Springfield became a city, the Armory was incorporated into the city seal. While the City has built up around the Armory, the impact and significance of the Armory remains firmly rooted, which can be seen by gazing upon the Main Arsenal as it sits atop the hill overlooking the City of Springfield. </span></p>",

The building was designed in two phases as a vernacular expression of Art Deco by William Edward St. Cyr Barrington, a local architect. The building possesses integrity of design, materials and workmanship. It retains its original massing having no exterior additions, its original buff brick walls with dark brick decorative detailing, and its integrated brickwork reflecting the Art Deco style.<br /> <br /> Within a year of the building’s 1938 opening, the popularity of bowling as an inexpensive form of entertainment enticed the property owners to add a second story and additional lanes to the Brookland facility. This addition, designed by Barrington, was seamlessly executed, providing little indication that there was an addition to the original one-story building. The Brookland Bowling Alleys was largely a bowling alley, although it also offered amenities including a barber shop and “luncheonette.” As completed in 1939, the building included 28 duck-pin lanes on both floors, described in press accounts as being very popular with local bowlers. The Brookland Bowling Alleys operated for twelve years, from 1938 until 1950 when a major fire destroyed the interior of the establishment. Barrington was again engaged for his design services to restore the building. The interior was renovated, but this time around, as a wholesale store for electric lighting, parts and appliances for Atlantic Electric Supply Corp., a company that still occupies the building today.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The forge is where bars of pig iron created at the blast furnace were changed into a new kind of iron that a blacksmith was able to use. The bars of pig iron were first brought to the finery hearths. Here, they went through a complex process where portions of the bar were melted and allowed to cool multiple times. This helped burn off much of the excess carbon in the bars, which had made them too brittle to work with. Eventually, the red hot iron was consolidated into a mass called a bloom, which was removed from the hearth for further work.<br /> <br /> Workers used sledge hammers to break off a shell of impurities that formed during the refining process. After consolidating the bloom a bit with the sledge hammers, the workers used a 500 pound trip hammer to further solidify the iron and change it into a more easily managed shape. The iron was first shaped into a rough brick called a loop. The loop was then hammered in the center to stretch it out. The iron had to be red hot for this to work, so it was reheated in the chafery hearth in the later steps of the process. Eventually, the iron was hammered into a semi-finished product called a merchant bar.<br /> <br /> While the pig iron bars were made of cast iron, and could not be worked, these merchant bars were now made of wrought iron, and could be heated and reshaped. Merchant bars were the main product that the iron works created and sold to blacksmiths. The blacksmiths are the ones who made finished products out of them.</p>",

A large photo of a green dogwood tree leaf is found on the right of the exhibit panel. Two small photos are found above it. One of the photos features a dogwood flower and its caption reads, “Pacific dogwoods usually flower twice each year, in both spring and fall.” The second photograph features a small, compound red and black-tipped berry on a background of green foliage. Its caption reads, “The dogwood’s showy reddish-orange seed clusters provide a feast for songbirds.” The main text of the exhibit panel reads, “The Pacific dogwood’s leaves are extravagantly large for trees that grow where summers are dry. These wide leaves use much more water than a conifer’s small, waxy needles. But near this mountain meadow, the water they need is available. The melting winter snowpack provides water in spring and early summer. Long taproots help dogwoods access water deep in the soil when the snow is gone. Pacific dogwoods rely on cool temperatures to keep their leaves from losing too much water. Their leaves hang downward to shade the trunk and branches. If an opening in the canopy allows too much sunlight to hit the trunk, the sunlight stimulates the growth of new leaves to provide more shade.”",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Hopi pueblo of Awatovi was already over 300 years old when Spanish explorers arrived there in 1540. Led by Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, the Spanish were searching for the legendary golden cities with hopes of bringing wealth back to Spain. What they found instead was a harsh, arid country dotted with native towns, a region isolated from the populated Rio Grande Valley. The first of the Hopi settlements the Spanish came across in Arizona was the Awatovi pueblo. Years later, the Spanish returned to Awatovi to establish a mission. Today, the Awatovi Ruins in Keams Canyon is a National Historic Landmark on the Hopi Indian Reservation in northeastern Arizona.</p> <p>The Coronado expedition left Mexico in 1540 and headed north with a company of over 300 Spaniards, 1,300 Mexicans, and both Native and African slaves. As they trekked through the desert, Coronado ordered one of his men, Pedro de Tovar, to lead a party of seventeen horsemen and several footmen in search of seven Hopi villages. Awatovi was the first of these villages Tovar and his men discovered. Upon contact, the Hopi and Spanish briefly skirmished, and then exchanged gifts before the de Tovar party moved on. The arrival of Coronado’s men in Awatovi marked the first exchange the Spanish had with the Hopi in Arizona. Afterward, contact between the Spanish and the Hopi was sporadic over the next 90 years, until Spain began to establish missions in the region to create a permanent European presence. The Hopi had no food surplus or wealth of gold or silver treasure, and their land was not a strategic place to establish a military presence, so the Spanish had no interest in living among the Hopi for any reason other than religious conversion.</p> <p>During the Spanish colonial period, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries brought Catholic and European values to North America on behalf of the Spanish crown. The Roman Catholic Church was charged with spreading Catholicism. The missionaries founded parishes near American Indian villages where they could make Christian converts, attempt to control the culture, and help administer Spanish law. In 1629, the year Spain launched large-scale missionary efforts in the Southwest, Franciscans founded a mission church at Awatovi. The Franciscan fathers at Awatovi named their mission church San Bernard de Aguatubi, after Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.</p> <p>According to the records of a New Mexico missionary, the Franciscans at Awatovi struggled to persuade the Hopi to convert until a miracle occurred. The Hopi brought a blind boy to Father Francisco Porras and asked the father to heal him. The legend goes that Porras held his cross to the boy’s eyes curing his blindness. Afterward, a large portion of the Hopi at Awatovi converted, but others mistrusted the Catholic fathers and worried that they would not be able to keep their own essential rituals. During the 17th century, Awatovi hosted the largest mission of any Hopi pueblos and was home to a population of roughly 900 Christian Hopi in 1664.</p> <p>In addition to Catholicism, the Franciscans brought European tools, domesticated animals, new agriculture, and trade opportunities to their southwestern missions. At Awatovi, the fathers gave the Hopi iron knives, axes, mattocks, picks, crowbars, saws, and chisels as well as knowledge of Spanish wood and stone-working techniques. The Hopi also adopted animal husbandry. They acquired and began raising sheep, which provided a new source of protein and wool for making textiles. The Spanish introduced new crops, including peaches and wheat, which the Hopi incorporated into their diet. The Hopi territory also became part of a trade route that a wagon train traveled through three times a year. This wagon train gave the Hopi at Awatovi access to goods from Mexico, Europe, and Asia.</p> <p>The residents of Awatovi were an anomaly among the Hopi, and the town’s open acceptance of Christianity led to its destruction. Beyond Awatovi, other Hopi villages rejected Spanish culture and Catholicism. Only four missionary outposts existed in the Hopi province beyond Awatovi and they did not have Catholic fathers in residence. The Awatovi Hopi built their new church on top of their kivas, adobe structures Puebloans used in spiritual rituals. Despite the apparent abandonment of pre-contact religious practice, some native residents at Awatovi resisted the missionaries. A Hopi traditionalist poisoned one of the Awatovi mission’s founding fathers in 1633. During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Hopi killed the fathers and razed the church at Awatovi.</p> <p>Even so, when the Spanish returned to take back Awatovi in 1692, the Hopi welcomed them and invited them to reestablish the mission. Despite the instances of resistance on the inside, the anti-Spanish Hopi sacked the pueblo in 1701. These Hopi wanted to purge their province of Christianity and the Hopi who accepted it to ensure the survival of their own religious practices. They completely destroyed the pueblo and killed all the men at Awatovi during the attack sparing only the unbaptized women and children who had knowledge of Hopi rituals and songs. The survivors were separated and sent to the surrounding Hopi villages. In retaliation, the Spanish attacked the Hopi several times over the decade following the destruction of Awatovi, but were unsuccessful in reclaiming the Hopi province. Since Awatovi, the Hopi have not hosted a Roman Catholic church or parish on their land.</p> <p>In the 20th century, Awatovi proved to be a valuable archeological resource. During the 1930s, a group of experts from Harvard University carried out the first multidisciplinary study in American archeology at the ruin. Involved in the field study were geologists, surveyors, cartographers, photographers, bone and ceramics experts, artists, and ethno biologists. They excavated over 1,300 rooms, discovered 11,700 stone and bone artifacts, and catalogued 8,500 pottery specimens in addition to recording over half a million potsherds. They also identified three Franciscan churches, two of which were over 100 feet long. In order to preserve Awatovi Ruins for future research and enjoyment, the site is not open to the public.<br /> Awatovi Ruins, a National Historic Landmark, is located south of Keams Canyon on the Hopi Indian Reservation in northeastern AZ. Awatovi Ruins is closed to the public. The Hopi Reservation welcomes visitors.

The limestone bluff in front of you first appeared on a 1732 French map as pierre a fleche, which means the “rock of arrows.” As a landmark on the river, it guided westward travel by water and wagon for trade and settlement.</p> <blockquote> <p><br /> “Our company crossed the Missouri near the Arrow Rock Ferry on the first day of September 1821…”<br /> -William Becknell</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The Arrow Rock is part of the Santa Fe Trail story. When William Becknell’s party crossed the river here in 1821 heading west to trade, a new era in American history began. For some, the trail brought wealth and opportunity. For others, the trail caused loss of life, land, culture, and resources.<br /> <br /> Today, the river no longer flows in front of the bluff. Use this painting to imagine a completely different scene with the hustle and bustle of a riverport and town.</p> <h4>Site Information </h4> <p>The Arrow Rock Ferry Landing was put on the list of the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2013, and Rich Lawson, who owns the property with his wife, Debbie, is looking to add more richness to Arrow Rock's history.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://arrowrock.org/about-discover-arrow-rock/\">More Site Information</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2021, The Pittsburgh Branch House of the International Harvester Company is a significant example of a regional branch house for sales, distribution and service of agricultural implements and motor trucks, initially for the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and then for the International Harvester Company. Under the direction of Cyrus Hall McCormick, Jr., the site and plan for the branch house building were selected in 1901. In August 1902, the International Harvester Company (IHC) was formed by the merger of McCormick and four other harvester manufacturing concerns. The building was constructed in 1902 as one of the final acts of the company and is one of the earliest assets of the newly formed combination. The Pittsburgh Branch House is significant for its innovation in commerce and agriculture sales as well as its identifiable architecture features. The Pittsburgh Branch House is an example of the Classical Revival style that was widely used to convey International Harvester’s brand and success. In the first decades of the twentieth century, IHC embarked on an intensive campaign for national expansion. The addition to the building and its overall reconfiguration in 1913 is a representative of this effort. The company’s national campaign was successful, and the Pittsburgh Branch House was ranked among the top IHC branches in the country.",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2020, The Stone Manufacturing Company is a locally significant example of a garment manufacturing facility and an important element of the diversified industrial growth in postwar Columbia, South Carolina. The history of the building represents the growth of undergarment manufacturing in the city and the rise of Stone Manufacturing from a small, South Carolina business to an international manufacturer. Beginning as a five-person operation in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1933, Stone Manufacturing expanded rapidly across the state in the postwar period, beginning in Columbia and eventually adding ten additional plants in the southeast. Eugene E. Stone III and his wife, Allene “Linky” Wyman Stone, were integral to the development of the mid-twentieth century garment industry and its success in South Carolina. By inventing the clipper foot, a device used to cut thread via foot pedal, Stone was able to increase the rate of production and generate garments more quickly than his competitors. Stone Manufacturing became one of the most successful apparel companies in the world. Its presence in Columbia reflects the industrial growth of the city in the immediate postwar period when the city’s Industrial Service Bureau worked to attract diverse businesses from across the nation to establish facilities in the area. <br /> <br /> The company’s founder, Eugene E. Stone III, originally worked in a small clothing factory where he was inspired from there to begin his own company. Eugene alongside his wife, purchased five sewing machines and opened Stone Manufacturing Company on River Street in Greenville with five seamstresses. By the end of the 1930s, Stone Manufacturing’s profits were growing, as was its operation. The company added to its product line, now manufacturing slips, panties, dresses, aprons, dustcaps, and sunsuits in addition to their original line of bloomers. By 1940, their sales had continuously grown at an annual rate of one-third, proving that their low cost, yet high-quality products were incredibly profitable. With the United States’ entrance into World War II came allotments on production for the war effort, but also diversification of products. While Stone Manufacturing had to allocate twenty-five percent of its business for contracts with the government, the company began manufacturing items they had never made before, such as mattress covers. The production of materials for the war effort certainly buoyed the company’s success, but the changes in clothing preference among veterans set up Stone Manufacturing for further achievement. While serving their country overseas, soldiers wore government-issued boxer shorts, a new style of undergarment. Eugene Stone correctly surmised returning veterans would drive demand for commercially produced boxers. It was the introduction of men’s undergarments that led Stone to purchase the Columbia facility in 1948. <br /> <br /> Following Stone Manufacturing’s expansion to Columbia and the addition of the men’s underwear line to the business, the company began rapidly expanding. The building grew multiple times to accommodate the surge in demand for men’s undergarments. The increase in manufacturing space in 1949 and 1950 allowed the plant to become one of the largest producers of underwear in the world, while the 1960 office space additions provided space for logistics and distribution. After expanding to Columbia, Stone Manufacturing brought plants to the towns of North, Norris, and Johnston, South Carolina, and Fair Bluff, North Carolina. The company also constructed a new plant and headquarters in Greenville at Cherrydale. The Cherrydale plant continued to grow and in 1956 became the world’s largest apparel plant. While Cherrydale served as the firm’s headquarters, the Columbia plant was the company’s most important satellite location. As the company’s first expansion and its second largest producer, Columbia ranked highly in the firm’s hierarchy. The Columbia plant’s role in coordinating company logistics also made it critical to Stone Manufacturing’s success. Stone Manufacturing created an inventory of more than six million seasonal garments. The largest known in the United States and a clear indicator of the company’s sustained growth. The company eventually became the largest manufacturer of men’s and boys’ underwear in the world. The company ties into both Columbia and South Carolina’s earlier textile industry and its shift to garment production with synthetic fibers. It is a testament to the progression of Columbia’s textile-based manufacturing throughout the twentieth century.",

Their redoubts so low, the cannon's mouth nearly on the ground, and at every discharge a blaze of fire sprang out among the dry leaves, which were soon ablaze and eating their way toward the gully, which was full of a mass of human beings, squirming around... Ah, but little can a peaceful citizen imagine the horror of war...At this stage our colonel, Will H. Martin, sang out, \"'Boys, this is butchery,\"' and, mounting our head logs, with a white hankerchief, he sang out to the Yanks as well as to our own men, \"'Cease firing and help get out those men.\"' Col. Martin's actions would save the lives of many Union soldiers in that incident. In a show of respect for this act of humanity, one of the Union officers would present Col.

Located in Solomons, where the Patuxent River joins the Chesapeake, the museum is a focal point for the many visitors coming to the area.</p> <p>Exhibits tell the story of the region's fascinating past and present. Fossils from millions of years ago show how a shallow ocean once covered what is now the Chesapeake Bay. Other exhibits depict human life along the Patuxent from the seventeenth-century to the present with over five hundred artifacts and photographs, including a twenty-eight-foot three-log canoe, a tobacco press, and boats from Solomons shipyards.</p> <p>Fifteen aquariums, from 50 to 3,500 gallons, explore the aquatic life of the Chesapeake estuary, displaying plants and animals from the salty waters of the Bay, and the fresh water of the upper Patuxent River. The museum exhibition building includes three permanent exhibits focusing on these themes: Miocene era fossils, a 13-tank aquarium that shows marine life from the Patuxent River and Chesapeake Bay, and a maritime collection that includes two lighthouses and a 113-year-old bugeye that takes visitors out on the Patuxent River. The museum also includes an oyster house, small craft shed, and carving shed.</p>",

It was like there was a force field separating us. It was not there to see, but it could be felt.”<br /> Arthur Loren Williams<br /> <br /> War Relocation Authority workers and their families – more than 400 people – lived within the same barbed wire fence that confined 11,000 Japanese Americans. But those government workers enjoyed higher pay, better apartments, and freedom.<br /> <br /> What was it like to live here?<br /> <br /> “When people are thrown together day after day and at the end of the working hours still find themselves in each other’s presence, there is no way, short of a deep and lasting coma, for them to ignore their fellow man,” Manzanar music teacher Lou Frizzell wrote. “In time, this constant awareness makes everyone decide that everyone else is a little peculiar, and I suppose everyone is.”<br /> <br /> Children of the staff “were all in the same boat,” according to Art Williams, whose father was assistant police chief. “There was no ‘new kid on the block’ barrier to penetrate. Everyone lived in similar housing.” Older WRA kids road a school bus six miles north to Independence, while many younger ones attended school in Manzanar.<br /> <br /> Some WRA staff and Japanese Americans established close working relationships and even friendships. Staff attended churches and funerals, and enjoyed sporting events, movie nights, and “Symphony Under the Stars” in the firebreaks.<br /> <br /> What became of the buildings?<br /> <br /> The WRA structures were built to a higher standard than the barracks that Japanese Americans lived in. Until the early 1950s, the apartments were rented to locals to help alleviate the post-war housing shortage. The buildings were later sold and moved to local communities, where many remain.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Kiʻilae Village offers a glimpse into the past, when Hawaiʻi was changing rapidly, but still supported traditional aspects of daily life. With the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, many things changed. New plants and animals were introduced and settlements began moving away from the coastal villages to the more fertile uplands and larger harbor cities. What remains in Kiʻilae today are abandoned house sites, agricultural features, animal pens, and salt pans that can be seen from more recent times.<br /> <br /> It is not known exactly when Kiʻilae village was established, but it may have been inhabited as early as the 1600’s due to availability of water, fishing grounds and upland fields. Indigenous knowledge points to the early settlement at Kiʻilae as a place where <em>kahuna</em> (priests) trained. By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Kiʻilae had a population of approximately 100 people consisting of about 10 extended families.<br /> <br /> Unlike the difficulty assigning a beginning date for Ki‘ilae Village, the end of its occupation is well documented. By 1913 only one family remained in coastal Ki‘ilae, and sometime the 1930’s the last full time resident moved away. Its depopulation was largely the result of a changing economy that focused increasingly around the mauka areas near the current Māmalahoa Highway. Green (1993:534) explains the changing economy and shifting population with the following:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>The improved belt road around the island, which provided access to trade centers, effectively isolated the shoreline settlements, causing much of their population to move inland nearer to the road and the kula garden areas.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>So, it seems that the change in community pattern along this coast was triggered not only from the evolution of transportation in the area, but also a change in the economy from a barter economy to a “work-for-money” economy.<br /> <br /> As you continue along the trail into the heart of Kiʻilae village, remember to stay on trail and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect these sites.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "As the trail continues down the coastline, walls begin to appear on the mauka (mountain) side of the trail, these enclosures are the former house sites of Kiʻilae Village. Trees and brush obscure almost everything besides the walls and the trail at this site.",

That's a <em>hōlua </em>sledding track. <em>Heʻe hōlua</em>, \"sled surfing,\" or \"land sledding,\" was a popular sport in Hawaiʻi. A hōlua slide was made of dry-laid local stones taking advantage of the natural inclines or hills to create a long-sloped ramp that was then covered in fresh soil and reeds making a slick surface which was then lubricated with <em>kukui </em>(candlenut) oil.<br /> <br /> Individual riders rode down the slide on a <em>papa hōlua</em> (sled), often reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (96.6 kph) The papa hōlua was carved from wood and was long and narrow in shape with two runners held apart by crosspieces. Two smaller rails sat on top of the crosspieces and acted as a platform. The whole sled was lashed together with coconut fiber. The sled could be as long as 14 feet (4.3 m) and weigh as much as 50 pounds (22.7 kg). See a replica of a papa hōlua in the bookstore at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> The papa hōlua's design allowed riders a choice of different riding techniques on their journey to the bottom of the slide, with two techniques being the most popular. Riders using the first technique would stand sideways on the papa hōlua, kick with one foot to launch themselves, and then put both feet on the sled and extend their arms for balance – much like a modern snowboard rider. Sliders using the second technique would jump onto the papa hōlua chest-down, face forward, and grip the narrow sled tightly for control. Both techniques allowed skilled sliders to steer the papa hōlua by shifting their body weight. Control of the papa hōlua was essential as a mistake or loss of control meant injury or possible death.<br /> <br /> He'e hōlua was a prestigious sport in the Hawaiian Islands. It was played mostly during <em>Makahiki</em>, the four-month winter New Year's celebration in honor of the <i>akua </i>(god) Lono, and only the Hawaiian <i>ali'i</i> (chiefs) were allowed to compete in the races.<br /> <br /> Would you be brave enough to test your skill on the papa hōlua?</p>",

            "bodyText": "The Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant, located at 7200 North Peters Street in Arabi, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, was completed in 1923 as a branch plant for the assembly of Ford automobiles in the Gulf South region. Historically about 16 acres and later expanded to 27.8 acres, the property was strategically located at the Mississippi River and adjacent to railroad lines to transport parts and finished automobiles to and from the plant. The plant includes two contributing buildings: the assembly plant (1922-23) and the oil pump house (1922-23), both of which were designed by industrial architect Albert Kahn. The plant is a sprawling, 227,000-square foot structure constructed of reinforced concrete and steel that housed a variety of functions, including assembly operations with a moving assembly line, a showroom, offices, and warehouse storage.<br /> <br /> The Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant was constructed as one of over three dozen branch assembly plants that Ford established throughout the United States between 1911 and 1932, nearly all of which were designed by the firm of industrial architect Albert Kahn. A new concept in automobile production at the time, these plants were devised to address the company’s distribution problems in the face of rapid sales increases. Rather than shipping completed automobiles from Ford’s headquarters in Michigan, which was unwieldy and expensive, unassembled parts were sent to branch plants throughout the country to be assembled on site. The completed automobiles were then shipped to local and regional dealers or overseas to international markets. At the same time, Ford also established branch agencies focused on sales and servicing. The assembly plants acted as miniature factories for the agencies to supply parts needed to make timely repairs. These new localized nodes of production, sales, and servicing created a more efficient and streamlined system, enabling Ford Motor Company to provide more comprehensive customer service, better target regional demand, and offer lower price points to its growing customer base than ever before. Soon enough, virtually “every other car in the United States [was] a Ford,” including in the New Orleans area, and the assembly plants were a key cog in the company’s success.  <br /> <br /> The Arabi plant closed for a year when Ford ceased production of the Model T in 1927 and began production of the new Model A. The facility reopened once it was updated to assemble the new model and, in 1929, it broke production records with an average output of 300 cars per day. In November 1929, at the dawn of the Great Depression, Ford was optimistic that 1930 would be its busiest year ever. Surveys at that time indicated that Fords comprised 48 percent of all automobiles sold in Louisiana, 52 percent in Mississippi, and 58 percent in Alabama. And indeed, 1930 and 1931 were strong years for the Arabi plant, but it was not enough to survive the Depression, and in December 1931 the plant was shuttered. It reopened briefly in 1932, prompting business leaders to celebrate it as a “signal of better times,” and in early 1933 Ford sales increased an incredible 386 percent in the New Orleans area, but it was not enough to keep the plant operational. <br /> <br /> In 1933, the plant ceased assembly operations and was converted into a Ford parts and distribution center. During World War II, the port quartermaster of the United States Army leased it as a warehouse. After the war, it continued as a parts and distribution center until the early 1970s, when it was sold to Southern Service Inc., an importer of Toyotas and Mazdas supplying the Midwest market. From 1977 until 2005, the building held freight storage for goods such as coffee and twine. It flooded in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and sat vacant for about a decade. Today, it is leased as storage for the film industry.<br />  ",

This area is the birthplace of three future United States presidents, and the only two brothers to sign the Declaration of Independence and is rich in natural and cultural history awaiting your exploration!<br /> <br /> At George Washington’s Birthplace National Monument, the institution of slavery is an integral part of daily interpretive programs. Specific programs depict the lives of the 20 enslaved African Americans and four indentured servants who worked at Pope’s Creek Plantation where George Washington was born in 1732. Their work consisted of cooking, household chores, farming, weaving, and woodwork. There is a representative slave quarter exhibit in the Colonial Kitchen. Interpretive rangers describe George Washington’s attitude toward slavery, from inheriting approximately a dozen enslaved persons when he was an adolescent, to manumission of his enslaved workers in his will in 1799. To support these programs, the park uses resources such as wills and inventories to show the names and monetary value of the enslaved people who worked for the Washington’s.</p> <p>The park also interpreters and educates visitors about the institution of slavery at Pope’s Creek Plantation. The park provides a site bulletin about the institution of slavery and either the Washington family, or George himself. The park has hosted special events, including one on Juneteenth and one on Labor Day to interpret portion of African American history. The education specialist with the help of the interpretive staff developed a middle school program about the institution of slavery and the influences it had on the social, economic and cultural world of George Washington. </p>",

It was the last island added to the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Most of the park was established in 1970 but a 1986 act of Congress authorized the inclusion of “approximately 200 acres of land at the mouth of Chequamegon Bay known as Long Island” into the park. The island is composed almost entirely of sand and has no obvious bedrock pedestal beneath it. Perhaps most importantly, Long Island (at least for now) is not an island at all! It changed from an island to a continuous part of a peninsula many times, usually persisting in one form or the other for a few decades. It is presently part of a peninsula and has been since the mid-1970s.</p> <h4><b>Getting There</b></h4> <p>Public access to Long Island is by private boat, water taxi, or kayak. The land on the peninsula east of the park boundary belongs to the Bad River Nation. The tribe controls and limits use of their lands. Water depths are very shallow at all approaches to the island. Most visitors beach their boats.<br /> <br /> No maintained trails exist on this island. In spite of challenging access and lack of facilities, the island remains a popular place for summer activities like swimming, sunbathing, picnicking, and walking on the beach.The island has one designated campground, located about one half mile southeast of the LaPointe light station. The site includes a picnic table, bear resistant food locker, fire ring, and privy. A permit is required to camp here.</p> <h4><b>One Island… Two Lights</b></h4> <p>Long Island is the only Apostle Island to have two active navigational lights. In 1858, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/long-lights.htm\">LaPointe lighthouse</a>, a one and one-half story wood frame dwelling with a short square tower on the roof, was built on the north shore of Long Island as the second lighthouse in the Apostles. In 1997, the U.S. Lighthouse Board replaced the original lighthouse with two new towers, one to the east and one at the end of Chequamegon Point to the west of the first lighthouse. The new LaPointe light tower is a 67-foot-tall cast iron cylinder, while a 42-foot pyramidal skeletal tower stands at Chequamegon Point. By 1987, beach erosion near the foundations of the Chequamegon Point light tower forced the U.S. Coast Guard to move the tower about 100 feet back from the shore. The move damaged the tower – the beacon now rests on a nearby modern cylindrical structure.</p> <h4><b>Unique Habitat</b></h4> <p>The wide undisturbed beaches on Long Island are not only attractive to people but are the only places in the state where a small endangered bird successfully nested in recent years. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/piping-plovers-on-the-move-apis.htm\">Piping plovers</a>, sand colored shorebirds, arrive on Long Island in late April to early May to lay their eggs in shallow nests. Well camouflaged eggs and young may go unnoticed to visitors.</p> <h2><b>FYI</b></h2> <p>Island visitors must be aware of the following:</p> <h4><b>Closures</b></h4> <p>Fencing protects piping plover nests from predators and human activity. When you arrive at an area that is closed due to piping plover nesting activity, you may see a metal fence enclosure (approximately 12 feet across) surrounded by signs and a twine fence (approximate 100 feet across).</p> <h4><b>Poison Ivy and Deer Ticks</b></h4> <p>Long Island is the one place in the national lakeshore where poison ivy is common. The short plant, with clusters of three leaflets, is scattered across many of the vegetated dunes on the island.Deer ticks, common on Long Island, can transmit Lyme disease and Ehrlichiosis. If you notice a rash, flu-like symptoms, or joint pain following a tick bite, call your physician.</p> <h4><b>Park Rules</b></h4> <p>Long Island visitors are subject to the same National Park Service rules and regulations that apply in the rest of the national lakeshore. Particularly note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Respect all areas fenced or posted for the protection of wildlife.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dogs must be on a leash six feet or shorter at all times – 36 CFR 2.15 (a) (2).</p> </li> <li> <p>Permits are required for camping – 36 CFR 1.6 (g) (1).</p> </li> <li> <p>Visitors MUST pack out all trash.</p> </li> </ul>",

Overflows from the vent soon consumed the landscape and filled both ‘Ālo‘i and ʻAlae craters. Majestic lava falls plunged 80 feet (24 m) over ‘Ālo‘i crater’s rim. As thin sheets of crust slid over the brink of the falls, thermal updrafts tore them from the flow’s surface; they floated down like autumn leaves blowing in the wind. Lava lakes within the craters overflowed with each new surge from Maunaulu—adding layers and elevation to the surrounding terrain. The dimpled lava mound that grew above ‘Ālo‘i crater is visible to the discerning eye. It sits on Maunaulu’s right flank and rises 260 feet (80 m) above the pre-eruption level.<br /> <br /> <em>‘Ālo‘i crater, named for the favorite pig of Kahawali, chief of Puna, was filled during the eruption. When Kahawali refused to race with Pele, she (in the form of lava) chased him to the sea. </em>",

It is a small island of only 1.1 miles in width and has 8.3 miles of shoreline. A unique and controversial lighthouse history lead to the island having not one, but two lighthouses. Camping, hiking, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">boating</a>, and history await you on Michigan Island.</p> <h4><strong>Camping and Hiking</strong></h4> <p>There is one <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">campsite</a> available on Michigan Island that can be reserved on <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/251865\">Recreation.gov</a>. A one mile sand spit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking</a> trail starts behind the light station at the vault toilets and goes to the sand spit and campsite on the southwest corner of the island. A small dock is available for boats below the lighthouse at a first come first serve basis. </p> <h4>Lighthouse</h4> <p>The story of the Michigan Island Light Station embodies the sweeping changes overtaking the Lake Superior region during a turning point in history. Living at a light station was much like it was at an isolated rural farm in the nineteenth century. Food and supplies had to be brought in by boat or else produced or collected on the island. Hunting, fishing, and berry picking throughout the islands was common practice. In the late 1800s a tramway was built to help haul supplies up the incline to the lighthouse from the dock. Roswell Pendergast, Keeper from 1869-1874, planted exstensive apple, cherry, peach, plum, and pear trees in the 1870s, and in the twentieth century the Lane family maintained and expanded the orchards. NPS staff have re-planted and maintain these orchards for visitors to enjoy. </p> <h4><strong>A Change In Plans</strong></h4> <p>There are two light towers at Michigan Island. One was supposed to be built somewhere else and the second originally was elsewhere! The original plans called for the lighthouse to be built on Long Island, to guide ships to the port of LaPointe, on Madeline Island. Since LaPoint harbor was on the west side of the island, the lighthouse inspector suggested placing the light on Long Island, where it would be visible to ships approaching from the east. However, for reasons that are not completely clear, a Lighthouse Service official ordered a last-minute change of plans, and the lighthouse was built on Michigan Island, instead. Made of rough stone, its exterior walls stuccoed and whitewashed, the new lighthouse combined a small, one-and-a-half-story keeper's dwelling with a low, conical light tower.<br /> <br /> The light on Michigan Island entered service in the spring of 1857, but was closed after only one year of operation. Evidence suggests that higher authorities in the Lighthouse Service repudiated the rash decision of their field representative, and ordered the hapless contractors to go back and erect a new lighthouse at the planned Long Island location. For more than a decade, the Michigan Island tower sat vacant, and in the harsh Lake Superior climate, it quickly began to deteriorate. In 1869, however, authorities decided that a lighthouse on Michigan Island might actually be useful, so $6000 was appropriated to repair the building and relight the light. The refurbished light was equipped with a three-and-a-half order Fresnel lens.</p> <p align=\"left\">Fifty years later, an effort began to place the Michigan Island light in a higher tower. When the Lighthouse Service discontinued operation of the Schooner's Ledge light on Pennsylvania's Delaware River near Philadelphia, the cylindrical steel tower was disassembled and brought to Wisconsin. Originally built in 1880, the tower was transported to Michigan Island in 1919, where it sat on the beach, awaiting assembly, for another ten years. The light station experienced a series of improvements in 1928 and 1929. A brick building was constructed to house an electric generator, a radio fog beacon, and a hoist engine for a tramway; a new keeper's dwelling was added; and the relocated tower was finally assembled. At 112 feet in height, the new tower became the tallest lighthouse in Wisconsin.</p> <p> </p> <h4><strong>Lamps and Lightkeeper Ed Lane</strong></h4> <p>As technology changed, each Michigan Island keeper had to learn to adapt. The first lamps burned lard oil, then in 1880 came the switch to kerosene, also known as mineral oil. In about 1914, the incandescent oil vapor lamp added air under pressure to kerosene. The fine vapor burned brighter in a mantle and used less fuel. The Michigan Island Light converted to electricity in 1929 when the new steel tower was put into use.Ed Lane was the light keeper at Michigan Island from 1901 until he retired from the U.S. Lighthouse Service in 1939, when the lighthouse board ceased to exist. This is the longest period of time that any keeper spent at a single Apostle Islands light station. On October 29, 1929 Ed noted in the lighthouse logbook,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Put window shades and worked in old tower. Started up new tower at sunset. Everything in good shape, but station looked odd, the old tower being dark for the first time in navigation in 60 years.\"</p> </blockquote> <p> The U.S. Coast Guard took charge of all American lighthouses starting in 1940. A young Coast Guardsman, Elseworth Riske, moved into the quarters formerly occupied by the Lake family. Though the uniform changed, much remained the same.The Michigan Island light was automated in 1943. The Fresnel lens was removed from the tower in 1972 and is now on display in the National Lakeshore Visitor Center in Bayfield. </p> <h4><strong>Visiting the Light Station</strong></h4> <p>Visiting Michigan Island can be a challenge. Only the most experienced private <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">boaters</a> and sea <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm\">kayakers</a> should consider attempting a trip to this lighthouse due to the great distance and exposed location. Even when lake conditions permit approach, the exposed location of the dock often makes landing impossible. Volunteers are usually available for Memorial Day - Labor Day for tours. </p> <p> </p>",

It is the farthest from the mainland and the most remote of the six Apostle Islands light stations. Visiting Outer Island can be a challenge. Only the most experienced private boaters and sea kayakers should consider attempting a trip to this lighthouse, due to the great distance and exposed location. Even when lake conditions permit approach, the exposed location of the dock often makes landing impossible. There is one <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">campsite</a> on the southern sand spit and primitive camping is also available. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">Hiking</a> is available on the island. There is a 7.5 mile Sandspit Trail that connects the campsite near the sand spit on the south end of the island with the light station on the north end, and a 1.5 mile trail leading the historic Lullabye logging camp. </p> <h4><b>Outer Island Light Station</b></h4> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/lighthouses.htm\">Outer Island light</a> was lit October of 1874 and is known as a “Poe Tower” for a series of lighthouses built in the Great Lakes region during Orlando Poe’s tenure with the Lighthouse Board. He recommended a lighthouse be built on Outer Island to mark the eastern edge of the Apostle Islands. As a member of the Light House Board, General Poe put his labors into helping save lives by directing ship traffic throughout the Great Lakes with his Italianate style influence looking lighthouses. The “Poe style” is known for its brick structures and graceful embellishments with hooded arched windows, support corbels, and curved brackets. People who worked with Poe marveled at the magnitude and intricacy of his work. The Outer Island tower is 90 feet high and was outfitted with the third order Fresnel lens that could be seen 20 miles offshore. It was also the first island station with a fog signal in the Apostle Islands, marking the eastern edge of the archipelago to oncoming traffic. The light became automated in 1961.</p> <h4><strong>Lullabye Logging</strong></h4> <p>In 1936 the Lullabye Furniture Company of Stevens Point, Wisconsin, purchased the entire island outside of the lighthouse reservation. This included eight thousand acres of standing timber mostly yellow birch, hemlock, and cedar. The company was founded in 1897 by John J. Bukolt and gained national distribution of cradles, other children’s furniture, and toys in the 1920’s. Logging on the island began in 1942 when wartime demand created a more favorable market of products such as plywood for the fuselage on bombers. By the 1950’s Lullabye’s Outer Island logging operation was fully mechanized and run by a thirteen-man crew. A bulldozed airstrip on the southwestern portion of the island allowed small planes to land. The airstrip was located several miles from the camp, but several old cars were brought to the island to transport people and goods. Fuel became essential for this type of logging and diesel was brought in on one thousand-gallon tanks.Camp life for Lullabye workers included amenities unknown to earlier generations of woodworkers such as a portable generator which provided electricity for lights and a television. <br /> <br /> Over 20 million board feet of timber was harvested over the years. By the 1950’s Lullabye had become one of the largest manufacturers of children’s furniture. Lullabye ended its Outer Island logging operation in 1963, not because the timber was gone, but because it was no longer profitable. Logging operations changed the landscape of the Apostle Islands. Eventually the forests regenerated, but the second and third growth forests are dominated by birch and maple. The regenerated forests support different plant and animal species than were found in the virgin forests. These logging camps remain relatively undisturbed and well preserved as a record of the past.</p>",

The combination of words and pictures on paper had a special quality that cannot be replaced by the computer screen or tablet. When I saw the call for artists to design a door for the Minuteman National Park, I immediately thought of combining words and images to make a poetry door, a portal that would have a quality of whimsy and magic. The door is my tribute to my parents and all the wonderful hours they spent reading to me, and the joy those memories still bring. <h3><b>Artist Bio:</b></h3> I love story-telling, and my artistic work often contains a narrative quality and implied story. For thirty-five years my inspiration was my home town of Lynn, Massachusetts, where I documented scenes of everyday life in the tradition of the Ash Can School. Other series include scenes of commuters on the subway, grooms at Suffolk Downs, and performers I knew when I worked for the Big Apple Circus. These images are created in a variety of media, including watercolor, oil, and pastel.<br /> <br /> My public artwork includes murals for the children’s departments of nine public libraries, and murals and mosaics for communities and organizations. My sculptural work has been displayed in numerous locations in New England. These include bronzes and sculptural mosaics. <h3><strong>What is this project? : </strong></h3> <p>Inspired by the <em>En Plein Air</em> exhibition on NYC's High Line, <strong>Go Out Doors - Neighbors</strong> builds upon and extends The Umbrella Arts Center's summer 2020 installation of artfully upcycled doors originally commissioned for the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in West Concord's Cultural District. The exhibition intended to encourage a reconnection to nature for communities then emerging from COVID-19 isolation, at-home schooling, and telecommuting. Gorgeously decorated, recycled doors crafted by regional artists became surprising waypoints of delight while traveling bike paths and walking trails. Some emphasize local wildlife and environmental themes; others are fun and whimsical, stressing exercise and companionship. In 2021, Go Out Doors - Neighbors projects have continued to spread, with new art doors installed or planned in Carlisle, Westford, Concord, Arlington, Lexington, Medford, Groton, Minute Man National Historical Park, and eight villages in Newton including Auburndale; Newton Centre; Newton Highlands, Newton Upper Falls, Newtonville, Nonantum, Waban and West Newton.Background, wayfinding, photos, information about the artists, calls for new proposals, and other news will be updated throughout the season at <a href=\"https://theumbrellaarts.org/go-out-doors-neighbors-2021\">Go Out Doors - Neighbors | The Umbrella Arts Center</a>.<br />  </p>",

Exploring the Buttrick Gardens' main elements, a rich history is revealed. Beginning with the indigenous care of the area, and continuing with the Buttrick family to the historical society, the essence of the land has been changed with each new steward. Not only can we get in touch with those who came before by walking their paths, but we can viscerally relate to the past by connecting with living things. As an artist, environmentalist, and daughter of a historian, gardens to me are the ideal combination to peer into our relationship with nature and society as a whole. Drawn to the Buttrick Gardens as an oasis throughout the pandemic, I hope to share the historical mosaic of the space and bring those who walked there into focus. By forging a tangible connection between us and the past, we can visualize what we want the future to look like and what we need to preserve to make that future take shape.</p> <h3><strong>Artist Bio:</strong></h3> <p>Originally from Nevada, BARD (Barbara Ayala Rugg Diehl) currently works and lives in Massachusetts. She brings her diverse backgrounds into her art subject matter and processes, having received her BA in Theater and English from Brandeis University and her MA in Sustainable International Development from the Heller School for Social Policy and Management. Her attraction to mixed media stems from both her work as an environmental educator and a personal creative curiosity. By using found items and reusing her own objects and clothes, she both reduces waste and explores the tangibility of art. In many of her pieces she utilizes 3-D elements to redefine who can interact with visual art, adding Braille and durable interactive elements to allow blind and low-vision audience members to enjoy her work. Her art has been featured in solo and group exhibits in seven states across the country, as well as internationally in Australia.<br />  </p> <h3><strong>What is this project? : </strong></h3> <p>Inspired by the <em>En Plein Air</em> exhibition on NYC's High Line, <strong>Go Out Doors - Neighbors</strong> builds upon and extends The Umbrella Arts Center's summer 2020 installation of artfully upcycled doors originally commissioned for the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in West Concord's Cultural District.

Originally built of timber, adobe walls were first added in 1870.

This included regular stable duties, as well as feeding and grooming their horses. Horses were utilized for patrolling, or scouting as it was commonly termed. Scouting parties could be out in the field for periods of days or weeks. In southwest, including Arizona, the cavalry was routinely engaged in extended scouts of two to three hundred miles.",

The first known garden in this area dates to when the Longfellows bought the property in 1843. After buying the house, Henry and Fanny designed a “lyre-shaped” flower garden and shortly afterwards in 1847, the Longfellows hired Richard Dolben to design a more elaborate garden that resembled a Persian carpet. Fanny Longfellow and Henry’s brother, Samuel Longfellow, were the most involved in the care of the formal garden. In a letter to family, Fanny once wrote, “Sam & I have not ventured yet to plant our seeds, therefore you shall benefit aid us with your experience & taste – a garden plot designed by Henry is just getting into shape, & I think will look very prettily when gay with flowers.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{632d3cf7-bee7-4039-ae67-06eb95838a6b}{147}\" paraid=\"725882581\">The formal garden’s design remained the same until 1905, when Alice Longfellow hired Martha Brookes Hutcheson to redesign her father’s garden in a Colonial Revival fashion. Hutcheson is noted for creating the layout that you see today and adding structural features like the pergola, fencing, and central sundial. Meant to reflect the house’s history, the formal garden is a blend of Dolben’s romantic curving design and Colonial Revival symmetry with a central axis. Hutcheson did not like the garden design but continued for the Longfellows, once writing, “Though I thought it [the garden] an ugly idea... I felt that it was a way in which one of my generation could pay him [Longfellow] homage.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{632d3cf7-bee7-4039-ae67-06eb95838a6b}{167}\" paraid=\"659126342\">Two decades later, Alice hired Ellen Biddle Shipman to replant everything within the existing garden beds. Shipman is noted for adding the trees and shrubs to the design and creating a flowing pattern of plants inside the flower beds. The garden you see today is a recreation of Shipman’s blueprints. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The formal garden is a rectangular space that abuts the northern and western borders of the property and is lined with fencing that abuts the east lawn and driveway. Visitors can enter the formal garden from three entrances: the archway next to the carriage house, a gate on the southwestern border by Alice’s Garden, and another gate on the southeastern border adjacent to the eastern property boundary. The Colonial Revival garden design is intended to resemble a Persian carpet, having a central circular teardrop pattern with geometric beds on the eastern and western sides. Linear flower beds line each border except for the eastern border, which is occupied by a large white pergola with benches in it. Boxwoods border each flower bed to reinforce the geometric garden layout and the flower beds are designed with a variety of flowers that bloom throughout the season. The western flower beds are dedicated to a variety of roses. Furthermore, the center of the formal garden is marked by a column supporting a metal armillary sundial. The northern border of the formal garden features a wide border of evergreen vegetation, creating a dense screen that entirely blocks the view of adjacent properties.",

It is incredibly rare in the United States and occurs more frequently in Baja California. Although populations of local Shaw’s Agave have vanished due to urban development, Cabrillo’s population is large and stable. Because of Cabrillo’s Mediterranean climate, the plant can thrive in this biome.  <br /> <br /> The Shaw’s Agave plant has provided the park with an excellent reason to look deeper into the pollinators of the area. The primary pollinator of the plant, the Mexican Long-tongued Bat (<i>Choeronycteris mexicana</i>), has not been seen in the park.

Almost all bridges of this type were built out of steel for railroads, however, the Harlequin Bridge was made of timber for vehicle use, which was unique. At its time of replacement in 2000, the Harlequin Bridge was one of only a few existing timber through truss bridges in the Pacific Northwest. This bridge here today is the 5th to be built at this location. It was designed specifically to pay respect to its predecessor.<br /> <br /> The bridge provides access to Company Creek Road, the only other major road in Stehekin Valley, and to Harlequin Campground, the Stehekin State Airport, Company Creek Trail, the Stehekin Powerhouse, and many private homes.",

Two steps lead up to the large pavilion covered with a green metal roof. Three rows of picnic tables fill the area.<br /><br />To your left, a paved trail wanders long the lake. A nearby sign has a map that shows how this trail connects with a network of trails through and around the City of Kearny. There are several wayside signs and exhibits as well as benches along this section near the Archway.<br /><br />First along the right side of the trail are flat metal sculptures of an adult bison with a calf. Feel free to touch. The wayside sign, titled \"Fate of the American Bison,\" tells of the intense hunting that reduced the number of bison from as many as 60 million to only 541 animals in 1887. Today, living on preserves and ranches, the bison numbers have increased to about 200,000. On the left side of the sidewalk are more bison statues. These are made of open metal mesh.<br /><br />Farther down the trail on the right is a path that leads to a Pawnee Earth Lodge. A sign on the far side of the bridge tells us that the lodge was built in 2010 by members of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations from North Dakota and the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. About the size of a small house, the lodge is a circular mound of earth, now covered with vegetation. Here and there an underlying wood beam can be seen. The entrance tunnel is made of vertical poles topped with a log roof. The entrance is closed with a metal gate.<br /><br />Past the lodge on the tail is a wayside sign titled \"The Never-Ending Line.\" It describes the conflicts between settlers and Indians did not end until the Sioux, Cheyenne and Pawnee peoples were forced onto reservations in the 1870s. <br /><br />The last exhibit along this trail section is a reproduction of a one-room sod house. The sign on the other end of the bridge tells us that the 224 blocks for the house were made from nine parts dirt and one part Portland Cement. The roof includes 37 saplings, 8 split Nebraska Red Cedar logs and 10 inches of soil. One sign at the right side of the path leading to the house discusses life in a sod house. On the other side, another sign explains how a sod house was made. <br /><br />The entrance to the house is closed with a metal gate. Looking through you can see a bed made of logs in the back-left corner, covered with a patchwork quilt. A couple of small woven rugs are on the dirt floor. A wooden chest sits against the back wall along with a wash tub and cooking pots. The inside walls are white-washed.",

Layers of gypsum were left behind as the sea emptied and filled over and over, and you can still see them as light layers of rock in the surrounding mountains.<br /> <br /> Water carries dissolved gypsum down to the basin, then evaporates, leaving behind gypsum crystals. Those crystals are then broken down into smaller and smaller pieces until they are the sand you just dug into.<br /> <br /> The dunes have been here for around 7,000 years! The secret to keeping all this sand in place is shallow underground water acting as an anchor. Much like a paper towel sucking up water, the dunes act like the paper towel and the water holds them in place. When you feel the wet sand a few inches down, you’re feeling the dunefield’s anchor.",

Clumps of low bushes are scattered about. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a Grasshopper Mouse, sitting back on its haunches, front paws held up to its mouth. It has a brown back and head, with lighter tan on its belly and front legs. Near the mouse is a shiny black stinkbug. Text at the top reads, “My fierce friends the grasshopper mice are almost 100% meat eaters—that is, if you think of deadly centipedes and scorpions as “meat.” They hunt at night like tiny cats. They claim and defend large territories—the size of 19 football fields. In a fight, they are as quick as lightning. After a kill, they get up on a rock, and let out a lion-like roar.

The sign sits near the top of a smooth sand dune, which extends even higher slightly to your left. Directly past the sign is a small clump of scrubby cottonwood trees, looking like large bushes. Behind you and to the right, the sand slopes downward to the grass covered basin floor below. The trail continues to your right and slightly downward as it rounds the shoulder of the big dune you are standing on. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a bobcat, crouched down as it slinks towards us. It has light brown, dappled fur and amber eyes. In the lower left of the sign is a picture of a Black-tailed Jackrabbit sitting with its long ears laid down along its back, its wide eyes staring off to the left. Text at the top reads, “Do you like to eat the same food, night after night? Not me! I like to eat a lot of different things. The bobcats that also live here in the dunes like to eat jackrabbits—a lot! Biologists who study desert bobcats say that 45% of their diet comes from just one prey: jackrabbits! It takes a lot of 4-pound rabbits to keep a 24-pound bobcat going strong.” End of description.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Look out at the trail in front of you. It may seem like just a simple trail, but if you look closely it will tell the story of the progression from footpaths to roadways.<br /> <br /> Imagine what this island would look like with no roads…. How about with no trails! It would certainly be difficult to get around in this rugged lava landscape. When the Polynesian Voyagers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, that was their reality. An untouched, rugged, lava wilderness. So, in ancient times, a network of trails was constructed to connect people, places, and resources.<br /> <br /> This section of trail is called the 1871 Trail, due to improvements made in… You guessed it, 1871. However, this small segment of trail is just one section of the larger Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail which is the 175-mile-long trail corridor that traverses from the northernmost tip of the island, along the western edge, around the southern tip and into Puna.<br /> <br /> This historic trail generally follows the ancient coastal <i>alaloa</i>, or long trail that formed primary route of travel around the island. The alaloa that the Ala Kahakai NHT follows is sometimes referred to as the <em>\"</em><i>alanui aupuni</i>,\" the Hawaiian Kingdom government road, that you can still see as the \"King's Trail\" in North Kona/South Kohala or the \"Māmalahoa Trail\" in North Kona which intersects our sister park, Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park. This ancient network of trail also included shorter more locally important trails like the <i>alahele</i> that ran laterally with the shoreline, and the <i>mauka-makai</i> trails, that ran from upland areas to coastal areas.<br /> <br /> Over the years, many of these anicent trails were straightened and widened to reflect changes in transportation while others were simply abandoned. Some of the trails that survived the tests of time were preserved, like the Ala Kahakai NHT, or even converted into roadways we know today. As you continue down the trail you see evidence of this evolution as you will pass historic and ancient structures, see impressive geologic features, and immerse yourself in the <i>kahakai</i> (coastal) environment.</p>",

Since farmer Romeo Wilder planted pear trees here 1918, they have thrived in years of expert care and grown resilient through long decades of neglect. Manzanar’s Bartlett and Winter Nellis pears, as well as its prize-winning Winesap and Spitzenburg apples, brought profits to a few, but others’ dreams of wealth eventually withered like the trees themselves as water became more valuable than the fruit they produced. Today, visitors may walk among these trees and imagine how they have nourished, in both body and spirit, those who have called Manzanar home.</p> <p>1910-12: Envisioning an apple-growing empire, water developer George Chaffey’s Owens Valley Improvement Company plants 22,000 apple trees in the new Manzanar Irrigated Farms. By 1920, tons of apples, pears, and peaches are shipped across the nation.</p> <p>1927- The City of Los Angeles acquires all water rights and land at Manzanar. Under its management, large-scale fruit production continues until the City halts orchard irrigation in 1934.</p> <p>1942 – Japanese American crews prune, thin, and irrigate nearly 40 acres of abandoned orchards within Manzanar War Relocation Center. There were “some very fine trees” among them, said orchard foreman Takeo Shima. Several thousand crates of fruit are harvested and used in the mess halls.</p> <p>1945-1992- Many trees die, but a high ground water table keeps these and others nearby producing. In the fall, local townspeople harvest apples and pears for baking and preserving.</p> <p>Present – Since 2006, National Park Service arborists have rehabilitated more than 100 fruit trees, installing new irrigation systems, pruning, and grafting old stock to new roots to preserve Manzanar’s heirloom fruit varieties.</p>",

The Atuka is a place for honored members of the family and guest to sit or sleep because it is the closest place to the fire.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{b3d1f04b-5ecd-4185-acb1-e28f46190cd9}{15}\" paraid=\"1392939152\">Over his head you see the hanging buffalo robe.

The shrine holds headdresses, medicine bags, ancient clan bundles, shields, spears and arrows all used in battle. They are all sacred and cherished items. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3cbb3e3b-ceb5-453a-81fd-775492b6b659}{48}\" paraid=\"659684664\"> As you walk outside of the Earthlodge, you hear sounds of the village, men talking, children playing, dogs barking, and women singing. Then, slowly, they begin to fade as you return to the present day. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=D8E9E978-97AA-FF28-F5926B693FA30539#:~:text=https%3A//www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm%3Fid%3DD8E9E978-97AA-FF28-F5926B693FA30539\">Ranger Tour</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{b3d1f04b-5ecd-4185-acb1-e28f46190cd9}{79}\" paraid=\"1168360816\"><b><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/knri/learn/historyculture/earthlodge.htm\">More information on our website</a></b></p> <p paraeid=\"{b3d1f04b-5ecd-4185-acb1-e28f46190cd9}{79}\" paraid=\"1168360816\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=D9D76F70-E72C-8686-2CC5FF99801162B2#:~:text=https%3A//www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm%3Fid%3DD9D76F70-E72C-8686-2CC5FF99801162B2\">Building An Earthlodge</a> <br /> <br />  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Outside: A brown, dome shaped lodge with a daisy chain of logs supporting sod covering on the sides and roof. The lodge is surrounded by a concrete sidewalk, brick seating, young trees and green lawn overlooking grass fields. Entrance is a hall built with smaller vertical logs with a roof of similar material. Inside: The houses of the village-dwelling tribes on the upper Missouri usually were circular in shape, the larger houses averaging about thirty feet in diameter. Their design incorporated four center wooden pillars and an adjoining framework of posts and beams supporting numerous rafters and wall poles. Over these was laid a matting of willow and grass and an outer, insulating later of earth. A hole in the roof admitted some light and otherwise vented the smoke from a central firepit in the floor. An exterior, moveable screen shielded the vented from the wind and rain. The entrance to the interior was protected from the weather by a covered passageway.

A steam engine and ice machine were also installed. <br /> <br /> This commanding officer’s quarters was under construction upon his arrival. Major Beaumont, who was a student of architecture, made substantial changes to the original design plan.  He eliminated aspects that were strictly ornamental, expensive, and time consuming to construct. The plans for two mansard towers were deleted, the diamond and circular windows were replaced with standard rectangles, and the house was partitioned to allow two officers to occupy the home.<br /> <br /> Major Beaumont was the commanding officer at Fort Bowie until 1888.

To protect the battery’s rear, a small stockade named Castillo de San Carlos was built on the bluff rising above.<br /> <br /> After Spanish West Florida became a US territory in the 1820s, Army engineers demolished the Castillo and built Fort Barrancas in its place. They then modernized the Spanish Water Battery and named it Barrancas Water Battery. With 15 cannon, the battery continued its original purpose in protecting the entrance to Pensacola Bay.</p> <p> </p>",
            "audioDescription": "161 words.<br /><br />This tour stop is located on one side of the main part of the Spanish Water Battery as you exit the tunnel passageway from the parade ground of Fort Barrancas. To the left is a 10-foot-high wall topped by a level space where the cannon were placed. To the right there is an alcove in the wall of the main structure about 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep. On the back wall of the alcove is an opening near the ground level, now covered with iron bars. The opening has a wooden shutter which can be closed. <br /><br />Underfoot a narrow brick walk leads around the wall to the right to the main open space of the fort. From there on the right is a long staircase, 26 steps in all, which leads up to a platform with high walls. On the left, a shorter staircase, 14 steps, leads up to the cannon area.<br /><br />End of Description.",

Although the Bayfield Peninsula lies just over a mile away, visitors are rewarded with the isolation and solitude of an island experience. Low cliffs of brown sandstone or banks of broken stone and red clay meet Lake Superior along Basswood’s shoreline. An isolated sandstone block, called “Lone Rock” or “Honeymoon Rock” lies off the island’s north tip. A dense growth of forest is broken only by several small clearings, the result of historic activities. The geology; the forests; and evidence of logging, quarrying, and farming are all vital components of Basswood’s story - a story to be “read” by the observant island visitor.</p> <h4 itemprop=\"name\">Boating, Camping, Hunting, and Hiking</h4> <p itemprop=\"name\">Apostle Islands National Lakeshore offers visitors the opportunity to experience and enjoy a variety of natural and cultural features. Visitors must do their part to help protect park resources. Please follow the seven principles of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">“Leave No Trace”</a> outdoor ethics.<br /> <br /> A 70 foot long dock is located midway up the west side of the island near the outlet of a small stream. The maximum depth of water at the end of the dock is 4-6 feet. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">Boaters</a> planning to moor overnight are cautioned that this dock is exposed to winds from the southwest and northwest. A rock landing is located at the south end of the island near campsite #1. Captains are encouraged to monitor marine weather forecasts for weather and wave conditions. Persons traveling to the island in small boats, canoes or kayaks should pay attention to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">weather conditions</a> and proceed with caution. Permits are required for all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping-permits-reservations.htm\">camping</a> and are available at the national lakeshore visitor center in Bayfield. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/basswood-campsites.htm\">Campsites:</a> four are located at the south end of the island near the brownstone quarry. Two more are located near a clearing 200 yards from the dock. A group campsite is in the clearing, along with a vault toilet.<br /> <br /> A special <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">deer hunt</a> for hunters using muzzle loading rifles takes place on Oak and Basswood islands in October. A limited number of permits are available. Contact Apostle Islands National Lakeshore's superintendent for details.<br /> <br /> Hiking: a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">5 1/2 mile loop trail</a> begins and ends near a clearing up the hill from the dock. </p> <h4 itemprop=\"name\">Brownstone, Lumber, and Crops</h4> <p>The Lake Superior brownstone industry began in 1869 when sandstone from Basswood Island was selected for Milwaukee County’s courthouse. Steam drills and derricks cut and moved the stone and, by 1871, brownstone was being shipped to Chicago to replace buildings lost in the great fire. In 1883, the new courthouse in Bayfield (now Park headquarters) was built of Basswood Island brownstone. Changing architectural styles and the economic crash of 1893 brought an end to the brownstone industry.<br /> <br /> Logging on Basswood Island began in conjunction with quarry activities and continued until the 1950s. Eastern hemlock, one of the first species harvested, was important to the leather industry. Two million board feet of white pine were harvested from the island’s northeast side in the 1890s. In the 1940s, a small logging camp was located in what is now a campground near Basswood Island’s dock. This operation harvested aspen and fir for pulpwood and yellow birch for veneer.<br /> <br /> Several farmers have taken advantage of the island’s extended growing season. The McCloud-Brigham farm, located in the north central portion of the island, was the largest. None of the five buildings once at the site remain standing.</p> <blockquote> <p><span style=\"color:#663333;\"><em>“A Mammoth Pumpkin weighing eighty-one pounds, a snake cucumber about four feet long, and some monster potatoes, which measure no less than eight inches in diameter. They are the products of Basswood Island, that wonderful place for farm products of mammoth proportions.”</em> - Bayfield County Press, 1877.</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Richard McCloud filed a homestead claim for property on Basswood Island in 1865. By 1871 he built a log home and cultivated five acres. The farm provided produce, including six varieties of onions and ten varieties of corn, for workers at the Strong, French & Co.’s quarry on the island. Richard McCloud and his brother Joseph operated the farm until Joseph’s death in 1900.<br /> <br /> In 1903, E. K. Brigham and his five sons began logging Basswood Island. They established their logging camp at the former McCloud farm. The camp housed as many as 50 men. The Brighams found markets far and near for the island’s white pine, hemlock, oak, and other hardwoods. Some timbers were cut in 24 foot lengths and shipped all the way to England for dock construction. Other trees were cut in three foot lengths and hauled across the ice to Bayfield to burn in the school furnace. After the timber was cut, the Brighams converted the old bunkhouse into a summer home. They planted several hundred apple and cherry trees at the farm and raised as many as seventeen cows. Although the property was never farmed after E. K. Brigham’s death in 1923, it stayed in the family until 1967.</p>",

Baseball was a powerful symbol of an American way of life that boosted morale and brought some sense of normalcy to a confined community. By summer 1942, nearly 100 men’s and 14 women’s softball teams were playing a full schedule of games. Teams like the <i>San Fernando Aces</i> and <i>San Pedro Gophers</i> came intact from their pre-war communities while other teams formed in camp. The <i>ManzaKnights</i> grew out of a popular young men’s social club while older men formed their own league. Women’s teams included the <i>Dusty Chicks</i>.<br /> <br /> Those incarcerated here joined sports of virtually every kind—basketball, volleyball, tennis, judo, sumo, weight-lifting, and golf—to combat boredom and stay active.

You don’t know what the outcome of the war is going to be. It’s just impossible to kind of consul them. You have to console them.”<br /> Dr. Masako Kusayanagi Miura<br /> <br /> The dust, poor food, and crowded conditions of Manzanar’s early weeks heightened fears of serious illness and epidemic. Rose Bannai Kitahara “started working as a nurse’s aid for the Public Health Department, going from barrack to barrack in the howling dust storms, and around open ditches to urge residents to complete their typhoid shots.”<br /> <br /> Initially, doctors treated patients in a single barracks without running water, adequate supplies, or equipment. Dr. Masako Kusayanagi Miura recalled only “five doctors and ten thousand people . . . we had old people, young people, women, children, everybody.”<br /> <br /> In July 1942, patients, staff, and equipment finally moved into a new 250-bed hospital complex built here. In sixteen connected buildings, the hospital housed operating rooms, laboratories, pharmacy, dental and eye clinics, a morgue, and staff quarters. Over a period of 3 ½ years, the hospital staff treated more than 70,000 cases.<br /> <br /> Most hospital employees were Japanese American. The hospital offered classes in nursing, stenography, and other fields. “When I first went to Manzanar hospital to work, I didn’t know any medical terminology,” said Mae Kageyama Kakehashi. After the war, she continued her career as a medical stenographer.<br /> <br /> Life began and ended at Manzanar. Doctors and nurses delivered 541 babies. Of the 11,070 people incarcerated here, 150 died.",

The sea caves and cliffs under the lighthouse are some of the most alluring within the national lakeshore. The carved delicate arches, vaulted chambers, and honeycombed passageways are a beautiful sight to behold. </p> <h4>Lighthouse</h4> <p align=\"left\">The history of Devils Island centers around the lighthouse. The eighth and final lighthouse was lite in the Apostle Islands on Devils Islands in 1891. A two-story, red brick, Queen Anne- style keeper's dwelling and a building for the steam fog signal were completed at this time, but the light was placed in a temporary tower. The tower, made of wooden timbers, held a fourth order, red light.</p> <p align=\"left\">A two-story, brick and shingle house similar in design to the keeper's dwelling was built for the assistant keepers in 1897. Work began on the permanent tower, an 82- foot tall steel cylinder, that same year. Although the tower was ready in the fall of 1898, there was a three year delay in supplying it with a lens. A third order lens from the Paris firm of H. Lepaute finally arrived in April 1901. The permanent tower was placed in service shortly afterward, and the temporary tower torn down the same year. The lighthouse was originally designed as a plain, self-supporting cylinder, but the high winds of its exposed location caused the tower to shake so badly that light keepers complained that the motion sometimes extinguished the lamp. In 1914, the Lighthouse Service reinforced the structure with external braces, alleviating the problem and giving the tower the appearance we see today.</p>   <p align=\"left\">Devils Island's flashing red light became a major landmark along trans-Superior shipping lanes. The station's steam fog signal was replaced in 1925 with a compressed air diaphone and a radio fog beacon. Ships on the lake could use the time delay between the radio and audible signals to determine their distance to the station. Devils Island eventually became the last manned station in the Apostle Islands. As the other lights were automated, the Coast Guard maintained a five-man crew on Devils Island to watch over the beacon and perform periodic maintenance on the other island lights. This era finally ended in 1978, when the Devils Island light was automated as well. When the Coast Guard detachment hauled down their flag, it marked the end of over a century of light keepers tending lights in the Apostle Islands.</p> <p align=\"left\">The lighthouse at Devils Island is the only one among the Apostles group to retain its original Fresnel lens, though there was a three-year period when the lantern room was empty. The U. S. Coast Guard removed the third order Fresnel lens from the tower in 1989 and replaced it with a smaller, plastic beacon. The National Park Service repaired the lens and returned it to the tower as a display in 1992. While technological advances aid navigation, the need for lights as navigational tools has decreased. Overtime lighthouses have acquired a significance beyond their importance to mariners. They represent a fascinating period in the historic development of the region. They also remind us of the brave men and women who tended these remote outposts to make life safer for sailors navigating the waters of the Apostle Islands.</p>   <br /> <b style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem;\">Visiting the Lighthouse</b> <p>Although Devils Island is relatively remote, the lighthouse is a popular destination for experienced boaters and sea kayakers. There best landing site is at the south end of the island near the dock.  Tour boats do not usually stop at Devils Island, but the Apostle Islands Cruise Service offers excellent views of the lighthouse from the lake. Visitors who do reach the island will find the lighthouse staffed with a volunteer light keeper during the summer season. </p> <br /> <br />  ",

Think rubber ducky?<br /> <br /> Still no? That's OK, erosion and time have worked their magic on the once aptly named formation and its bill was worn off long ago, but what remains still stands out above the canyon.<br /> <br /> People, both past and present, often try to make sense out of the canyon's immense size and grandeur by seeking the familiar in a strange and unknown landscape. Scattered throughout Grand Canyon you will find sinking ships, alligators, covered wagons, figures of myth and legend, and more all hidden in the rocks and formations we see. This time honored tradition helps us make sense of the canyon landscape, recalls a comforting feeling or memory,  and helps us focus on the shapes and details before us.<br /> <br /> What do you see in the canyon's formations? </p>",

Under the guidance of Seigoro Murakami and Shigeo Tashima, 400 judo students practiced in Manzanar on a 40’ by 60’ canvas-covered sawdust platform. Judo’s demanding physical conditioning and code of behavior lifted spirits and introduced many young Japanese Americans to the disciplines and traditions of their cultural heritage.</p> <p>Framed by old cottonwood trees, the white dojo defied the camp’s monotonous, rectangular layout and stood in contrast to the black tarpapered barracks. Japanese sliding screens were added in winter. “When we weren’t practicing hard enough, Sensei (teacher) Murakami would open the screens and blast us with the cold air,” recalled Isamu Yamashita. Today visitors can see sidewalks that connected the dojo to a dressing and storage room, built on the foundation of Ed Shepherd’s ranch house from decades earlier.</p> <p>Enthusiasts of kendo (Japanese fencing) practiced in their own dojo just southwest of the Judo dojo. Most were among Manzanar’s Kibei population, American-born Japanese educated in Japan, whose strong cultural and political ties to that country sometimes put them in conflict with more Americanized Nisei. Following the 1943 “Loyalty questionnaire” crisis, many Kibei were sent to Tule Lake Segregation Center and, reported the Manzanar Free Press, “all interest in kendo has died away.”</p>",

Designed and built by those incarcerated, mess hall gardens served as a source of block identity and pride.This and other gardens in Blocks 9, 12, and 22, share symbolic roots in ancient Japanese design. In each, you can find three distinct levels aligned north to south: a hill of earth represents the mountains for which water flows south to a pond, symbolizing an ocean or lake. Incarcerated Japanese Americans planted trees from the camp nursery and hauled stones from the rugged Inyo Mountains east of Manzanar.<br /> <br /> You can find crane and turtle rocks, which, found together are said to ensure ageless vitality.<br /> <br /> “Six months ago Manzanar was a barren, uninhabited desert. Today, green lawns, picturesque gardens with miniature mountains, stone lanterns, bridges over ponds where carp play, and other original, decorative ideas attest to the Japanese people’s traditional love of nature and ingenuity in reproducing beauty in miniature.”<br /> “Best Garden Contest,” Manzanar Free Press, Fall 1942</p>",

Do you notice that they have the appearance of a chocolate chip cookie, with little chunks of different rocks embedded in the larger boulder? These rocks are called the Shatter Zone in Acadia, and to geologists they’re known as a <i>volcanic breccia.</i><br /> <br /> But hang on… <i>volcanic? </i>Do you see a volcano anywhere nearby? Probably not! The volcano that made these rocks existed on Mount Desert Island 420 million years ago – it has long since cooled and become the rock that makes up most of the island. The Cadillac Granite, the pink granite seen throughout much of Acadia, represents the ancient core of that volcano. The Shatter Zone, which we are looking at now, is the perimeter of that volcano’s caldera.<br /> <br /> A caldera is a volcanic crater, formed at the mouth of a volcano after it erupts. The rocks at the edge of the Mount Desert Island volcano crumbled into the empty space left by the magma after it erupted. The magma remaining in the volcano at that time cooling, but still molten – similar in consistency to a gel. When crumbled rocks fell into it, they got stuck in the magma. Because this magma was cooling, it didn’t melt the fallen chunks of rock completely, and that’s why we can still see those rocks stuck in the magma (which is now granite) of the Shatter Zone today.<br /> <br /> Geologists today use the Shatter Zone to help trace the ancient perimeter of the volcano because rocks only fell into the caldera around its edges. Using a geologic map, you can see that the Shatter Zone is represented by the dark brown crescent on the eastern coast of MDI. By studying the Shatter Zone, geologists have found that the caldera of this volcano would have been 10 miles wide – about five times the total distance of this hike!</p>",

They completed the central part of the structure in June 1942, and added the wings – serving as fireman dormitories, office space, and truck garages – in October 1942. Some Japanese Americans put personal touches to their work, inscribed dates, names, and phrases in the concrete foundation. Look for these inscriptions on the original ramp in front.<br /> <br /> Situated at the east edge of the camp, the fire station’s location was unfavorable. Fire chiefs and inspectors worried about increased response time to fires. They also complained about the slow fire alarm system, which delayed response time up to ten minutes. In 1944, the department requested the purchase of a fire siren, but it “was denied by Washington without further justification.”<br /> <br /> Despite these setbacks, Japanese American firemen successfully battled 91 fires, averting catastrophe for these incarcerated in Manzanar.<br /> <br /> Fire Engines<br /> <br /> For the first few months, Manzanar’s fire personnel relied on hand tools and a borrowed truck. On July 11, 1942, the Army Corps of Engineers delivered a new Ford engine with a pump capacity of 500 gallons per minute. The Dodge fire engine arrived on April 3, 1943, adding an additional 500 gallon pump capacity. Soon after, the Manzanar Motor Pool provided a pickup truck to carry an extra 1,000 feet of hose.<br /> <br /> After the war, the Bishop Fire Department purchased the Ford and used it for decades. They expanded the bed and added the ladder in the 1950s. The National Park Service acquired it in the 1990s. The Dodge was used by Lone Pine Fire Department before being transferred to the Keeler Volunteer Fire Department. Keeler used the truck for years. They donated it to Manzanar in 2017.</p>",

The abundance and quality of water was critical.Decades earlier, the Owens Valley Improvement Company built a creek-fed water system, including a small reservoir, for the farming town of Manzanar (Spanish for “apple orchard”).<br /> <br /> In May 1942, army contractor Vinson and Pringle began construction on this reservoir, also fed by Shepherd Creek. Reservoir infrastructure included a settling basin, sand trap, chlorine house, and storage shed. In 1943, Japanese American crews enlarged the 540,000-gallon reservoir to a 900,000-gallon capacity.The reservoir provided a daily supply of up to 1,500,000 gallons of water through 40,000 feet of pipes to faucets outside Manzanar’s barracks and into mess halls, latrines, and laundry rooms. The system also supplied 84 fire hydrants, Victory Gardens, and dozens of Japanese gardens.The camp closed in 1945. For decades after the war, Owens Valley locals came here to swim. Although no longer in use for water storage, the reservoir is an important part of Manzanar’s history.<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> <br /> The inscriptions in the reservoir’s concrete illustrate a sampling of attitudes among Japanese Americans. Embedded pebbles in the wall around the reservoir spell out: “STONE WALL BY THE EMERGENCY CREW 2/25/43.” The Emergency Crew performed vital work, but it was hard labor and thought to be one of the worst jobs in camp. The camp administration considered some of the crew members uncooperative. Some inscriptions reflect feelings of alienation: pro-Japanese and anti-American sentiments occur alongside names, initials, and dates. But artistic touches – rustic stone lanterns and decorative upright rocks – suggest that the reservoir crews took pride in their work. One inscription, the Japanese character for “peace,” echoed the hopes of thousands of people confined at Manzanar.</p>",

Needless to say they were one of the greatest fire hazards possible.”<br /> Joseph Fine, Fire Protection Officer<br /> <br /> Fire poses a danger wherever people live, but Manzanar’s wood and tar paper buildings were especially prone to disaster. “The buildings within the blocks were too close together,” wrote Joseph Fine, Fire Protection Officer. “During high wind, fire could have raced out of control.”<br /> <br /> Manzanar’s layout was, in part, a fire prevention measure. The US Army separated groups of buildings with open areas called firebreaks. Keenly aware of the threat of fire, incarcerated Japanese Americans worked alongside government staff in developing a fire protection system.<br /> <br /> In April 1942, people had only garden hoses, water buckets, shovels, and one borrowed truck to fight fire. Soon the Army Corps of Engineers installed fire hydrants and provided hoses and nozzles. By August, each barracks had a fire extinguisher, installed by the staff of the Manzanar Fire Department.<br /> <br /> Japanese American firemen received a salary of $16 per month, while fire chiefs made $19. Most had no experience, but a report noted, “They were eager to learn and developed into good firemen.”<br /> <br /> Engineer Fred Nagai recalled, “We used to have fire drills once a week or twice a week and polish the fire truck. And the rest of the time you just laid around . . . play cards . . . That was the easiest job.” Yet over the course of three years, Manzanar’s fire personnel responded to nearly 100 fires.<br /> <br /> Manzanar’s largest fire occurred in the warehouse section on July 28, 1944. All paid and volunteer firemen reported to work. A strong south wind drove flames toward Block 4 as people rushed to wet down the roofs of their barracks and other nearby buildings. The fire destroyed warehouses 33, 34, and 35.</p>",

SATTERLEE,</i><br /> <i>AS PART OF</i><br /> <i>ACADIA NATIONAL PARK”</i></p> <p><i></i>The unique sandy beach down the stairs as well as the distant spit of land also referred to as “The Headlands” (imagine the coastline are ‘shoulders’ and the spit of land is the head jutting off of the shoulders) was once the summer residence of a family named Satterlee. The Satterlee’s estate was commonly called ‘Satterlee Field.'<br /> <br /> In 1900, the wealthy financier J.P. (John Pierpont) Morgan purchased 117 acres, including all of Sand Beach and Great Head as a wedding gift for his oldest child and daughter Louisa Peirpont Morgan’s (1866-1946) wedding. Louisa married Herbert Satterlee (1863-1947) in New York City on November 15th, 1900. Louisa and Herbert had two daughters, Mabel born in 1901 and Eleanor born in 1905. The two daughters grew up exploring the landscape and making connections to the rockbound coast of Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> The Satterlee summer excursions to the coast of Maine came to an end when Louisa died in October of 1946 and Herbert died in July of 1947. Much of the estate was burnt during the October Fire of ’47 (discussed in more detail at a later stop on this hike). The Satterlee family already had an ongoing relationship with Acadia National Park because large portions of park land already bordered Satterlee Field. The Satterlee family even allowed park visitors to explore Sand Beach. After the Fire of ’47, the Satterlee daughters Eleanor and Mabel decided to donate the land in honor of their mother Louisa so others could continue to visit this beautiful landscape for generations to come. Since then, visitors to Acadia have enjoyed the same beach, forests, mountains, and coastline they once enjoyed here in Maine.</p>",

Everything is so different and we have to do much experimenting.”<br /> John Fukasawa, a Manzanar farm foreman<br /> <br /> Manzanar receives very little rain, but in the late spring, snow melting in the Sierra Nevada replenishes nearby streams. Tumbling down granite-walled canyons, those streams bring water that infuses life into this high desert landscape. For centuries, humans have harnessed that water to coax food from the land.<br /> <br /> Paiutes diverted stream water to irrigate plots of edible native plants. After passage of the Homestead Act in 1862, farmers and rangers who came to support nearby miners staked claims on those irrigated fields. North of Manzanar is a slender line of cottonwood and willow trees marking Shepherd Creek, named for a family that settled here in 1864. Later ranchers and farmers dug canals to irrigate hay and grain fields. In 1905, brothers George and Charles Chaffey began buying land to subdivide into the orchard farms that gave Manzanar (Spanish for apple orchard) its name. George Chaffey installed concrete irrigation pipes to conserve water, and by 1921 there were 20,000 fruit trees growing at Manzanar. In the 1920s, the City of Los Angeles bought up Manzanar farms to secure additional water rights for the city. Inyo County declared the town of Manzanar abandoned in 1941.<br /> <br /> The War Relocation Authority utilized Manzanar’s abundant water supply to make the camp as agriculturally self-sufficient as possible. Japanese Americans restored earlier canals and pipes, and diverted Shepherd Creek into a 900,000 gallon reservoir constructed northwest of here in 1942. In fields north and south of the camp’s living area, they cultivated 440 acres with 35 varieties of vegetables, grains, and fruits. In the area in front of you, victory gardens flourished, yielding bountiful vegetables and colorful flowers.<br /> <br /> Water Wars<br /> <br /> During the early 1900s, a thirsty, growing Los Angeles looked toward Owens Valley for its water. In 1913, the 233-mile Los Angeles Aqueduct started carrying much of the water south. Hailed as an engineering triumph and still in use, the aqueduct remains a flashpoint for conflicts over the region’s water and environment. Since the 1920s, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) has owned nearly all land and water rights in the valley.<br /> <br /> The federal government leased Manzanar from LADWP from 1942-1947. Fifty years later, the US government exchanged other federal land to create Manzanar National Historic Site.</p>",

And for the John Ahu house site that you see before you on the <em>makai</em> (ocean) side of the trail, the location was in a very prime spot indeed! Not only for expansive ocean views that would cause the price of this house site to soar in modern times, but also easy access to the main route of travel and the ocean. Below the house site is one of the few suitable canoe landing spots along this stretch of coast. As you continue down the trail a little bit, look back up at the house site and notice the gradual slope down to the water. That’s the spot! In addition to being able to land a canoe, this cove was also the only place with deep enough sheltered waters for larger boats to unload goods to exchange with villagers.<br /> <br /> When finding a place for one’s house, it’s important to make sure that you are close to all amenities, especially water. While there is certainly ample saltwater available at this location, fresh water is often hard to come by. In this part of the island, there are no streams or rivers to provide freshwater and instead, freshwater sources are either collected rainwater or the brackish water of anchialine pools.<br /> <br /> In Kiʻilae village most of the houses had thatched roofs and only the most well-to-do houses, like the John Ahu house, had tin roofing. With tin roofing came the ability of water catchment, and thus the cistern that you can see in what remains of the house site. However, even with water catchment, rain on the South Kona coast is not guaranteed, and in many cases, the Ahu cistern had to be filled via mule train from the wetter areas up <em>mauka </em>(mountain).<br /> <br /> Even today, many residents of South Kona live on rainwater catchment systems, however when the catchment is low, water trucks and roads allow for much easier access to freshwater than the mule trains of the past.</p>",

A permanent detachment of 20 Marines was assigned to the Yard in 1805, but they lacked barracks. Construction of a permanent barracks building, intending to house up to 150 Marines, began in 1810 with the stipulation that the Marines work with construction material not in use by the Navy. On February 19, 1811, the Marines moved into their new barracks, then a single story building flanked by two three-story wings. The barracks eventually was expanded to the four-story structure visitors see today with improvements made between 1861 and 1948.</p> <p>The Marine Barracks included not only housing, but also a barbershop, post exchange, chaplain’s office, movie theater, brig, and pistol range. The duties of the Marines included controlling access to the Yard, guarding the naval prison, and deploying as required to conflicts around the world. The Marines even responded to civil emergencies throughout Boston, including prison riots, crowd control, and fire relief. The detachment reached its greatest numbers during World War II with 643 Marines stationed here. The Marines lowered the Yard’s American Flag for the last time on July 1, 1974, when the Yard closed.</p> <p>Today the Marine Barracks serves as the administrative center and park housing for Boston National Historical Park.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Marine Barracks is four stories tall building, eleven bays long, and five bays deep. The first floor exterior is primarily painted a mint green while the upper levels are primarily painted white. It has a U-shape plan with the three-story rear wing extending out from the center of the north elevation. The granite boundary wall runs along the north side of the building, creating two courtyards on the easy and west sides of the rear wing. Two brick towers (consisting of staircases) divide the south facade of the building into three sections, with 5 bays in between them. The towers have four-light windows at the location of the landings for the staircases. On the exterior of the second floor of each of the towers are mint green speaker phones pointed south. The primary entrance on the first floor consists of a pair of partially-glazed steel double doors recessed in a segmental arch opening in the center of the facade. Over the arch opening is a sign stating \"Marine Barracks\" with the insignia of the Marines. Secondary entrances are located in the first story of the south elevation of the east and west wings. Two rectangular openings on the first story of the east elevation are capped by shed roofs clad with slate shingles and copper flashing supported by scroll brackets. The five bays across the facade is vertically divided by Doric pilasters with groups of three, eight- and six-light horizontal sliding aluminum windows. The rest of the windows primarily consist of two-over-two, double-hung sash in varying sizes with splayed brick lintels and concrete sills. Some window openings on the upper stories of the east elevation are filled in with brick. A two-entrance rounded driveway leads up to the Marine Barracks. In front of driveway is a grassy area that served as the Marine Barracks Parade Ground.",

There was a Quarters A, demolished in 1958, that was the home of the porter, or Navy Yard property manager. It stood behind Quarters B and adjacent to Gate 1. The exterior wall of Quarters A remains as part of the yard’s Boundary Wall.</p> <p>Naval Strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan and Commodore Matthew Perry are notable officers who once lived in these houses.</p> <p>These buildings are now used as offices and housing by the National Park Service.</p> <h2>Sources</h2> <ul> <li>Black, Frederick R. and Edwin C.

            "audioDescription": "Quarters B-F faces east and is comprised of five Federal style brick row houses. Each quarter is two-and-one-half stories tall, three-bays wide, and four-bays deep on a raised brick foundation with a granite watertable on the east (facade) elevation. The primary entrances are located in the north-most bay of the facade of each unit. Granite steps with wrought iron handrails lead to recessed openings with a projecting surround of white chamfered pilasters and a wide white lintel topped by a shallow pitch roof. The entrances are located within the recessed openings and consist of simple, modern panel doors with a window and a storm door. On the white lintel is a small black circle with a white block letter written in it. The letters are B through F, as each townhouse is lettered B-F. Windows primarily consist of six-over-six, double-hung sash in two sizes, taller on the first story and shorter on the second, with granite lintels and sills. A window is located in each bay on the second floor, and two windows are located in the two southern most bays of each unit. Windows in the basement level on the facade are three-over-six, double-hung sash. A slate shingle-clad, side-gable roof spans the entire building with one to three gable dormers per unit on the east slope, and large shed dormers at irregular intervals and sizes arranged on the west slope. The windows in the dormers vary between one-over-one and eight-over-eight, double-hung sash. Two corbelled brick chimneys rise from between each unit for a total of ten chimneys. A cement pathway runs in front of all of the town houses, with additional cement pathways running perpendicular to lead up to the staircase of each townhouse. A lawn with a couple large trees is in front of the townhouses.",

            "bodyText": "<p>As the first warehouse building constructed at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a>, Building 5 is the third-oldest structure in the yard. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/commandants-house.htm\">Commandant's House</a> (1805) and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/marine-barracks-cny.htm\">Marine Barracks</a> (1811) are the only buildings constructed before Building 5 (1816). This warehouse's plain, Federalist-style façade reflects its early storage function.</p> <p>Building 5 resembles other warehouses built in Boston in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. This sturdy building is over 200 feet long and three-stories high. While its pitched slate roof remains, original chimneys have been removed and many doors have been converted into windows.</p> <p>No other building in the Charlestown Navy Yard has had as many strikingly different uses as Building 5, reflecting the complexity of the 175-year history of the U.S. Navy in Boston.</p> <p>Building 5 primarily stored lumber and other shipbuilding materials and was known as the Navy Store. By 1869 and into 1900, the Navy expanded the use of this large building to include various offices, as well as a dispensary (clinic), a print shop, a Naval Museum, and a library.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, wishing to increase the services available within the Charlestown Navy Yard, the U.S. Navy further expanded the use of Building 5. The U.S. Navy added a commissary (grocery store), a barber shop, and a clothing store. After the dispensary moved into its own building in 1905, a dental office opened in Building 5 (1906 to 1910). Also, during the first decades of the 1900s, the chaplain and the Naval Reserve had offices here. Naval officers and servicemen also refined their marksmanship at Building 5's Rifle Range and rehearsed for the Navy Band in the building's practice space.</p> <p>In 1936, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) renovated the interior of Building 5. Still visible on the first floor are the huge, steel girders that the WPA installed to stabilize this heavily-used, over 200 year-old building. At this time (1936), the Navy Yard installed an exterior plaque at the northeast corner of Building 5 that marks the landing of British re-enforcements in the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.</p> <p>World War II changed the use of Building 5 yet again. It became the Officers' Club and mess, office space, classrooms, and the Bachelor Officers' Quarters. These uses continued until 1974.</p> <p>That year, the Charlestown Navy Yard closed and the National Park Service was charged with preserving the history of this Navy Yard and some of its buildings. Building 5, being close to the main entrance to the Yard (Gate 1) and the USS <em>Constitution</em> and Museum, made it an ideal location for a visitor center and exhibition space.</p> <p>In 2008, the first floor of Building 5 opened as a visitor center with an exhibit on the history of the Charlestown Navy Yard called \"Serving the Naval Fleet.\" Currently, the National Park Service and U.S. Navy share the other floors of Building 5.</p> <h2>Sources</h2> <ul> <li>Carlson, Stephen P.

            "audioDescription": "Building 5 is a three-story red brick building built in the Federalist-style. The entrance faces east and is the shorter side of the large rectangular structure. The entrance is framed with a white lintel on top and two white posts on either side. On the lintel is a blue sign with white text: \"Visitor Center\" in all caps. To the left of the text is a National Park Service arrowhead. On either side of the entrance are two windows. The second and third floors of this façade have 5 windows across. Between the center window of these two floors is a painted black rectangle with the number \"5\" painted white on top. The longer side of the is 200 feet long, with 21 windows. All windows are grid-paned 4x3. Halfway down the building on the second floor is an exterior metal fire-escape staircase, but it folded up, not extended to the ground. At the corner of the third floor on each end of this side is a large white rectangular light extending from the building like a rod. The building has a hipped roof that is gray.",

Today's picnickers can carry their food to picnic tables spaced through out the picnic area and us the steel pedestal charcoal grills. Accessible picnic tables and grills are located adjacent to the parking area near the vault toilet. Drinking water is available.  Do not use the historic structures.<br /> <br /> The picnic area is the trailhead for the Picnic Area Loop Trail. This single track foot trail through the woods, with many short ups and downs, takes about 15 minutes to hike.<br /> <br /> The gravel road leaving the picnic area has a hairpin turn.

At Mile 45.8, there is a wide area in the road where buses pause for scenic views. Far below, visitors can see the Plains of Murie, which is crossed by numerous braided river channels and dotted with kettle ponds and large boulders, called glacial erratics. On the far side of the Plains of Murie, the Polychrome Glaciers and numerous peaks of the Alaska Range can be seen.<br /> <br /> In summer, nearly all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/visiting-denali.htm\">transit and tour buses</a> travel to this point. In spring and fall, intrepid visitors can cycle out to this point or visit it on a backpacking trip, but it is too far to reach otherwise.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <h4>Looking South</h4> <p><br /> If you’re a fan of geology, this is a great place to get out and walk around! A number of interesting glacial features can be seen from the Polychrome Overlook. High in the valleys to the south are the Polychrome Glaciers, barely visible as white patches of ice flowing towards the park road. Each of these glaciers terminates in a dark, stagnant, debris-covered ice field. The Polychrome Glaciers have retreated and downwasted substantially since they were first documented, and will likely disappear completely in the coming decades if the climate continues to warm.<br /> <br /> Between the glaciers and the road is a large outwash plain referred to as the Plains of Murie after famous wildlife biologist Adolph Murie. On days with clear skies, kettle ponds, mostly located towards the east end of this expanse, shine brightly on the plains. Overcast days more easily reveal solifluction lobes on some of the lower mountains. These lobes look like dripping paint from far away, and indeed they are dripping in a sense, as they are caused by the slow, downslope creep of water-saturated soils and sediments. Solifluction lobes are common in areas with permafrost and can be seen on hillsides throughout the park.<br /> <br /> A 35-foot-high (11m), house-sized erratic boulder on the lowlands to the south, transported to its current location by glaciers in the Pleistocene Epoch, looks small upon the vast Plains of Murie. See if you can spot it!</p> <h4>Looking North</h4> <p><br /> An arcing light-green layer of clay has stained the rocks below it on the north side of Polychrome Overlook. This clay is the product of volcanic ash weathering over time.<br /> <br /> Beginning in 2002, a layer of this slippery clay at the overlook caused half of the road to slump over four feet (~1.5 m) during several episodes of heavy precipitation. To mitigate the slumping, Federal Highways Administration and park staff removed the clay, backfilled with materials that were less susceptible to slumping, and added perforated pipes to drain water from the area. The pipes have no obvious inlets, but their outlets can be seen poking out of the slope on the south side of the road.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "Small gardens on the left and right in the summer and spring. Otherwise the garden sits fallow. Wayside: Hidatsa Garden With simple tools, Hidatsa women grew corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers in the fertile soil along the Missouri and Knife Rivers. “My grandmother Turtle made scarecrows to frighten away the birds…she drove two sticks for legs, and bound two other sticks to them for arms: on the top she fastened a ball of cast-ways skins…Such a scarecrow looked wicked!” Picture: Hidatsa woman hoeing with bone hoe, 1912 Buffalo Bird Woman, known in Hidatsa as Maxidiwiac, was born about 1839, in an earthlodge along the knife River in present day North Dakota. In 1845, her people moved upstream and built Like-a-fishhook village, which they shared with the Mandan and Arikara. There Buffalo Bird Woman grew up to become an expert in traditional Hidatsa gardening. Mapi (Sunflower) “Usually we planted sunflowers only around the edges of a field. We thought a field surrounded thus by a sparse sown row of sunflowers, has a handsome appearance.” Ama’ca (Beans) “In the spring, when I came to plant beans, I was careful to select seeds for the following points: seed should be fully ripe…plump, and good size.” Ko’xati (Corn) “We knew when corn planting time came by observing the leaves of the wild gooseberry bushes. This is the first of the woods to leaf in the spring.” Kuku’l (Squash) “We had a reason for planting the squash seeds in the side of a hill. If we planted them in level ground the rains would beat down the soil …but if we planted the sprouts on the side of the hill, the water from the rains would flow over them and keep the soil soft.” Buffalo Bird Woman’s Garden As you walk further north there is a Drying Stage on the right. the description below for a Watchers' stage is similar to the Drying Stage. \"A watchers' stage was not hard to build. Four posts, forked at the tops, upheld beams, on which was laid a floor of puncheons, or split small logs, at the height of the full grown corn. The floor was about four feet long by three wide, roomy enough for two girls to sit together comfortably. Often a soft robe was spread on the floor. A ladder made of the trunk of a tree rested against the stage. The latter had three steps.\" Wilson, Waheenee Wayside: Drying Stages \"A corn drying stage stood before every lodge.\" Buffalo Bird woman's Garden \"By far the chief use of the drying stage was to dry vegetables, especially our corn and sliced squashes. Firewood, collected from the Missouri in the June rise [flood], was often piled on and under the stage floor to dry.\" \"The keepers of the O'kipa ceremony used to bring out their buffalo head masks, and air them on the drying stage that stood before their lodge door.\" Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden",

            "bodyText": "<p>Route 66 tends to evoke images of open, western landscapes like Monument Valley, but the road is also urban. Nowhere is it more so than in downtown Chicago, where the quintessential American corridor begins, or ends, depending on your perspective, at Grant Park. At the intersection of Jackson and Michigan Avenues is the “End Historic Route 66” sign. Many vintage icons from the Route 66 era have been lost, but not Grant Park, the historic road’s official eastern terminus.<br /> <br /> Located in close proximity to Lake Michigan, Grant Park is one of the oldest parks in the city and had its beginnings in the 1830s, but the 1893 World Exposition was a catalyst for its historic significance. Chicago spent $27 million hosting the landmark event. Running from May to October of 1893, the fair covered 633 acres and attracted numbers equal to nearly half of the United States population. The fair introduced several firsts, including Cracker Jacks, Aunt Jemima syrup, diet soda, and Pabst beer. It also introduced the idea of making Grant Park a major civic and cultural landmark.<br /> <br /> In all, Grant Park lived up to its promise as Chicago’s cultural and civic center. Grand promenades, groomed lawns, and numerous bridges and fountains, along with modern installations of art and three major historic cultural institutions for the public--the Art Institute, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Field Museum of Natural History--all distinguish the park. Statues of Christopher Columbus, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S Grant, and various other equestrian sculptures provide visual focus for various areas. Built in 1927, the Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain is a monumental focal point. The park hosts public appearances of famous people, special events, and festivals and serves as a neighborhood park used for baseball games, ice skating, tennis, walking, jogging, and other amusements.<br /> <br /> Pairing Grant Park with Route 66, the major east-west automobile artery, was a natural choice. Before the advent of Route 66, the popular Pontiac Trail already connected Chicago to St. Louis. In 1918, Illinois began paving the road. By the time Route 66 came along, the entire Pontiac Trail had pavement. By 1927, when Louis Armstrong and the accompanying King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, ushered in the Jazz Age in Chicago, Route 66 signs were visible all along the Illinois route.  Chicago sported numerous services to accommodate travelers, including its parkland gem, Grant Park. The National Park Service acknowledged Grant Park’s significance in its 1993 National Register of Historic Places listing.<br /> <br /> Grant Park’s street address is 337 East Randolph St. in Chicago, IL. The park is bounded on the north by Randolph Dr. and the Chicago River, on the east by Lake Michigan, on the south by McFetridge Dr., and on the west by Michigan Ave.<br /> <br /> For more information visit the <a href=\"https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/grant-ulysses-park#Info\">Chicago Park District Grant Park website.</a><br /> <br /> See the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/\">Art Institute of Chicago website</a> for information about visiting.<br /> See the <a href=\"https://www.sheddaquarium.org/\">Shedd Aquarium website</a> for information about visiting.<br /> See the <a href=\"https://www.fieldmuseum.org/\">Field Museum website</a> for information on visiting.<br /> <br /> Find the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/database-research.htm\">Grant Park National Register nomination form.</a></p>",

Prior to the bridge, access was only available via vehicle ferry from the Oregon Inlet Fishing Center. The completion of the bridge brought well needed connections to the southern Outer Banks, as well as faster evacuation routes during severe weather.<br /> <br /> The Bonner Bridge reached the end of its functional lifespan in the 2010s, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation began a bridge replacement project. In 2019, the new Marc Basnight Bridge opened, replacing the Bonner Bridge. As part of the replacement project, the remnant 1000ft of the bridge on the Hatteras side of Oregon Inlet was retained as a structure to help train the ocean current further into the center of the inlet to aid navigation and as a pedestrian and fishing structure. <h2>Rules</h2> <br /> Fishing is a fun and rewarding experience.

Notice how the stonework near the trail is missing and that fewer stones remain the closer to the trail you get. Take a look at the other side of the trail too, can you see evidence that the ramp continued this side? What explanation can you think of for these missing stones?<br /> <br /> The answer is… The stones were removed to facilitate trail construction in this section. The historic trail intersects this hōlua and shows that it was constructed <i>after</i> the hōlua was in use. The original ancient trail would have run closer to the shoreline, avoiding this area that was reserved for the <em>aliʻi</em> (chiefs). Stones that were removed from the holua and incorporated into the construction of the trail.<br /> <br /> This hōlua is found in the <em>ahupuaʻa</em> (land division) of Kēōka, one of the three ahupuaʻa that the 1871 trail traverses.</p>",

When a day’s downpour adds to glacial melt the stream may rise six feet, undermining the bank and toppling trees into the flood, washing them down to river mouth and beach. Some fall from eroding headlands. Numbered trunks are strays from tug-pulled log rafts. Drift logs are dangerous. At high tide they may suddenly roll. Unwary people have been crushed and killed by drift logs. Riptides make swimming and wading dangerous. There are no lifeguards. Swimmers beware.

The largest, labeled Perch, has a wide oval body that is dark across the top with a white side and belly. A spined fin runs along most of its back with a shorter fin along its underside.

Text at the top right reads: Sea Stacks. A link between land and sea, offshore islands provide sanctuary for ocean birds to breed and raise their young. Cormorants and murres nest on ledges; pigeon guillemots and petrels nest in crevices. Ranging far out to sea for all their food, many birds come no closer to the mainland than these rocky outposts. Some offshore islands are ghosts of former headlands. Surf gnaws islands out of the shoreline. Harder rock is all that remains. Below the text, is a comparative illustration showing three side-by-side slices of tall headland jutting into the ocean, each slice representing a different stage in sea stack creation. On the left, the headland is solid. In the center, an arch has formed at the tip of the headland, and on the right, the arch is gone, leaving a tall vertical column of rock standing alone in the ocean.",

Beginning with the panel on the left, text in the top right reads, Tidepool Life. Twice a day, drowned in seawater, then exposed to frying sun. Hammered by storm waves. Tidepools are home to a variety of sea creatures surviving ingeniously. Notice their shapes. Many are low and rounded to withstand pounding surf. Anemones cluster, reducing evaporation, crowding competing organisms, and amassing more tentacles to catch, sting and hold prey. Find the best pools at low tide near the large rock to the north. Look and enjoy, but please don’t disturb. Filling the left side and bottom of the panel, an illustration provides a cross section view of a tidepool. Above the water on a seaweed covered rock are two white Glaucous-winged gulls, one pecking at a cup shaped limpet attached to a rock. A Black oystercatcher with a black body, long, wedge shaped bill, white eye and log legs stands on a rock. Underwater, a thick bodied Ochre star and triangle shaped Black turban shell are attached to a rock. A hermit crab extends out from its shell. A green sea anemone, its short, round body topped with a ring of tentacles sits beside the sac shaped body of a Solitary tunicate. A small fish called a Sculpin swims among the rocks. The wayside panel on the right, has text that reads, Drift Logs and Riptides. Beach logs are the bones of a rain forest picked clean by the sea. They begin in river valleys, giant conifers like Sitka spruce. When a day’s downpour adds to glacial melt the stream may rise six feet, undermining the bank and toppling trees into the flood, washing them down to river mouth and beach. Some fall from eroding headlands. Numbered trunks are strays from tug-pulled log rafts. Drift logs are dangerous. At high tide they may suddenly roll. Unwary people have been crushed and killed by drift logs. Riptides make swimming and wading dangerous. There are no lifeguards. Swimmers beware. On the left side of the panel, an aerial view illustration shows the churning water of a rip current rolling perpendicular to the shoreline through a narrow gap between the shore and a sandbar. In the center of the panel, is a smaller drawing at beach level of a jumbled pile of drift logs.",

In the top left corner, text reads, Human disturbance has severely impacted most Pacific Coast tidepools. This brilliant collage of plants and animals can easily be destroyed. Tubeworms, seastars, sea anemones and other tidepool creatures, along with all wildlife, are protected in Olympic National Park. Please leave intertidal plants and animals undisturbed in their natural habitat. To the left of the text is an illustration of tubeworms standing erect, their feathery gills extending above the top of their long, thin bodies like open umbrellas. The final illustration in the left bottom corner shows a person standing in the surf at ocean’s edge holding a fishing rod. Text reads, Surf fishing? Any natural bait native to Olympic National Park can be used only during its legal harvest season – check park regulations regarding crabs, fish, and shellfish. It is never legal, however, to remove or possess tidepool life. Removing only a few tubeworms weakens the entire colony.",

Text at the top right reads: Tilting Coast. The rocks are at odd angles –tilted, almost overturned. Younger layers are underneath the older stone. Originally, these sediment layers settled in a deep ocean basin to the west. But continental movement has shifted things during the last 15 million years. Earth’s outer crust consists of vast mobile plates carried along by convection currents. As the ocean floor collided and dipped beneath the land plate, the rocks which form the Olympic peninsula were skimmed off and added to the continent. Below the text is a diagram illustrating the geologic process of land building. To the right, is a cross section illustration of clams buried in sandstone with text that reads: The holes in the rocks around you were drilled by piddock clams. These clams use a rocking motion to burrow into the sandstone.",

First, it is important to know that since 1759, the size of the property has shrunk significantly. Consequently, many of the changes in this area were likely farther from the house than you see today. </p> <p paraeid=\"{41869baa-80af-4b8c-b1f2-d37d1753bb9b}{49}\" paraid=\"102903385\">Change to the east lawn first occured with Andrew and Elizabeth Craigie, who were both deeply interested in extravagance and horticulture. Early into their ownership of the house, the Craigies added additions to the back of the house and built large porches on either side (the same porches you see today). According to Henry Longfellow, the Craigies also had lovely gardens. It is likely some of these gardens existed in this general area, and it is known that one greenhouse existed east of the house as well. </p> <p paraeid=\"{41869baa-80af-4b8c-b1f2-d37d1753bb9b}{59}\" paraid=\"1705181122\">The Longfellows adapted this space to suit their leisurely needs and provide space for raising a family. The enormous linden tree you see today was likely first planted around the time that the Longfellows bought the house in 1843. The Longfellows adored the linden tree, so much that when their gardener mistakenly cut off its low branches, Henry wrote in his journal, “O day of woe! ... My walk on the Eastern piazza is desecrated! I am wretchedly disturbed, and poor Fanny is in tears and quite heart broken.” In addition to maintaining the linden tree, the Longfellows also added balustrades to the porches (there were no railings when the Craigies built it), and planted small orchard in this area, although it is unknown exactly when it existed in the landscape. </p>",

The right side of the lawn is bounded by hedges and an additional gravel pathway. A large fenced historic garden is located at the rear of the East Lawn, with an entrance gate on the left side.

In 1759, John Vassall, Esquire used his family’s wealth – which derived from Jamaican sugar plantations – to purchase large plots of land in Cambridge and build the mansion you see today. Vassall built this house in a traditional Georgian style, having a rectangular shape and symmetrical design typical of that era. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b01f525c-fcd9-4b55-a42c-5244fee202ca}{224}\" paraid=\"1931254607\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{b01f525c-fcd9-4b55-a42c-5244fee202ca}{228}\" paraid=\"1566385727\">When the Craigies bought this property in 1792, they focused on embellishing the landscape to show off their wealth. Here at the front of the property, the Craigies removed part of the brick wall replaced it with the wooden fencing you see today (a popular trend of the era). It is also likely that prior to the Craigies, a circular driveway was in front of the house, which the Craigies then moved to the western side (where you see the carriage loop today). </p> <p paraeid=\"{80ecc1a4-42d0-4682-99ba-0c87168c18f6}{3}\" paraid=\"771452523\">Later on, the Longfellows added to the Forecourt in a way that embellished and attempted to preserve the house’s charm. The lilac beds you see today were first planted by the Longfellows to shield the Forecourt and home from the bustling noise on Brattle Street. Furthermore, Henry Longfellow preserved the elm trees in the Forecourt the best he could. He believed the elms dated to Washington’s era, writing that “the magnificent elms… signalized the place and under whose shadow Washington had walked.” In 1872, Henry also added the balustrade (fence-like structure) you see running along the path leading to the sides of the house. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Forecourt is the front yard of the house that abuts Brattle Street. The border facing Brattle Street is lined with taupe-colored, Chippendale-patterned woodwork fencing and brick walls. An entrance for pedestrians is at the midpoint of the fence line. Walking through the visitor entrance, guests pass between dense masses of lilac shrubs and tall elm trees, following a path that leads directly to the front door of the house. The yellow house is built in a Georgian design, having symmetrical features like the windows and black shutters as well as four white pilasters that decorate the front of the house. The landscape is designed to give a sense of grandeur and the topography of the forecourt is organized into three levels of elevation that grow higher leading to the house. Three short flights of sandstone steps lead to the house, raising each terrace about two feet from the prior. A white wooden balustrade with woodbine growing underneath accentuates the edge of the first terrace and behind it is a stone dust pathway that runs east/west and curves around the sides of the house to provide easy direction.",

The covered bridge provided easy movement for the Confederates, intent on speeding 15,000 troops with their horses, wagons, and artillery toward their objective, Washington, D.C. Union General Wallace ordered the bridge held “at all hazard.” Throughout the morning the Confederates advanced on the bridge, but a determined Union force held them back. By noon, Wallace decided to move his troops toward the Confederate threat at the Thomas farm, then ordered the bridge burned. Sheaves of wheat were gathered and ignited under the bridge's roof; flames engulfed the structure destroying it.<br /> <br /> <i>[The covered bridge] had to go.… I remember as if it were yesterday the struggle I had with myself to have the match applied.… I gave the word and in a moment…the old crossing was in a whirl of flame and smoke.</i> — Union Major General Lew Wallace<br />  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Burning the Bridge wayside is located on the Gambrill Mill Trail on the boardwalk facing North-West overlooking the Monocacy River. The wayside is posted along the boardwalk fencing.   The wayside is a typical National Park Service wayside roughly 3 feet tall and is rectangular in shape with a brown metal frame supporting a laminated informative panel that is roughly 2 feet by 3 feet. The panel has an artist’s color rendering of Union troops retreating across the Georgetown Pike wooden covered bridge. The bridge is on fire with thick smoke billowing from the roof. Two Union soldiers carrying their weapons and packs are retreating toward the viewer while one Union solder lies wounded on the ground. Two other Union soldiers are trapped on the other side of the Monocacy River.  The view surrounding the wayside: The foreground as you look North-West is a slope down to the Monocacy River with tree cover to the left when facing the wayside. Above the river stretches the present-day Urbana Pike, Route 355, roughly were the old Georgetown Pike wooden covered bridge stood. To your left is the boardwalk trail stretching back to the Gambrill Mill parking lot. Behind you is a wet meadow wetland full of swampy brush and scrub. The trail circles the wetland. To your right is another wayside the Desperate Escape wayside as well as a ramp leading down from the boardwalk onto the ground level trail.",

In this 1921 photo of Kīpukapuaulu, only a grassy cattle pasture remains beneath a canopy of grandparent trees. Absent are the young trees and native forest floor plants beneath them. Had those conditions continued, Kīpukapuaulu would have looked much different today. Today’s understory is flourishing. The recovery of the forest floor plants has not only increased the diversity of native plants here, but also restored plants of cultural significance, like the endemic ʻalaʻalawainui (<em>Peperomia cookiana</em>), the indigenous palapalai fern (<em>Microlepia strigosa</em>), and the common kupukupu swordfern (<em>Nephrolepis exaltata and cordifolia</em>). Without question, much of Hawaiʻi’s extraordinary plant life plays an essential role in the Hawaiian culture. ʻAlaʻalawainui is widely used by native Hawaiians for its medicinal value. Palapalai and kupukupu are most commonly haku (braided) or hili (plaited) to create lei for hula—lei poʻo (lei worn on the head), lei ʻāʻī (lei worn on the shoulders), and lei kūpeʻe (lei worn as a bracelet around the wrists and ankles). These, and other plants, are meticulously collected and offered as hoʻokupu (spiritual gift) to the goddess Pelehonuamea or placed on the sacred kūʻahu (hula altar) in honor of the goddess Laka—the ʻaumakua to whom hula practitioners pay homage. These now thriving, culturally significant plants are the most common species found in the returning understory of Kīpukapuaulu.",

It wasn’t until 1934 that the Kīpukapuaulu trail was constructed by the hard-working “boys” of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)—a program established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933. This emergency work program was implemented to provide economic relief for American families from the Great Depression by employing young men during a time when jobs were scarce. Working alongside skilled laborers, these “boys” became known as Roosevelt’s “Tree Army”—then, the most effective large-scale environmental program in the nation. Several camps were opened through Hawaiʻi. The largest camp on the island of Hawaiʻi was built in Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park (1934–1942). It housed some 200 young men that, while working and living in the park, accomplished many great tasks—establishing much of the Park’s early infrastructure. One such project included the construction of the Kīpukapuaulu trail. They later followed that with several additional projects aimed at invasive grasses removal, tree seedling plantings, and tree identification—all a testament to the significance of Kīpukapuaulu as a “veritable botanical oasis.”",

It is the only cave in the park to have lights and interpretive signs explaing the cave formations, ecology and cave climate. Even thought the cave is lite we still recommend bringing extra lights and always watch your head.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>770 feet. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Cave has a relatively \"smooth\" path (paved). <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>524 foot walk. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

The elder mānele trees in front of you are the exclusive host plants to two of these small, rare picture-wing flies, <em>Drosophila mimica</em> and <em>Drosophila engyochracea</em>. Ecologist Dr. David Foote has been counting the populations of these two flies periodically since the mid-1990s by attracting them to sponges marinated in a concoction of decaying mushrooms. He is encouraged about the future of<em> Drosophila mimica</em>, as this species is thriving, by feeding on the rotting fruits of the recovering mānele trees. It is a much different story for the <em>Drosophila engyochracea</em>, whose populations have plummeted in the last three decades. Very few flies have been observed since 2007. The villains of this story are alien predators, including yellow jacket wasps and, possibly, a newly arrived spider that lives in the bark of these mānele trees. As predators of the <em>Drosophila engyochracea</em>, they are eating this species to extinction.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Progressive Club Sea Island Center on Johns Island, South Carolina is significant for its role as a Citizenship School and for its association with events and persons important in the African American Civil Rights movement. The club building on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with the development of continued adult education, social history, politics, ethnic heritage, recreation, and commerce for the African American community of the Sea Islands beginning with the building’s construction in 1963 until the death of the Club’s founder Esau Jenkins in 1972. The structure and site served as a vital community center, providing a home for the Progressive Club’s legal and financial assistance program, adult education program, dormitory lodging, and as a community recreational facility, childcare center, meeting place and grocery store.<br /> <br /> In 1948, Jenkins formed the club with Joe Williams after an island local, Sammy Grant, was shot by a white man while defending himself from an attack by the man’s dog. The case against the dog owner was dismissed by a magistrate judge, and Jenkins and Williams raised money from other islanders to appeal the judge’s decision. Their efforts were successful, and the dog owner was convicted of aggravated assault. Jenkins and Williams decided to create an organization that would help secure funds and legal help for the local Black community. They called their organization the Progressive Club, and members helped islanders find solutions to a variety of problems, such as finding transportation to work in neighboring Charleston. For this purpose, Jenkins secured a bus for work commuters as well as island children who needed to get to school.<br /> <br /> In August 1954, Esau Jenkins was encouraged to travel to Tennessee to attend a workshop and to meet with Miles Horton of Highlander Folk Center, a social justice leadership training and education center. At the August 1954 workshop Jenkins explained that the Island community needed trained educators to establish an adult education and citizenship class to teach adult African-American Island residents how to read and write. The week’s workshop also stimulated Esau’s interest in developing a more robust political action strategy on the island by finding people to help get the island’s Black community registered to vote. Septima Poinsette Clark was just the person to do just that. The following summer Clark attended a similar workshop. Clark, a native of Johns Island, would eventually begin working as a field representative for the Highlander Folk Center. She had been fired as an elementary school teacher by the State of South Carolina because of her membership in the NAACP. While at Highlander, Clark developed what would ultimately become the general curricula for Citizenship Schools. Clark and Bernice Robinson also began a program at the Progressive Club to train new citizenship schoolteachers.<br /> <br /> In 1956 the club purchased the vacant Mount Zion Elementary School to serve as its headquarters. The school building needed extensive work, including electricity and indoor plumbing. The club was able to restore the building with the financial support of its members and the Highlander Folk Center. The Citizenship School within the Progressive Club – inspired by the Highlander Folk Center – opened in the former school building in 1957.<br /> <br /> The success of the Citizenship School led to the development of other Citizenship Schools on other rural islands in South Carolina, such as Edisto and St. Helena. In 1962, the old Mt. Zion Elementary School was razed, and the current, larger structure called The Progressive Club Sea Island Center was built in its place. The new building broke ground in October of 1962 and was completed in March of 1963. The new building was able to provide more services and programs to a larger area, and the new center served not only Johns Island, but also those from nearby James and Wadmalaw Islands. The new structure also included a grocery store with fuel pumps in the front of the building; a multi-purpose room that was used as a gymnasium, classroom, community center, day care and commercial kitchen. Additionally, four dormitories for over-night visitors had also been added. These facilities created a safe environment for the community to congregate and hold meetings. Many workshops were held there and were often led or attended by nationally recognized leaders in the movement. For instance, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Johns Island twice to attend meetings and workshops at the Progressive Club and stayed at the home of Esau and his wife Janie Jenkins. The workshops offered at the new center represented the success of the Progressive Club’s initial mission of literacy education and voter registration.<br /> <br /> After Jenkins’ death in 1972, many services offered by the club came to an end, though the grocery store continued to operate until 1975. The grocery store remained until Hurricane Hugo damaged the roof of the building in 1989. The Progressive Club had no insurance on its building, and the club was denied funds by FEMA. Today club members are hoping to restore the building and continue the legacy of community building and social justice. In 2007, the Progressive Club Sea Island Center was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> In September 2021, the Progressive Club was added to the African American Civil Rights Network for its connection to the civil rights movement.<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private resources.</em></p>",

To the west are barren salt flats that are the source of these beautiful dunes. When rain runs off the highly soluble limestone rock in the adjacent mountains, salts are leached. This runoff pools in the desert basin and as it evaporates, large grains of mineral salts are left behind. The wind carries the salt grains northeast toward the Guadalupe Mountains and deposits them at the base of the western Guadalupe escarpment to form gypsum dunes.<br /> <br /> The dune landscape is geologically young. It developed over the past few thousand years as dissolved salts and gypsum from an adjacent lake bed were deposited by wind into ever changing sculpted hill, swale, and ripple formations. The mesquite coppice dunes form stabilized spots where wildlife abounds.<br /> <br /> The dunes environment is home to gypsum-loving plant and animal life such as gypsum scalebroom, a white variant of the lesser earless spiny lizard, and five of the park’s seven species of scorpions.<br /> <br /> Visitors are allowed to hike over the open dunes, but are encouraged to avoid walking on the fragile biological soil crusts. Visitors may also hike on abandoned ranch road traces and discover windmills and other historic remnants of the past. Temperatures in the dunes area are generally mild in the winter and dangerously hot in the summer.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Founded in 1862 as a school for freed slaves, Penn School established a commitment to Black education, community welfare, and cultural heritage that has remained strong for over 150 years. Penn School functioned as an educational institution, health clinic, farm bureau, catalyst for community action, and a repository for preserving St. Helena Island’s unique Gullah heritage and written history.<br /> <br /> The founders of Penn School were northern missionaries and abolitionists who came to the South Carolina sea island following the Union occupation of the area during the Civil War. Education was a top priority; classes for freedmen were held in barns, cabins, and deserted plantation houses scattered across St. Helena. The only school of this type to survive was Penn School, established by Laura Town and Ellen Murray, on land purchased from Hasting Gantt, a freedman and entrepreneur. A private charity composed mostly of Quaker abolitionists in Philadelphia supported Penn during its early decades. After the demise of the state’s Reconstruction regime, the school struggled financially. Rossa B. Cooley and Grace House, two northern white educational philanthropists, took over leadership of the school at the turn of the century and revised the curriculum to follow the Hampton-Tuskegee model of Black education. In addition to training students in masonry, carpentry, and the domestic arts, Penn School trained midwives and offered relief to St. Helena Island residents suffering from economic hardship during the Great Depression. Although the school closed in 1948, the community service and cultural preservation functions originated by the school’s founders flourished through Penn Community Services, Inc., organized in 1951. Penn opened South Carolina’s first day care center for African Americans, provided a community health care clinic, and began a Teen Canteen for local teenagers.<br /> <br /> Under the direction of devout Quakers, Courtney and Elizabeth Siceloff, Penn Center became a major facilitator for civil rights and social justice activism. The isolated campus was one of the few places in the Jim Crow South where interracial organizations met, and sometimes stayed overnight, without the threat of legal action. The Siceloffs embraced the movement after conversations with local residents who shared how unequal education, generational poverty, political disenfranchisement and segregation shaped their lives. According to historians Orville Burton and Wilbur Cross, the Siceloffs broke away from the condescending notion that the Black community needed to be “taught” citizenship to become “civilized” and “Americanized” and eventually understood the “Christian commitment and theological worldview” of their African American neighbors long before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. brought it into the mainstream.<br /> <br /> Throughout the 1960s, Penn Center sponsored and hosted interracial conferences on civil rights organized by groups such as the NAACP, CORE, SNCC, Southern Regional Council, South Carolina Council on Human Relations, World Peace Foundation, and the Peace Corps. The Baha’i Faith also held religious meetings at Penn to avoid scrutiny due to the interracial makeup of its congregation and their opposition to segregation. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) held citizenship education classes at Penn, taught by iconic organizers Andrew Young, Dorothy Cotton, Bernice Robinson, and Septima P. Clark. These integrated organizations stealthily met and strategized on this isolated campus, safely under the radar of local authorities, the public and the press.Young eventually introduced Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Penn Center. King, his SCLC lieutenants, and countless unnamed activists met with the SCLC at Penn five times between 1964 and 1967.<br /> <br /> The isolated campus on St. Helena Island became a bastion of peace and a place of refuge where King could unwind, breathe freely and express himself openly, saying things in front of groups at Penn that he couldn’t say on the national stage. Folk singer Joan Baez, who attended a retreat in 1966, recalled King saying, “he couldn’t take the pressure anymore, that he just wanted to go back…and preach in his little church, and he was tired of being a leader.” King composed many of his speeches at Penn, including his “I Have a Dream” speech, which he wrote while staying in Hastings Gantt cottage. He practiced the address at nearby Brick Baptist Church. At Penn, King was able to voice publicly his unpopular anti-Vietnam War stance and express his concerns for the 40 million Americans living in poverty, which led to his strong opinions about the intrinsic evils of capitalism.<br /> <br /> King organized retreats at Penn Center as opportunities for he and fellow SCLC members to debate the utility of nonviolence and the need to broaden the civil rights movement from a regional to a national focus. During a retreat in September 1965, SCLC leadership and staff became embroiled in fierce debate over whether to relocate the movement to Chicago. Septima Clark and other veteran staffers, as well as the Penn staff, felt that citizenship education should be the focus. They believed that protests and demonstrations had a place in the movement but should be secondary to laying the groundwork.<br /> <br /> Younger staffers, frustrated by the slow pace of progress, wanted more direct-action protests. SCLC leaders decided to take the movement to the North and begin training staff for activism in the Chicago campaign. At the same time, Diane Nash Bevel, a former Freedom Rider who had joined the SCLC staff in 1962, would continue to develop educational programs on nonviolence in the South.<br /> <br /> Subsequent retreats revealed the continuing evolution of the nonviolent philosophy of Dr. King and the SCLC. In November 1966, during one of the only formal speeches he gave at Penn, Dr. King connected the long struggle for African American civil rights to the neglected fight for economic equality. Tying his antiwar stance to his broader focus on human rights, the civil rights icon pledged to use nonviolence to fight America’s three evil, “inseparable triplets”: racism, excessive materialism, and militarism. King’s speech and the sessions from this retreat became the basis for his 1967 book entitled Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? A year later, King and the SCLC returned to finalize plans for a mass demonstration in Washington D.C. to protest poverty and the evils of capitalism. Dubbed the “Poor People’s Campaign,” the plan received mixed reviews and caused further division within the ranks of the SCLC.<br /> <br /> King did his best to reaffirm the SCLC’s role of offering hope, determination, and a commitment to nonviolence. Four months later, on April 4, 1968, he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, the day after he arrived to support striking sanitation workers in the city. Penn had begun constructing a remote cabin on the marsh for future visits but he was killed before it was completed. It is still referred to as the Martin Luther King cabin.The historic campus, Brick Church, and surrounding areas were listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 9, 1974. In subsequent decades, Penn Center continued to serve as a site for church and organizational retreats, a training center for various organizations, and an educational site for Black history and culture.<br /> <br /> In January 2017, President Barack Obama designated the Beaufort National Landmark District, Camp Saxton Site, Penn Historic District and the Old Beaufort Firehouse as the Reconstruction Era National Historical Park to preserve and commemorate activities during Reconstruction under management of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> In September 2021, the Penn Center was added to the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> (AACRN).<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private resources.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Sandy Island School on Sandy Island, South Carolina is significant to the story of African American civil rights in South Carolina because it served as the central location for the islander community’s activism for political representation and cultural preservation. The school embodies the self-sufficiency of the Sandy Island community in the face of unequal and scarce educational resources for African Americans throughout the twentieth century. Through the islanders’ collective determination and action, students received a quality education in the face of meager resources, enabling them to flourish in their chosen careers off the island.<br /> <br /> The construction of Sandy Island School, the salaries of its teachers, and even living quarters for the faculty were financed entirely by a wealthy northern couple, Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington. In 1929, the Huntington’s purchased four former plantations and additional acreage on Sandy Island. Archer Milton Huntington (1870-1955) was a poet, scholar, and avid supporter of the arts. Anna Hyatt Huntington (1876-1973) was an award-winning sculptor who came from a family that valued higher education and the arts. The Huntington’s acquisition of land along the Waccamaw Neck was part of a wider trend of wealthy families purchasing abandoned or financially strapped former plantations in the coastal south after the collapse of the plantation rice economy. On Sandy Island, the Huntington’s built the school, as well as an identical (now demolished) school near Brookgreen Plantation, in addition to a medical clinic, and a still-extant church, Brown Chapel.<br /> <br /> Prior to the building of Sandy Island School, education on the island took place in residents’ homes or in churches, with the islanders paying the teachers’ salaries. Students only attended school for four or five months out of the year because families needed their children during the planting and harvesting season, and the community could only afford the teachers’ wages for a portion of the year. Over time, the teachers who taught on Sandy Island became an important part of the community, including a man who would become the last African American member in the South Carolina House of Representatives until 1970, John William Bolts. In fact, Sandy Island served as one of the largest African American voting blocks in Georgetown and unanimously elected Black representatives to the national and state legislators until Jim Crow voting officials removed it as a voting precinct in 1902.<br /> <br /> Once the school was constructed, Sandy Island’s children went to school for a full nine-month term. One of the first teachers and first principal of the new school was Doland Bland, a graduate of Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. According to employment records, another early teacher was S.W. Tucker, who lived in the teacher’s cottage from September 1938 to May 1942. To staff the school, the island’s leaders often called upon college-educated community members like Emily Collins Pyatt, a graduate of Benedict College, who taught on the island for eleven years. Education at the school reflected the religious values of the community, and many former students and Sandy Island residents, such as Laura Herriot, recall teachers beginning each school day with a prayer and religious song.<br /> <br /> While Sandy Island was and remains an island community, the educators on Sandy Island were far from isolated. The principal and teachers of the Sandy Island School were heavily involved in the organization and execution of the Brookgreen Welfare Conference throughout the 1930s and 1940s, which was founded by Seymour Carroll, chairman of the South Carolina Natural Resources Commission. The Brookgreen Welfare Conference was a statewide and regional conference that brought together volunteer health practitioners, who provided care for residents, and African American political leaders from across the state. Bland or Miles Bogan, principal of Brookgreen School, often chaired the organizational committee for the conference. The Sandy Island School children performed for the conference attendees, and the Brookgreen and Sandy Island schools hosted several of the conference’s sessions. Horry and Georgetown County schools both offered holidays to their employees and students to attend the conference.In what Andrew Young has asserted was the very foundation of the Civil Rights Movement, African American political leaders throughout South Carolina began organizing adult education schools called Citizenship Schools to overcome the literacy test hurdle.<br /> <br /> In the late 1950s, Sandy Island School served as a host site for the Georgetown County Adult Negro School Program, a Citizenship School with close ties to the adult educational efforts on Johns Island. As such, Sandy Island has historic significance for its association with this movement of literacy and political empowerment among local African Americans within the region. The existence of such adult schools within Georgetown County, and the rest of South Carolina, has previously been undocumented. The Georgetown County Negro Adult School’s program was organized in a similar manner to the Citizenship Schools on Johns, Edisto, and Wadmalaw Island, which were also all active PDP precincts.In the late 1950s, Beatrice Funnye, current resident of Plantersville, SC, was a student in the Georgetown County Negro Adult School program in Plantersville, and her teacher was former Sandy Island School teacher and principal Emily Collins Pyatt. She remembers learning the South Carolina Constitution and the election process during the evening classes. However, there were also basic concepts such as general math taught.<br /> <br /> During this same period, Sandy Islander Yvonne Tucker-Harris recalls helping her grandmother complete math assignments for the Sandy Island’s adult classes. Central to the mission of the adult school, however, was voter registration. According to Funnye, Plantersville’s civic leaders told the community to attend the adult school to “learn how to read so you know how to vote.”<br /> <br /> Through the efforts of the NAACP, Progressive Democratic Party, and the Georgetown County Negro Adult School program, the total number of registered voters in Georgetown County increased from 5,608 to 10,366 (85%) between 1958-1962. Through these adult education courses, Sandy Island rekindled its political power hard-won during Reconstruction. Sandy Island’s seniors, who were past school age when the Sandy Island school was built, passed the challenging literacy tests each year to cast their vote—a practice continued until this day. Sandy Island and Waccamaw Neck activist and voting precinct volunteer Genevieve Peterkin described them as the most “civic-minded people” with a nearly 100% turnout in every election, and potential candidates would noticeably appeal to island community leaders, such as Prince Washington, for the islanders’ vote.<br /> <br /> The Sandy Island School was added to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> (AACRN) in September 2021. <br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private resources.</em></p>",

M. Topp. The Gladstone School is significant as an example of a school of the Long Progressive Era, a reform movement that prioritized educational improvement. Improvements to school buildings during this era included specialized spaces for subject matter instruction, and increased community engagement. The Gladstone School, with its Collegiate Gothic exterior featuring large window openings for plentiful light and air, and interior of specialized learning spaces and wide corridors for ease of circulation. The school contains two, three-story buildings connected by a pedestrian bridge. The buildings include the c. 1914-1924 building (with a 1965 addition), and the 1926 Annex building. The buildings are connected by a metal-clad contributing 1926 pedestrian bridge at the second floor.  <br /> <br /> The Gladstone School utilized the Progressive educational system wherein students would learn from both a “homeroom” teacher and other, more specialized personnel who could teach subjects such as music, art, and physical education. Progressives strove to provide students with an educational building set to the highest standards of sanitation, ventilation, and natural lighting. Curriculum reforms were also implemented to provide a more experimental learning-oriented education to youths. To this end, the schools featured auditoriums, shop rooms, libraries, and gymnasiums, along with specialized personnel who could teach students the arts, physical education, and home economics. The original building included 9 classrooms, a kindergarten, a Sewing Room, Cooking Room, Model Bed Room, Model Dining Room, and assorted ancillary spaces. <br />  <br /> The school was finished and occupied in the Fall of 1914 and dedicated the next year, servicing elementary and junior high students. In urban areas with dense populations of immigrants, such as Hazelwood, public schools also fulfilled the Reformers’ objective of Americanization. The “social” rooms and after-school adult English language courses offered at Gladstone in the 1920s were part of the “Americanization” process for newly arrived immigrants, accomplishing the Progressives’ objective to integrate the influx of immigrants into American society. Recreation spaces including gymnasiums and pools were becoming an important element of Progressive Schools, as reformers sought to incorporate health, wellness, and physical activity into education. When completed in 1924, the Annex building contained a swimming pool in its basement level, 14 classrooms on two floors above, and one large and one medium gymnasium on the two-story upper floor, along with “playrooms,” and locker rooms.  <br /> <br /> The school continued to operate and function as a Progressive Era elementary school and junior high school in the 1940s. By the 1950s, Post World War II, the demographics of Hazelwood had changed from southern and eastern European immigrant enclaves to predominantly African-American. Following displacement from Pittsburgh’s Lower Hill District urban renewal project which destroyed the commercial heart of the African American community, many settled in Hazelwood. At the same time, many of the while residents were moving to the suburbs, following national demographic and development trends spearheaded by the FHA and VHA programs. To accommodate demographic changes in population and age, in 1958 the entire Gladstone School was converted from an elementary and junior-high school into a high school.",

The congregation built the church using the limestone that was in the area as wood was hard to come by in the grasslands of western Kansas The church was occupied by two different congregations over the years, Mount Pleasant congregation worshiped in the building from 1885-1897. The A.M.E. domination worshiped in the church from 1910-1947 eventually the doors of the church closed due to declining membership. Remaining A.M.E members joined the 1st Baptist Church congregation. <b> </b><br /> <br /> The A.M.E. church received major restoration, the project entailed restoring the floors, walls, ceiling, and altar. As of 2021 the church is open for visitation with various exhibits and artifacts on display. ",
            "audioDescription": "The A.M.E church is a one room building 30 by 100 feet with a steep shingle roof. Stucco is plastered on outside of the limestone structure. On the front face of the church in large letters is A.M.E Church 1885. Through the double doors is a wooden floor with limestone hours. In the back of the church is a wooden altar. Small windows on the southern side of buildings with 3 metal stars placed above the windows. Outside the building is an interpretive wayside. Written on the way side. \" Leaning On The Lord The harsh Kansas prairie inspired the Nicodemus AME (African Methodist Episcopal) congregation even more to their faith. Rev Jerry Meyers and the five others organized the church in 1879. Members first met in dug outs and then in the First Baptist Church, Community Leader Rev. Meyers led the organization of the first school. 1885 Rev Charles brown and the forty members of the congregation raised funds for their own wooden Frame building ST. Paul’s AME Church. Fire destroyed the original Church Building in 1896. The congregation preserved and in 1010 They added the front foyer to the buildings at that time and the date 1885 was set over the door to commemorate Rev. Brown and the congregation’s first structure.\"",

Colonel Dan would be at the forefront of the assault with men from his old regiment, the 52<sup>nd</sup> Ohio infantry. In the minutes before the fateful action, Colonel Dan would recite a section from Thomas Macaulay’s 1842 poem ‘Horatius’ to his men. “Then out spake brave Horatius, the captain of the gate: To every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late. And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods”. This brigade would suffer heavy casualties during the fighting that would follow. ",

As a park ranger working on the South Rim, McKee saw the need for a partnership to support interpretive programs, publications, and efforts to preserve the canyon. From its beginning, the natural history association did just that, funding interpretive talks, research, and scientific papers. It continues to do so today as the Grand Canyon Conservancy.<br /> <br /> Today, GCC still serves its founding mission, and much more. Membership, general-audience publications, educational outreach, a field institute, and philanthropy programs were added over the years to serve the Conservancy's mission of cultivating support, education, and understanding of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More Information (Wi-Fi or cell service required)</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\">Grand Canyon Conservancy</a></p>",

Pets must be on leash at all times in the campground.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>Campground Dedication Ceremony</h4> <p>Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve dedicated Kendesnii Campground on July 27, 2012. Under sunny skies, the special event included a naming ceremony, a picnic, speeches and the unveiling of the cultural panel (interpretive wayside). Park Superintendent Rick Obernesser opened the event, saying “I am excited that so many of us are here today as we dedicate the park’s first official campground.” Kendesnii is the Ahtna name of Daisy Nicolai. She and her children had a spring camp in the campground area for many years. In addition to acknowledging the family’s connection to this site, using an Ahtna name for the campground recognizes the important association between Alaska Natives and Wrangell-St. Elias. Park staff worked with local tribes in identifying the campground name, and the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, on behalf of Daisy’s family, partnered with the park in organizing the dedication. Many of the more than 100 guests at the event were members of Daisy’s family. Also among the guests were Nabesna Road residents and park visitors camping at the site. Daisy’s closest surviving relatives – a sister and three daughters – shared memories of Daisy, as did several grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, Tribal Administrator Wilson Justin, who is also one of Daisy’s grandchildren, said “The honor of keeping a promise made a generation ago is privilege not always understood but vital to those who stand in shadows of our Traditions. Thank You to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park for the support in keeping that promise. Cheesh’na extends a welcome to all visitors to the Kendesnii Campground.” The campground is located at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road. It has vault toilets, picnic tables, and ten sites that will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. Currently there is no charge for use of the site. A canoe launch exists at the lake dock and development of a potable water well is being planned. Funding for campground construction came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Recreational Fee Demo Program.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Kendesnii Campground. 4 Â½ minutes.<br />The Kendesnii Campground is located in the Boreal Forest at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road, next to two small lakes. It has 10 sites around a circular dirt and gravel road, each of which will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. There are outhouses, picnic tables, fire rings, bear proof garbage containers, and a small boat launch for canoes and non-motorized watercraft only. <br />Note that at this time, there is no potable water source in the campground.<br />The campground is free and open year-round, but is not plowed during the winter. Reservations are not taken and not required.<br />At the end of the short entrance road, note a 10-foot (2.75 m) tall by 12-foot (3.5 m) wide wooden information station with a narrow, overhanging triangular roof. <br />At the left, the first of three information panels displays three black-and-white photographs across the top. The first photograph shows a man in a fur-lined hooded parka standing on the back of wooden sled in the snow. Text underneath this photograph describes the abundance of food and water in Wrangell St.-Elias National Park and Preserve:<br /><br />Salmon, lake trout, grayling, and burbot swim in the streams...Moose and caribou roam its boreal forest. And blueberries, cranberries, and mushrooms are found throughout its wilderness boundaries...Subsistence allows Alaska residents who live close to Wrangell St.-Elias to hunt, fish, and gather inside the park. For others, hunting is allowed only in the preserve.<br /><br />A second photograph shows a pair of Dall sheep grazing on a hillside, all white with spiral horns. Text underneath this photograph reads that one of the founding purposes of the park is to:<br /><br />...protect habitat for, and populations of, fish and wildlife.<br />Dall sheep are one of 48 mammal species who call this wilderness home. Found only in Alaska and northwest Canada, these stunning creatures keep to high, open areas., they are easily spotted on rock and tundra covered slopes during the summer...Wrangell St.-Elias protects more than 15,000 Dall sheep, one of the world's largest concentrations!<br /><br />A third photograph looks over the back of a man carrying a loaded pack, walking across the tundra towards a snow-covered peak. Text underneath reads:<br /><br />For many in Alaska, the wilderness provides recreation and renewal...The majority of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve is designated as a wilderness area. At nine million acres, it is the largest of the...designated wilderness areas...(in the) United States...(This) Wilderness Area is open to all. No permits are needed for hiking or camping.<br /><br />The second panel shows a map of the campground, while the third panel posts a full list of the Kendesnii Campground Rules and Regulations. Pets must be on a leash, you should try to bring in your own firewood, and hunting is prohibited within the campground from May 1 to September 30. If you need questions or require additional assistance, you may:<br /><br />Contact the Slana Ranger Station at 907-822-7401 (during winter call 907-822-5234)...For emergencies call 911. Cell reception is best at mileposts 1 through 18 and at MP 23 near Long Lake.<br /><br />From a position facing the information panels, turn right and move 20 feet (6 m), then turn left and move an additional 20 feet (6 m) forward to a bear-safe trash can, and an outhouse another 20 feet (6 m) beyond that on your left. <br />Note a six-foot (2 m) tall sign to the right of the toilet showing pictures of various animals and their footprints.<br />About 30 feet (9 m) to the right of this sign, a gravel path at the left leads up a gradual, winding incline to a small clearing, the campground amphitheater, with four, eight-foot (2.5 m) wooden benches and a fire pit.<br />Moving another 80 feet (24 m) along the dirt and gravel road beyond the amphitheater path, a short, dirt and gravel trail to the right leads to a small boat launch. About 40 feet (12 m) along this trail to the left, a winding, sometimes uneven interpretive trail leads up a small incline to a couple small picnic areas at the edge of the lake, with more views of the Wrangell Mountains. <br />Note there may be areas of standing water, rocks, and roots in the trail along the way.<br />â€ƒ<br /><br />",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Old Manse has stood witness to momentous events that helped shape the American character; from the first shots of the American Revolution on April 19, 1775 to the literary revolution of the mid-19th century. It was home to revolutionaries and to writers, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne, as well as to many remarkable women, such as Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley, who blazed a path for revolutions to come.<br /> <br /> The two and one-half story home follows a center hall floor plan. On the north side of the hall are the formal parlor and dining room, while a smaller parlor and kitchen are on the south side of the home. The window panes in the dining room bear inscriptions cut by Hawthorne and his wife with her diamond ring. The second floor contains bedrooms and at the northwest corner is the study used by both Emerson and Hawthorne.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/people/reverend-william-emerson.htm\">Reverend William Emerson</a> built The Old Manse in 1769 and it remains relatively unchanged today. In the years leading up to the outbreak of war in 1775, Reverend Emerson inspired his congregation to stand up and resist the the designs of the British Parliament to curtail their rights as Englishmen. In March of 1775 he delivered a firey sermon the Concord minute and militia companies during a muster. \"Arise! my injured countrymen! and plead even with the sword, the firelock and the bayonet, plead with your arms the birthright of Englishmen, the dearly-purchased legacy left you by your never-to-be-forgotten Fathers...\" Though he preached liberty, Reverend Emerson also enslaved four people at the Old Manse: Cate, Phyllis and her daughter, also named Phyllis, and Frank. On <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/april-19-1775.htm\">April 19, 1775</a> Reverend Emerson and his family witnessed the battle at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/places/concord-s-north-bridge.htm\">Concord's North Bridge</a> from the second floor windows.<br /> <br /> Nature writing in Concord, Massachusetts began at The Old Manse in Concord with Ralph Waldo Emerson’s first draft of Nature, published in 1836. Emerson wrote the first draft of his famous essay in the upstairs study, with its windows overlooking his grandfather’s fields, the Concord River, and the site of the famous North Bridge conflict. Another famous resident, Nathaniel Hawthorne, rented the house from 1842-1845, and lived there with his bride Sophia Peabody Hawthorne.<br /> <br /> Because Ralph Waldo Emerson penned the first draft of his groundbreaking short book, Nature, from The Old Manse study, this is the birthplace of the American Transcendentalism movement. The essay, which laid the foundation of the movement, challenged a new generation to demand their own works, laws, and worship. The small book pinpointed nature as a source of spiritual truth, beauty, and symbol as well as a professional discipline. In the woods free from the stresses of urbanization, Emerson believed individuals restored their faith and reason.<br /> <br /> The publication of Nature and several subsequent essays attracted a small group of highly talented men and women to Concord including Henry David Thoreau, Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, and others who formed the leadership of American Transcendentalism. The authors found solace in the natural aesthetic of Concord, exploring local woods and rivers, ideas on nature, social justices, and connections between physical and spiritual realism. They expressed their philosophy in principled actions by writing, giving speeches, and following their own prescriptions.<br /> <br /> The American literary movement continued to flourish at The Old Manse with the arrival of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who rented the house with his bride Sophia Peabody Hawthorne. They arrived at The Old Manse on their wedding day, July 9, 1842. Thoreau’s wedding gift to the Hawthornes was a vegetable garden, which Hawthorne described in the preface to Mosses to an Old Manse. Thoreau also described floating past The Old Manse in his first book A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers. Hawthorne made his own contributions to American nature writing in his preface to Mosses from an Old Manse, which lovingly details the pastoral beauty of The Old Manse landscape.<br /> <br /> The Old Manse had other connections with the Massachusetts conservation movement. Ornithologist William Brewster, the first president of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, owned a boathouse on the site for two years. Brewster recounted his affiliation with the boathouse in his personal journal where he described the feat of floating the boathouse downstream to a new location in 1892.<br /> <br /> In 1939, The Trustees of Reservations purchased The Old Manse along with most of its original furnishings. The Old Manse was designated a National Historic Landmark in the 1960s.<br /> <br /> The Old Manse is located at 269 Monument St. Concord, MA. The Old Manse has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The Old Manse offers guided tours, walk-in tours, and pre-booked tours.

A color illustration that assembles, in one scene, many of the plants and animals living in this old-growth forest habitat before you fills the panel. Text on the top left reads: National Treasure. Mingle with the centuries-old giants of Olympic National Park’s old-growth forests and become a part of history. Many of these western hemlock and Douglas-fir trees were thriving before Columbus set sail in 1492. They greeted guests at Sol Duc Resort in 1912 and stood stately when Olympic National Park was established in 1938. From seedlings to 750-year-old sentinels, this multi-layered forest harbors countless residents, from black bears and banana slugs to birds of many songs. In death, old growth takes on vital new roles. Standing snags serve as nesting sites for owls and small mammals. Fallen trees become nurse logs where saplings can sprout above the crowded forest floor. Decomposing leaves and logs provide refuge for salamanders, beetles and a bustling unseen world. This magnificent old-growth forest offers adventure and solace for wilderness enthusiasts from around the globe. It is a finely tuned system that ties the past to the present. Will this national treasure be a link to our future?” The illustration is a ground level view of an old growth forest. On the forest floor, a fallen tree dominates the foreground. It is covered with moss, white wildflowers, and plants with red berries. A snake, with its red tongue extended, slithers up the side of the tree. On top, are two yellow slugs with black spots and antenna, a black and orange bird, and two small pine tree saplings. Attached to the side of the tree are orange and white shelf-like fungi. On the ground, a small brown and white squirrel holds a pinecone. Next to the fallen tree on the left, the head of a small grey animal with dark eyes, short snout, and small rounded ears, peeks out from behind a moss-covered tree stump. In the forest background, a black bear walks by a tall plant with wide green leaves and red flowers. A brown elk with two five-pointed antlers stands near the wide base of tree. A brown and whited spotted owl is perched at the top of a dead tree, while below, a black and white woodpecker with a bright red head, clings to the bark. A small bird sits on its nest on a high moss-covered tree branch as a brown bird flies into the forest. On the left, a group of hikers walk through the forest.",

A color illustration assembling many of the plants and animals that live in the forest habitat before you, fills the panel. Text on the left reads: Night Shadows. Enter Olympic’s old-growth forest at twilight and share the darkening hours. A Columbia black-tailed deer unveils her silhouette through the evening curtain. Elusive cougars stalk deer by scent and sound. Songs of owls and frogs quicken the air. Fiery shadows leap from tree to tree as the setting sun kindles an intricate night world. One night creature, the northern spotted owl, needs old growth for survival. This threatened species nests in broken treetops and trunk hollows far above the forest floor. Flying squirrels, favored prey of spotted owls, scurry down to the forest floor to dig for truffles and spread the spores of future fungi. At this moment of opportunity, a vigilant spotted owl swoops down to snag a squirrel. Northern spotted owls, flying squirrels and truffles weave a unique tapestry in the old-growth forest night. What other vital connections can you discover? The illustration is a ground level view of a forest of tall trees, its floor covered in a lush carpet of green ferns, moss and decaying wood. Above the ground is an owl in flight with outstretched, upward curved brown wings edged with individual finger-like feathers and fanned out tail feathers. It has a white and brown chest and round head with two large dark round eyes and a thin white downward curved beak. A thin line of dark feathers shaped like a heart encircles its face. Clawed feet hang from its legs. On the ground, a grayish-brown squirrel crouches near a fallen tree, and a brown deer with large ears stands sideways as a brown cougar walks nearby.",

On this 4-foot-tall upright wayside panel, text in the bottom right corner reads: Wild Coast. The sea makes the rules. Hiking this long stretch of wilderness beach, you may have to climb headlands, cross numerous streams, enter a cocoon of fog, or follow animal tracks in the sand. There are no sheltered lagoons. If you ignore the tides, storm waves may trap you against a sheer cliff. Find solitude, or a whale’s jawbone, or a kind of bird you’ve never seen before. Filling the top half of the panel is a blue and white drawing of a wave hitting the rocky shoreline below high tree topped hills. A sea stack is offshore. In the bottom left corner, a blue and white drawing shows a hiker holding a hiking pole while traversing a jumble of rocks at the base of a hill, the ocean in the background.

The land is brown, and the ocean is blue. Ozette Lake also in blue is inland. The trail hugs the coast from Rialto Beach in the south to Cape Alava in the north. The text, You Are Here, marks your current location at Rialto Beach. In between the beginning and end of the trail, are marked locations for Hole-in-the-Wall, Cape Johnson, Norwegian Memorial, Yellow Banks, and Sand Point. Inland trails are marked by dashed lines at Sand Point and Cape Alava. The Ozette Ranger Station at the northern tip of Ozette Lake is marked with a Ranger and tent logo. Text reads: Caution: If no headland trail exists, wait until low tide before rounding Point. Leashed pets allowed only from Rialto Beach to Ellen Creek. Backcountry permits required for overnight camping.",

Filling the panel is a color illustration showing a cutaway view of a creek with salmon. Text reads: Protect Salmon. Please Don’t build dams or disturb the creek. Any disturbance to the gravel in this creek can be fatal to salmon. Coho salmon assume many different forms throughout their life. In the fall, adult salmon return from the ocean to spawn and deposit their eggs in the gravel. The young emerge in the spring and eventually swim back to the ocean beginning the cycle again. In the illustration, red salmon eggs deposited on the gravelly creek bottom are hatching. Several young orange-red salmon with yolk sacs attached to their bodies swim above the gravel in the blue green water. Other small salmon swim nearby, their egg sacs gone, and in the background, two adult salmon with spotted backs and red sides swim side-by-side.",
