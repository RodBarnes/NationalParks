The building, however, does not reflect the original appearance. In 1837 the structure was remodeled and repurposed as another barracks building in the fort, and commanding officeres had stuctures outside of the fort that they lived in.<br /> <br /> The left most door of the front of the building leads to a first floor exhibit that talks about Major Armistead, the creation of the Star-Spangled Banner flag, and how areas of this building would have looked in 1814. There is a rear entrance as well, and the building is open during normal visitation hours.",

These stone structures are sturdier and larger than quarters on most other plantations of the time. They were built as duplex units with a central interior wall, so it is likely that a family lived in the two rooms on each side.<br /> <br /> Family life for many of the enslaved centered around the Slave Quarters. It was here that families ate meals of salted pork, beef, corn meal and fish. These meals may have been supplemented by fresh vegetables grown in small gardens behind the quarters. Stories, told by the fireside, might recall ancient African traditions. In these buildings, enslaved families could enjoy a limited amount of privacy and could speak freely, away from the watchful eyes of the overseer or the Ridgely family.</p>",

In the 1740s, Colonel Charles Ridgely served as a member of the newly founded Maryland Jockey Club and passed on his love of horses to his son. The Ridgely family began to breed and racehorses in the late 1700s, before the mansion was built.<br /> <br /> Later, as owners of some of the finest Thoroughbreds in America, the Ridgelys were in part responsible for Maryland’s reputation as the center of American racing in the early 19th century.The racing and breeding of Thoroughbred horses reached its height at Hampton under Governor Charles Carnan Ridgely, and stables began to be constructed to support this purpose.<br /> <br /> Stable #1 was a two-story, stone-walled building built in 1805 on the west side of Stable Drive. The exterior was finished with scored stucco to match the Mansion. The stable housed prized racing horses as well as stable hands and jockeys who worked with them. Stable #1 was remodeled in the mid-1800s to reorient the central hall from north/south to east/west. During this remodel, the tack room was converted to stalls, increasing the original five stalls to thirteen. Modeled after Stable #1, Stable #2 was constructed in 1857 but finished with exposed stone. The stable had pyramidal roofs topped with wooden cupolas. The interior of Stable #2 was divided into one open stall and several box stalls. Historically, both Stable #1 and Stable #2 housed horses on the first floor, and the second floor was used for hay storage.</p>",

Additionally after the battle, Major Armistead ordered other powder magazines to be built to spread out the fort's powder supply and prevent the possibility of a disaster occuring. Today visitors can enter the powder magazine to see a repleca of how the inside would have looked while the fort was active.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The powder magazine is a square brick structure with a domed roof. There is only one door to enter the magazine and the interior room looks a lot smaller than the building due to the thickness of the walls to protect the powder that would have been stored there.",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Selasphorus sasin sedentarius</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Allen's hummingbird, <em>Selasphorus sasin sedentariusis,</em> an endemic subspecies found on all of the islands in Channel Islands National Park, with the exception of Santa Barbara Island. It is also a permanent resident on Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. In the 1960's, sedentarius likely dispersing from Santa Catalina Island, colonized the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Los Angeles County. Since that initial colonization, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> has spread over much of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Before receiving its present name, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> was called <em>non-migratory Allen's hummingbird</em>.</li> <li>The endemic species found on the Channel Islands, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em>, differs from the mainland species <em>S.s. sasin</em>, by having a longer wing, tail and bill.</li> <li>During the breeding season, males defend territories in mixed shrubs and woods located in coastal canyons. Allen's hummingbirds have even been seen chasing red-tailed hawks and American kestrels from their territories.</li> <li>In the 1960's <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> was discovered nesting on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, which initially was perplexing.Through investigation, it was theorized that the ornamental non-native plants such as the eucalyptus and bottlebrush have played a role in this increased range.</li> <li>Recently, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> has spread its range across the L.A. Basin, and beyond. They have also moved into Orange County to the south, and even into thevalleys neighboring the coastal plain.</li> <li>The recent colonization of <em>S.s.sedentarius</em> on San Miguel Island in the mid-20th century may be a recolonization of habitat that was once destroyed by grazing.</li> <li>Contrary to published accounts, Allen's Hummingbirds do not sound like the similar appearing Rufous hummingbirds. <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> is very different vocally as well as mechanically with the \"wing whistle\" and \"tail pops\".</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Allen's hummingbird is a small bird, with mature adults reaching only 3 to 3½ inches in length, although the subspecies on the Channel Islands, <em>S.s. sendentarius</em>, is slightly larger, and also has a longer wing, tail and bill. The male Allen's has a green back and forehead, with rust-colored rufous flanks, rump, and tail. The male's throat is also an iridescent orange-red. The female and immature Allen's hummingbirds are similarly colored, but lack the iridescent throat patch, instead having a series of speckles on their throat. Females are mostly green, featuring rufous colors only on the tail, which also has white tips. The immature Allen's hummingbirds are so similar to the female rufous hummingbird that the two are almost indistinguishable in the field.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Allen's hummingbird <em>S.s. sasin</em>, the nominate species, is migratory, and winters along the Pacific coast of central Mexico. The second race, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em>, is a permanent resident on the Channel Islands off southern California. In the 1960s, this population colonized the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Los Angeles County and has since spread over much of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> inhabits chaparral and riparian woodlands below 1000 feet in elevation. Interestingly, due to its expansion to the mainland, it now inhabits a mixed urban habitat. The more widely distributed subspecies, <em>S.s. sasin</em>, inhabits mixed evergreen, riparian woodlands, eucalyptus and cypress groves, oak woodlands, and coastal scrub areas in breeding season. The broad array of landscape horticulture found in residential gardens, in particular the fuchsia plantars; provide a substantial year-round food source of desirable nectar.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Like all hummingbirds, the Allen's hummingbird's high rate of metabolism requires it to feed frequently, about every hour. The Allen's hummingbird drinks nectar from flowers, as well as eating any small insects it finds crawling around the flower blossom, which provide it with needed protein.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The courtship flight of the male Allen's hummingbird is a frantic back and forth flight arc of about 25 feet similar to the motion of a swinging pendulum, followed by a high-speed dive from about 100 feet. The male is also highly aggressive and territorial. Hot-tempered despite its diminutive stature, a male Allen's hummingbird will chase any other males from its territory, as well as any other hummingbird species, and they have even been known to attack and rout predatory birds several times larger than themselves, such as kestrels and hawks.</p> <p>Males maintain territories that overlook open coastal scrub or riparian shrubs where they perch in conspicuous places. Females choose nest sites in areas where there is more tree cover. They locate the nest in shrubs and trees with dense vegetation such as vines and thickets anywhere from 2 feet to 45 feet off the ground.</p> <p>The Allen's hummingbird constructs its nest out of plant fibers, down, and weed stems, coating the nest with lichens to give it structure. The nest is placed above ground on a tree branch or the stalk or stem of a plant. On average the female lays two dull white eggs, which are incubated for 12-22 days. <em>S.s. sasin</em> usually lays two clutches per season; however, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> will lay more. The young will leave the nest about three weeks after hatching. The mother will continue to feed the fledglings for several more weeks, then the young are left to fend for themselves.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Although this species may have a restricted range, it is not believed to be vulnerable. The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for vulnerable under the population size criterion. Recent surveys within the park indicate that there is an increasing trend with yearly fluctuation. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen's_Hummingbird</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Allen\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Allen's_Hummingbird/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon2.org/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=6\">http://www.audubon2.org/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=6</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/allen-s-hummingbird\">http://www.answers.com/topic/allen-s-hummingbird</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/pelagics/ALLENSHUMMER.html\">http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/pelagics/ALLENSHUMMER.html</a></li> <li>The Hummingbird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting, Identifying, and Enjoying Hummingbirds By Donald Stokes, Donald W.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Oceanodroma homochroa</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel relies upon the isolated breeding grounds of the Channel Islands National Park to ensure its successful reproduction. Due to its sensitivity to outside influences that impact its numbers, the park has proved to be a major component in its vitality. The park's success in removing non-native species such as the black rat that have preyed upon nesting birds has been a factor in the increase in many of the susceptible seabird populations.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ashy storm-petrel breeds on 17 islands in the northeast Pacific, principally off California, but also northwestern Baja California, Mexico.</li> <li>They have a restricted range and a small global population of approximately 10,000 birds.</li> <li>Fifty percent of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels breed on San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Anacapa islands.</li> <li>They mate in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nest at the same burrow.</li> <li>Ashy Storm-Petrels nest in rock crevices along cliffs, offshore rocks, and under driftwood in sea caves.</li> <li>Ashy storm-petrels have a long breeding cycle, laying just one egg in May and fledging in October.</li> <li>Ashy storm-petrels depart from and return to the nest at night to avoid predators.</li> <li>Petrels \"patter\" on the ocean's surface to gather prey items including squid, fish and krill.</li> <li>Ashy storm-petrels can live to 34 years old.</li> <li>The ashy storm-petrel is listed as species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel, as the name implies, is an entirely gray seabird with a forked tail, roughly the size of a purple martin. This small seabird weighs 1.3 ounces and is eight inches in length, with a wingspan of 18 inches. It is smaller and grayer than the similar black and Leach's storm-petrels, but larger than the least storm-petrel-the other dark species found in the area.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel can only be found on the islands off California and in the adjacent waters. This species' limited year-round range extends from Cape Mendocino, California, to northern Baja, just south of the US- Mexico border. Breeding colonies occur on offshore islands in the area, including the Southeast Farallon islands, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, San Clemente and Mexico's Coronados islands. On most of the larger islands listed above, breeding occurs on outlying rock formations, free of mammalian predators.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Ashy storm-petrels feed near their nesting islands in the offshore waters of the California Current, one of the richest regions of the world ocean. The birds breed on rocky islands among talus slopes, from just above sea level to the highest, interior portions of nesting islands. Smaller islands and offshore rocks where resources are not sufficient normally to sustain predatory mammals, such as rats and foxes, are preferred for nesting.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> It is a gregarious bird at sea, feeding nocturnally on squid, loligo opalescens, fish (particularly lanternfishes myctophids, which rise to the sea's surface at night) and krill, which also swarm at the surface. They are also attracted to fishing vessels for the fish oils released when the nets are pulled. During the breeding season, foraging coincides spatially and seasonally with the spawning aggregations of sardines and anchovies.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Ashy storm-petrels nest in rock burrows on offshore islands, returning to the nests at night. The species has a long breeding cycle, laying eggs in May and fledging in October, although timing varies greatly, more so than in most other storm-petrels: some pairs may have a chick that is half grown when other pairs are still laying. Like in many other seabirds, pairs show both mate and site fidelity. They mate in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nest at the same burrow. This is intriguing since the pairs spend their lives out of the breeding season separate from each other, and despite the fact that many individuals might seem to compete for burrows at the nesting colonies. A change in mate is usually associated with a change in nesting site.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Like other storm-petrels, ashy storm-petrels arrive and depart their breeding colonies only at night. Outside of the breeding season it is believed to be more widely distributed, foraging on the California Current, but undertakes no large migration and doesn't range as far as other species of storm-petrel.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel is listed as species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game. The limited range of this species makes it susceptible to local disasters such as an oil spill. The species is particularly susceptible to loss of coastal upwellings that have been unpredictable along the California coast in recent years and are anticipated to decline further in the face of global warming. Increased populations of western gulls, predators of ashy storm-petrels, at a number of breeding sites are cause for concern. Ashy storm-petrel breeding colonies are also susceptible to introduced mammalian predators including mice, rats, and cats. Ashy storm-petrels are sensitive to disturbance, especially during the incubation period. Most ashy storm-petrel breeding colonies fall within protected areas in California, which includes Channel Islands National Park. The park's success in removing non-native species such as the black rat that have preyed upon nesting birds has been a factor in the increase in many of the susceptible seabird populations such as the ashy storm-petrel.

Since citizenship was a job requirement, most saw weaving nets as a chance to prove their loyalty—and earn some money. A friendly camaraderie grew among the crews—who often worked to big band music blaring from loudspeakers—as they turned out an average of 6,000 nets a month.<br /> <br /> The three 18’ tall sheds built on long concrete slabs soon became a flash point for discontent over wages and friction between citizens and non-citizens that spread throughout camps. The work proved hazardous, too, with those incarcerated enduring long hours of breathing find lint and contact with harsh dyes.<br /> <br /> The net factory closed after the Manzanar Riot in December 1942 and the sheds were converted to other purposes. The mattress factory produced 4,020 mattresses for the camp before fire destroyed it in 1943.",

On the upper corners of this wayside exhibit frame are tactile sequoia cones made of brass. The cones are about the size of an egg, with a small twig attached to each. The cones have been flattened on the bottom to help secure them to the frames. Many wayside exhibits in the Giant Forest have similar brass cones. The text reads, A Graceful Grouping Known as The Three Graces, these three sequoia trees are all the same age. How did they come to stand in such an orderly row? At some time in the past, a large tree probably fell here. In falling, it may have torn an opening in the forest canopy, letting sunlight hit the ground. Eventually one of the frequent natural fires here burned it up. Sequoia seeds sprout in huge numbers after fire. They grow particularly well where it burns hot enough to leave nothing but ash and bare soil. They survive even better where sunlight also reaches them. A row of ash left by the burned trunk of a tree that opened the forest as it fell would be the perfect spot. A black and white photo shows three giant sequoias, touched by shafts of sunlight that also illuminate the dirt road beside them. The caption reads, Other sequoia threesomes have been called the \"Three Graces\" in the past. This lovely trio was named when the Moro Rock Road beside it was still a simple path. Two photos of other in line Sequoias. A photo of four sequoias in a line with two dirt roads, each of which runs in between the trees on the left side of the grouping. The caption reads, If you drive south from here, you will pass The Four Guardsmen, another example of same aged sequoias growing in a line. The second photo shows a line of giant sequoia trunks in groupings of three and four with a single trunk to the right. The caption reads, Sequoias in a group like this are fairly common. Look for them as you explore the park's sequoia groves.",

As a term of the treaty, Great Britain received most of the formally French territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. France also ceded West Louisiana to its ally Spain in compensation for western Florida, which Spain yielded to Great Britain. Britain, in turn, created West Florida. In 1764, this spot was the northern boundary of West Florida, marked by a line from the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers’ confluence east to the Chattahoochee River. <br /> <br /> The West Florida Boundary Trailhead is the southern terminus of the Yockanookany Section of the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail.

Built into a hill and low to the ground, with a roof that extends over the edge of the building to maintain cooler temperatures inside, it was designed to store milk and process butter. At the bottom of the stairs of the Dairy is a grotto built over a natural spring. Water from this spring runs inside the building and into a basin. Milk stored in tall stoneware jars sat in the basin to be cooled. Although a cool place during hot months, working the crank of a barrel churn was a monotonous task. Milking dozens of cows in the huge cattle barn once located past the Long House took workers most of the day.<br /> <br /> Ms. Croner describes her father's tasks as a dairyman in the early 20th century:<br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>\"He took care of the cows...milked the cows and got milk ready in the morning to take out to this lady, Miss Pink German. He'd get up at four in the morning. He had to get the cows milked.\"</em></p> <p>While it was common during the days of tenant farming for the Dairy to be run by a dairyman, through over a century of slavery, enslaved women and paid female employees held the role of dairymaid, where their labor provided additional income for the Ridgelys. In 1822, for instance, the Hampton dairy produced 4,296 lbs of butter commercially sold, netting a profit of close to $1,800. The dairymaid in this period was Milly Sheridan, who worked as a paid employee at Hampton after being granted her freedom in Governor Ridgely's will in 1829.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The bald eagle is one of the largest birds of prey found in North America. It is the national bird and symbol of the United States of America. This sea eagle has two known sub-species and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. Bald eagles typically can be found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. In Channel Islands National Park, due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The scientific name means \"a white-headed sea eagle\" and comes from the Greek words <em>halos</em>, meaning sea; <em>aetos</em> meaning an eagle; <em>leukos</em> meaning white; and <em>kephalus</em> referring to the head. Bald is from the Middle English word <em>balled</em>, meaning shining white.</li> <li>Rather than do their own fishing, bald eagles often go after other creatures' catches. A bald eagle will harass a hunting osprey until the smaller raptor drops its prey in midair, where the eagle swoops it up.</li> <li>Had Benjamin Franklin prevailed, America's emblem might have been the wild turkey not the bald eagle.</li> <li>The largest bald eagle nest on record, in St. Petersburg, Florida, was 10 feet in diameter and 20 feet tall. Another famous nest—in Vermilion,Ohio—was shaped like a wine glass and weighed over 2 tons. It was used for 34 years until the tree blew down.</li> <li>Immature bald eagles spend the first four years of their lives in nomadic exploration of vast territories and can fly hundreds of miles per day. Some young birds from California have reached Alaska.</li> <li>Bald eagles can live a long time, with a longevity record of 28 years in the wild and 36 years in captivity.</li> <li>Bald eagles occasionally hunt cooperatively, with one individual flushing prey towards another.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but reversed sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many raptors, is evident in the species in that females are 25 percent larger than males. The beak, feet, and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. It presently occupies historical habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England. Northern eagles are migratory,while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year.</p> <p>Historical records indicate that in the early 20th century bald eagles bred on all islands within the park, with at least two dozen nesting pairs over the 8 Channel Islands. Breeding bald eagles provided important ecosystem functions in the northern Channel Islands. For example, bald eagles were once the top marine aerial predator and probably fed upon a variety of seabirds and fish. Bald eagles are generally highly territorial, and in the past this behavior may have prevented golden eagles from colonizing the islands. Due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands. Bald eagles have also been reintroduced on Santa Catalina Island</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The bald eagle explores sea coasts and other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish as well as rivers,large lakes, and mountainous open country. The bald eagle prefers old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Selected trees must have good visibility, an open structure, and proximity to prey, but the height or species of tree is not as being in close proximity to water. The bald eagle is extremely sensitive to human activity, and is found most commonly in areas free of human disturbance.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The bald eagle's diet is opportunistic and varied, but most feed mainly on fish. When fish sources are unavailable, eagles may rely largely on carrion, especially in winter, and they will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales, though it seems that carcasses of hoofed animals and large fish are preferred. They also may sometimes feed on subsistence scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps. Mammalian prey includes rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, and deer fawns. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, egrets, and geese. Most live prey are quite a bit smaller than the eagle, but predatory attacks on large birds such as the great blue heron and even swans have been recorded. Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans (especially crabs) are preyed on when available.</p> <p>Fishing is a learned behavior for the bald eagle, and so juvenile eagles spend their first year eating carrion (carcasses) until they become proficient at fishing (Dooley et al. 2005). Prey remains from bald eagle nests on Santa Catalina Island contained almost 90% fish (Newsome etal. 2010), but an historic bald eagle nest on San Miguel contained more bird remains than fish (Collins et al. 2005). The abundance of seabirds and pinnipeds on the northern Channel Islands means eagles likely take advantage of those resources more than in other areas. This could pose a problem for recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands (see below), because pinnipeds and seabirds contain more DDE than do marine fish, due to bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Bald eagles nest in trees except in regions where only cliff face sor ground sites are available. They tend to use tall, sturdy conifers that protrude above the forest canopy, providing easy flight access and good visibility. In southern parts of their range, bald eagles may nest in deciduous trees, mangroves, and cactus. It's unknown whether the male or the female takes the lead in selecting a nest site. Nests are typically built near the trunk, high up in the tree but below the crown.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, where large trees are scarce, bald eagles have built nests on cliff faces, rock shelves and shallow cliffs, as well as in island pines and Torrey pines. One pair even attempted nesting in a grassland on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>Bald eagles build some of the largest of all bird nests—typically5 to 6 feet in diameter and 2 to 4 feet tall and ranging in shape from cylindrical to conical to flat, depending on the supporting tree. Both sexes bring materials to the nest, but the female does most of the placement. They weave together sticks and fill in the cracks with softer material such as grass, moss, or cornstalks. The inside of the nest is lined first with lichen or other fine woody material, then with downy feathers and sometimes sprigs of greenery. Ground nests are built of whatever's available, such as kelp and driftwood near coastal shorelines. Nests can take up to three months to build, and may be reused (and added to) year after year. The female lays one to three eggs with a usual clutch size of two eggs. The eggs are incubated for approximately 35 days, and the young eagles fledge 10 - 12 weeks after hatching. Bald eagles become sexually mature at five to six years with maturity usually corresponding to when their head and tail feathers become white.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The bald eagle's recovery is a spectacular conservation success story. Once abundant in North America, the species became rare in the mid-to-late 1900s—the victim of trapping, shooting, and poisoning as well as pesticide-caused reproductive failures. In 1978 the bird was listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Since 1980, gentler treatment by humans along with the banning of DDT (the bird's main pesticide threat) has led to a dramatic resurgence. By the late 1990s, breeding populations of bald eagles could be found throughout most of North America.</p> <p>In 2002, with funding from the <a href=\"http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/southwest/montrose/index.html\">Montrose Trustees Restoration Program</a>, the park (in conjunction with partner, <a href=\"http://www.iws.org/\">Institute for Wildlife Studies</a>) began to introduce juvenile bald eagles to the northern Channel Islands. This was done using a technique called \"hacking\". Birds of approximately 8 weeks of age were kept in one of two hack towers on Santa Cruz Island until they were ready to fly (at approximately 3 months of age). Sixty-one young bald eagles were introduced to the northern Channel Island between 2002 and 2006.</p> <p>Today, bald eagles are again an important part of the island ecosystem. 2006 marked the first successful bald eagle nest on the Channel Islands in over 50 years, and since that time, the recovering bald eagle population on the islands has grown. As of 2013 there were five breeding pairs on Santa Cruz Island, two on Santa Rosa, and one on Anacapa, and a total of over 40 bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p>Recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands was seen as critical to recovery of the endangered island fox, since nesting bald eagles might dissuade dispersing golden eagles (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>) from establishing breeding territories on the islands (Coonan et al. 2010). Golden eagle predation was responsible for the massive decline of island foxes on the northern Channel Islands in the 1990s.</p> <p>In June 2007, the bird's recovery prompted its removal from the Endangered Species list. Continuing threats to bald eagle populations include lead poisoning from ammunition in hunter-shot prey, collisions with motor vehicles and stationary structures, and development-related destruction of shoreline nesting, perching, roosting and foraging habitats.</p> <p>Based upon information of population trends, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has listed the bald eagle a species of Least Concern and current data demonstrates that the population is presently increasing.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species/baleag\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bald_Eagle/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005688/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.peregrinefund.org/subsites/explore-raptors-2001/eagles/baldeagl.html\">The Peregrine Fund</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.J., C.A.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Thryomanes bewickii nesophilus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Bewick's wren is an endemic subspecies found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Anacapa Islands. It is a small, noisy, hyperactive little bird with bold white eyebrows, flicking its tail as it hops from branch to branch.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>This species is named after British engraver Thomas Bewick-a friend of pioneering bird artist John James Audubon, who collected the first recognized specimen.<br />  </li> <li>Courting Bewick's wrens normally form monogamous pairs. While they're setting up house and even after the female has begun incubating eggs, the male and female often forage together. This may help the male prevent his partner from mating with another bird.<br />  </li> <li>At the sound of approaching humans, a female Bewick's wren incubating eggs usually flushes quietly from her nest cavity, but remains nearby and scolds. Some females, however, sit tightly on their eggs even when disturbed.<br />  </li> <li>The male Bewick's wren learns its song while still on the parents' territory.It learns the song not from its father, but rather from the neighboring territorial males. The song repertoire developed before the first winter is retained for life.<br />  </li> <li>The Bewick's wren can live up to 8 years.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This Bewick's wren is grayish-brown above with an obvious whitish eyebrow which extends back down the neck. The subspecies in the park is overall somewhat darker. It has a long, fanned tail, although the park's subspecies tail is smaller. Its tail is often cocked upward, which it flips and jerks from side to side as well as rises slowly up and down. The top and bottom of the tail is barred with black and you might be able to see the white spots on the outer tail feathers when the tail is fanned. This wren has whitish underparts and an unstreaked back. The bill is long and slightly downcurved. The legs and feet are gray. Both adults look similar. The juvenile is like the adult but has dark edges to its feathers.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Bewick's wrens are resident along the West Coast, throughout the southwestern U.S., and in parts of the eastern U.S. They leave some eastern breeding areas in the winter. The population is stable, except in the eastern U.S., where it is declining. The endemic subspecies, <em>Thryomanes bewickii nesophilus,</em> is found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Anacapa Islands, while a different subspecies, <em>T. b. catalinae</em>, occurs on Santa Catalina Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Bewick's wrens favor dry brushy areas, chaparral, scrub, thickets in open country, and open woodlands near rivers and streams. They are at home in gardens, residential areas, and parks in cities and suburbs. On the Channel Islands, based on recent surveys, nesophilus favors chaparral, pine forest, riparian, and/or woodland habitats.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Bewick's wrens eat the eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of insects and other small invertebrates. Common prey include bugs, beetles, bees and wasps, caterpillars, butterflies, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, flies, and spiders. Bewick's wrens also occasionally eat seeds, fruit, and other plant matter, especially in winter. Bewick's wren nestlings receive mostly caterpillars, spiders, grasshoppers, and insect pupae. Adults sometimes consume pebbles and mud, perhaps for nutrients or to help with the grinding digestion of their food. The subspecies found in the park rarely feeds on seeds and generally gleans invertebrate prey from the lower branches of small trees and shrubs and from the stems of large herbaceous plants.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Bewick's wren's cup-shaped nest has a base of sticks, grasses, rootlets, leaves, moss, or other plant materials, depending on what the local environment provides. Many contain spider egg cases. The open cup may be lined with feathers, wool, hair, or plant down. The male initiates nest building; both sexes participate. The construction process usually takes less than 8 days, though sometimes it can stall for long periods and require weeks to complete. The nest is about 2.5 to 3 inches high and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, the cup about 1-2 inches deep and 2-2.5 inches in diameter.</p> <p>The nesting period of the Bewick's wren begins with a clutch of 3 to 8 eggs laid in its cup shaped nest. From 1 to 3 broods may be laid in one season, but two would be the norm. The size of the egg would approximate two-thirds in length and about one half an inch in width. The eggs would be described as white with reddish -brown or purplish spots. The incubation period for bewickii would be from 14 to 16 days. The weight of the new hatchlings would be about 1/20th of an ounce and find its eyes tightly closed; its skin pink, with sparse down. After hatching, both parents bring foof to the nest. Generally, at two weeks the young leave the nest.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Bewick's wren is identified as a species of Least Concern by the ICUN Red List because the species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdinginformation.com/birds/wrens/bewicks-wren/\">http://www.birdinginformation.com/birds/wrens/bewicks-wren/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bewicks_wren/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bewicks_wren/id</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.oiseaux-birds.com/home-page.html\">http://www.oiseaux-birds.com/home-page.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106006938/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106006938/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Bewicks-Wren/description.html\">http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Bewicks-Wren/description.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-troglodytidae-bewicks-wren-thryomanes-bewickii\">http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-troglodytidae-bewicks-wren-thryomanes-bewickii</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

San Miguel Island, the westernmost island in Channel Islands National Park, is home to the most important breeding colony of this species in Southern California.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Brandt's comorants breed along the Pacific Coast from Alaska to Mexico.</li> <li>Their main breeding range is between California and Washington.</li> <li>Brandt's cormornats nest in colonies on the ground including cliffs, islands, and offshore rocks.</li> <li>The male cormorant selects the nest site and brings the nesting materials to the female so she can build the nest.</li> <li>Brandt's cormorants are great divers and they can dive as deep as 40 feet in their pursuit of prey.</li> <li>Their webbed feet propel them underwater so they can swim and feed on fish close to the bottom.</li> <li>During the breeding season, they have an expandable pouch on their throat that turns blue.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants weigh about 4.6 pounds and measure 34 inches in length, with a wingspan of about 4 feet. Sexes look similar; with short black legs, a long black body and neck, and a dark bill with a hooked tip. Breeding adults have brilliant turquoise eyes and a bright blue gular pouch-distinctive among this species of cormorant-which fades quickly after the nesting season. Their breeding plumage also includes white plumes on either side of the head, neck, and back. Like other cormorants, Brandt's cormorants often spread their wings out to dry after a dive, as their feathers are not completely waterproof and become soaked. This helps reduce buoyancy and allows the cormorant to forage deep under water.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants breed along the Pacific Coast from Alaskasouthern British Columbia southward to Baja California. All five islands in the Channel Islands National Park provide breeding sites. In the main part of their range, from California to Washington, the cormorants rely upon food sources produced by the upwelling of the California Current. In the non-breeding season, the effects of this current diminish, and Brandt's cormorant populations redistribute along the coast from southern Alaska southward to Baja California, wintering wherever food is locally available.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants are exclusively marine, inhabiting inshore Pacific coastal waters, especially kelp bed areas; as well as large bays, estuaries, or coastal lagoons. Their preferred breeding location is on gentle slopes on the windward side of islands. They may forage either near shore or well out to sea.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Brandt's cormorant diet consists predominantly of a wide variety of fish, including herring and rockfish, as well as shrimp, and crabs. This cormorant, sometimes feeding in groups, can dive deeply from the surface (capable of reaching over 100 meters) and pursues fish underwater, propelled by its powerful webbed feet. The bird snatches prey with its bill, rather than spearing it.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants breed on all of the islands of Channel Islands National Park, although San Miguel Island is the most important. The latest survey shows 4200 pairs in the entire park. This species is colonial, nesting with other Brandt's cormorant, and in California, with the common murre. Male cormorants choose the nest site and display there, inflating the blue throat pouch while pointing the head and tail skyward. The males are also responsible for nest building. They make a substantial nest on the ground, consisting of dry matter like weeds, grass, sticks, or marine debris all cemented together with droppings.Seaweed is collected by diving and is also used as nesting material. The female cormorant usually lays 3 to 6 pale blue eggs. Cormorant hatchlings are naked and helpless. Both parents care for the chicks, feeding by regurgitation, brooding chicks when cold, and shading them when hot. Chicks often congregate in groups called crèches once parents stop attending nests continously, but they return to their own nests to be fed.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants are primarily permanent residents, with some local movement. For example, Farallon Island birds migrate to the adjacent mainland. They may wander along the Mexican coast in winter, south of their breeding range, but never inland.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorant colonies vary from year to year, both in size and location. In California, Channel Islands National Park, as well as refuges and ecological reserves, serve as protected areas. Persistant challenges to Brandt's cormorant include pesticides and oil pollution. During the incubation period, Brandt's cormorant are vulnerable to disturbance from fishing, diving, boating, and even visitation for research or educational purposes, which can result in near-total egg loss and colony desertion. El Nino's ocean warming effect has also negatively impacted populations. Research suggests that, given good ocean conditions and public access restrictions, Brandt's cormorants can persist even in high-disturbance areas. The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds required for listing as a vulnerable species. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern in BirdLife International (2011) IUCN Red List for birds.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"> <li sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"110\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"111\"><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species\">Birds of North America</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Ptychoramphus aleuticus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet is a small, chunky seabird that ranges widely in the North Pacific. It is noteworthy for its extraordinary diving ability and skill at catching prey underwater. The Channel Islands National Park is a major breeding and feeding grounds for this species. The park provides the isolation required for its nesting sites providing the environment required to maintain its population.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Cassin's auklets breed along the Pacific coast, from midways up the Baja California peninsula to Alaska's Aleutian Islands. On the Channel Islands, the Cassin's auklet currently nests on Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, San Miguel, and Anacapa Islands.</li> <li>During the non-breeding seasons, Cassin's auklets will spend most of their time at sea.</li> <li>Cassin's auklets nest in rock crevices and build burrows.</li> <li>They will also nest in artificial burrows allowing biologists to easily monitor a colony.</li> <li>Both parents incubate a single egg.</li> <li>Cassin's auklets are excellent divers; their wings allow them to \"fly\" underwater.</li> <li>During the nesting season, food is stored in a specialized throat pouch and brought back to the nesting site. They return to their nest only at night.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet is a small (10 in., 7 oz.) nondescript auk. Its plumage is generally dark above and pale below, with a small white mark above the eye. Its bill is overall dark with a pale spot, and its feet are blue. Unlike many other auks, the Cassin's auklet lacks dramatic breeding plumage, remaining the same over most of the year. At sea it is usually identified by its flight, which is described as looking like a flying tennis ball.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet ranges from midway up the Baja California peninsula to Alaska's Aleutian Islands off North America. It nests on offshore islands, with the main population stronghold at Triangle Island off Vancouver Island's Cape Scott, where the population is estimated to be around 550,000 pairs.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> San Miguel Island and its islets, particularly Prince Island and Castle Rock, provide the most important nesting sites for the Cassin's auklet in the Southern California bight. It also breeds colonially on the other islands of the Channel Islands National Park, except Santa Rosa Island. The Cassin's auklet usually nest in dense colonies in rock crevices and in burrows they dig in rocky compacted soil or they may excavate burrows for nesting in soft soils under vegetation, stumps, or fallen logs on seaward slopes of coastal sites.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet feeds offshore, often relying on upwellings of cooler nutrient rich waters and associating with bathymetric landmarks such the continental shelf and underwater canyons. This species unique ability to dive by beating its wings for propulsion allows it to hunt down large zooplankton, especially krill. It can dive to 30 meters below the surface, and by some estimates 80 meters.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet may be found in the breeding colony year round. Auklet pairs show a strong loyalty towards each other, nesting on the same site for many years. Parents take turns incubating a single white egg, with the at-sea parent returning after dusk to swap shifts in order to avoid predators such as the western gull or peregrine falcon. The egg is incubated for 40 days. The small chick is then fed nightly for 35 days by both parents, who regurgitate partially digested food (krill and other small crustaceans) carried in a special gular pouch, often referred to as a sublingual pouch. The chick fledges alone and makes its way to the sea. The Cassin's auklet is unusual amongst seabirds because it will occasionally lay a second clutch after a successful first clutch.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> This seabird is not recognized as the migratory bird, however the northern birds may move southward during the winter season toward ice-free areas. Populations on the west coast are generallypermanent residents.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet is listed as Least Concern. Although some populations (principally the Farallon Islands population) have suffered steep declines since the early 1970's, the species is still numerous overall. Threats to the auklet include introduced carnivores (particularly in Alaska), oil spills, and changes in sea surface temperature (caused by El Niño events). The Cassin's auklet is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.On Santa Barbara Island, efforts are underway to restore seabird nesting habitat for Cassin's auklets by removing non-native plants and planting native vegetation to improve seabird habitat. Nest boxes insulated against the elements have also been installed with the goal of providing a secure nesting area and vocalization playback systems have been used to attract auklets. Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks, located off of Santa Cruz Island, are also important nesting islets for Cassin's aucklets. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing non-native vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and signs informing the public that the rocks are closed to protect nesting seabirds.

The island loggerhead shrike is a robin-sized bird that hunts like a small hawk, preying on insects and small animals, including small birds. Populations on all three islands are greatly diminished from historical populations. A close relative, the endemic San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike (<em>Lanius ludovicianus</em>), is found only on San Clemente Island and is federally listed as endangered.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The name \"loggerhead\" means of possessing a head that is disproportionately larger than the rest of the body.</li> <li>Another name for the shrike is \"butcher bird\", owing to its tendency to impale their prey on thorns. The reason appears to be due to their lack of talons that would accommodate holding their prey while consuming it.</li> <li><em>Lanius</em>, the scientific name for the shrike, is derived from the Latin word meaning \"butcher\". Historically, the Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands population of island loggerhead shrikes was variously reported as \"extremely common\" to \"comparatively common\" and \"fairly common.\"</li> <li>Recent surveys indicate that the island loggerhead shrike occurs in very small population sizes.</li> <li>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list the subspecies under the Endangered Species Act, the objective of a 2009-2010 project was to obtain a rigorous and defensible estimate of northern island loggerhead shrike abundance on both islands.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island loggerhead shrike is a robin-sized bird. It is the darkest of all forms of this species. It is similar in coloration to the mainland loggerhead shrike, but the gray of upper parts is still darker (nearly slate color) especially on the top of the head, and more uniform, the shoulder feathers, almost wholly deep gray; white spot at the base of primary wing feathers much smaller; under parts of body much more strongly tinged with gray, becoming distinctly gray on sides and flanks; lateral tail feathers with much less of white, this extending slightly less than an inch for the tip on inner web of exterior tail feathers.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Although loggerhead shrikes are widely distributed throughout the continental United States, the island loggerhead shrike is an endemic, genetically distinct subspecies of loggerhead shrike found on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Santa Catalina Islands.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Like other shrikes, island loggerhead shrikes require rather open areas for hunting, with sufficient vertebrate and invertebrate prey, but also adequate perches, and enough shrub cover nearby for nesting. They prefer grasslands, open coastal sage scrub habitats on terraces, and brushy canyon slopes (Collins 2008).</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Island loggerhead shrikes are efficient search-type predators; their diet apparently is related more to prey abundance, detectability, and size than to specific prey type. Although the diet of the island loggerhead shrike has not been studied, it is likely similar to that of the San Clemente loggerhead shrike an endemic subspecies of shrike that occurs only on San Clemente Island in the southernChannel Islands (Collins 2008). That shrike feeds on a wide variety of prey, including various aerial and ground-dwelling arthropods (crickets,grasshoppers, beetles, earwigs, lepidopteran larvae, flies, truebugs, ants, bees, and wasps), small ver­tebrates (lizards, birds, and mice), molluscs (land snails), isopods (pill-bugs), arachnids (spiders and scorpions), chilopods (centipedes), thysanurans (silverfish), and diplopods (millipedes). For foraging, shrikes require open and semi-open habitats with scattered taller vegetation. Shrikes generally search for prey from a variety of perches from 3 to 45 feet above the ground.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Protection of nests against predation is important. On the islands, shrike nests are susceptible to predation by island foxes, and, on Santa Cruz Island, by the islandscrub-jay. Therefore, nests typically are placed in a variety of arborescent shrubs, includ­ing lemonade berry, California sagebrush, Catalina cherry, toyon, blue elderberry, and various oaks. Pairs generally raise a single brood and will renest following nest failure. Island loggerhead shrikes have an extended breeding season, which enables pairs to raise two broods in some years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Although loggerhead shrikes are widely distributed and abundant, the northern island subspecies is classified as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game and has been petitioned for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act.</p> <p>Recent exhaustive surveys on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands provided the first reliable estimates of island loggerhead shrikes (Stanley et al. 2012). Estimated population size in 2010 was 240 on Santa Rosa and only 42 on Santa Cruz, and historical shrike populations may have been much higher (Collins 2008). Higher shrike numbers on Santa Rosa may reflect higher habitat quality on that island. There may be more habitat with short vegetation, which shrikes prefer, on Santa Rosa Island. Shrikes also require adequate perches from which to hunt, and suitably thick shrubs in which tonest. Changes in vegetation due to removal of non-native ungulates will have as-yet undetermined effects on shrike habitat.</p> <p>Very little is known about the ecology of the island loggerhead shrike. Basic information is lacking concerning breeding biology, habitat relations and the importance of predation. Because of this, the reasons for its apparent decline and the difference in population size between Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands remain unclear.</p> <p>The island shrike's cousin, the San Clemente Island shrike, was listed as Endangered in 1977 and at one point was considered the most endangered animal in North America. In 1998 there were only 12 adults remaining in the wild. The population has since increased due to captive breeding and reintroduction, coupled with innovative predator control: predatory island foxes were fitted with shock-collars to prevent them from depredating shrike nests (Cooper et al. 2005).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/birds/loggerhead-shrike\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDEQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.nature.nps.gov%2Fim%2Funits%2Fmedn%2Fassets%2Fdocs%2Fresourcebriefs%2FLOSHSummaryFINAL_2012.pdf&ei=PIFyUrTLIsS5iwLUhYDIDg&usg=AFQjCNEIMxCOhHhoyX-yReW-CqsCVVenrw&bvm=bv.55819444,d.cGE\">Northern Channel Islands Loggerhead Shrike Study</a></li> <li>Collins, P.W. 2008.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Oreothlypis celata sordida</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This endemic subspecies of orange-crowned warbler is a small, comparatively drab warbler of shrubs and low vegetation that is found on all of the Channel Islands. It is different than other orange-crowned warbler subspecies owing to its shorter tail, longer broader bill, and darker plumage.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>The orange-crowned warbler is divided into four subspecies that differ in plumage color, size, and molt patterns. The Channel Islands subspecies is the darkest green and is found only on the Channel Islands and locally along the coast of southern California and northern Baja California.</li> <li>Observant birders discover this cryptic warbler breeding in oak woodlands and giant coreopsis thickets across the islands, sometimes in astonishingly high densities.</li> <li>Typically, the orange-crowned Warbler is a ground nester, but the Channel Islands subspecies has adapted to select higher nesting sites in oak trees, giant coreopsis and lemonade bushes.</li> <li>Orange-crowned warblers are known for belting out a high-pitched trill, but males on the Channel Islands have a much more variable, melodic song than is typical of the species.</li> <li>Owing to the Channel Islands subspecies lack of a need to migrate long distances after breeding through unfamiliar terrain, (30 miles to the mainland) it has a have a much higher probability of surviving from one breeding season to the next than highly migratory populations.</li> <li>Only 45% of Alaska warblers lived one year, contrasted to 75% that lived to one year on Catalina Island.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Generally, the orange-crowned warbler is a small warbler with olive-green upper parts and faintly streaked, yellow under parts. Head has inconspicuous orange crown, broken eye-ring, and faint eye-line. Sexes are similar. What best distinguishes the Channel Islands sub-species is given by the original describer of the subspecies, C. H. Townsend (1890): \"Adult male: Entire plumage decidedly darker than <em>H. celata lutescens</em>. Feet and bill larger; wings slightly shorter. There is an appearance of grayness about the upper plumage, owing to a leaden tinge on ends of feathers. Throat and under parts slightly streaked.\"</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Research focused on orange-crowned warblers shows that the species as a whole is widely distributed, but the Channel Islands subspecies, is largely relegated to the Channel Islands because of intensive development on the nearby mainland. These warblers are one of many island endemics that have made the Channel Islands famous for their unique flora and fauna.</p> <p>Two of the largest islands – Catalina and Santa Cruz – are where long-term study sites have been established to follow the breeding activities of but the Channel Islands subspecies. The islands are in close proximity and are alike with respect to topography, habitat, and many other features. However, they differ in two key aspects: their predator community and the amount of rainfall they receive It is not known exactly where individuals that breed on the Channel Islands go after their February-June breeding season, but most leave the islands to spend their \"winters\" (July-January) on the coast of southern California and northern Baja.</p> <strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Gilbert et al. (2010) report that orange-crowned warblers on the Channel Islands prefer humid and shaded sites on slopes, in canyons gullies and sea-cliffs in chaparral, Torrey pine, coastal bluff and coastal sage scrub vegetation types.On Santa Rosa Island, orange-crowned warblers preferred coastal sage scrub, grassland and chaparral and avoided closed-cone pine and oak woodland.<br /> <br /> <strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Most warblers, including but the Channel Islands subspecies, exhibit migratory tendencies, taking advantage of the spring flush of insects in temperate zones, gleaning insects off leaves. Their diet includes insects and spiders, but it also includes seeds and fruit. Orange-crowned warblers rely on insects like caterpillars to feed their young. Astudy by the Catalina Conservancy, shows that but the Channel Islands subspecies consumes lesser quantities of fruit and nectar.<br />   <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Like many members of its genus, orange-crowned warblers are ground nesters with cup style nests. However, but the Channel Islands subspecies frequently nest off the ground ad well, mostly in oak trees, lemonade berry bushes, and giant coreopsis plants. The islands where off-ground nesting occurs are generally free from visually-oriented nest predators like jays, and these nests tend to have higher success than ones on the ground, which are more susceptible to snake and mammal predation.</p> <p>Average clutch sizes around 3 to 6 are typical. The orange-crowned warblers incubate their eggs for approximately 12 days. Once the eggs hatch, both the male and the female provide parental care to the offspring. They provision food in the nest for 11 days (nestling stage) and out of the nest for upwards of 2 months (fledgling stage) while the young grow and develop the necessary skills to fly and find food on their own. If at some point a predator finds the nest and eats the eggs/nestlings, the pair will usually start over again and build a brand new nest, hoping for better luck the next time.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The orange-crowned warbler, <em>Vermivora celata</em>, are a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Redlist. This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for \"Vulnerable\" under the range size criterion The population trend appears to be increasing, and the population size is extremely large, For these reasons the species is evaluated as \"Least Concern.\"</p> <strong>Additional Information</strong><br />   <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/orange-crowned_warbler/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/153/_/Orange-crowned_Warbler.aspx\">What Bird</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://learning.colostate.edu/courses/ecology/lhe/index.html\">Colorado State University Study</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106009088/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/featured_birds/default.cfm?id=302\">The Smithsonian National Zoological Park</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Empidonax difficilis insulicola</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> A small yellowish flycatcher of shaded forests and streamsides, the Pacific-slope flycatcher is found throughout the Pacific Coast states, west of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. The population of Pacific slope flycatcher breeding on the Channel Islands off southern California may actually be best treated as a distinct subspecies. It is larger than mainland populations, has a longer bill, a paler chest, slightly different vocalizations, and differs genetically.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The New World family of flycatchers, <em>Tyrannidae</em>, includes the Pacific-slope flycatcher is p, and 365 other species distributed over the Americas from the Canadian tree limit to Patagonia.<br />  </li> <li>The name <em>tyrannidae</em>, meaning tyrant, reflects the species pugnacity toward crows, hawks, and other large birds which they harass with great determination.<br />  </li> <li>The scientific name <em>difficilis</em>, which in the Latin is appropriate as it means \"difficult \". This species is extremely difficult to distinguish from the similar Cordilleran flycatcher.<br />  </li> <li>These two above species were formerly considered a single species known as the western flycatcher.<br />  </li> <li>Flycatchers characteristically feed by darting after insects from an advantageous perch.<br />  </li> <li>A group of flycatchers has many collective nouns, including an \"outfield\", \"swatting\", \"zapper\", and \"zipper\" of flycatchers.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Pacific-slope flycatchers on the Channel Islands are larger than individuals of mainland population. The species in the park also has a longer bill, a paler chest, slightly different vocalizations, and differs genetically.1 The Pacific slope flycatcher, Empidonax difficilis, found on the mainland has olive-brown upper parts, yellow throat and belly; and an olive-gray breast. Eye-ring is white and elongated. Its wings are dark with two pale bars. Bill is long with dark upper mandible and bright yellow lower mandible. Sexes are similar.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The island subspecies is considered a summer resident on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. Nests have been on the north facing slopes of West Anacapa. Middle and East Anacapa do not have the trees for their preferred nesting habitat. (Collins personal communication 2010) Pacific-slope flycatchers are spring and fall transients on the other two park islands (Jones, Collins, and Stefani 1999). While there are occasionally spring and fall transients of other Empidonax Flycatchers, the most common of these flycatchers is the Pacific-slope flycatcher. Transient sightings of other species of Empidonax Flycatchers are more common on Santa Barbara Island than on the northern park islands (Jones, Collins and Stefani 1999). These flycatchers migrate for the winter, probably to Mexico. Since the different Empidonax Flycatchers look so similar in the field, exact information about this subspecies's winter location is not available.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Pacific-slope Flycatcher inhabits either coniferous or deciduous forests. In its range it enters mixed woods, douglas fir forests, redwood forests, and many other wooded environments including Riparian woodlands. A recent study found Pacific-slope flycatchers on Santa Rosa to prefer pine, chaparral, woodland and riparian habitats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Like most flycatchers, Pacific-slope flycatchers are insect eaters and they can be seen watching from a perch, at any level within shady parts of the forest, and then flying out to catch insects in the air. Individuals also capture some prey (such as caterpillars and spiders) from foliage or twigs while hovering.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Nesting habitat in more open and drier habitats on Channel Islands for the distinct island flycatcher occurs among eucalyptus shade trees or in oak clumps in canyon bottoms, foraging over coastal scrub and opuntia cactus (Johnson 1980). Nests are placed on cliffs, earth banks, tree branch crotches, or building ledges, or in tree cavities, often along streams or near seeps or springs.</p> <p>Pacific-slope flycatchers breed once annually from mid-April through mid-July. On the average four eggs are laid per season with hatching occuring from 13 to 16 days. The female alone incubates the eggs but both sexes bring food to the fledgling young and remove fecal sacs. Typically, chicks will fledge within 14 to 16 days.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> While long term population trends have not been quantified, Pacific-slope flycatchers are a species of Least Concern according to the IUCN Redlist. They are not listed under the U.S. Endangered Species act or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. They are listed and protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Pacific-slope flycatchers on Santa Rosa were found to exist at high densities over a 15-year period, with some annual variation in abundance. 8 Breeding Bird Survey data show no significant declines of this species between 1966 and 1996.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/171/overview/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher.aspx\">http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/171/overview/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher.aspx</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/ssp/pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis-insulicola\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/ssp/pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis-insulicola</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/flycatcher.aspx\">http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/flycatcher.aspx</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-tyrannidae-pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis\">http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-tyrannidae-pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/917414/details\">http://eol.org/pages/917414/details</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Melospiza melodia graminea</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong>This small bird, although somewhat difficult to identify due to its inconspicuous marking, is familiar to most birders: the song sparrow is one of the most widespread sparrow species in North America. Though its bland plumage has a wide range of variations, its exquisite voice is easily recognized. The Channel Islands endemic subspecies, <em>M. m. graminea</em>, is found on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa Islands. It was a former resident of Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The song sparrow is found throughout most of North America, but the birds of different areas can look surprisingly different. Song sparrows of the Desert Southwest are pale, while those in the Pacific Northwest are dark and heavily streaked. Song sparrows of Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain are even darker, and they're huge: one-third longer than the eastern birds, and weighing twice as much.</li> <li>Some scientists think that song sparrows of wet, coastal areas have darker plumage as a defense against feather mites and other decay agents that thrive in humid climates.The darker plumage contains more of a pigment called melanin, which makes feathers tougher and harder to degrade than lighter, unpigmented feathers.</li> <li>The song sparrow lives up to its name, being one of the most persistent singers throughout the spring and summer.</li> <li>Other birds such as mockingbirds are not able to effectively imitate their song.</li> <li>They recognize enemies by both instinctual and learned patterns, and adjust future behavior based on both its own experiences in encounters, and from watching other birds interact with enemies.</li> <li>A group of song sparrows are collectively known as a \"flock\", \"choir\", and \"chorus\" of sparrows.</li> <li>The oldest known song sparrow lived to be 11 years, 4 months old.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The song sparrow is medium sized sparrow that has heavily streaked gray-brown upperparts. Its underparts are a dull white that includes a dark central breast spot with thick streaks. Its head has brown crown, paler median stripe, pale gray eyebrow, white chin and a dark brown moustache stripe. It has rust-brown wings and a tail that is long and usually tinged rust-brown. The Channel Islands song sparrow has longer feet, a longer tail and wings, and is also grayer.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Channel Islands song sparrow is limited to San Miguel and Santa Rosa Island. It is also a transient visitor in the spring and fall to Anacapa Island. It was a former resident of Santa Barbara Island where it was driven to extinction by predation (cats) and habitat destruction brought about by introduced rabbits.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The song sparrow is distributed widely in North America and occur in many different habitat types, most often inhabiting shrubs on moist ground near freshwater, saltwater or coastline. On San Miguel the song sparrow has been found to be most abundant in areas with dense shrubs, and unlike on the mainland, were found in areas well-removed from water, perhaps due to the availability of considerable fog-moisture on San Miguel. Song sparrow use of Santa Rosa habitats was also not tied to water availability. Song sparrows utilized riparian areas but did not prefer them. They strongly selected for coastal sage scrub and grassland, while avoiding chaparral, woodland and pine habitat types.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The song sparrowforages on the ground, in shrubs or in very shallow water. Anecdotal observations from San Miguel Island suggest that its diet is similar to that of song sparrows on the mainland. The year-round diet of song sparrows in California is composed of 21% insects and 79% plant. Insects, such as beetles, caterpillars, bees, ants and wasps, true bugs, and flies. These are an important component of the diet in the spring, when animal prey make up 71% of overall diet versus 3% in September The song sparrow also eats crustaceans and mollusks on the coast.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves deep, which they line with fine grasses or leave unlined. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed by the pro­tective canopy from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub because of the winds. 6The female lays two to six red brown marked, pale green eggs are laid in a cup nest 2 to 4 feet above the ground. Incubation ranges from 12 to 14 days and is carried out by the female who raises up to three broods per season. Both parents are involved in feeding the nestlings that remain in the nest from 9 to 12 days.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Channel Islands song sparrow is listed by the State of California as a Species of Special Concern. In addition, the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service lists it under the heading of Birds of Conservation Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/song_sparrow/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Sparrow\">Wikipedia</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19000\">Comrack, Lyann A. and Randi J.

They sometimes work in pairs to raid seabird colonies, with one bird distracting an incubating adult and the other waiting to grab an egg or chick as soon as it's uncovered.<br />  </li> <li>Native people of the Pacific Northwest regard the raven as an incurable trickster, bringing fire to people by stealing it from the sun, and stealing salmon only to drop them in rivers all over the world.<br />  </li> <li>Breeding pairs of common ravens hold territories and try to exclude all other ravens throughout the year.<br />  </li> <li>Young ravens finding a carcass will call other ravens to the prize. They apparently do this to overwhelm the local territory owners by force of numbers to gain access to the food.<br />  </li> <li>The oldest known wild common raven lived to be 17 years 2 months old.</li> </ul> <br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Common ravens are entirely black, right down to the legs, eyes, and beak. The raven is not just large but massive, with a thick neck, shaggy throat feathers, and a Bowie knife of a beak. In flight, ravens have long, wedge-shaped tails. They're more slender than crows, with longer, narrower wings, and longer, thinner “fingers” at the wingtips.<br />   <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> This species of common raven, aka northern raven, is found year-round on the Channel Islands, however, it is highly adaptive and found in far North America, as well as in the Arctic Circle. It also inhabits very high elevations in very cold climes.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The park’s ecological monitoring program detected increases in raven populations on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands in the past two decades. 4 Both increases may be due to the ability of ravens to capitalize on novel food resources. The increase on Santa Rosa may be tied to the availability of deer and elk carcasses, when those non-native ungulates were hunted as part of a commercial hunt operation. Ravens on San Miguel began taking advantage of pinniped carcasses made available in the early 1990s due to mortality by hookworms, and that may have fueled their increase on that island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Common ravens occur over most of the Northern Hemisphere in nearly any habitat (eastern forests and the open Great Plains are exceptions). These include coniferous and deciduous forests, beaches, islands, chaparral, sagebrush, mountains, desert, grasslands, agricultural fields, tundra, and ice floes. They do well around human habitations including farms, rural settlements and isolated houses. In larger towns they are often replaced by American crows, although they do occur in some cities including Los Angeles. Human presence has allowed ravens to expand into areas where they didn’t previously occur, such as using artificial ponds and irrigation to survive in deserts and living on human garbage in some forests. Common ravens are slowly moving back into the forests of the northeastern United States and Canada as those forests regenerate.The raven is also a permanent resident of all of the Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Common ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity.<sup> </sup>Common ravens will eat almost anything they can get hold of. They eat carrion; small animals from the size of mice and baby tortoises up to adult rock pigeons and nestling great blue herons; eggs; grasshoppers, beetles, scorpions, and other arthropods; fish; wolf and sled-dog dung; grains, buds, and berries; pet food; and many types of human food including unattended picnic items and garbage.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Common ravens build their nests on cliffs, in trees, and on structures such as power-line towers, telephone poles, billboards, and bridges. Cliff nests are usually under a rock overhang. Tree nests tend to be in a crotch high in the tree, but below the canopy and typically farther down in a tree than a crow’s nest would be.</p> <p> </p> <p>Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.</p> <p>Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles</p> <p> </p> <p>In most of their range, egg laying begins in late February. Females lay between three to seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion. The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion. The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/commonravens.html\">http://www.avianweb.com/commonravens.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17657\">https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17657</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/id</a></li> <li>Coonan, t.J., R.C.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The golden eagle is one of the largest, fastest, and nimblest raptors in North America. Lustrous gold feathers gleam on the back of its head and neck;a powerful beak and talons advertise its hunting prowess. Although they had never bred historically on the Channel Islands, golden eagles were able to colonize the northern Channel Islands in the mid 1990s due to the presence of an alien prey base (feral pigs and mule deer fawns) and the absence of the native bald eagle, extirpated from the islands by chemical contaminants and by direct persecution. Golden eagles also preyed on the vulnerable island fox, nearly driving foxes to extinction. Subsequent conservation efforts successfully relocated golden eagles to the mainland, and restored bald eagles to the Channel Islands, helping to bring back the island fox from the brink of extinction.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The golden eagle is the most common official national animal in the world, being the emblem of Albania, Germany, Austria, Mexico, and Kazakhstan.</li> <li>Golden eagles are important to many Native American cultures, which include the bird and its feathers in ceremonies.</li> <li>Golden eagles are not typically found in the densely populated eastern portion of the United States, but are found instead in the rugged solitude of the sparsely populated western U.S.</li> <li>Although capable of killing large prey such as cranes, wild ungulates, and domestic livestock, the golden eagle subsists primarily on rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, and prairie dogs.</li> <li>Golden eagles possess astonishing speed and maneuverability for their size. Diving from great heights, they have been clocked at close to 200 miles per hour.</li> <li>Nests are huge, averaging some 5-6 feet wide, and 2 feet high, enclosing a bowl about 3 feet by 2 feet deep. The largest golden eagle nest on record was 20 feet tall, 8.5 feet wide.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The golden eagle is a large, dark brown raptor with broad wings. Its size is variable: it ranges 28-33 inches in length, has a wingspan of 6-7 feet , and weighs 7 to 13 pounds.Sexes are similar in plumage but display the typical reversed sexual dimorphism of raptors, in which the female is much larger than the male.Adults are primarily brown, with gold on the back of the crown and nape, and some grey on the wings and tail. Tarsal feathers range from white to dark brown. In addition, some birds have white epaulettes on the upper part of shoulder feathers on each wing.The bill is dark at the tip, fading to a lighter horn color, with the waxy top of the beak, called a cere, colored yellow.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Golden eagles can be found throughout much of the northern hemisphere, typically in sparsely populated areas</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The golden eagle seeks open areas with large, rocky cliffs or large trees, such as pines, cypress or sycamores. They are often found in alpine parkland, open forests and mid-elevation clear-cuts, as well as in chaparral or plains areas.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The golden eagle's predominant prey in North America are medium-sized mammals such as rabbits and ground squirrels. Other species, such as foxes, martens, young deer are also taken. Ranchers have historically battled the eagle because of its ability to prey upon small livestock such as lambs and small goats. In Channel Islands National Park, predation by the golden eagle on the endemic island fox brought the latter close to extinction, with golden eagle breeding on the islands supported by feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island and deer on Santa Rosa Island Other important prey include birds; indeed,virtually any bird, from jays to swans, are potential prey. Golden eagles also r steal prey from other raptors. While not as large as some vultures, golden eagles are capable of driving vultures and other raptors from carrion. Golden eagles are avian apex predators, meaning they make their living at the top of the food chain (nothing preys on a golden eagle).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Golden eagles usually mate for life. They build several eyries within their territory and use them alternately for several years. These nests consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. Old eyries may be quite large as the eagles repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. The female usually lays two eggs between January and September, depending on the locality. The eggs vary from all white to white with cinnamon or brown spots and blotches. They start incubation immediately after the first egg is laid, and after 40 to 45 days the young hatch. They are covered in fluffy white down and are fed for fifty days before they are able to make their first flight attempts and eat on their own. In most cases only the older chick survives, while the younger one dies without leaving the eyrie. This is due to the older chick having a few days' advantage in growth and consequently winning most squabbles for food. This strategy, called asynchronous nesting, is useful because it makes the parents' workload manageable even when food is scarce, while providing a reserve chick in case the first-born dies soon after hatching. Golden eagles invest much time and effort in bringing up their young; once able to hunt on their own, most golden eagles survive many years, but mortality even among first-born nestlings is much higher, in particular in the first weeks after hatching.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Some golden eagles live in their nesting territory all year. Others may migrate due to lack of food during the winter. As a rule, they do not have to migrate large distances because of their excellent hunting abilities.</p> <p><strong>Golden Eagle Status in the Park</strong><br /> From 1999 through 2006, golden eagles were live-trapped and removed from the park, because golden eagle predation was the primary source of mortality for island foxes and was responsible for the massive island fox decline from 1994–2000.</p> <p align=\"start\">Until the 1990s, golden eagles never bred on the Channel Islands. Golden eagles nested on both Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands from the mid-1990s to as recently as 2006. They were able to colonize the islands because of several factors. First, bald eagles were absent from the Channel Islands, having disappeared by the mid-20th century due to both human persecution and the presence of DDT in the environment. Territorial bald eagles may have deterred goldens from establishing. Second, golden eagles arriving on the islands found food sources that were not available prior to the ranching era: feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island, and mule deer on Santa Rosa.</p> <p align=\"start\">In order to mitigate golden eagle predation on island foxes, The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, with the support of the Park Service and The Nature Conservancy, relocated golden eagles to distant sites on the California mainland. A total of 44 golden eagles, including 10 eaglets born on the islands, were trapped and relocated, and monitoring indicates that none have returned.</p> <p align=\"start\">Other ecosystem-wide actions, such as the removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island and the restoration of bald eagles, have tipped the balance in favor of island foxes and away from continued golden eagle use of the islands. As of 2009 the occasional golden eagle visits the islands, but the level of predation on island foxes is negligible;all three island fox subspecies in the park are recovering rapidly.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> In North America the situation is not as dramatic as it has been in in temperate Europe, North Asia, North Africa, and Japan, but there has still been a noticeable population decline. The main threat is habitat destruction which by the late 19th century already had driven golden eagles from some regions they used to inhabit.In the 20th century, organochloride and heavy metal poisonings were also commonplace, but these have declined thanks to tighter regulations on pollution. Within the United States, the golden eagle is legally protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Available habitat and food are the main limiting factor nowadays. Collisions with power lines have become an increasingly significant cause of mortality since the early 20th century. On a global scale, the golden eagle is considered by the IUCN as of least concern,thanks mainly to the large Asian and American populations.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species\">http://birds.audubon.org/species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">http://www.birdlife.org/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Golden_Eagle/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Golden_Eagle/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106003537/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106003537/0</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The endemic subspecies of house finch, <em>m. frontalis</em>, is found only on Santa Barbara Island and the other southern Channel Islands. The northern islands all have the same subspecies as the coastal mainland does, so they are not endemic. The distinguishing characteristic of this sub species is a heavier bill and some evidence of vocalization differences. The degree of red color in house finches is somewhat dependent on diet. House finches on the southern islands can frequently be found nesting on the cactus. This bird is primarily a ground feeder and particularly favors seeds from composites.<br /> <br /> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The house finch was originally a bird of the western United States and Mexico. In 1940 a small number of finches were turned loose on Long Island, New York, after failed attempts to sell them as cage birds (\"Hollywood finches\"). They quickly started breeding and spread across almost all of the eastern United States and southern Canada within the next 50 years.</li> <li>The total house finch population across North America is staggering. Scientists estimate between 267 million and 1.4 billion individuals.</li> <li>House finches feed their nestlings exclusively plant foods, a fairly rare occurrence in the bird world. Many birds that are vegetarians as adults still find animal foods to keep their fast-growing young supplied with protein.</li> <li>The oldest known house finch lived to be 11 years, 7 months old.</li> <li>The red of a male house finch comes from pigments contained in its food during molt (birds can't make bright red or yellow colors directly). So the more pigment in the food, the redder the male. This is why people sometimes see orange or yellowish male house finch.</li> <li>Females prefer to mate with the reddest male they can find, perhaps increasing the probability of obtaining a capable mate who can do his part in feeding the nestlings.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The adult male of the species typically has a bright red breast, rump, forehead, and supercilium;center of crown, nape, and back are brown and dark wing has two white wing bars and pale edges to flight feathers. Belly and rest of underparts are mostly white, with clear demarcation from red breast, and bold streaks on flanks. Some birds have an orange tone to breast. Contrastingly, the adult female has gray-brown plumage, streaked above and below, with two pale wing bars and pale edges to flight feathers. Juveniles will show the same appearance as the adult female. The distinguishing characteristics of the subspecies found in Santa Barbara Island is a heavier bill and some evidence of vocalization differences.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> House finches are very adaptable and can be found in a wide range of habitats, from arid deserts to open woodlands and shrubby fields. They are common in both urban and suburban areas as well, extending from the southern edge of Canada through central and southern Mexico. Populations are less dense in the central Great Plains states and the southeastern United States. The endemic subspecies of house finch, <em>m. frontalis</em>, is found only on Santa Barbara Island and the other southern Channel Islands. The northern islands all have the same subspecies as the coastal mainland does, so they are not endemic. These birds generally do not migrate, but they can become nomadic in search of food. In the park, house finches declined on San Miguel from 1993 to 2003, for unknown reasons, and have increased in recent years.<br /> <br /> <strong>Habitat</strong><br /> House finches are native to open and desert habitats, but have expanded their range, naturally and through introductions, and now can be found in almost any kind of human-altered habitat. They prefer edge habitat and are absent from dense coniferous forests.<br /> <br /> <strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The vast majority of the house finch's diet is vegetable matter--seeds, buds, berries, and nectar. They feed their young regurgitated seeds. They eat a few small insects, especially aphids, but are primarily seed- and fruit-eaters at all times of the year.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> House finches are monogamous, and pairs tend to form while the birds are in their winter flocks. Some pairs may stay together year round. They choose a wide variety of nesting sites, and will nest in man-made objects such as window ledges and holes in buildings. Ivy growing on buildings or trees creates many nesting sites. Nests may also be located in conifer trees, hanging planters, and old nests of other birds. The first requirement is a solid base with some overhanging material. The female builds most of the nest, which is an open cup of grass, weeds, twigs, leaves, and rootlets, lined with feathers and other fine material. The female incubates 4 to 5 eggs for 13 to 14 days while the male brings her food. The female broods the young for the first few days after they hatch, and the male continues to bring food. The female then joins the male in bringing food to the young. The young leave the nest after 12 to 15 days and may be fed by the male for about two more weeks, while the female starts a second clutch. Pairs may raise three or more broods each season.<br /> <br /> <strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The house finch has an extremely large range and appears to be increasing, and so does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under any of the criteria of the IUCN Red List. It is instead identified as a species of Least Concern.<br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/house_finch/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/house_finch/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0050\">http://enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0050</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/bird/house_finch\">http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/bird/house_finch</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://birding.about.com/od/birdprofiles/p/housefinch.htm\">http://birding.about.com/od/birdprofiles/p/housefinch.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106008856/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106008856/0</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.J., R.C.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phalacrocorax auritus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The double-crested cormorant is the most numerous and widespread North American cormorant, although this bird is listed as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game. Owing to the isolation of Channel Islands National Park, this bird is provided with the protected breeding area of Santa Barbara Island, and especially Prince Island off the northeast coast and Castle Rock off the northwest coast of San Miguel Island. Anacapa Island also has established breeding colonies.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Double-crested cormorants are the most numerous and widely distributed species of the six North American cormorants.</li> <li>Their range extends from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska down to Mexico.</li> <li>Like other cormorants, their feathers are not waterproof and they need to dry their wings after spending time in the water.</li> <li>During the breeding season, the skin on their throat turns bright orange.</li> <li>Double-crested cormorants nest in a variety of places: on the ground, cliff edges, trees, shrubs, and in artificial structures.</li> <li>Double-crested cormorants make a bulky nest of sticks and other material. They frequently picks up junk, such as rope, deflated balloons, fishnet, and plastic debris to incorporate into the nest. Parts of dead birds are commonly used too.</li> <li>Females on average lay four eggs. Large pebbles are occasionally found in cormorant nests, and the cormorants treat them as eggs.</li> <li>Incubating adults hold the eggs on their feet.</li> <li>Double-crested cormorant nests often are exposed to direct sun. Adults shade the chicks and also bring them water, pouring it from their mouths into those of the chicks.</li> <li>They are gregarious birds usually found in colonies. In breeding colonies where the nests are placed on the ground, young cormorants leave their nests and congregate into groups with other youngsters (creches). They return to their own nests to be fed.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Double-crested cormorants weigh from 3.3 to 6.6 pounds and measure 33 inches in length, with a wingspan of about four feet. Sexes look similar, with short, dark legs, a long black body and neck; a lighter colored bill with a hooked tip, bare orange skin around the face and chin. Breeding adults have brilliant turquoise eyes and mouth lining. A small curled plume on either side of the crown may be seen during the breeding season. The long neck is kinked in flight. Because their feathers are not waterproof, double-crested cormorants often spread their soaked wings out to dry after a dive. This incomplete waterproofing helps reduce buoyancy, a valuable attribute for a diving seabird.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Growing in numbers throughout its range, the double-crested cormorant is widely distributed across North America. It breeds locally along all coasts and extensively in Florida, the center of continent, and along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway, as well as in Mexico, Belize, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Most cormorants winter along the Pacific Coast from Alaska to Mexico, along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from North Carolina to Belize, and inland on ice-free areas along large rivers and lakes.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The double-crested cormorant is very adaptable. They may be found in diverse aquatic habitats, ranging from rocky northern coasts to mangrove swamps, lagoons, estuaries, rivers, small inland ponds, and large reservoirs. The double-crested cormorant is a species that is even more widespread in winter. The largest number of colonies in southern California of double-crested cormorants is found on islands of Channel Islands National Park with nesting occurring on Santa Barbara, Anacapa, and San Miguel islands, with an occasional colony on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The diet of the double-crested cormorant consists predominantly of a wide variety of fish. The cormorant dives from the surface and chases fish underwater, propelled by its powerful webbed feet. The bird then grabs the fish with its bill, rather than spearing it; upon surfacing, it flips the fish into the air, then catches and swallows it head-first.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> They first breed at 3 years of age in nesting colonies, sometimes with other wading birds. The birds make a bulky nest of sticks and other bulky items, including seaweed and flotsam, often lined with grass in a tree near water, on a cliff ledge, or on a beach. They frequently pick up debris, including rope, deflated balloons, and fish nets, to incorporate into the nest. The cormorants usually lay 3 to 4 pale blue eggs. Cormorant hatchlings are naked and helpless. Both parents care for the chicks. Double-crested cormorant adults shade the chicks and bring them water, pouring it into the chicks' mouths from their own. In ground-nesting colonies, young cormorants leave their nests and congregate with other youngsters, called crèches, returning to their own nests only to be fed. The young birds begin to fly at about 5 weeks, and become independent at about 9 weeks of age.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Populations on the west coast generally are permanent residents, but double-crested cormorants elsewhere are migratory. They migrate by day in flocks, often forming \"V\"-shaped formations as they follow rivers or coastlines, headed from the coldest parts of their breeding range toward ice-free areas.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Although, the double-crested cormorant is a wide spread species and classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, in 2002 the California Department of Fish and Game listed the double-crested cormorant as a species of special concern. This variance occurred due to the fact that the bird is not listed under the federal Endangered Species Act or the California Endangered Species Act. Due to the fact that human threats and climatic conditions produced low historical populations, it made it prudent to take a conservative view to the species. In California, Channel Islands National Park, as well as refuges and ecological reserves, are protected areas for this bird.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"110\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"111\"><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species\">Birds of North America</a></li> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizset=\"112\"><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

Horned larks favor short grasses and bare ground habitat.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong><br />   <ul> <li>Larks return to their birthplace after every migration (a characteristic known as philopatry).<br />  </li> <li>Because of their philopatric behavior, local populations have adapted to the color of their habitat, resulting in 15 distinct subspecies in the West.<br />  </li> <li>The use of mowed areas around airstrips has allowed the horned lark to colonize regions where no other suitable habitat may exist nearby, such as heavily forested areas.<br />  </li> <li>Adult horned larks eat primarily weed and grass seeds, but they feed insects to their young.<br />  </li> <li>Many collective nouns have been used to describe a group of larks, including an \"ascension\", \"chattering\", \"exaltation\", \"happiness\", and \"springul\" of larks.</li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Unlike most other larks, this is a distinctive-looking species on the ground, mainly brown-grey above and pale below, with a striking black and yellow face pattern.The summer male has black \"horns\", which give this species its common name.Vocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinking, and weak.The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill. <p>The island subspecies, <em>insularis</em>, shows all of the characteristics typical of change in the island birds including darker color, a longer broader bill, longer tarsi, and longer toes. They also have shorter wings and tail. This subspecies has some streaking below.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Besides breeding the Channel Islands, the horned lark breeds in Alaska and Canadian Arctic, coastal Canada, and south throughout all of the U.S. except in the Southeast. Horned larks winter from southern Canada southward;also found in Eurasia.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Larks are common to abundant residents in a variety of open habitats, usually where trees and large shrubs are absent. It is found from grasslands along the coast and deserts near sea level to alpine dwarf-shrub habitat above tree line In winter, flocks in desert lowlands and other areas augmented by winter visitants, many migrating from outside the state.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Adult horned larks eat primarily weed and grass seeds, but they feed insects to their young.1 The horned lark searches for food by walking along the ground.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The horned lark breeds from March through July, with peak activity in May. The lark pair nests solitarily;with two to five gray or green eggs spotted brown, which are laid in a nest made of grass lined with feathers and soft materials and built in a shallow depression, natural or dug by the female. Incubation ranges from 11 to 12 days and is carried out mostly by the female. A pair frequently raises 2 broods in a season. Incubation is 10-14 days;altricial young tended by both parents. Young leave nest at 9-12 days, and can fly 3-5 days later.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The global population of this bird does not show signs of decline that would necessitate inclusion on the IUCN Red List. For this reason, the current evaluation status of the Horned Lark is Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/horned_lark/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/horned_lark/id</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Horned-Lark/bent_life_history.html\">http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Horned-Lark/bent_life_history.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/691/overview/Horned_Lark.aspx\">http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/691/overview/Horned_Lark.aspx</a></li> <li>California's Wildlife.

There are over 20 recognized subspecies, and the island birds belong to the subspecies <em>megalonyx</em>, which also occurs in coastal southern California. A separete subspeices (<em>P. m. clementae</em>) inhabits Sant aCatalina Island and formerly occured on San Clemente Island, but was extirpated there by the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>While feeding on the ground spotted towhees often use a two-footed, backwards-scratching hopping technique.. This \"double-scratching\" is used by a number of towhee and sparrow species to uncover the seeds and small invertebrates they feed on.<br />  </li> <li>During conflicts between two towhees, one bird pick up a piece of twig, bark, or leaf and carry it around. This seems to be an indication of submission.<br />  </li> <li>Early in the breeding season, male spotted towhees spend their mornings singing their hearts out, trying to attract a mate. Male towhees have been recorded spending 70 percent to 90 percent of their mornings singing. Almost as soon as they attract a mate, their attention shifts to other things, and they spend only about 5 percent of their time singing.<br />  </li> <li>When disturbed, a nesting female spotted towhee may run away like a mouse rather than fly.<br />  </li> <li>They occasionally sun themselves, lying down on the grass with feathers spread.<br />  </li> <li>They often bathe in dew or fog drip on vegetation.<br />  </li> <li>A group of towhees are collectively known as a \"tangle\" and a \"teapot\" of towhees.<br />  </li> <li>Spotted towhees live in drier habitats than eastern towhees. Some scientists have suggested that the bold white spots on spotted towhees' backs help them blend in to the sun-dappled undergrowth.<br />  </li> <li>The oldest recorded spotted towhee was 10 years 8 months old.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The spotted towhee is a large sparrow with white-spotted black back and black rump. Its breast is black, the belly white, and sides are rufous. The species has a black head with eyes that are red. Distinctively, its wings are black with white spots. It has a tail that is long and black with white corners. The female spotted towhee is duller, with brown instead of black and fewer white spots. Differences between the subspecies, <em>P. m. clementae</em> and <em>P. m. megalonyx</em>, the most locally common of the subspecies, is that clementae is in size slightly greater than megalonyx;its bill and feet appreciably larger. As well<em>, clementae's</em> coloration is grayer than in <em>megalonyx</em> with its black areas in the male duller and less intense.The rump and lower back of <em>clementae</em> is more or less mixed with grayish.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Spotted towhees are widely distributed in western North America, occurring from the southern tip of Mexico to southern Canada. The spotted towhee is the most common bird on Santa Rosa Island, according to park landbird studies.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Spotted towhees are birds of dry thickets, brushy tangles, forest edges, old fields, shrubby backyards, chaparral, coulees, and canyon bottoms, places with dense shrub cover and plenty of leaf litter for the towhees to scratch around in. Data from the park's landbird monitoring program indicates that spotted towhees on Santa Rosa Island favor scrub, grassland and chaparral habitat types.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Spotted towhees rummage in the leaf litter or creep through thick shrubs. Towhees tend to hop wherever they go, moving deliberately and giving themselves plenty of time to spot food items. They scratch at leaves with a characteristic two-footed backward hop, and then pounce on anything they've uncovered.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In the breeding season, spotted towhees eat mainly insects including ground beetles, weevils, ladybugs, darkling beetles, click beetles, wood-boring beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars, moths, bees, and wasps. Other leaf-litter arthropods such as millipedes, sowbugs, and spiders are taken as well. They also eat acorns, berries, and seeds including buckwheat, thistle, raspberry, blackberry, poison oak, sumac, nightshade, chickweed, and crops such as oats, wheat, corn, and cherries. In fall and winter, these plant foods make up the majority of their diet.</p> <p>Spotted towhee nests are usually built in depressions on the ground, or occasionally in vegetation 1 ½to 5 feet off of the ground, which are typically overhung with bushes, vines, or clumps of grass that provide shelter and protective screening. The female lays two to six white or gray eggs flecked with purple and red brown that she incubates from 12 to 14 days. Pairs will raise two and occasionally three broods in a single season and will renest following nest failure.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department of Fish and Game has listed the San Clemente spotted towhee, which occurs currently on Santa Catalina Island and formerly occurred on San Clemente Island, as a California Bird Species of Special Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>PDF of San Clemente Spotted Towhee account from:Shuford, W.

The archeological sites around the Channel Islands are a testament to the importance of the Chumash and other American Indians. Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> As you reach the overlook you mayl see tiny fragments of broken shell glittering in the soil. How did these shells get up here? Must be the ocean at work—or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify this as a \"midden,\" a debris pile containing remnants of those societies who came before-the Chumash and their ancestors. This midden is just one of an estimated 3,000 prehistoric sites on Santa Cruz Island, ranging from small temporary camps to larger villages and dating back at least 7,500 years. At the time of European contact (Cabrillo's voyage in 1542), at least 1,200 Chumash lived in 10 villages distributed around the island's coast, including the largest historic island village, Swaxil, located near the Scorpion ranch.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life.The Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the midden reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plant resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in swift tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The midden also reveals that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders was shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California. Chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of Olivella snail shells to produce these beads. Not only did the islands have an abundance of Olivella shells, but, even more importantly, eastern Santa Cruz Island also had considerable natural deposits of chert, a hard durable silica rock.<br /> <br /> Eastern Santa Cruz Island was the center for manufacturing chert microdrills, as this location had chert of the proper type and quality for such tools within coastal Chumash territory. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on Santa Cruz Island have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island was not, unfortunately, isolated enough to protect the Chumash from the diseases the Spanish brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Chumash population had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics. The last of the Chumash islanders would leave their traditional island home in 1822.<br /> <br /> Although much has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of the island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Chumash, give us a window into this ancient world and remind us on another level how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol, Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal . Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw .<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash, from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop. Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol. The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek, which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",

This deposit is filled with tiny fragments of broken shell, what archeologists call a midden or debris pile, left by the Chumash and their ancestors. This midden is one of 3,000 prehistoric sites on the island.",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Balaenoptera musculus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The blue whale, a baleen or filter feeder cetacean, as contrasted to toothed whales, is a part time resident of the waters off of the Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. It is the largest animal that has been proven to have ever existed on earth. With a feeding area for this species lying offshore of Southern California, a unique opportunity is afforded the public to observe these extraordinary marine mammals on whale watching boats serving the area.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Blue whales can grow to be about 100 feet in length and may weigh around 160 tons. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>A blue whale heart is the size of a Volkswagen Beetle and pumps 10 tons of blood through the massive blue whale body. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>A blue whale aorta (the main blood vessel) alone is large enough for a human to crawl through. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Blue whale blows, also called spouts, consist of air and water and rise about 30 feet high. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>It is estimated to take 2,200 lbs. of food to fill a blue whale's stomach. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Female blue whales are generally larger than males. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Blue whales live in all oceans of the world. <sup>4</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> According to <em>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World</em> by Jefferson, T.A., S. Leatherwood, and M.A. Webber, \"The blue whale is the largest animal ever known;however, its size substantially overlaps with that of adult fin and sei whales. Like all rorquals, the blue whale is slender and streamlined. The head is broad and U-shaped (like a gothic arch) when viewed from above and relatively flat when viewed from the side. Along the center of the rostrum, there is a single prominent ridge, which ends in an impressive \"splash guard\" around the blowholes. The flippers are long and pointed, and the dorsal fin is relatively small, variably shaped, and placed about three-quarters of the way back from the snout tip. The broad flukes have a relatively straight trailing edge and a prominent notch. Blue whales are bluish grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. The head is uniformly blue, but the back and sides are mottled. When viewed through the water surface they may appear dappled or uniformly light blue. There is light to extensive mottling on the sides, back, and belly, generally in the form of dark spots on a lighter surface, but sometimes the reverse. A chevron, with the vertex behind the blowholes, sometimes marks the transition of coloration between the head and the body. On the throat, there are 55 to 88 long pleats extending to or near the navel. The mouth contains 270 to 395 pairs of black, broad-based baleen plates, each less than 3 feet long. The blow is tall and slender, reaching 30 feet or more in height.\"<sup>2</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Based on acoustic data, size, and photo identification studies, there are two groups of blue whales in the North Pacific: eastern and western. The eastern group, (which is the west coast of the US and Canada), winters off Mexico and Central America, and feeds off California and British Columbia in summer/fall (from June to November). <sup>4</sup></p> <p>According to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, \"Blue whales can be seen off the west coast of Baja California from about February through July. Peak numbers have been reported there in April. They appear in the area again in October, but have not been reported between November and January. They are seen fairly frequently off Southern California from June through December. Encounters have been most numerous during July through October. Many of the blue whales appear to be migrating northward just outside the Channel Islands. Catches of blue whales from British Columbia shore stations peaked in June and September, suggesting a northward movement past Vancouver Island in spring and a southward shift in autumn.\" <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The habitat of the blue whale, as reported from a study by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, in 1998, shows the relationship of this species and its habitat to coincide with the movement of its food sources, as well as migration due to its imperative for breeding.The primary habitat that is based upon feeding, as stated in the study, was observed to be offshore of San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands in the Channel Islands and the adjacent continental shelf of the mainland. This is also where enormous swarms of krill and other food sources for this species are generally located. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>Additional habitat is centered upon the process of reproduction.This species migrates to southern climes, based upon observation, as far north as the Gulf of Cortez in Baja California and as far south as Central America where the initial nurturing of newly born calves provides optimal conditions.However, a specific location of the areas that the blue whale maternal activities occur is still unknown. <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> An article published in the <em>American Scientist,</em> Goldbogen (Scripps Institution of Oceanography), described the unique technique used by the blue whale in feeding called \"lunge feeding.\"This effective method, as stated in the study, described in detail how the adaptation of the whale's jaw permitted the maximum opening, which in turn allowed the blue whale to draw in and envelop the greatest concentration of food. After the prey is captured, the water is pushed out by the tongue, and animals such as krill are filtered by the baleen and remain as food for the whale.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>The primary food of the blue whale off the Channel Islands of California is krill, which are tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.Three species of krill comprise this important food in the blue whale's diet. They are the North Pacific krill (<em>euphausia pacifica)</em>, thysanoessa spinifera, and nematoscelis difficilis. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Information from the Marine Mammal Center states \"Females give birth to calves every two to three years. They remain pregnant for about one year before giving birth. When born, the blue whale calf is about 23 feet long and weighs 5,000 to 6,000 pounds. A nursing blue whale mother produces over 50 gallons of milk a day. The milk contains 35 to 50% milk fat and allows the calf to gain weight at a rate of up to 10 pounds an hour or over 250 pounds a day! At six months of age and an average length of over 52 feet, the calf is weaned. The blue whale reaches sexual maturity at around 10 years of age. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The blue whale, being found in all oceans of the world, has distinct populations with varied challenges.With the exception of the Northeastern Pacific population, which includes Alaska down to Central America, all blue whale populations are in a serious situation.Based upon census date, only the Northeast Pacific is increasing in population.The IUCN List of Endangered Species in its evaluation of the blue whales status writes, \"Although there are uncertainties over present abundance, the total population has been depleted by at least 70%, and possibly as much as 90%, over the last three generations, assuming a 31-year average generation time. The species therefore meets the criterion A1(abd) for Endangered, and probably meets the same criterion for Critically Endangered.\"<sup>8</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary: <a href=\"http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/bluwhal.html\">http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/bluwhal.html</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the <em>World</em>, Jefferson, T.A., S.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Tursiops Truncatus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Bottlenose dolphins are one of the most recognizable and well-known species of the cetacean family. Based upon historical references and their depiction in works of art going back to ancient civilizations, as well as today’s performers in entertainment venues in marine parks, such as Sea World, they are easily identifiable. Being primarily coastal inhabitants, the bottlenose is conspicuous to the public without the need to leave land to view them. In the Ventura area it is not unusual to spot forays by the bottlenose into Ventura Harbor, the site of the park’s administrative center. This species is also seen along the entire Southern California Bight by countless beach goers.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>There appear to be two main varieties; a smaller, inshore form and a larger, more robust form that lives mainly offshore. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>A social species, the bottlenose dolphin may live in groups of 100s of individuals. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>They employ a feeding strategy called \"fish whacking,\" where they strike a fish with their flukes and knock it clear out of the water. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Dolphins can rest one side of their brain at a time, allowing them to sleep whilst remaining conscious enough to surface and breathe. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Bottlenose dolphins are born with a few hairs on their \"rostrum\" or beak that they lose shortly after birth.<sup> 5</sup></li> <li>The bottlenose has more flexibility in its neck than other oceanic dolphin owing to the fact that 5 of its 7 neck vertebrate are not fused together. <sup>8</sup></li> <li>This species can live as long as 60 years. <sup>9</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, “The bottlenose dolphin is probably the most familiar of the small cetaceans because of its coastal habits, prevalence in captivity worldwide, and frequent appearance on television and in advertising. It is a large, relatively robust dolphin, with a short to moderate length stocky snout that is distinctly set off from the melon by a crease. The dorsal fin is tall and falcate, and set near the middle of the back. Color varies from light grey to nearly black on the back and sides, fading to white (sometimes with a pinkish hue) on the belly. The belly and lower sides are sometimes spotted. There is a dark stripe from eye to flipper, and a faint dorsal cape on the back (and sometimes an indistinct spinal sides are sometimes spotted. blaze), generally only visible at close range. Often, there are brushings of grey on the body, especially on the face, and from the apex of the melon to the blowhole. Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 26 pairs of robust teeth in each jaw. In older animals, many of these may be worn down or missing.<br /> <br /> Adults range from about 5.5 to 13 feet in length with males somewhat larger than females. There is incredible variation between different populations. Maximum weight is at least 1400 pounds, although most animals are much smaller. At birth, the bottlenose is about 3 to 4 feet in length.” <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Bottlenose dolphins are cosmopolitan in distribution, occurring in most coastal areas in temperate and tropical regions of the world.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> According to NOAA, Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, the bottlenose dolphin is found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. They are found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. There are coastal populations that migrate into bays, estuaries and river mouths as well as offshore populations that inhabit pelagic waters along the continental shelf. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> In a comprehensive study of the bottlenose dolphins feeding habits published by Stephen Leatherwood in 1975, it was concluded that the species was both an “opportunistic and catholic feeder”. Additionally he comments, “The observations for coasts of mainland Mexico, Baja California, and southern California similarly involve feeding on varied prey and under varied circumstances. The recurrence of patterns over time at widely divergent locations suggests their adaptive value for the species.”<br /> <br /> Feeding strategies in collecting food have shown cooperative efforts of pods in herding or driving fish into shallower water on shorelines, bays or inlets to facilitate easier acquisition of prey. In the Southern California Bight, species utilized as food cover a broad spectrum. Sardines, northern anchovies, squid, shrimp and larger schooling species such fall within the bottlenoses diet. <sup>10</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Based upon studies by Jefferson, et al., 2008; Reynolds, III and Wells, 2003; Reynolds, III, et al., 2000 as found in Animal Diversity Web, the age of the bottlenose dolphins at sexual maturity varies geographically. Typically Female dolphins typically reach sexual maturity between 5 and 10 years of age, while males reach sexual maturity between 8 and 13 years old. Sexual maturity is usually achieved years before reproduction; males that reach sexual maturity at age 10 don’t typically breed until they are at approximately 20 years old. Reproductive seasons vary from region to region. Typically, females ovulate at a particular time of year while males are active throughout the year (but with a peak of testosterone production when females ovulate). Gestation lasts about 12 months and each pregnancy produces one calf. Females nurse their young from nipples on each side of their genital slit until the calf is between 18 and 20 months. Bottlenose dolphins reproduce every 3 to 6 years, with females usually becoming pregnant soon after their calf is weaned. Calves can be born at any time of the year but with a peak in birthing during warmer months. Females can reproduce well into their late forties.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Based upon a 2008 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN), states that although there are many threats operating on local populations, the species is widespread and abundant, and none of these threats is believed to be resulting in a major global population decline. It therefore states that the species is of least concern. <sup>11</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>FAO Species Identification Guides: Marine Mammals of the World</li> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalscience.org/\">The Society for Marine Mammalogy</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/\">arkive.org</a></li> <li>NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources</li> <li>International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN),</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.mmc.gov/species/bottlenosedolphin.shtml\">Marine Mammals Commission</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.acsonline.org/\">American Cetacean Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalscience.org/\">Marine Mammal Science</a></li> <li>Marine Fisheries Review, Vol. 37, No.9, September 1975, Leatherwood</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22563/0\">The IUCN List of Threatened Species</a></li> </ol>",

However, the tree frog is probably the most abundant frog found in California as well as the western United States.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can find the extended family of treefrogs in your backyard, along the beach, in the Mojave Desert, in woodlands, in grasslands or pastures, and even at 11,000 feet on Mount Whitney.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs change color based on the air temperature and humidity.</li> <li>Baja California treefrog's color change is to reduce the likelihood that it will become a meal for a bullfrog, raccoon, heron, snake, or other predator.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs have special \"sticky pads\" on their feet that help them climb.</li> <li>Treefrog are the only frog in the West that makes the classic \"ribbet\" vocalization - the sound that Hollywood film producers have made familiar around the world.</li> <li>Frog music is heard most often in the spring, but treefrogs vocalize all year unless the temperature dips below freezing.</li> <li>Interestingly, the treefrogs coordinate their vocalizations, creating a frog chorus. One male acts as the \"chorus master\" and starts calling. Other males in the vicinity gradually join in as the chorus swells.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Male Baja California treefrogs are just under 2 inches long and generally green or dark gray, with a creamy underside. Females are gray or brown and a bit larger than the males. The color of both sexes can vary, but you can verify the Baja California treefrog identification by looking for a dark brown or black band that runs from the eyes to the shoulders and white underside.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Even though the Baja California treefrog exist on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Catalina islands, the range of this frog is not clear, due to the small number of specimens sampled for the study that described the species. It is apparently found throughout southern California, south of Santa Barbara County and Bakersfield and on the offshore islands, excluding most of the southeast deserts. It ranges farther east into Nevada, and south into Baja California.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> This species utilizes a wide variety of habitats, often far from water outside of the breeding season, including forest, woodland, chaparral, grassland, pastures, desert streams and oases, and urban areas. Although, in the breeding season, shallow bodies of water act as habitat due to its component in the laying of eggs. During active periods, adults are most commonly found in close proximity to and along stream channels. During the daytime, individuals seek refuge in cavities or small depressions on the surfaces of the boulders lining streams, often fully exposed to direct sunlight. These perches are usually within a few jumps from the nearest pool.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog eats a wide variety of invertebrates, primarily on the ground at night, including a high percentage of flying insects. During the breeding season, they also feed during the day. Typical of most frogs, prey is located by vision, and then the frog lunges with a large sticky tongue to catch the prey and bring it into the mouth to eat. Tadpoles are suspension feeders, eating a variety of prey including algaes, bacteria, protozoa and organic and inorganic debris.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Breeding is aquatic. Fertilization is external. Breeding and egg-laying occurs between November until July, depending on the location. Adults probably become reproductively mature in their first year. Males move to breeding waters and begin to make their advertisement call. These calls attract more males, then eventually females. Males call while in or next to water at night, and during daylight during the peak of breeding when calling can occur all day and night. Some males and females have been observed staying only a few weeks at a breeding site. Some males have been observed moving to another site. And others have been observed staying at a site the entire breeding season.Males are territorial during the breeding season, establishing territories that they will defend with an encounter call or by physically butting and wrestling with another male. Satellite male breeding behavior has been observed - a silent male will intercept and mate with females that are attracted to the calling of other territorial males.</p> <p>Females lay on average between 400 - 750 eggs in small, loose, irregular clusters of 10 - 80 eggs each. Egg clusters are attached to sticks, stems, or grass in quiet shallow water. The eggs hatch in two to three weeks. Eggs appear to be resistant to the negative effects of solar UV-B radiation and even to increased water acidification. Eggs can also survive freezing temperatures for a short time. Tadpoles aggregate for thermoregulation and to avoid predation.</p> <p>Tadpoles metamorphose in about 2 to 2.5 months, generally from June to late August. In summer, there are often large congregations of new metamorphs along the banks of breeding pools. Metamorphosed juveniles leave their birth pond soon after transformation, dispersing into adult habitats.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. This frog is not included on the Special Animals List, meaning there are no significant conservation concerns for it in California according to the Dept. of Fish and Game.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm\">https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html\">http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog\">http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Falco peregrinus anatum</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Peregrine falcons (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>) have one of the widest distributions of any falcon species, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The American subspecies, , <em>F. p. anatum</em>, inhabits western north America, from Mexico to Canada and Alaska. This falcon species was a resident on the Channel Islands in years past, but largely disappeared due to harassment, shooting, egg stealing, and reproductive failure caused by organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT. However, this species has made a comeback due to reintroduction efforts. Peregrines were reintroduced on the islands in the 1980s and as of 2013, there are 45 active peregrine falcons on the eight Channel Islands.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>The peregrine falcon is one of the most widespread birds in the world. It is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands.</li> <li>The name \"peregrine\" means wanderer, and the peregrine falcon has one of the longest migrations of any North American bird.</li> <li>People have trained falcons for hunting for over a thousand years, and the peregrine falcon was always one of the most prized birds.</li> <li>Formerly called the \"duck hawk\", peregrines are formidable hunters that prey on other birds (and bats) in mid-flight.</li> <li>Peregrines hunt from above and, after sighting their prey, drop into a steep, swift dive, or stooop, that can top 200 miles an hour.</li> </ul> <br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This raptor is identified by its long, pointed wings and a long tail. Its shape as well as its size makes it stand out—the long primary feathers give the peregrine a long-winged shape. As with most raptors, males are smaller than females, so peregrines can overlap with large female merlins or small male gyrfalcons. Adults are blue-gray above with barred underparts and a dark head with thick sideburns. Juveniles are heavily marked, with vertical streaks instead of horizontal bars on the breast. Despite considerable age-related and geographic variation, an overall steely, barred look remains. <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The peregrine is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands. Within Channel Islands National Park, a 2011 survey revealed that peregrine falcons are found on all five islands in the park. Although the numbers are not large, historic evidence shows that the peregrine was sparsely distributed on the islands. Owing to factors relating to the imperative of protecting nesting sites, peregrines tend remain in the Channel Islands for life.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Habitat for the peregrine is closely associated with the nest territory and their foraging areas. On the Channel Islands this generally would generally include coastal strands, bodies of water, and shorelines.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Foraging areas are associated with the nest territory. This generally includes coastal strands, bodies of water, shorelines, open grasslands, marshes and wooded areas. Peregrines hunt in the air, and the usual method of hunting prey is by attacking flying birds from above or chasing them from behind (Recovery Plan, 1982). Prey consumed by California peregrines is highly varied, nevertheless, they feed primarily on other birds, such as songbirds, shorebirds, ducks, and, in urban areas, starlings and pigeons. Flying high above their intended prey, peregrines will \"stoop\" or dive and strike in mid-air, killing the prey with a sharp blow. At no nest sites do peregrines concentrate on a single prey or few species. Peregrines are generalists which hunt the large variety of prey that occur in their home range (Walton, 1997).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Generally speaking, peregrines are monogamous, mate for life, and breed in the same territory their entire life. On the Channel Islands, pairs remain in the area around the nest cliff enough from July to January (i.e. the non-breeding season) to maintain possession of the nest site and drive out competitors (Walton, 1997).</p> <p>Peregrines do not make stick nests; although they may use old common raven (<em>Corvus corax</em>) or great horned owl (<em>Bubo virginianus</em>) stick nests. The cliff usually has a small cave or overhung ledge large enough to contain three or four full-grown nestlings. Several holes or ledges that can be used in alternate years are apparently not an absolute requirement but probably increase the suitability of the cliff (Recovery Plan, 1982).</p> <p>Peregrine falcons generally reach breeding maturity at 2 years of age. Usually, the male arrives at a nesting site and begins a series of aerial acrobatic displays to attract a mate. An average clutch of four eggs is laid in the spring, hatching about a month later. Peregrines vigorously defend their nests, although they may abandon them if severely or continuously harassed.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The use of DDT as a pesticide during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s resulted in a precipitous decline of peregrine falcons in North America. During this period of DDT use, eggshell thinning and nesting failures were widespread in peregrine falcons, and in some areas, successful reproduction virtually ceased.</p> <p>As a result, there was a slow but drastic decline in the number of peregrine falcons in most areas of its range in North America. By the time peregrine falcons were listed as endangered in 1970, the eastern population of the American peregrine falcon was gone and the populations in the west had declined by as much as 90 percent below historical levels. By 1975, there were only 324 known nesting pairs of American peregrine falcons.</p> <p>An aggressive recovery program began in 1974 and resulted in over 6,000 falcons being reintroduced to the wild. Now there are about 3,000 breeding pairs of American peregrine falcons in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Territory occupancy, nest success, and productivity are all at levels considered normal for healthy peregrine falcon populations.</p> <p>In August 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the American peregrine falcon from the list of endangered and threatened species, marking one of the most dramatic successes of the Endangered Species Act. Post-delisting monitoring will continue until 2015.</p> <p>Surveys in 2013 recorded a total of 45 peregrine falcon territories on the eight Channel Islands, and 27 of those territories had eggs or chicks by the end of April 2013. In 2013 there were 5 territories on Anacapa, 16 on Santa Cruz, 13 on Santa Rosa, 9 on San Miguuel, and 3 on Santa Barbara (Sharpe 2013).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/Peregrinefactsheet.pdf\">Peregrine Falcon Fact Sheet, US Fish and Wildlife</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Peregrine_Falcon/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19000\">Comrack, Lyann A. and Randi J.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Aimophila ruficeps obscura</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The rufous-crowned sparrow is a small American sparrow that is found mostly across South-western USA and Mexico. An endemic subspecies of the rufous-crowned sparrow, <em>r. obscura</em>, first described in 1923 by Donald Dickey and Adriaan van Rossem, resides in the national park on Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands.This endemic subspecies was formerly found on</p> Santa Catalina Island . <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rufous-crowned sparrow pairs remain on their territories year-round and stay bonded for life.</li> <li>The rufous- crowned sparrow was first described in 1872 from specimens taken in Arizona. From 1886 to 1915 it was not recorded in the state.</li> <li>This secretive little bird spends most of its time on the ground, but if startled it will investigate by flying to a nearby perch. An exception is during spring mornings when this bird sings from the tops of boulders or another similar perch.</li> <li>This sparrow is awkward in flight and primarily uses running and hopping to move.</li> <li>Nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators for their nest;the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush.</li> <li>They have been known to live for up to three years, two months.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This sparrow has a chestnut-brown rufous crown, brown back with dark streaks, brown wings and a long, brown tail. It has a pale gray face, back of neck, chest, belly, and underparts. It also can be identified by its brown, rufous eyestripe and conical black bill. Another key identifier is its conspicuous black \"whisker\" mark on side of its chin. The sparrow also has pink legs and feet. The sparrow's young have diffuse streaks on their breast and flanks. Both sexes of the rufous-crowned sparrow are similar in appearance and their size ranges from 5 to 6 inches in length.The endemic subspecies, <em>r obscura</em>, is darker in color, has a heavier bill, longer tarsi, and heavier toes.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> This subspecies of rufous-crowned sparrow is found year-round on Santa Cruz island and West and Middle Anacapa. While this bird does not nest on East Anacapa, it can occasionally be seen there (Collins 2008).</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Habitats favored by the rufous-crowned sparrow on the islands are coastal-bluff, coastal sage and open coyote-brush scrub, often rocky in nature and located in steep ravines and canyons. These birds are both ground nesters and ground feeders. On Santa Cruz, the sparrow’s prime habitat includes grassy hill slopes and canyon walls with scattered bushes or clumps of cactus.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> These sparrows forage primarily on the ground, generally under the protective cover of vegetation, and only rarely in open areas, in foli¬age, or on branches of taller woody vegetation. The fall diet of rufous-crowned sparrows in California is 88.4% vegetables, which are primarily small grass and forb seeds, fresh grass stems and tender plant shoots. The rest of its diet, amounting to 11.6%, is animal matter of which insects such as ants, grasshoppers, ground beetles, and scale insects make up that small percentage for the fall and winter diet.Animal matter is generally taken in higher proportion during the breeding season.</p> <p>It is unknown whether this species obtains adequate water from its diet or if dietary water must be supplemented by drinking. Individuals have been observed drinking from and bathing in pools of water in rock crevices following rainstorms.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> There are no data on the characteristics of nest placement by island sparrows, but they probably select settings similar to those used by<em>A. ruficeps</em>on the main land. Their nests generally are in grass or against shrubs or grass tussocks either on or flush with the ground in a natural depression or hole in the ground or, infrequently, up toa foot and a half off the ground in a low bush. Pairs will raise two and possibly three broods and will ren est following nest failure. Breeding occurs from late March to late August.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Rufous-crowned sparrow habitat on the islands was adversely affected by the heavy grazing that occurred on Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands, and birds were likely more vulnerable to native and non-native predators such as island scrub-jays, foxes, and spotted skunks. However, recent work suggests that the species has benefited from the removal of sheep and other grazers, and may be increasing in both distribution and abundance.</p> <p>According to the IUCN Red List status of Globally Threatened Birds, this species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion. The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19951\">https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19951</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/rufous-winged_sparrow/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/rufous-winged_sparrow/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/scrub.html\">http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/scrub.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.bird-friends.com/BirdPage.php?name=Rufous-Crowned%20Sparrow\">http://www.bird-friends.com/BirdPage.php?name=Rufous-Crowned%20Sparrow</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9023\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9023</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/rufouscrownedsparrows.html\">http://www.avianweb.com/rufouscrownedsparrows.html</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Zalophus Californianus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> California sea lions<em>, Zalophus californianus</em>, are probably the most familiar marine mammal at the Channel Islands. These smart, playful animals are often seen feeding, playing in the surf or lounging on beaches around San Miguel, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara, but may also be seen on the other Channel Islands. These members of the<em>otariid</em>or walking seal family have external ear flaps and large flippers that they use to \"walk\" on land. The trained \"seals\" in zoos and aquariums are usually California sea lions. Significant breeding rookeries for this species are found on the California Channel Islands.<sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sea lions produce loud roars and barking, which helps explain why they're named after lions. Males of some sea lion species even grow thick manes around their necks. <sup>2</sup><br />  </li> <li>California sea lions are among the most gregarious marine mammals, forming dense aggregations of a thousand or more animals on land. <sup>2</sup><br />  </li> <li>In the wild this species can live up to 17 years, although in captivity, one California sea lion lived over 31 years. <sup>3</sup><br />  </li> <li>The deepest dive ever recorded by this species was 900 feet and it lasted just under ten minutes. <sup>3</sup><br />  </li> <li>Ninety percent of the young are born in June. They are born on land and nurse for a year or more.<sup>3</sup><br />  </li> <li>The stomach of an average California sea lion may contain as many as 100 pieces of gravel sized rocks. No one is sure yet what they are used for but it is believed that they are used to ease hunger pains during their mating and fasting periods. <sup>4</sup><br />  </li> <li>San Miguel Island is home to one of the largest rookeries in the world for California sea lions with a breeding population of approximately 80,000 animals.</li> </ul>   <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The California sea lion is the well-known performing \"seal\" of zoos, circuses, and oceanaria. In both sexes, the muzzle is dog-like and long, slightly tapering to a moderately blunt end. Adult males are substantially more robust and larger than females. Male California sea lions reach lengths of almost 8 feet in length, and weights of more than 600 pounds. Females, may reach up to 6 and a half feet in length and weigh up to 240 pounds. Newborn pups are about two and one half feet in length and weigh in from 13 to 20 pounds.</p> <p>The species has visible ear pinnae (ear flaps) on either side of its head (this is one distinguishing difference between sea lions from seals). Mature adult males have a raised forehead called the sagittal crest which increases to about an inch and a half at ten years of age. In adult males, the sagittal crest creates a high peaked crown. The crest begins to emerge at sexual maturity and, although highly variable, is most prominent in full-grown males. Females lack a pronounced crest and have a thinner head that slopes more gently to the end of the muzzle. This makes sub adult and juvenile males very difficult to distinguish from females. A California sea lions fore flippers are large and winglike, with the skeletal structure of a land animal.However, they have been modifies for swimming with cartilage extensions at the end of the finger bones.Not present are claws or hair.The California sea lion has a small flattened tail between the hind flippers.</p> <p>The color of California sea lions is highly variable. When dry, the coat of most adult males is dark brown. However, many males do not darken completely, remaining sandy brown on the sides, belly, and rear quarters. On most males, especially darker individuals, the crest and a corresponding area on the muzzle and around the eyes lighten with age. Adult females and juveniles are uniformly tan. Pups are born with a thick brownish black lanugo that is generally molted by the end of the first month.The succeeding light brown juvenile coat is shed 4 to 5 months later, and as adult males age, the hair around their heads lightens to a light tan is replaced by adult coloration. All ages and sexes have contrasting black flippers, naked except for a short stubble of dark fur partially covering the upper surface. <sup>1, 7</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The California sea lion ranges along the western coast and islands of North America, from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the US or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The US stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> During the breeding season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or higher up along the coast. . Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near the Bonneville Dam in the Columbia River. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> California sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovy, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, and market squid. They mostly forage near mainland coastlines, the continental shelf, and sea mounts. California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. They sometimes cooperate with other predators, such as dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds, when hunting large schools of fish. Sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Adult females feed between 6.2 to 62 miles from shore, but males may forage as far as 280 miles from shore.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively;the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Males do not establish their territories until after the females give birthThe animals tend to be more physically aggressive during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. 5</p> <p>Most pups are born in June or July and weigh 13 to 20 pounds. They nurse for at least five to six months and sometimes over a year. Mothers recognize pups on crowded rookeries through smell and vocalizations. Pups also learn to recognize the smell and vocalizations of their mothers. Breeding takes place a few weeks after birth. Males patrol territories and bark almost continuously during the breeding season. Most pups are weaned at 12 months of age. However, some pups continue to receive maternal care as yearlings and 2-3year olds. <sup>1, 6</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the California sea lion should remain classified as species of Least Concern due to its large and increasing population size.Exploitation during the 19th and 20th centuries caused population reductions. The distribution range has not changed since the exploitation era but population numbers have increased mainly in California where the population estimate is around 238,000. The population in Mexico occupies both side of the Baja California Peninsula: the west coast has an estimated population of 75,000 –87,000, whereas the Gulf of California population is near 30,000. The total population of California sea lions is therefore around 355,000 individuals. The population in California is reaching carrying capacity. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/california-sea-lion/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/california-sea-lion/</a>?</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/pinnipedia/california-sea-lion.htm#ff2\">http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/pinnipedia/california-sea-lion.htm#ff2</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328615/details\">http://eol.org/pages/328615/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=123\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=123</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_sea_lion\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_sea_lion</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41666/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41666/0</a></li> <li>Marine Mammals of the World ID guide, Jefferson, Leatherwood and Webber</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>An Ideal Isolated Island Home</b><br /> A cool, salty mist fills the air as you approach Cavern Point. The ever-present western gulls and graceful pelicans often can be sighted soaring along the steep, rugged volcanic cliffs. These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Cruz Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to twelve different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for sea birds and shore birds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> This isolation and abundance of food also make the islands an ideal home for seals and sea lions. Watch for California sea lions and harbor seals swimming in the waters around Cavern Point and Potato Harbor. These two species rest and breed throughout Santa Cruz Island's shoreline.<br /> <br /> But even the island's isolation could not protect these and other sea mammals from human predation. As early as the late 1700s fur hunters were exploiting sea otters, elephant seals, fur seals, and California sea lions for their fur, hides, and oil. This slaughter would continue until 1911, when the sea otter finally became the last sea mammal to receive legal protection.<br /> <br /> Isolation also was not able to protect some species of sea birds from human impacts. The gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and pesticides all have been detrimental. The endangered California brown pelican, for example, once nested on Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> In addition, during the 1960s, the pesticide DDT nearly caused the pelican to become extinct as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, on neighboring Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made with just one chick surviving. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> On Santa Cruz Island, these efforts have focused on closing off public access to certain habitat critical sea caves and restoring seabird habitat on Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks. These rocks are important nesting islets for burrow-nesting seabirds. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing nonnative vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and closures to protect nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> <b>Protecting the Islands</b><br /> This is why Channel Islands National Park was established by Congress in 1980-to protect, preserve, and teach us about the islands' unique past and fragile resources, including: the island Chumash and the ranchers who came after them; the native plants that are struggling to recover; the complicated geologic story; the pinnipeds, sea birds and shore birds that depend on these isolated islands for survival; and the wide variety of other natural and cultural resources not mentioned in this trail guide. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and help preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Cruz Island and the rest of the Channel Islands. But don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to safeguard-to preserve-the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Seabird Information</strong></u></p> <p>The Channel Islands are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Thirty shorebird species have recorded, including snowy plovers, willets, wandering tattlers, whimbrels, black turnstones, and sanderlings. Twelve species of seabirds depend on the rich marine resources and the isolation of these offshore islands to provide food and undisturbed nesting grounds safe from predators. The islands host half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls and 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets. In addition, the islands are home to the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands are critically important to seabirds, supporting:<br /> <br /> - the largest breeding colonies of seabirds in southern California<br /> - the only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in California<br /> - the only protected colonies of California brown pelicans and Scripps's murrelets on the West Coast of the U.S.<br /> - the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels<br /> - over 30 years of seabird research<br /> <br /> <strong>Impacts to Seabirds</strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Monitoring and Restoration</strong><br /> Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support seabird populations in southern California. Several of these projects have been funded by the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program (MSRP), a multi-agency government program dedicated to restoring natural resources harmed by DDTs and PCBs released into the environment.

The islands offer protected habitat in an increasingly disturbed southern California environment.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Seabirds and Shorebirds</strong><br /> The islands are particularly important for seabirds, offering critical nesting habitat. The particular association of northern and southern species found here is not duplicated anywhere else in the world. The islands support large numbers of western gulls, Cassin's auklets, Brandt's cormorants, and the only nesting population of California brown pelicans along the West Coast of the United States. Also, the islands support the world's largest population of Scripps's murrelets.</p> <p>While some seabird species may be viewed from the islands, park boat concessioners will search for seabirds on boat trips out to the islands. Be sure to tell a boat crew member that you are interested in seabirds and they will often assist in finding and identifying birds. In addition, local chapters of the Audubon Society occasionally sponsor boats trips around the islands to view seabirds. Due to limited beach access on some islands, shorebird viewing is best done on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Landbirds</strong><br /> The landbirds are also a distinctive group-they represent a unique selection of the birds that live on the California mainland. Ten of the 40 landbird species that commonly nest on the park islands are represented by endemic species or subspecies-forms that occur only on the islands and nowhere else. Of this group, the island scrub-jay (found on Santa Cruz Island) is the only bird that is endemic at the species level.</p> <p>The larger islands of Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa offer more types of habitats and, therefore, more variety of landbirds. Many birders visit Prisoners Harbor (easiest viewing opportunity) or Scorpion Ranch on Santa Cruz Island to view the island scrub-jay.</p> <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Haematopus bachmani</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The black oystercatcher is the signature bird of the rocky intertidal coastline. It is a permanent resident on all five islands in the park, being restricted in its range, never straying far from shores and particularly favoring rocky shorelines. It has been suggested that this bird is seen mostly on coastal stretches which have some quieter embayments, such as jetty protected areas. It hunts through the intertidal area, searching for food visually, often so close to the water's edge it has to fly up to avoid crashing surf.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Despite its name, this prominently-sized black bird with large feet seldom eats oysters.</li> <li>Although they don't swim, black oystercatcher chicks will sometimes dive under water to avoid predators.</li> <li>Migrating only short distances or not at all, they are permanent residents of their breeding range.</li> <li>The black oystercatcher can live for more than15 years.</li> <li>Monogamous pairs make their nests by tossing rock flakes, pebbles or shell fragments toward their nest bowl with a sideways or backward flip of their bills. They use the same nest year after year.</li> <li>Limpets and mussels have a strong muscle that holds the two shells tightly together—yet an oystercatcher can easily and quickly pry them open.</li> <li>The black oystercatcher has a very loud piercing whistle that can be heard at great distance over crashing waves.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The black oystercatcher is a distinctive, crow-sized, short-tailed, all-black shorebird. It has pale pinkish legs and a long, bright reddish-orange bill and eye-ring.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Oystercatchers breed from the western Aleutian Islands in Alaska south to central Baja, California. Within Alaska, they have ranged northward to the Pribilof Islands in winter and to Round Island, Bristol Bay, to nest in the summer. It is a permanent resident on all five islands in the park. Ranges of the black oystercatcher and the brown-and-white American oystercatcher overlap in Baja California.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Oystercatchers never stray far from shore and favor rocky shorelines in particular. It has been suggested that this bird is seen mostly on coastal stretches which have some quieter embayments, such as jetty protected areas.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Mussels and limpets are their primary food, but black oystercatchers prey on a wide range of shellfish and other creatures found along the rocky shore. They locate open mussels and disable them with a quick jab to the adductor muscle. With the mussel stuck in the open position, the oystercatcher can pull out the contents with the tip of its chisel-like bill. Oystercatchers often forage in the wave zone, because mussels that are splashed by waves open more frequently.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The female black oystercatcher lays two to three eggs among pebbles in a shallow rocky depression or in a hollow on the beach above the high tide line. The nest is built by both the male and the female. They will create or scrape a depression in the ground and then pick up and toss shells and bits of rocks and pebbles into the depression with a backwards or sideways flip of their heads. They use the same nest year-after-year. Both the male and the female take turns incubating the eggs. The eggs incubate for 24-29 days and the chicks fledge in about 35 days. The chicks remain close to the nest at first. One of the parents will stay with them while the other parent forages for food to bring back to the nest. Eventually, the chicks will go with their parents to feeding areas. The chicks fledge at about five weeks and will forage on their own, but they will still occasionally be fed by their parents. The female has one brood a year.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The black oystercatcher, with a global population of 10,000-12,000 individuals, is considered rare. It is completely dependent on marine shorelines, favoring sheltered areas of high tidal variation that support limpets and mussels, their preferred food. Their numbers are highest from Alaska to British Columbia, where there is relatively plentiful preferred habitat and lower levels of disturbance than in the southern portion of the range.</p> <p>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service selected the black oystercatcher as a Focal Species for Conservation Action due to small population size, restricted range, threats to preferred habitat, lack of baseline data to assess conservation status, and a suite of ongoing and anthropogenic and natural factors that may limit long-term viability. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and other agencies in 2007 developed a range-wide conservation action plan and working group, which is the unified resource and blueprint for tracking and conserving the species.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <p>Anders, Brad A.

From 1000-1450 A.D., the area was the site of a Middle Mississippian culture town where the cultivation and storage of corn allowed a permanent community to persist. The town’s inhabitants left by 1450 A.D. for reasons unknown, although it was possibly due to nutrient-depleted soils or lack of wild game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ad6fb0b0-799c-4e98-a194-2532d7458915}{175}\" paraid=\"317830522\">The Angel Mounds State Historic Site strives to tell the story of these native peoples. It was first established in 1938, when the Indiana Historical Society purchased the current 600 acres, prior to which it was a working farm. Between 1939 to 1964, a crew of excavators directed by noted Indiana archaeologist Glenn A. Black uncovered more than 2.5 million artifacts from the site. Angel Mounds was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5758cb86-c812-4a5f-ac0f-7a87682995a2}{220}\" paraid=\"314586140\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Twelve earthen mounds created for ceremonial purposes are scattered throughout the property and can be viewed from the walking trail. The interpretive center details the history and culture of the site’s historic inhabitants, known as the Mississippian Culture. There is also an interactive area where visitors can explore different aspects of Black’s research. Visitors can also walk the four-mile Angel Mounds Loop Trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ad6fb0b0-799c-4e98-a194-2532d7458915}{205}\" paraid=\"1074725215\">For those who want a deeper look into the history of the area, Angel Mounds hosts a regular lecture series on the history of Mississipian Culture’s way of life, economics, politics, and religion. Camps and other activities for children are available in the summer. Farm Fest is another popular two-day event celebrating Indiana’s history of farming.

Ocean conditions are highly variable and sometimes dangerous. Many beaches on the islands have steep, dangerous shore breaks. The wind and swell generally come from the northwest and become stronger as the day continues. From October through January, visitors must also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds. The ocean currents outside of coves and protected beach areas can be strong and extremely dangerous. These conditions should be carefully considered when planning your trip and entering the water.</p> <p>In addition to the regulations and guidelines listed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a>, the following suggestions should also be considered:</p> <ul> <li>There are no lifeguards on duty, so all water sports are at your own risk. Visitors should be aware of boat landing operations at all times-avoid water sports near skiffs that are conducting surf landings.</li> <li>Snorkelers, divers, and swimmers should always use the buddy system. This allows for someone to go for help if you encounter trouble.</li> <li>For your own safety, the law requires divers to display a dive flag while diving. It is recommended that spear guns be unloaded at least 50 feet from the beach.</li> <li>Before departing, swimmers, snorkelers and divers should leave an itinerary and/or float plan with someone who is on shore and can be easily contacted.</li> <li>Sea caves can be very dangerous-large waves or swells can fill a cave unexpectedly. Be extremely careful and wear a helmet at all times when exploring sea caves.</li> <li>Due to cold water conditions (55° to 70° F), wetsuits and hoods are recommended.</li> </ul>",

Samuel Curtis’s union artillery pounded the top of Big Mountain. When the artillery thundered across the landscape, Confederate soldiers tried to find shelter on the rocky slope of this overlook. Solid shot tore through the trees and shattered rock, while explosive shell burst overhead, throwing a deadly shower of lead, iron, wood, and stone into the defenders. Twenty-one guns belonging to six union army batteries created a deafening sound that could be heard from miles away. The Confederates suffered many casualties, but there were only four known fatalities.</p>",

The village was a permanent settlement, and its residents relied upon fishing, hunting, and crops. After a smallpox epidemic in 1781 wiped out a large portion of the villagers, the site was abandoned. When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark came upon the ruins in 1804, they were already heavily deteriorated.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{6044c3d7-831f-48e4-9dc8-182e048f3815}{186}\" paraid=\"276269584\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In June 1872, the U.S. Military established an infantry post near the ruins called Fort McKeen, but it was renamed Fort Abraham Lincoln a few months later. A calvary post was added to the fort in 1873. By the following year, it had become one of the largest and most important forts on the Northern Plains, housing some 650 men. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{2448c0aa-0608-46e4-bfdd-d71af15586d3}{230}\" paraid=\"1973208851\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, visitors can tour On-a-Slant Village and its six reconstructed earth lodges while learning about the Mandan and their history. Living history tours of Historic Fort Lincoln and the Custer House are also available. The park also boasts numerous outdoor activities, including camping, rental cabins and tipis, hiking, and various events and outdoor performances hosted throughout the year. In the visitor center, visitors can relax at the coffee show and peruse the gift shop and museum.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{61d42434-81e2-4d44-9437-975b9bff4ebe}{160}\" paraid=\"2071758183\">For more information on events or cabin rentals, call (701) 667-6340 or visit <a href=\"https://www.parkrec.nd.gov/fort-abraham-lincoln-state-park\">https://www.parkrec.nd.gov/fort-abraham-lincoln-state-park</a>. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Hypsypops rubicundus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The garibaldi, a member of the damselfish family, is the California State marine fish and its possession is illegal. It is easily identified by its bright red orange coloration. The garibaldi is found in temperate waters off the California coast from Monterey Bay southward and northern Baja coastline waters of Mexico. The Channel Islands, and in particular the southern isles, are the more predominant habitat for this species.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The species is one of the brightest colored fishes off the southern California coast. Adults are bright orange</li> <li>The garibaldi gets its common name, garibaldi, from the 19th century Italian leader by the same name whose famous army wore flashy red/orange colors into battle.</li> <li>One reason the garibaldi is protected in California is its popularity as a salt water aquarium fish, for which a law was passed to make it illegal to remove them from their habitat.</li> <li>The male garibaldi is the housemaker of a mating pair. It not only selects the nesting area, but also prepares it meticulously for the laying of eggs by the female.</li> <li>Being fiercely territorial, it is not uncommon for the garibaldi to chase away divers from its nesting area.</li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Garibaldis are round, plump fish with flowing pectoral and tail fins, and staring yellow eyes. Swimming through dark reefs and brown kelp, they're a jolt of glowing orange, a reminder that garibaldis are relatives of coral-reef damselfish. Juvenile garibaldis are deeper orange, with sparkling spots of blue and blue-trimmed fins. <sup>1</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The garibaldi is primarily found off the coast of California. They have a home range from Monterey Bay down to the Baja California peninsula, and around the Channel Islands as stated by Eschmeyer, W., E. McFarland, J. Chess in their 1983 work, the field guide to Pacific coast fishes of North. However, the northern Baja coastline of Mexico, as well as islands such as Guadalupe, is home to this species.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In contrast to most other species of the damselfish family that have tropical reefs as their habitat, the garibaldi lives in cooler temperate waters. Their habitat ranges from the shallow subtidal regions down to depths of approximately 100 feet. The garibaldi occupies shallow rocky reefs near where the intertidal and subtidal zones meet. Here they swim in and around the kelp forests that are prevalent in this habitat. These kelp forests are a critical habitat element as they provide potential protection from predators, are a source of food, and are important for reproductive success for this species.<br /> <br /> Garibaldis have a clear idea of exactly where their territories end, and two males may be seen peacefully grazing less than two feet apart—as long as each remains on his own turf. Female garibaldis tend to be less protective of their territories, perhaps because they contain no eggs. Territoriality seems to be tied to the rocky reef—periodically, garibaldis gather without drama in the waters above the reef. These \"kelp socials\" seem to be a way for garibaldis to investigate each other and may help females choose their mates.<sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The garibaldi feeds during the day on a diet of primarily bottom-dwelling invertebrates including worms, small anemones, sponges, bryozoans, crabs, shrimps, small shellfish, and sea stars. Given the opportunity, females eat their own eggs. Their diet of sponges may contribute to their bright colors.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> According to observational research conducted by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, it is discovered that much of the work of raising babies is handled by the male. Upon becoming an adult, a male garibaldi picks out a promising stretch of reef—a sheltering nook plus a smooth expanse of rock wall—where he will live for the rest of his life. Each March, males work feverishly to tidy their nest areas, by removing debris, carrying away sea stars or urchins that wander along, and biting away all the plant growth except for a few species of red algae. These he trims so they're about an inch long—perfect places for thousands of eggs to rest.<sup>4</sup><br /> <br /> Once a male's nest is perfectly trimmed, the next challenge is attracting the attention of female garibaldis. Beginning in April and lasting until fall, females ready to lay eggs make outings to look for good nests. They signal their interest by swimming with their fins sticking straight up. Males try to entice these females over by swimming loops with their bright orange bodies. At the same time, they thwack together the teeth in their throat to make a thumping sound that (they hope) the female can't ignore. If she takes notice, he swims straight over to his nest, hoping she will follow. Females are very choosy, often visiting 15 nests or more before making up their minds. The Monterey Bay Aquarium states that the male garibaldis are fiercely protective of their territories and they don't get sentimental after attracting a mate. As soon as a female has laid her eggs, the male chases her away before she has the chance to munch on any other eggs in his nest, then fertilizes the eggs by scattering his sperm over them. He also chases off any other creatures that venture too close.<sup>4</sup><br /> <br /> In the end, it seems to make little difference how well tended a male's nest is or how well he swims loops. Females are reluctant to lay their eggs in an empty nest—they look for a nest with eggs from at least one other female (and up to 20 females). This means male garibaldis have to work hard to attract their first females; after that, many others come—sometimes lining up to lay eggs at a popular nest. Females are also picky about the age of the eggs in a male's nest. They prefer to deposit theirs alongside other freshly laid, bright-yellow eggs. Garibaldi eggs hatch in two to three weeks, so eggs with just a few days' head start would hatch earlier and have an advantage over younger hatchlings. In a bizarre turn of events, males sometimes eat the older eggs in their nests (gulping down 200 at a time), gambling that they'll attract even more females in the next day or so.<sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), there are no major threats known for this species. However, this fish was historically exploited by the aquarium trade (Moe, 1992). Conservation actions have been taken by the State of California to fully protect the species and it may be present in some Marine Protected Areas in Mexico and United States as shown in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA 2006).<sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cab\">Cabrillo National Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/183367/0\">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animal-guide/fishes/garibaldi\">The Monterey Bay Aquarium</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/garabaldi/\">Aquarium of the Pacific</a></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Stereolepis gigas</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Giant Black Sea Bass is a unique species if not for any other reason than its extraordinary size. Its presence in the waters off of California and Baja California has played an important role in the health of the ecosystem in which it lives. With a position at or near the top of the food chain, it provides the balance required for an optimum marine environment. Prior to the 1950’s, this species of bony fish was very common to the near shore waters of Southern California. Due to over-fishing, their population was reduced to critically low levels. Back as far as the late 1970’s, the California Department of Fish and Game made it illegal to spearfish these giants. In 1982, both commercial and sport fishing of Giant Black Sea Bass was banned in California waters.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>It is estimated that the Giant Black Sea Bass is capable of growing to lengths of over 7 feet and weighing over 700 pounds.</li> <li>The largest species ever caught by a sport fisherman with rod and reel, weighing 563 pounds, was caught off of Anacapa Island in 1968. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Up to 60, 000, 000 eggs are produced by the female during the spawning season. <sup>6</sup></li> <li>Giant sea bass was originally assigned to the grouper family, Serranidae, but was later placed in a new family called the Percichthyidae<sup>.7</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong> <p>As implied by its alternative name of giant sea bass, the most dramatic feature of this fish is its conspicuous size, capable of growing over 700 pounds! The bulky, robust fish has a large mouth, small teeth and a distinctive single, strongly-notched dorsal fin (4). Almost as impressive as its size is the variation in color displayed by this species. Juveniles start out life as a bright orange color with black spots, with the orange turning a more bronzy purple as the individual grows and the spots fading as the fish gets darker. Large adults often appear solid black to grey, with a white underside, but retain the ability to display large black spots. Indeed, black sea bass are in fact capable of rapid and dramatic color changes, from dark above and light below to displaying white mottling or simply changing from jet black to pale grey. These color changes are thought to act as a form of communication between individuals or to be an indication of stress. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> According to the Pfleger Institute of Environment Research, the giant (black) sea bass range from Humboldt Bay to the tip of Baja California, and occur in the northern half of the Gulf of California. Within California this species is rarely found north of Point Conception. “PIER sponsored research from 2000 to 2005 focused on documenting the movements of giant sea bass around the northern Channel Islands. PIER researchers placed acoustic tags in giant sea bass within PIER’s Channel Islands Acoustic Receiver array. The study revealed that many of the giants leave Anacapa Island during the winter months and return in May or June while others remain at the island year round. Data on the seasonal movement patterns, spatial distribution, feeding habitats and potential spawning aggregation locations have been compiled and are awaiting publication. ” <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Adult giant sea bass seem to prefer the edges of near shore rocky reefs (35 to 120 feet) and are often associated with kelp beds. At certain times of the year adults can be found well away from the reef, foraging over sandy bottom and routinely associated with spawning squid. <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> “The most important prey items of the giant (black) sea bass’, based upon research by PIER, 4 “are sting rays, skates, lobster, crabs, various flatfish, small sharks, mantis shrimp, blacksmith, ocean whitefish, red crab, sargo, sheephead, octopus, squid and an occasional kelp bass or barred sand bass. Giant sea bass are not built for sustained speed, and the vast majority of their prey is organisms that live on the bottom. These organisms, located crawling across the substrate or buried just below the surface, are drawn into the mouth of a giant sea bass by the vacuum produced when the huge mouth is rapidly opened. Certainly some mid-water fish are ambushed and sucked in by giant sea bass lurking in the shadows of the kelp.” <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> As shown in a study by Sepulveda, C., S. Aalbers. 2009. \"The Giant Sea Bass: Status of Biological Knowledge” , “Male giant sea bass reach sexual maturity at about 40 pounds, while females mature at sizes of 50 to 60 pounds. These sizes correspond to an age of 11 to 13 years for either gender. During a three mouth spawning period from July to September, females may produce up to 60,000,000 eggs. After fertilization, the eggs absorb water and swell up, measuring up to 1/24th of an inch in diameter. Eggs are positively buoyant and float to the surface. After hatching, larvae drift and feed on plankton for about a month until they sink and start their juvenile phase.”6</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Based upon a 2008 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN), states that the Giant Black Sea Bass was classified as a Critically Endangered species by IUCN in 1996. This assessment presents additional information to support that assessment. The American Fisheries Society classified the species as Threatened. <sup>7</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/black-sea-bass/stereolepis-gigas/\">Wildscreen Arkive</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fishbase.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?ID=3310&AT=Giant+seabass\">FishBase</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://pier.org/ca_coastal_gs_bass_biological.php\">Pfleger Institute of Environment Research</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/anglingrecords.asp\">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Stereolepis_gigas/\">Animal Diversity Web</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/20795/0\">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> </ol>",

As highly prized targets for fishermen and divers, most California spiny lobsters do not live longer than 5-7 years before being caught. They have been known to achieve lengths of over 3 feet long and weighing 16 pounds.<br /> <br /> As predators, lobsters play a central role in maintaining the diversity of intertidal and subtidal communities. Predation on kelp-eating species such as sea urchins helps to maintain a balance in the kelp forest ecosystem, providing a more stable habitat for other species that rely on the kelp for food and shelter. The kelp forests of the Channel Islands offer an excellent rocky habitat for their pelagic larvae arriving with the converging currents from the south.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Batrachoseps pacificus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Channel Island slender salamander is found on Santa Cruz, San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa islands and is the only endemic amphibian found on any of the California islands. This secretive creature is found under rocks and logs (mainly near streams) and also in the soil litter, or duff, during the winter and spring rainy season.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Channel Islands slender salamander is a member of family Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders.</li> <li>Lungless salamanders breathe through their skin, requiring them to live in damp environments on land, not in water, and to move about on the ground only during times of high humidity.</li> <li>Typical of most slender salamanders, when disturbed, this salamander may coil up and remain still, relying on cryptic coloring to avoid detection.</li> <li>It might also uncoil quickly and spring away, repeatedly bouncing over the ground, or drop its tail to distract a predator.</li> <li>The tail is easily broken off, but it can be regenerated.</li> <li>The cool marine climate of the Channel Islands, including summer fog, provides enough moisture for this species to be active all year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is a small slim salamander with 18-20 costal grooves, which denote its rib connections. It has short limbs, a narrow head, long slender body, very long tail, and with its conspicuous costal and end of torso grooves, this species has the worm-like appearance typical of most slender salamanders. There are four toes on the front and hind feet, which is also typical of slender salamanders. Fairly robust for a slender salamander, with relatively long legs. Its coloration is brown to pinkish above with a wide dorsal stripe with indefinite borders, and may be made up of many light speckles. The throat and underside of the tail are pale and the abdomen area is whitish or slate, with light and dark speckling.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is an endemic species found only on the Channel Islands, although not on Santa Barbara Island. Interestingly, Channel Islands slender salamanders share their habitat on Santa Cruz Island with another similar species, the black-bellied slender salamanders without interbreeding. In one February survey, researchers recorded 155 Channel Islands slender salamanders and 152 black-bellied slender salamanders in similar habitat. However, only Channel Islands slender salamanders were found under driftwood on a sandy substrate near the ocean. In general, when only one species is found at a more open site, it is usually Channel Islands slender salamanders.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Channel Islands slender salamanders occur in grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, oak woodlands, and pine forest communities. They have been found under rocks and logs, especially near streams. Dense populations have been found in open areas near the ocean; in February at the west end of Santa Cruz Island, salamanders were abundant under driftwood on sand within 200 feet of the ocean. Periods of surface activity correspond generally to the rainy season, especially in drier inland valleys (e.g., Santa Cruz Island). However, the moderating influence of cool, marine air, combined with daily fog, extends activity throughout the summer.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Feeding probably occurs both above and below ground. Studies describe that a similar species, the California slender salamander (B. attenuatus) capture prey using a projectile tongue and feed on small invertebrates, which consist of on earthworms, small slugs, a variety of terrestrial arthropods including sowbugs and millipedes, and insects including collembolans, aphids, caterpillars, small beetles, beetle larvae, and ants. The Channel Islands slender salamander probably eats a similar array of prey items.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander do not have the ability to dig their own burrows, but use excavations of other animals and cracks in the soil, in addition to man made tunnels and crevices. Because of this they must descend from the surface to moist areas underground before the late spring. Eggs are laid while the female is below ground during late fall and winter. Egg sets have been found from December 8 to January 18. The number of eggs per set ranged from 13 to 20. Hatchlings emerge during winter and early spring. It is not known if adults tend their young, and the adults and the young animals migrate to the surface during the early rains in the fall and winter. The timing of this cycle is highly dependent on weather, and varies greatly between wet and dry years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The most recent edition of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the Channel Islands slender salamander as of Least Concern since, although its Extent of Occurrence is much less than 5,000 per square kilometer, it is common and occurs in an area of extensive, suitable habitat which appears not to be under threat, it has a presumed large population, and it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>Natural History of The Islands of California, Schoenherr, Feldmeth & Emerson</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.amphibiaweb.org/\">http://www.amphibiaweb.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626\">http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Delphinus Capensis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Common dolphins can be split into two groups long and short beaked. Both groups are found throughout the world’s oceans and share similar behavioral characteristics such as jumping and surfing the bow waves of vessels. However, the long beaked dolphins, delphinus capensis, are more commonly seen near coastal areas.. Both forms have a dark gray dorsal surface with a lighter hourglass pattern on their sides, and white undersides.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Common dolphins are one of the most numerous cetaceans in the world, with a population that is estimated to be over one million. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Until recently, the long-beaked common dolphin was not considered a valid species, (and was grouped with the short-beaked dolphin) however, in 1994, it was demonstrated that it is indeed a valid species. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>These dolphins have an estimated lifespan of approximately 40 years. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Long-beaked common dolphins are gregarious. Schools range from less than ten to several thousand. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Hybrids between this species and common bottlenose dolphins have been born in captivity.3</li> <li>Long-beaked common dolphins have more teeth than any other species of dolphin <sup>5</sup></li> <li>The species name capensis refers to the Cape of Good Hope. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Long-beaked common dolphins are capable of diving to at least 900 feet and holding their breath for up to 8 minutes to feed on prey. <sup>5</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, “The common dolphin is a moderately slender animal (although some offshore animals are rather stocky) with a medium to long beak and a tall, slightly falcate dorsal fin. Common dolphins are strikingly marked, with a dark brownish grey back, white belly, and tan to ochre anterior flank patch. This flank patch dips below the dorsal fin and combines with streaks of light grey on the tail stock to produce the species’ most characteristic feature, an hourglass pattern on the side. The lips are dark, and there is a stripe running from the apex of the melon to encircle the eye. There is also a black to dark grey chin-to flipper stripe, and sometimes a thinner stripe running towards the area of the anus. There are 40 to 61 small pointed teeth per row. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> Common dolphins are highly geographically variable and many regional forms have been described. In several parts of the world, two types of common dolphins appear to exist: a long-beaked coastal type (generally with a muted color pattern), and an offshore type with a shorter beak (the latter comprises several stocks in the eastern tropical Pacific). Recent research indicates that these two types represent separate species. <sup>1,3</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> According to NOAA’s Office of Protected Resources, The long-beaked common dolphin has a restricted distribution in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Long-beaked common dolphins are commonly found along the U.S. west coast, from Baja California (including the Gulf of California) northward to about central California. Distinct populations can be found off the coasts of California and Mexico, South America (Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina) -- The abundance and distribution of this species may change with varying oceanographic conditions. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Long-beaked common dolphins generally prefer shallow, tropical, subtropical and warmer temperate waters closer to the coast, usually within 50-100 nautical miles and on the continental shelf. <sup>5 </sup>These parameters of adaptation for this species make the Southern California Bight and ideal fit.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Long-beaked common dolphins are capable of diving to at least 900 feet and holding their breath for up to 8 minutes to feed on prey. The NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources states that the majority of their diet consists of small schooling fish such as anchovies and sardines. Krill and cephalopods (e.g., squid) also comprise and important part of their diet. Dolphin groups may work together to herd schools of prey. This species has 47-67 pairs of small sharp conical teeth in each jaw used for grasping prey. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> As stated in Marine Mammals of the World, in a 2008 publication by Jefferson, T. A, M. A. Webber, and R. L. Pitman, Long-beaked common dolphins become sexually mature at around 6.5 feet in length. Breeding usually takes place between the spring and autumn, followed by a 10-11 month. gestation period. Females give birth to a single calf that is about 2.5-3 feet long and weighs about 20 lbs, and have an estimated calving interval of 1-3 years. <sup>1, 5</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The long-beaked common dolphin is covered by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN), states that although the species is widespread and its aggregate abundance probably numbers in the high tens or low hundreds of thousands, in several areas (most notably West Africa, the east and west coasts of South America and East Asia) there are known incidental and directed takes of unknown, but possibly large, magnitude, making it difficult to make a reliable assessment of the impact on the species. Therefore, the Long-beaked Common Dolphin is listed as Data Deficient.<sup> 6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>FAO Species Identification Guides: Marine Mammals of the World</li> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.marinemammalscience.org/\">The Society for Marine Mammalogy</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/long-beaked-common-dolphin/delphinus-capensis/\">Wildscreen Arkive</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/long-beaked-common-dolphin\">NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN),</a></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Uria aalge californica</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> In July, 2011, researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service discovered that California common murre chicks had hatched for the first time since 1912 on the Channel Islands. This new nesting colony was spotted perched on the 100-foot-high sea cliffs of Prince Island-a small islet off San Miguel Island within Channel Islands National Park. Historically, common murres nested on Prince Island, but this colony disappeared nearly a century ago, likely a result of human disturbance and egg harvesting.</p> <p>Since it has been so long since the last nesting was observed here, scientists surmised that recent ocean conditions could be the reason for the re-establishment of this seabird colony. With this murre colony, Prince Island now hosts 13 nesting seabirds, making it one of the most important and biologically diverse nesting habitats on the West Coast of North America.</p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/news/murre.htm\">Common Murre Press Release</a> for more information on this discovery of nesting common murres.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The common murre's breeding range on the Pacific Coast is from Alaska south to the Channel Islands National Park in Southern California.</li> <li>Common murres are silent at sea, but in flight make a soft murrr sound.</li> <li>If you see a string of black and white birds flying swiftly across the surface of the water, chances are you're seeing a \"bazaar\" or \"fragrance\" of common murres.</li> <li>Courtship displays including bowing, billing and preening. The male points its head vertically and makes croaking and growling noises to attract the females.</li> <li>The eggs vary in color and pattern to help the parents recognize them, each egg is unique.</li> <li>Common murres can fly 125 miles from the nest to find food for their chicks.</li> <li>Common murres will dive to almost 250 feet in pursuit of schools of small fish.</li> <li>When the chick is ready to fledge, the male swims below the cliff and calls out to it. The chick then hurls itself off the cliff edge and drops 800 to 1,000 feet into the ocean where it swims out to its father.</li> <li>The male stays with the chick and cares for it and feeds it until it is able to fly when it is 39-46 days old.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Common murres are football-sized seabirds with the tuxedo colors of penguins. They are about 15 to 18 inches long, with short necks and long, straight bills. The body is black above and white below with distinct summer and winter plumages. In the summer, the head and neck are black with grayish-brown wash on the crown. In the winter, the throat, cheeks and fore-neck are white, with a black line down the cheeks. The neck is short and the bill is fairly long, slender, and black. The feet are blackish. The trailing edge of the secondaries is white.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> During the breeding season, the common murre is found along the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts. On the Pacific Coast, it is found from Alaska south to California as far as the northern limit of the Channel Islands off Southern California. On the Atlantic Coast, it is found from Labrador, Canada south to New Brunswick, Canada. It winters at sea from Newfoundland, Canada south to Massachusetts on the Atlantic Coast, and from Alaska to southern California on the Pacific Coast. It is also found in Greenland and northern Europe and Asia.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Common murres favor cool ocean waters, both near and far from shore. During the breeding season they are found closer to rocky shorelines. They nest on coasts and on islands alike, provided there are cliff ledges or flat bare rocks atop sea stacks, which are steep rock formations near the coast. San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands National Park is a prime example of a breeding area that is attractive for the breeding common murre colony. Common murres are to be found after breeding season on the open ocean or in large bays.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Common murres feed entirely by pursuit-diving, and are capable of diving to depths of more than 240 feet in search of prey such as fish during breeding, and more krill and squid during winter and pre-breeding periods. Common prey species include northern anchovy, rockfish, Pacific herring, Pacific whiting and market squid. To dive, they partly extend their wings and propel themselves underwater, then snatch and carry a single fish lengthwise in their mouth, with the head of the fish held in the mouth cavity.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Common murres first breed at 4 to 5 years of age. Pairs exhibit a high degree of site and mate fidelity. Upon arrival at nest sites, they participate in courtship displays. They do not build nests. The female lays a single egg each year. Common murre eggs are pointed at one end; when pushed, they roll around in a circle, preventing them from rolling off the nesting ledge. The variation in egg color and markings allows parent murres to recognize their own eggs when they return from sea. As many as 20 pairs may incubate in one square meter. Incubation lasts about 5 weeks; both sexes incubate and feed the newly hatched chick. Often, to prevent young chicks from jumping off the ledge prematurely, adults stand between the chicks and the cliff edge. When the chick is ready to fledge, the male swims below the cliff and calls out to it. The chick then hurls itself off the cliff edge and drops as much as 800 to 1,000 feet into the ocean where it swims out to its father. On Prince Island, off of San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands National Park, the cliffs are a mere 100 feet high. At the end of the colony chick-rearing period, successful breeding males and their partly-grown chicks depart the colony. During the at-sea chick-rearing period, chicks are fed at sea until independence. Other adults (i.e., females, failed breeders, and sub-adults) also cease colony attendance once male-chick pairs have departed. The first successful chick hatching since 1912 in the Channel Island National Park was observed on July 28, 2011, on Prince Island, and islet of San Miguel Island, the northernmost island in the park.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> In California, common murres are largely resident year-round near breeding colonies, but some birds disperse to southern California in winter. Insufficient evidence is available to determine whether murres from Alaskan colonies winter in the area from southern British Columbia to California, although some Alaskan murres (especially from the Forrester Island colony) are present in northern British Columbia in summer and winter.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> A new colony of common murres is situated within Channel Islands National Park, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the recently designated Harris Point California Marine Protected Area. Seabird biologists will continue to evaluate the future of the common murre colony at Prince Island. Partners in this monitoring effort included the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program and the California Institute for Environmental Studies.</p> <p>Common murres are the most frequent avian victims of oil spills on the Pacific coast because of their low reproductive rate and concentrations in major shipping channels. However, murres have suffered major kills on every North American coast during past half century. In the 1988 Nestucca spill, about 30,000 murres were killed off the Washington and British Columbia coasts; in 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska killed many more. Other threats to common murres include over-fishing, gill-netting, and marine climate change. An estimated 70,000 murres were killed in gill nets in California before restrictions were imposed in 1987. Gill-netting continues today in Puget Sound.</p> <p>Pacific coast common murres experienced further heavy declines after the 1983 El Niño event, which caused warmer, less productive ocean environments. Their recovery is complicated by eagle predation and disturbance. Common Murres are highly sensitive to disturbance by humans on foot, in boats, or in planes. Washington colonies are disturbed by low-flying aircraft, especially near military bases. Hastening to fly clear of disturbances, murres knock eggs and chicks out of the nest. Unguarded chicks and eggs are easy prey for gulls and other predators.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"110\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"111\"><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species\">Birds of North America</a></li> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizset=\"112\"><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Eschrichtius robustus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The gray whale is probably the best known of the great whales of the northeastern Pacific and the one most frequently seen in and around Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Owing to its extraordinarily long migration on a coastal route that passes close to large human populations, it is probably the most viewed of any large whale.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Adult Pacific Gray Whales can be 45 feet long and weight up to 33 tons. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales make one of the longest migrations of any mammal--10,000 miles round trip. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Baby gray whales average 15 feet in length and weigh about a ton. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>A mother gray whale's milk is more than 50% fat. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales can live 40 to 60 years. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales were nearly hunted to extinction in the 19th century. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales have been protected from exploitation by the International Whaling Commission since 1946. As a result, current populations are considered close to their pre-exploitation numbers. <sup>3</sup></li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong></p> <p>According to <em>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World</em>\"by Jefferson, T.A., S. Leatherwood, and M.A. Webber, \"Gray whales are easy to identify. They are intermediate in robustness. The upper jaw is moderately arched, and the head is acutely triangular in top view and slopes sharply downward in side view. The flippers are broad and paddle-shaped, with pointed tips. The flukes have smooth S-shaped trailing edges, with a deep median notch. There is a dorsal hump about two thirds of the way back from the snout tip, followed by a series of 6 to 12 smaller \"knuckles\" on the dorsal ridge of the tail stock. There may be several (generally 2 to 5) short, but deep, creases on the throat that allow compression of the throat during feeding. Although young calves are dark charcoal grey, all other gray whales are brownish grey to light grey. They are nearly covered with light blotches and white to orangish patches of whale lice and barnacles, especially on the head and tail. These patches of ectoparasites are very helpful in distinguishing this species. The mouth contains 130 to 180 pairs of yellowish baleen plates, with very coarse bristles. The blow is bushy, heart-shaped when viewed from ahead or behind.\" <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> According to the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, the eastern North Pacific stocks of gray whales spend their summer around the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas between Alaska and Russia. In the winter, many of these gray whales migrate to the warm waters of the west coast of Baja California, Mexico, and the southeastern Gulf of California. .A large numbers of whales, particularly females with newborn calves, utilize coastal lagoons on the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula. There is also a western North Pacific population of gray whales found along the coast of eastern Asia that is totally isolated from the eastern North Pacific population. This western North Pacific population of gray whales, estimated to include fewer than 100 individuals, remains highly depleted and its continued survival is questionable. <sup>7</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales prefers shallow, coastal waters and feeds over oceanic continental shelves around the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas between Alaska and Russia during the summer. 7 During the winter, the Marine Bio Conservation Society states that the gray whales inhabit shallow coastal waters of the eastern and western North Pacific often sighted along the North American Pacific Coast between the arctic and the equatorial lagoons of Baja California, Mexico. The southward journey takes 2-3 months and the whales remain in the lagoons for 2-3 months allowing calves to build up thick layers of blubber for the northward migration. The return trip north takes another 2-3 months and mothers and calves travel very near shore on the northbound migration to avoid their main predators. <sup>8</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The gray whale is unique in the use of its baleen feeding technique as contrasted to other baleen whales.According to the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, \"Gray whales are bottom feeders, and suck sediment and the 'benthic' amphipods that are their prey from the sea floor. To do this, they roll on their sides and swim slowly along, filtering their food through coarse baleen plates, of which they have 130-180 on each side of the upper jaw. In doing so, they often leave long trails of mud behind them, and \"feeding pits\" in the sea floor.\"Whereas, when other baleen whales find a food source, they open their mouths underwater taking in water as well as the prey. The whale then partly shuts its mouth, pressing its tongue against its upper jaw, thus forcing the water to pass out sideways through the baleen, which retains the prey such as krill, a major food source that it then swallows.</p> <p>Gray whales, as described by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), are stated to feed primarily on swarming mysids, commonly called opossum shrimps, tube-dwelling amphipods, and polychaete tube worms in the northern parts of their range, but are also known to take red crabs, baitfish, and other food (crab larvae, mobile amphipods, herring eggs and larvae, cephalopods, and megalops) opportunistically or off the main feeding grounds. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Society of Marine Mammalogy states that gray whale breeding and calving are seasonal and closely synchronized with migration.. Sexual maturity is attained between 6 and 12 years of age. Breeding is highly synchronous, with females coming into estrus during a three-week period from late November to early December, which coincides with the onset of the southward migration. Conception is restricted to a short period between late November and early January. If there is no conception, a second estrus may occur 40 days later when the whales are on the wintering grounds. Females normally reproduce at intervals of two years, producing a single calf every other year.</p> <p>The gestation period is estimated to be 12 to 13 months, with a mean calving date in mid-January. Some calves are born during the southward migration while others are born near or on the wintering grounds of the west coast of Baja California, Mexico, and the southeastern Gulf of California. Calves are weaned and become independent by seven to nine months old while on the summer feeding ground. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the Society of Marine Mammalogy, the population is presently estimated at about 20,000 animals. In contrast, the western gray whale population, which was also decimated by whaling, remains highly depleted today and its continued ability to survive is of concern. The most recent assessment of this population suggests that about 130 individuals exist. 6Based upon a 2008 assessment, by Taylor, B.L. and Notarbartolo di Sciara, G. (Cetacean Red List Authorities) of the ICUN, the gray whale is given a listing of \"Least Concern\" since when the two subpopulations are assessed as a single species-level unit, the estimated population size is above the threshold for a threatened category, and the population has increased over the last three generations. The recent apparent decline in the eastern subpopulation is considered to be a fluctuation and is not inconsistent with a \"Least Concern\" listing. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary: <a href=\"http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/graywhal.html\">http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/graywhal.html</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the <em>World</em>, Jefferson, T.A., S.

The effort to build the fort to serve as an outpost in the Louisiana Purchase territory was led by William Clark, one of the namesake members of the Lewis & Clark Expedition.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{aa907f5b-1bbc-4f58-900f-55522e24783d}{78}\" paraid=\"1127893607\">Thanks to the treaty of 1808, a large swathe of land was made available for the fort’s construction. Per the treaty, the Osage tribe gave up all the land east of a line due south of Fort Osage to the Arkansas River to the Americans in exchange for peaceful trade relations and protection from enemy tribes. Of course, this agreement wasn’t as beneficial for the Osage as they’d hoped. Subsequent treaties continued to carve away at native lands until the tribe was officially removed and sent to a reservation in southern Kansas.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{1d443612-8df5-4abf-becf-392703a4261a}{137}\" paraid=\"65\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Fort Osage remained populated until 1827 when it was abandoned due to the closure of the fort’s factory, ending government trade with the native tribes. As may be expected, the fort quickly fell into disrepair. Then, in 1908, an article published in the Kansas City Star prompted a decades-long effort to reclaim the fort, culminating in it being named a county park in 1941. Reconstruction of the fort was authorized in 1947, and the first Blockhouse was completed in 1948. Construction continued into the 1960s, with Fort Osage officially becoming a historical landmark in 1961. </p> <p paraeid=\"{aa907f5b-1bbc-4f58-900f-55522e24783d}{98}\" paraid=\"68\">Currently operated by Jackson County Parks & Recreation, Fort Osage provides an opportunity for visitors to tour the reconstructed site and experience living history. Each year, the Fort Osage Education Center provides educational programs to thousands of students. For more information, call 816-650-3278 or visit <a href=\"https://fortosagenhs.com/\">https://fortosagenhs.com/</a> </p>",

The expedition’s first introduction to the region was on the evening of Monday, September 24, 1804 when Lewis, Clark and their entourage of 43 men and three boats anchored at the mouth of what is now known as Bad River. This location today is Fischers Lilly Park in Fort Pierre. The consequent days which saw the expedition’s first interaction with the Lakota people, then known as the Teton Sioux, proved contentious. Challenges in communication and differing objectives led to what many believe was the closest the expedition came to ending. We know this today because much of the interaction was recorded in Captain Clark’s journal, including the following excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“and such curiosities as we thought might amuse them; in this we succeeded to well; for after giving them a quarter of a glass of whiskey, which they seemed to like very much, and sucked the bottle dry, it was with much difficulty that we could get rid of them. They at last accompanied Captain Clark on shore in a dugout canoe with five men; but it seems they had formed a design to stop us; for no sooner had the party landed that three of the Indians seized the cable of the dugout canoe, and one of the soldiers of the chief put his arms around the mast; the second chief, who was intoxicated, then said, that we should not go on, that they had not received presents enough from us…” </i></p> </blockquote> <p>Today, visitors can visit Fischers Lilly Park along with the thriving towns of Pierre and Fort Pierre, located on opposite sides of the Missouri River. The area is known for its political significance as capital of the state, high density of museums and historic sites, its plethora of outdoor recreation activities including fishing and water sports on the Missouri River, and hunting and bird watching in the Fort Pierre National Grassland and surroundings. </p>",

It lies at the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers, which unite to form the mighty Missouri River. In addition to preserving the area’s vibrant scenic beauty, the park also memorializes the local history.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{bb60c984-40dc-4b44-ba27-7d2293d8c0ee}{222}\" paraid=\"923395970\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In July 1805, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark of the Corps of Discovery camped in this area. While there, they noted the as being home to the Blackfeet Nation, as well as numerous grizzly bears. They also saw it as being of strategic importance to the United States government and recommended a fort be built along the river. It was also at this location that the Hidatsa tribe captured Lewis and Clark’s native guide, Sacagewea.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{b39c1df0-0a45-491a-bf85-0203d286f077}{10}\" paraid=\"1735800471\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">While a military fort was never built, a group of fur traders from the Missouri Fur Company did establish a makeshift cottonwood structure here known as Fort Three Forks in 1810 with the intent of making it a trading post. Within a few months, however, they abandoned the endeavor after conflicts with the native people. In 1960, the site was designated the Three Forks of the Missouri National Historic Landmark.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{bd67a2b7-d905-4a9a-8129-9b531b1a146e}{64}\" paraid=\"1949356645\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Missouri Headwaters State Park is open year-round. For those looking to stay overnight, there are 17 campsites available, along with tipi rentals. Several foot trails lead to scenic spots and other points of interest. Visitors can also enjoy fishing, canoeing, floating on the river, swimming, bicycling, and picnicking. Interpretive programs are also available. </p> <p paraeid=\"{61d42434-81e2-4d44-9437-975b9bff4ebe}{99}\" paraid=\"30\">For more information on programs, activities, and camping, call (406) 285-3610 or visit <a href=\"http://stateparks.mt.gov/missouri-headwaters/\">http://stateparks.mt.gov/missouri-headwaters/</a>. </p>",

At the time, the Nez Perce resided in the northwestern quarter of what would become the United States of America. In 1863, the village of Lewiston was incorporated as part of the Idaho Territory, just three years after Captain E.D. Pierce found gold in the area. Unfortunately for the Nez Perce, the gold rush that followed forced them into multiple federal treaties that slowly shrunk their territory.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f21914b8-4ffd-421a-a25e-23c8c62b5869}{129}\" paraid=\"70\">Today, the Nez Perce County Historical Museum documents and preserves this history to educate locals and visitors about the multifaceted past of Nez Perce County. The society and museum are managed by its board and operated by employees and volunteers.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Mirounga angustirostris</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The northern elephant seal, <em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>, is the second largest seal in the world. It is surpassed only by its relative the southern elephant seal. Due to its unique body structure, this mammal is an excellent swimmer and diver. Male elephant seals can be easily identified by their large proboscis, which resembles an elephant’s trunk (and is the source of their name). This impressive pinniped relies upon the Channel Islands National Park as an important part of its life cycle. San Miguel, Santa Barbara, and Santa Rosa islands all provide critical habitat. <sup>4, 7</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Populations of northern elephant seals in the U.S. and Mexico are derived from a few hundred individuals. This small group managed to maintain a foothold in Mexico, despite the fact that by the end of the 1800's they were nearly hunted to extinction for their blubber. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>Pups are nursed for about a month and can gain as much as 360 pounds in that time. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>It is estimated that the adult male northern elephant seal can weigh up to 5,000 pounds. The female, on the other hand, weighs about a third of the male, which is a dramatic example of sexual dimorphism, or physical size difference between the sexes of a species. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>Northern elephant seals dive almost continuously during the 6 to 8 months they spend at sea. They dive to depths of 300-800 meters and dives can last up to 2 hours. The deepest dive recorded was over a mile. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>Great white sharks and killer whales prey on northern elephant seals. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Elephant seals are the only known animals capable of filling collapsed lungs. Their lungs collapse during dives. The surfactant/lubricant responsible for this ability is being researched at the Scripps Institute in San Diego for the potential benefit to premature human babies with lung problems. <sup>3</sup></li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals are large and imposing, with significant differences in size and shape between sexes (sexual dimorphism). In both sexes, the body is long and robust, and the neck very thick. Adult males may grow to over 13 feet in length and weigh up to 5,000 pounds while females are smaller, growing up to 10 feet and weighing up to 1,700 pounds.</p> <p>Mature adult males have an unmistakable large and fleshy appendage on their snout called a proboscis. The proboscis is inflatable;when relaxed, it hangs down in front of the mouth and when inflated, it resembles the trunk of an elephant and is the origin of the species' common name. Males begin developing this enlarged nose, or proboscis, at sexual maturity (about three to five years of age) and it is fully developed by seven to nine years.</p> <p>Northern elephant seals are uniformly grey, tan, or brown but color generally begins to fade after the annual molt. Many bulls become pale in the face, proboscis, and head with increasing age. The chest shield, proboscis, and certain areas of the face are often pink. Pups are born with a woolly black lanugo (downy hair) that is shed at about 3 weeks of age to reveal a silver-grey coat, similar to that of adults at about the time of weaning (28 days). Within a year, the coat will turn silvery brown. <sup>1, 7</sup></p> <p>Northern elephant seals are in the family <em>Phocidae,</em> the true seals. They lack external ear flaps and move on land by flopping on their bellies.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals are found in the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of Alaska down to Baja California. Males and females make separate biannual foraging migrations. Males journey north to the Aleutian Islands and the Gulf of Alaska, whereas females travel further west to the open ocean. The total linear distance migrated by these animals each year has been recorded at 12,800 miles. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> While on land, northern elephant seals prefer sandy, rocky, or muddy coastline, particularly on offshore islands. They typically aggregate in large groups while on land. These animals spend only 10% of their time on land, returning to reproduce and molt. The other 90% is spent in the water, diving and foraging for food, with only 11% of this time spent at the surface. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals spend 90% of their lives in the water in order to feed. During their foraging migrations, they dive into the water repeatedly and continuously to find food, never stopping to rest or sleep for months at a time. Northern elephant seals are exceptional divers.—sometimes diving deeper than 4900 feet and remaining submerged for 1-2 hours. Males feed near the eastern Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska, and females feed further south, in the offshore waters of Washington and Oregon. The species eat squid, octopus, Pacific hake and other boney fishes, various cartilaginous fishes, and jawless fishes. Females feed on squid in the mesopelagic zone, which is below 650 feet it is surmised to avoid their predators.Males do not feed during breeding season. <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The breeding season occurs from December through March. Each winter elephant seals arrive at their breeding beaches in Mexico and California. Males are the first to arrive, and they fight each other to establish dominance. During this time, dominant males will often inflate their noses and produce a noise that sounds like a drum to warn lesser males away. Females soon arrive and associate with dominant males. Several days after coming onto the beaches, the females give birth to the pups they have been carrying since last year. Pups weigh 75 pounds or more and are about four feet in length. The pups nurse for about 28 days, generally gaining about 10 pounds a day. At this time females will mate with one or more of the dominant males and then return to sea. For the next two months, weaned pups, called \"weaners<ins cite=\"mailto:Douglas%20Simpson\" datetime=\"2013-07-24T08:48\">\"</ins><del cite=\"mailto:Douglas%20Simpson\" datetime=\"2013-07-24T08:48\">,\"</del>remain on rookery beaches, venturing into the water for short periods of time, perfecting their swimming and feeding abilities. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals are not presently endangered. At one time, however, this species was thought to have been hunted to extinction. They were presumed extinct by the 1880's, after being exploited by hunters and whalers seeking to use the animals' thick layer of blubber as an oil source. A few animals were then discovered in 1892 which were captured and killed for scientific study. Eventually, it was discovered that a population of about 20 to 100 individuals had survived. Studies have shown that all individuals of the current population, which has grown to over 170,000, are relatives of these few survivors. The population bottleneck that occurred during this time is of concern because genetic variation is reduced, creating the possibility for the population to be vulnerable to disease or reproductive failure. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>Based upon a 2009 assessment, the current population is 170,000 and is growing. The population is renowned for its remarkable growth during the 20th century, following virtual annihilation by sealers in the 19th century. In 2005, 42,589 pups were counted, an increase of 14,699 (53%) over the number observed in 1991. Total population size increased at a rate of 3% from 1991 to 2005. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>As stated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is the world's main authority on the conservation status of species, the northern elephant seal has recovered from near extinction and population growth and is expected to continue over the coming decades. Due to its large and increasing population, expanding range and lack of foreseeable threats, the northern elephant seal is classified as Least Concern. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-elephant-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-elephant-seal/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Mirounga_angustirostris/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Mirounga_angustirostris/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328640/details\">http://eol.org/pages/328640/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=49\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=49</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_elephant_seal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_elephant_seal</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13581/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13581/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/nelephant.php\">http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/nelephant.php</a></li> <li>Marine Mammals of the World ID guide, Jefferson, Leatherwood and Webber</li> </ol>",

San Miguel Island is now one of three American northern fur seal colonies and the southernmost breeding colony in the world. The first seals to arrive had flipper tags identifying them as being from the Pribilof or Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. Today the San Miguel colony numbers around 10,000 animals. 4 The northern fur seal's scientific name <em>Callorhinus ursinus</em> means \"bear-like,\" which reflects \"sea bear,\" the name originally given them by Europeans. Their common name alludes to the thick coat that is needed by the species for protection from the cold weather and frigid waters found in both their feeding grounds and the majority of their breeding grounds.<sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>A Northern fur seal bull will defend territory against any intruders including other bulls and even humans.<sup>5</sup></li> <li>Northern fur seal bulls can be more than 4.5 times heavier than adult females. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Northern fur seals can spend extremely long periods in the open ocean. Before returning to the breeding colonies, many pups will remain at sea for up to 22 months. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>The northern fur seal has 300,000 hairs per square inch. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>A northern fur seal mother finds her pup by listening for its distinctive voice. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Northern fur seals feed mainly at night, when prey species are closer to the ocean surface. <sup>5</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Beginning at birth, males are much larger than females. Adult females and sub-adults are moderate in build. Sexes are difficult to distinguish until about age 5. The neck, chest, and shoulders of adult males are greatly enlarged over those of females and sub-adults, although at the end of the breeding season males may be thin to the point of emaciation. Male pups weigh 12 pounds and grow to 385-605 pounds and seven feet in length. In comparison, female pups only weigh 10 pounds and grow to 66-110 pounds and 4.5 feet in length. <p>Adult females and sub-adults are medium to dark silver-grey above. The flanks, chest, sides, and underside of the neck are cream to tan. There are variable cream to tan colored areas on the sides and top of the muzzle, chin, and as a \"brush stroke\" running backwards under the eye. The fur of the outer part of the ear near the naked tip and the insertion is often pale. Adult males are medium grey to black, or reddish to dark brown all over. Adult males also have gray hair on the backs of their necks. The mane can have variable amounts of silver-grey or yellowish tinting on the guard hairs. Pups are born with a black pelt, which becomes dark brown with lighter coloration on the chest and belly. After 3 to 4 months, pups molt to adult female or sub-adult male coloring.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>The head of northern fur seals looks deceptively small because of the very short down-curved muzzle and small nose. The nose extends slightly beyond the mouth in females and moderately in males. Fur is absent on the top of the fore flipper and there is an abrupt look of a \"clean shaven line\" across the wrist. The hind flippers are about one-fourth of the total body length, the longest in any eared seal; they have extremely long, cartilaginous terminal flaps on all of the toes, beyond the position of the nails on the 3 central digits. <sup>6,7</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The full range of the northern fur seal extends throughout the Pacific rim from Japan to the Channel Islands of California, although the main breeding colonies are in the Pribilof and Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. Smaller breeding grounds exist on the Kuril Islands North of Japan, Robben Island in the Sea of Okhotsk, and on San Miguel Island. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Northern fur seals are pelagic, spending most of their lives in the open ocean and only using certain offshore islands for pupping and breeding. They rarely come ashore except to breed or pup and are almost never seen on mainland beaches unless they are sick. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Northern fur seal diet is well known from their range in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. They are carnivores that feed primarily at night without chewing their food;they swallow it whole or in large chunks. Northern fur seals eat a wide variety of small schooling fishes and squids. Diet composition varies between the six major breeding islands and changes during their annual migration. Sixty-three species of fishes and squids have been identified as part of the northern fur seal diet throughout their range. In the Bering Sea, northern fur seals primarily consume walleye pollock, squid, salmon, Pacific sandlance, northern smooth tongue, and Pacific herring. Between Alaska and California the primary prey species are northern anchovy, Pacific herring, squid, capelin, Pacific sandlance, Pacific whiting, salmon, Pacific saury, and various species of rockfish. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Northern fur seals often return to the rookery of their birth. Adult males establish territories in late May to early June and aggressively guard and herd 40 or more females. Pregnant females arrive at the rookeries in June and give birth one or two days later to a single pup. . The initial bonding of the female and pup is crucial;the female and pup must learn to recognize each other's smell and \"voice\" in order to find each other in the rookery after long periods of separation. Once the female and pup have bonded and nursed for 5-10 days, the female comes into estrus and is ready to mate once more, usually with the male in whose territory she gave birth.</p> <p>Once they have mated, females returns to the ocean for their first feeding trip after fasting for up to 10 days. During the next four months, nursing females make repeated trips to sea to feed, spending 7 to 10 days at sea and returning to land to spend time nursing their pups. Females deliver fat-rich milk to their pups, which depend on their mother for food until they are approximately 4 months old. Females, juveniles of both sexes, and pups begin to leave the islands in October to migrate south for the winter. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The northern fur seal is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species as Vulnerable. Referring to the population of animals in the Pribilof Islands, the IUCN states that \"[they have] experienced a significant, steep decline in recent years and [have] failed to recover despite the cessation of commercial harvesting. Although the global population is still over a million animals, the current downward trend in abundance remains a mystery.\" <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>http:// <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/northernfurseal.htm\">www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/northernfurseal.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-fur-seal\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-fur-seal</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3590/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3590/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_Island\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_Island</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/northfs.php\">http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/northfs.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_fur_seal\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_fur_seal</a></li> <li>Marine mammals of the world, Jefferson, T.A., S.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Sceloporus occidentalis becki</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island fence lizard, <em>Sceloporus occidentalis becki</em>, is endemic to the Channel Islands of California. It is found on the three most northerly islands in the national park. Although it is a distinct sub-species, it is physically similar in appearance to various mainland sub-species of the western fence lizard, which is one of the most common lizards in California. This species is sometimes called the \"blue belly lizard\", due to the vivid blue coloration seen on the abdomen of the adult male of the species.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Many authorities have already accepted research that concludes that <em>Sceloporus occidentalis becki</em>, the island fence lizard, is a unique species. However, since this conflicts with current taxonomy, the taxonomy of the entire species is likely to be revised in the future.</li> <li>A protein in the blood of the island fence lizard kills the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.</li> <li>The island fence lizard's tail detaches easily to distract a potential predator.</li> <li>Males defend their territory and try to attract females with head-bobbing and a push-up display that exposes the blue throat and ventral colors.</li> <li>Generally, fence lizards are active when temperatures are warm, and are inactive during periods of extreme heat or cold. However, the mild temperatures of the Channel Islands allow the island fence lizard to be active all year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island fence lizard is a fairly small lizard with keeled and pointed dorsal scales of equal size on the back, sides, and belly. Scales on the backs of the thighs are mostly keeled, and abruptly smaller, and the rear of the limbs is yellow or orange. The sides of the belly are blue. Color is brown, gray, or black with blotches. Sometimes light markings on the sides of the backs form stripes or irregular lines, and sometimes dark blotching may form irregular bands. The belly is light in color. Males have blue markings on the sides of the belly edged in black, a black patch on the throat, enlarged postanals, and a swollen tail base. Some scales on the back become blue or greenish when a lizard is in the light phase. Females have faint or absent blue markings on the belly, no blue or green color on the upper surfaces, and dark bars or crescents on the back. Juveniles have little or no blue on the throat and faint blue belly markings or none at all.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The island fence lizard is endemic to Channel Islands National Park's three northerly islands, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The island fence lizard prefers open sunny areas, including stream banks, beach driftwood, grassy hillsides, and human settlements. It can be seen in the early morning sunning on rocks, logs and on fences; the latter giving rise to its common name.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The island fence lizard eats small invertebrates such as crickets, spiders, ticks, and scorpions, and occasionally eats small lizards, which includes its species.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The island fence lizard mates in the spring. The female lays one to three clutches of eggs numbering from three to seventeen eggs from April to July. The eggs hatch in about 60 days, from July to September.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> This species is not included on the state's Special Animals List, which indicates that there are no significant conservation concerns for it in California. The World Conservation Union - IUCN Red List does not have the species listed. Additionally, the island fence lizard is regularly monitored to ensure its health and viability in the park. Annual monitoring in the park ensures that conservation issues for this species will be detected in adequate time for proper management.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/s.o.becki.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/s.o.becki.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=55037\">http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=55037</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/data_objects/14843145#cite_ref-ReferenceA_2\">http://eol.org/data_objects/14843145#cite_ref-ReferenceA_2</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/fieldguide/herps/scel-occ.html\">http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/fieldguide/herps/scel-occ.html</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></p> <p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Urocyon littoralis</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island fox only lives on six of the eight Channel Islands off the coast of southern California--they are found nowhere else on Earth. Each island population is recognized as a separate endemic or unique subspecies.<br /> <br /> The island fox, a descendant of the mainland gray fox, is the largest of the Channel Islands' native mammals, but one of the smallest canid species in the world.<br /> <br /> Although foxes have always existed at low population sizes, four island fox subspecies underwent catastrophic declines in the 1990s. On San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands at Channel Islands National Park, the decline was attributed to predation by golden eagles. The presence of non-native ungulates as a food source in addition to the DDT-caused decline of bald eagles, a natural competitor, facilitated the establishment of golden eagles as resident breeders on the islands. By 2000, predation on island foxes resulted in population declines to 15 individuals on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, and less than 80 on Santa Cruz Island. In 2004, each of the park's island fox subspecies were federally listed as endangered.<br /> <br /> In 1999, Channel Islands National Park began an island fox recovery program that included captive breeding and reintroduction of foxes, removal of resident golden eagles, re-establishment of bald eagles, and removal of non-native ungulates. This coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Today, the population has recovered within the park. Population trend and annual survival are currently monitored to ensure that recovery continues and future threats to the park's island fox subspecies are identified.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>It is the only carnivore unique to California.</li> <li>Although the island fox is one of the smallest canids in the world, it is the largest native terrestrial mammal on the Channel Islands.</li> <li>The island fox is one-third smaller than its mainland ancestor, the gray fox. At 12 to 13 inches in height and 4 to 5 pounds, the island fox is about the size of a housecat.</li> <li>Some individuals have been known to live up to 15 years.</li> <li>Unlike nocturnal gray foxes, which hunt exclusively at night to avoid predators, island foxes have no natural predators, allowing them to be active duringdaylight hours with peaks in activity occurring at dusk and dawn.</li> <li>Visually, island foxes show signs of dominance or submission through facial expressions and body posture.</li> <li>They communicate by barking and sometimes growling.</li> <li>Their keen sense of smell plays an important role in the marking of territories. Island foxes are known to scent-mark their territories with a few drops of urine and tend to concentrate scats in particular areas, often conspicuously positioned on well-traveled paths.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Appearance</strong></p> <p>The island fox is one third smaller than its mainland ancestor the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size.</p> <p>The island fox has similar markings to the gray fox. They have gray coloring on the back, rust coloring on the sides,and white underneath. The face has a distinctive black, white, and rufous-colored patterns.</p> <p>On each of the six islands, a different subspecies occurs, distinguished by both genetic and physical differences. For example, San Miguel Island foxes have shorter tails, due to one less tail vertebra, and longer noses than the other island foxes.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Range</strong></p> <p>The island fox is found on six of the islands in the Southern California bight, including the three largest islands in the Channel Islands National Park (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands). The other three islands which island foxes inhabit San Nicolas and San Clemente, owned by the US Navy, and popular Santa Catalina Island, which in large part is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy.</p> <p>Older research on the island fox dated them back on the northern Channel Islands to 10,400 to 16,000 years ago. Yet, geologists believe the northern Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland. The most plausible and accepted theory for foxes crossing the water barrier of the Santa Barbara Channel is one of \"rafting.\" During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today's. The channel between the islands and mainland narrowed, perhaps to just four to five miles across. The northern islands became one large island we call Santarosae. The gray fox could have rafted on debris propelled by storms and/or currents. As the climate warmed and the ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae became the islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel. Due to the lack of a fresh water source, the foxes did not persist on Anacapa, but the other three islands had suitable habitat for foxes.</p> <p>Recent archeological work, however, only dates the oldest island fox fossil at about 6,000 years before present, which is several thousand years after native people populated the island. This raises the possibility that gray foxes were brought to the islands by humans, and rapidly evolved into a smaller, separate species after that.</p> <p>Island foxes brought to the southern Channel Islands of Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente by the Chumash native people who traded with the Gabrielino people of the southern islands. The Chumash considered the fox to be a sacred animal--a pet of the sun, and possibly a dream helper. The island Chumash performed a fox dance and probably used the pelts of foxes to make articles like arrow quivers, capes, and headdresses.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong></p> <p>The climate of the California Channel Islands is semi-arid, and though rainfall amounts differ among islands the average rainfall across all islands is less than six inches per year. The native island vegetation is mostly coastal scrub, but these habitats have been heavily modified by the effects of introduced grazing animals and other human impacts. The northern islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz) have significant areas dominated by non-native plant species, such as annual grasses and iceplant, whereas the southern islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas) have greater development impacts such as the naval bases and the town of Avalon. The larger islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente) also have perennial streams that support riparian vegetation and tree species. Foxes are found in most of these habitats on these islands, but they prefer shrubby or wooded areas such as chaparral, coastal scrub and oak woodlands.</p> <p>Island foxes give birth to their young in simple dens, which are usually not excavated by the foxes themselves. By two months of age, young spend most of the day outside the den and will remain with their parents throughout the summer. Some pups disperse away from their natal territories by winter, although others may stay on their natal territories into their second year.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong></p> <p>Island fox diets vary based upon food item diversity of the individual islands. On San Rosa Island, where food item diversity is high, deer mice, Jerusalem crickets, beetles, and earwigs are the preferred food. On other Channel Islands, diets include plant items such as fruits from cactus, manzanita, saltbushes and seafigs, as well as insects and deer mice when they are present. Occasionally, foxes forage along the shoreline for crabs and other marine invertebrates.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproduction</strong></p> <p>Island foxes are generally monogamous (mate for life), and breed only once a year. Pairs are seen together frequently beginning in January, and mating takes place in late February to early March. The gestation period is thought to be similar to the gray fox, which is around 52 days, and pups are born from late April through early May. Litter size ranges from one to as many as five pups, but two or three is considered average. Born in the protection of a den, pups are blind and helpless with short dark brown hair at birth. They emerge from the den at about one month of age, much furrier but still considerably darker than adults. They begin to resemble their parents by late summer.</p> <p>It is believed that island fox pups undergo a period of extended parental care. In a recent study of island foxes, scientists found adults and pups in the same trap on 22 occasions. In 24 traps containing only pups, they found killed mice and other prey items outside the traps, apparently left by the parents for their young. As with most wild canids, males play an important role in the rearing of young.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Conservation Status</strong></p> <p>The island fox, which only a short time ago was on the brink of extinction, provides an instructive example of how a coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Additional information about the strategies developed and implemented to reverse this situation may be found at <a href=\"http://www1.islandfox.org/p/about-island-fox.html\">Island Fox Conservation</a>.</p> <p>Due to these successful efforts, the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species now lists the island fox as near threatened.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf\">http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.islandfox.org/\">http://www.islandfox.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm\">http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm</a></li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong><u>The Decline of the Island Fox</u></strong></p> <p><strong>The Warning Provided by Monitoring</strong><br /> From 1993 to 1999 the National Park Service monitored the population of island foxes on San Miguel Island. Each summer, foxes were trapped and tagged. When each fox was first captured, it was implanted with a device about the size of a grain of rice called a passive integrated transponder tag, or \"PIT\" tag. The tag gives each fox a permanent, unique number that can be read with a special scanner and allows scientists to monitor individual foxes over the years.</p> <p>Park biologists estimated there to be over 400 foxes on San Miguel in 1994, but by 1995, an alarming decline had begun. With each passing year, fewer foxes were trapped in the monitoring grids. At the same time, rangers and visitors reported seeing fewer live foxes and more fox skeletons and carcasses. By 1998, the San Miguel population was down to a few dozen. Island fox populations on all three islands were naturally small and had historically fluctuated, but as far as was known had never been as low as they were during this period and had never come close to extinction.</p> <p>In fall 1998, National Park Service biologists initiated a radio telemetry study of island foxes on San Miguel Island to determine causes of mortality. Of 15 radio collared foxes tracked from 1998 to 1999, 5 were believed to be killed by golden eagles and 2 died of other causes. This confirmed the results of an earlier study on Santa Cruz Island where golden eagle predation was identified as the cause of death for 21 of 29 fox carcasses. Golden eagle predation was unprecedented, and was considered unnatural because golden eagles had not previously bred on the islands and were, until this time, rarely observed.</p> <p>Similar declines occurred simultaneously in the island fox populations on neighboring Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands Fox mortality rates due to predation were so high that by 1999 the San Miguel and Santa Rosa fox subspecies were nearing extinction; on each of those islands total abundance had declined from approximately 450 and 1,500, respectively, to 15.</p> <p><strong>Eliminating the Major Cause for Decline</strong><br /> While the threat of critically low island fox population size could conceivably be improved through captive breeding and reintroduction, such efforts would be futile unless the threat from golden eagles was eliminated. Historically, the native bald eagle most likely deterred golden eagles from exploiting the Channel Islands as a food source. Golden eagle did not colonize the islands until their larger fish-eating relatives were wiped out by DDT, hunting, and egg collection. With the golden eagle's sharp talons, swiftness of flight, and 4 times the body mass of a fox, they easily preyed upon the vulnerable fox.</p> <p>Interestingly, the first documented decline on San Miguel in 1995 coincided with the first golden eagle sightings on the island. Golden eagles had been live-captured and relocated from some areas in western North America to reduce depredation on livestock and it was surmised that similar translocation methods could be used to golden eagles from the Channel Islands. In late 1999 the National Park began working with its partners to relocate golden eagles to the mainland. Golden eagles nested on both Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands from the mid-1990s to as recently as 2006.</p> <p>In order to mitigate golden eagle predation on island foxes, The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, with the support of the Park Service and The Nature Conservancy, trapped and relocated a total of 44 golden eagles, including 10 eaglets born on the islands to distant sites in northeastern California. Monitoring indicated that , none returned to the islands.5 Today the occasional golden eagle visits the islands, but the level of predation on island foxes is negligible; all three island fox subspecies in the park are recovering rapidly.</p> <p><strong>Additional Threats</strong><br /> Predation by golden eagles was the primary mortality factor for foxes on the northern Channel Islands, but there were other threats as well. Introduced diseases or parasites could conceivably devastate island fox populations. In 1999-2000, on privately-owned Santa Catalina Island, about 90% of the fox population was recently lost due to canine distemper virus.</p> <p>Due to their insular existence, island foxes have no built up immunity to parasites and diseases brought in from the mainland and are especially vulnerable to those a domestic dog might be carrying. In addition, it is extremely difficult to vaccinate against or treat foxes for these parasites and diseases in the wild. For this reason, pets are not permitted in Channel Islands National Park.</p> <p><strong>Eliminating Other Factors Contributing to the Decline</strong><br /> Domestic pigs had been brought to Santa Cruz Island in the mid-1800s as a food source, and subsequently became feral. By the mid-1990s the thousands of feral pigs on the island became a factor in the decline of island foxes. Golden eagles were able to successfully colonize the island, and begin breeding, because of the availability of piglets.</p> <p>Simply relocating the existing golden eagles would not assure island fox recovery. With the substantial prey base provided by island pigs, dispersing golden eagles would continue to breed on the island. It would therefore be necessary to implement longer-term actions that would prevent sustained use of the islands by golden eagles. This resulted in a strategy that would require the removal of the feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island beginning in 2004, in a project implemented by the NPS and The Nature Conservancy, its partner in management of Santa Cruz Island. By 2006, no pigs remained on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>In a similar manner, introduced mule deer supported golden eagle breeding on neighboring Santa Rosa Island. Deer and elk on that island were to be phased out as part of an agreement between NPS and the former owners of the island, and by 2012 non-native ungulates had been all but eliminated on Santa Rosa Island.<br />  </p> <p><strong><u>The Restoration of the Island Fox</u></strong></p> <p><strong>The Captive Breeding Program</strong><br /> Captive breeding was a necessary - and ultimately successful - recovery action for island foxes, and it also provided an opportunity to study island fox reproductive biology, which was previously unknown. When foxes were first brought into captivity on San Miguel Island just before the 2000 breeding season, mated pairs were established by placing together males and females that appeared likely to have been paired in the wild, based on information available at capture. Because there were more females than males, some females were housed together.</p> <p>In subsequent years as pups were born and reached maturity, they were assigned mates based on a computer program designed to prevent inbreeding in small populations, such as the fox, and maximize genetic heterozygosity (lack of similarity).</p> <p>The success of the island fox breeding program is evident in data given in the 2011 Island Fox Meeting Report. Considering the northern Channel Islands exclusively, numbers that include pups are as follows: Santa Cruz, 1302; San Miguel, 516; Santa Rosa, 292.</p> <p>As a result of research conducted during the captive breeding period, we now know that island foxes have induced estrus and ovulation, which is unique among canids and may be related to other distinctive features of their mating system. Island foxes differ substantially from wolves, the species perhaps best known for its complex social system, strong pair bonds, and solicitous parental care. All the canid species appear to be socially monogamous, but from there they diverge in terms of group size, degree of sociality, and age of dispersal of young. For example, male aggression toward females - something that appeared rather common even in the reproductively successful island foxes - is virtually unknown for other canid species, in which males tend to be very solicitous to females, especially during estrus and pregnancy. However, it is unclear whether this behavior is characteristic of free-ranging island foxes or merely an artifact of captive conditions. In another contrast with other canids, the reproductive rate was lower for captive-born island foxes, the opposite of what is usually observed in other canid species. This suggests that something, such as social experience during the juvenile period, might have been missing in the captive environment, something that apparently is less important to other canid species.</p> <p><strong>Reintroduction of the Bald Eagle</strong><br /> The process of bringing back the bald eagle to the northern Channel Islands led authorities to believe that they might prove to be a natural deterrent to the colonization of the golden eagle. In 2006 a bald eagle was observed escorting a golden eagle out of its territory on Santa Rosa Island. Newly released bald eagles were also seen chasing golden eagles off of a carcass provided for them. Historical evidence and studies have shown that the natural bald eagle food sources are marine fishes, seabirds and pinniped carcasses, suggesting that bald eagles pose little threat to the island fox.</p> <p>From 2002-2006, the Institute for Wildlife Studies (IWS) released 61 bald eagles on Santa Cruz Island. In 2006, the first known nesting attempts occurred in the northern Channel Islands. Two pairs of eagles successfully fledged one chick each from nest at Pelican Harbor and Malva Real on Santa Cruz Island. Since 2006, there have been successful hatchings and Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands. As of 2012 there are over 50 bald eagles on the California Channel Islands and over 30 known eagles on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Encouraging Native Plants</strong><br /> Island foxes evolved in an environment thick with native shrubs that later dwindled after the introduction of livestock grazing. Without shrubs for hiding cover, the foxes were especially easy for the golden eagles to catch. Today, the removal of nonnative grazers is showing astonishing results. Lush shrubs and wildflowers are coming back. Restoring the island's vegetation benefits the foxes and all native wildlife.</p> <p><strong>An Ecosystem Solution</strong><br /> Without the ecosystem-level changes of pig removal and bald eagle restoration, fox recovery was not assured. That those two ecosystem level actions were implemented in conjunction with island fox recovery actions was fortuitous. The two actions had been planned and funded separately from island fox recovery, but the value of those planned actions to island fox conservation was recognized when the complicated relationship among foxes, pigs, and eagles became apparent. The success of those ecosystem-level actions was facilitated by the islands' isolation and their limited, more defined ecosystems: once pigs were removed from the islands, there was little chance of them returning. The success of these ecosystem-level actions for island fox conservation underscores the importance of considering ecosystem-wide conditions in endangered species management.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>The Current Status of the Island Fox</u></strong><br /> An affiliated group of management agencies, landowners, academics, and non-profits concerned with the conservation of the island fox has convened since 1999 to exchange information regarding the status and trend of the six island fox subspecies, and to work cooperatively on island fox conservations issues in such areas as captive breeding, wild population management, veterinary issues, and educational/outreach. In the most recent 2011 meeting of this group, the Island Fox Working Group, data was presented that indicated that 4 of the 6 island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) subspecies were stable or increasing, with high survival, though island foxes still face potential threats from pathogens and predation.<br /> <br /> <strong>Current Status on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> <em>Recovered.</em> Captive breeding ended in 2008 for the Santa Cruz Island Fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis santacruzae</em>) and all foxes were returned to the wild. Survival remains very high, and the populaiotn has increased steadily. Some areas now show less increase (fewer pups) as the population nears historic density.<br /> <br /> <strong>Current Status on Santa Rosa Island</strong><br /> <em>Recovered.</em> Captive breeding continued for the Santa Rosa Island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis santarosae</em>) until 2008 when all foxes were returned to the wild.The annual survival rate climbed to 90% in 2007-2009, but the incidental arrival of three juvenile golden eagles in spring 2010 caused survival to dip in that year. Since then survival has climbed above 90% and the fox population continues to increase.<br /> <br /> <strong>Current Status on San Miguel Island</strong><br /> <em>Recovered.</em> Captive breeding continued for the San Miguel Island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis littoralis</em>) until 2007 and all foxes were returned to the wild. The population continues to increase by about 25% per year with a high annual fox survival rate, 90%. As of 2011 the population had reach pre-decline levels (close to 400 adults) and can be considered biologically recovered. As the population has reached known historical levels, biologists are watching to see how the population stabilizes. Monitoring foxes via radio telemetry collars has also provided early identification of predation or disease threats. Annual vaccination of 60 - 100 individual foxes is protecting a larger potential survivor group in the event of introduced rabies or distemper virus.<br /> <br /> <strong>Future Prospects of Threats to Species</strong><br /> The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species still lists the Island Fox as critically endangered as of a 2008 assessment. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will likely release a draft island fox recovery plan in 2012. Monitoring and mitigation of known threats (eagle predation and canine disease) will be a prominent recovery action in the plan. Island foxes may be vulnerable to impacts of future global climate change. Such impact could be direct, such as changes in acceptable temperature ranges, or indirect, such as impacts on floral or faunal food sources for the fox. Alternatively, global climate change may affect the distribution or virulence of pathogens, such as bacteria or parasites.</p>",

Therefore, they have very small, overlapping home ranges.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island night lizard is a medium-sized lizard, with adults ranging from 2 ¾ to 4 inches in body length. It is endemic to the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California where it occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. Both the color and pattern of the back of adult island night lizards are highly variable. Though these patterns grade into one another, there are serveral distinct types of which the mottled pattern is the most common (44% of the lizards). Less frequent patterns include plain, blotched, striped, broken stripes, ocellated, and finely mottled. Lichen-covered rocks and ground which make up their habitat and appear to provide good camouflage. Such cryptic coloration is oftern associated with the sort of sedentary lifestyle that the lizards have. However, the variety of colors and patterns present among the lizards is unusual. Few other terrestrial vertebrates show the marked color and pattern differences seen in island night lizards. In those that do, it is generally seen as geographic variation over a comparatively large range.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Island night lizards are an endemic Channel Islands reptile, known only to occur on Santa Barbara Island in the park and on San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. They are the most morphologically distinct of the endemic vertebrates on the Channel Islands, indicating they have been isolated from the mainland for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The island night lizard is veru very secretive, preferring habitats with dense vegetation cover, such as boxthorn and prickly pear cactus, as well as cracks and crevices in and around rock outcrops and surface boulders. These areas provide protection from predators. They are also often found under rocks, driftwood, and fallen branches. Suitable habitat on Santa Barbara is in all of the canyons and on some of the sea cliffs, especially on the south side of Signal Peak. Island night lizards are very sedentary and have very small home ranges, averaging about 183 square feet.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Island night lizards feed on a wide variety of terrestrial spiders and insects, but they also eat an unusually large amount of plant material for a small lizard. Common animal food items include ground-dwelling spiders, pillbugs, a ground beetle (Amara sp.), moth larvae, and ants. Common plant food items include fruits of Australian saltbush, flowers, fruits and leaves of boxthorn, fruits of iceplant, and composite (Asteraceae) flower parts.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Night lizards have a low reproductive rate compared with other lizards, likely because they are so long-lived. Only about half of the adult females bear young in a given year and a female may not have her first brood until she is nearly five years old. Seasonal activity peaks in the spring when mating takes place, then continues at a lower level through the summer and fall. Island night lizards breed in April, and 2 - 9 young are born fully developed in September. Giving birth to live young (as opposed to laying eggs) is not common among reptiles. Young of the year are active throughout the year, while adults are active primarily during the spring and summer.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The island night lizard is listed as Threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, due to habitat alteration and predation resulting from introduction of alien species (e.g., feral cats, goats, pigs, and rabbits). However, according to the Channel Islands Species Recovery Plan of 1984, habitat on the islands \"probably has not been altered to the detriment of the [island night] lizards by grazing mammals\". Goats and pigs have recently been removed from San Clemente Island. Today, the island night lizard is not thought to be in imminent danger of extinction, and could be a candidate for delisting. Santa Barbara Island is part of the Channel Islands National Park. The entire island of San Clemente, used for military training, has been designated as Critical Habitat.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.werc.usgs.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectID=148\">USGS WERC Projects - Island Night Lizard Population Ecology on the Channel Islands</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20-%202007\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20%20-%202007</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Spilogale gracilis amphiala</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island spotted skunk is endemic to the two largest California Channel Islands, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa. Unlike the island fox and the island deer mouse, the island spotted skunk shows little differentiation between the two islands as well as the mainland subspecies, suggesting recent colonization of the species. In recent times, the species was limited in numbers. However, island spotted skunk populations on both islands began increasing in the late 1990s, coincident with the decline in island foxes caused by golden eagle predation. As the only two terrestrial carnivores on the islands, skunks and foxes are natural competitors.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Island spotted skunks on the two islands differ only slightly, with those on Santa Rosa spotted skunk being slightly longer than those on Santa Cruz.</li> <li>Island spotted skunks are only about a third as large as their competitor, the island fox.</li> <li>They are more carnivorous than foxes, and more nocturnal. However, their diet became a little more omnivorous in the absence of the fox, during the late 1990s.</li> <li>Skunks may live only one to two years in the wild.</li> <li>Historically, skunks have been classified as a subfamily in the weasel family, the Mustelidae. Recent genetic data has resulted in skunks being reclassified into its own family, <em>Spilogale</em>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island spotted skunk can be identified by its complex pattern of white markings on a blackbackground consisting of four to six broken white stripes, a triangular white forehead patch, a series of shorter white stripes resembling spots, and white on part of the abdominal surface and tip of the tail.</p> <p>It is distinguished from spotted skunk subspecies on the mainland by its shorter tail and less white abdominal coloration, slightly larger size, broader skull, and proportionately less white and blacker in the fur. Like the mainland subspecies, the island spotted skunks exhibit sexual size differences, with males averaging 28% larger than females. This skunk is considerably smaller than striped skunks on the mainland and has softer, glossier fur.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Channel Islands spotted skunks currently occur only on Santa Cruz and Santa RosaIslands where they are widely distributed. Spotted skunks occurred on San Miguel Island, probably until the late nineteenth century. Fossil material has been collected on San Miguel Island and a spotted skunk was reportedly collected from San Miguel Island sometime during the 1870s. However, there have been no records of skunks on San Miguel since then.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands show habitat preferences similar to those reportedfor the mainland subspecies. Based on radio telemetry studies, spotted skunks on Santa Cruz Island showed a preference for chaparral-grassland, open grassland, fennel-grassland, and ravines. On Santa Rosa Island, spotted skunks were found to be associated with rocky canyon slopes, cactus patches, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, open woodland, other scrub-grassland communities, and riparian habitat along streams. On both islands, the species has also been recorded in or under human dwellings and ranch outbuildings. The elevational range of the Channel Islands spotted skunk extends from sea level to approximately 2000 feet.</p> <p>Channel Islands spotted skunks are nocturnal. Activity begins at dusk, peaks during the early evening, and continues intermittently until dawn. On Santa Cruz Island, spotted skunks nest in cavities, burrows, and other natural crevices, as they do on the mainland. Dens are constructed in roots and earth under shrubs, cavities in rocks, open grassy areas, road cuts, human-made structures, and trunks and roots of oaks. Individuals use several dens distributed throughout their home range; some dens are used by two or more individuals either sequentially, or for females, simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands have similar diets as those reported on the mainland. Studies on Santa Cruz Island showed skunks to be carnivorous, consuming primarily island deer mice and insects along with occasional lizards. Jerusalem crickets were the most frequent prey, but other prey included grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, caterpillars, earwigs, and ants. Seasonally available fruits and berries were collected on Santa Cruz Island consisting of grapes, summer holly stems and berries.</p> <p>In recent years skunks have begun preying on seabirds nesting in sea caves on Santa Cruz Island. Expansion of skunk foraging to sea caves is likely a result of their substantial population increase following decline of foxes.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The breeding season for spotted skunks on the islands is probably similar to spotted skunks on the mainland. Western spotted skunks mate in September and October, and following delayed implantation and a 210-310 day gestation, give birth in April and May to 2-6. Counts of three and five uterine scars were recorded from two skunks collected at Santa Cruz Island in September.</p> <p>On Santa Cruz Island, California, in a 1994 study of 47 dens used by island spotted skunks, 29.8% were under shrubs, 21.3% in open grassland, 21.3% in cavities in rocks, 10.6% in road cuts, 10.6% under human structures, and 6.4% in cavities in roots and trunks of trees.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN Red List (2008), the Western Spotted Skunk is listed as Least Concern as they are widely distributed in a variety of habitats including human altered habitats. The species may be declining in parts of the United States but not at a rate fast enough to be threatened. In contrast, prior to the recent upswing in skunk numbers on the islands, the island spotted skunk was thought to be rare, and was listed as a Species of Special Concern by the state of California. when the Island Spotted Skunk had a small population and was not well-studied, the skunk that time was designated as a species of concern. However, recent surveys now show a remarkable recovery in the species. On Santa Rosa Island, skunks are marked and counted during annual population monitoring for island foxes, and as of 2011 there were approximately 3,000 skunks on Santa Rosa Island.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/sudden-increase-rare-endemic-carnivore-ecology-island-spotted-skunk/\">Ecology of the Island Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/ssc/docs/mammal/species/46.pdf\">Channel Islands Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136797/0\">ICUN Red List</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

The challenging and quickly changing weather and at times extreme sea conditions and dangerous sea caves greatly add to the risks of sea kayaking in the park. Sea kayaking on your own in any area of the park should not be attempted by novice or first time kayakers or anyone who is not properly experienced, trained, conditioned and equipped.</p> <p>Visitors may kayak on their own or with a park authorized guide/outiftter. The National Park Service strongly recommends for your safety that sea kayaking be done with one of the park's authorized guide/outfitters. The guided trips are moderate to strenuous in nature, but some do not require previous kayaking experience.<br /> <br /> For the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area on Santa Cruz Island visit: <a href=\"http://www.sbadventureco.com/adventures/channel-islands/#Sea-Cave-Kayaking\">Channel Islands Adventure Company</a>. For kayak guide and outfitting services in other areas of the park (excluding Scorpion area), visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/parkmgmt/visitor-services-list.htm\">Visitor Services List.</a></p> <p>Visitors with their own kayaks who would like to explore the park may contact the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/island-transportation.htm\">park concessioners</a>, who will transport kayaks on their public trips for an extra fee. The concessionaires offer year-round transportation to the islands for day visits and camping trips.</p> <p>Sea kayaking opportunities are available throughout the park. To help you decide which island to visit, specific island information is available at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/placestogo.htm\">Places To Go</a> or from the visitor center through publications, exhibits, and the park movie.</p> <p>The area of the park that is most popular for sea kayaking is centered around Scorpion Beach on East Santa Cruz Island. This location is a world class destination for sea kayaking because of easy beach access, clear ocean waters, nearby camping, readily available concessionaire boat transportation service and a spectacular shoreline with beautiful sea cave and cliffs to explore.</p> <p>Sea kayaking at San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands is recommended to only the most highly experienced (expert), skilled, conditioned kayakers with all necessary safety equipment due to the consistently extreme weather and sea conditions that regularly dominate these areas.</p> <p>Due to the many hazards of crossing the channel from or to the mainland to the park islands the National Park Service does not recommend this be attempted by sea kayakers.</p> <p>Detailed kayaking information about the channel and islands may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) \"Local Notice to Mariners\" publication by contacting the Coast Guard at (510) 437-2981. Kayaking guides and nautical charts to the Channel Islands are available from local marine stores and online bookstores. Refer to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Ocean Survey charts 18720, 18721, 18725, 18727, 18728, 18729, and 18756.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Weather</strong><br /> Conditions in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the islands are variable and the ocean is unforgiving. Only experienced kayakers with vessels capable of withstanding severe weather are advised to make the cross-channel passage.</p> <p>Kayakers should obtain the latest weather broadcast provided by the NOAA Weather Service by calling (805) 988-6610, visiting Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's <a href=\"http://channelislands.nos.noaa.gov/focus/kiosk.html\">Internet Weather Kiosk</a> and by monitoring weather radio on VHF-FM 162.475 MHz (weather station 3) for marine forecasts and VHF-FM 162.55 MHz (weather station 1) and VHF-FM 162.40 MHz (weather station 2) for land-based observations.</p> <p>Weather conditions vary considerably in the channel. Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and the sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. The calmest winds and sea conditions often occur August through October. The other months are subject to a much greater chance for adverse wind and seas with sudden unexpected changes. High winds may occur regardless of the forecast. Forty-knot winds are not unusual for Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands have more moderate winds.</p> <p>Winds are often calm in the early morning and increase during the afternoon. Generally the wind comes from the northwest, but kayakers must be also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds at anytime, especially from September through April.</p> <p>Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Ocean currents of considerable strength may be encountered both near and offshore from the islands. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (°F) in the winter to the upper 60s (°F) in the fall.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Safety</strong><br /> Due to challenging weather conditions, kayaking should not be attempted by the novice or anyone who is not properly trained, conditioned, and equipped. Safety requires good planning and common sense. Sea kayaking is potentially hazardous, even for experienced kayakers. Please follow these saftey recommendations:</p> <p><u>Use the buddy system.</u><br /> There are no lifeguards on duty. Kayaking is at your own risk. Stay together and paddle within the skills of the least experienced paddler in the group.</p> <p><u>Obtain current weather and sea conditions.</u><br /> The conditions around the islands are considered \"open ocean.\" Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and sea conditions may become dangerous without warning.There is no place where visitors will be kayaking in a protected cove. Always observe and evaluate sea conditions before entering the water. Be alert to wind, wave, and currents at all times.</p> <p><u>Do not travel down wind (with the wind) as you will have to return into a headwind.</u><br /> Wind and waves typically come out of the northwest or west. Winds tend to increase in the afternoon. Morning hours can be a better time for kayaking, and other watersports. Challengin Santa Ana or east winds may occur at anytime, but are most common from September through April.</p> <p><u>Do not exceed your skill level.</u><br /> If you are new to sea kayaking or other watersports, stay close to your launch area and paddle with an experienced kayaker. Ask National Park Service personnel or kayak guides if you have questions concerning weather, safety, etc. Be capable of re-entering your kayak from the water.</p> <p><u>Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return.</u><br /> Kayakers should always file a float plan with family and/or friends and inform them of your departure and return. The float plan should include: 1) the number of boats and boaters on the trip as well as the color, size, and type of craft used; 2) names and addresses for the boaters , as well as emergency phone numbers; 3) any survival and special emergency equipment should be listed (EPIRB, VHF, food rations, flares, etc.); and 4) the place, date, and time of departure and return should be logged as well as destination(s). This information can be invaluable for a search operation if something goes wrong. Remember to be flexible with your plans. Weather should always determine your course of action.</p> <p>If you are kayaking across the channel, kayakers should also file a formal float plan with the harbormaster before departing and contact island rangers at the beginning and end of the paddle.</p> <p><u>Carefully select and equip your paddlecraft.</u><br /> Craft should be of a sea kayak design and kayakers must have the following items:</p> <ul> <li>Lifejackets-all paddlers must have lifejackets.</li> <li>Helmets-always wear a helmet when paddling below cliffs and in sea caves.</li> <li>VHF radio, tow line, compass, throw bag, first aid kit, signaling device (airhorn, whistle, or signal mirror). Carry these items with you and know how to use them.</li> <li>Wetsuits are highly recommended. Water temperatures remain cold throughout the year.</li> </ul> <p><u>Sea Caves</u><br /> Sea caves can be very dangerous-large waves or swells can fill a cave unexpectedly. Even on calm days, the wake from large ships in the channel can pose a danger to kayakers in caves. Be extremely careful and wear a helmet at all times when exploring sea caves. Always observe and evaluate sea conditions before entering any sea cave.</p> <p><u>Shipping Lanes</u><br /> Major shipping lanes lie between the islands and the mainland. Kayakers should be aware of their location and use caution when crossing them. All kayakers should listen to the USCG notice to mariners broadcast on VHF channel 22 since the waters in and surrounding the park are sometimes closed for military operations.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Regulations</strong><br /> In addition to the regulations listed below please see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/parkmgmt/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/limiting-your-impact.htm\">Limiting Your Impact</a> for additional information.</p> <ul> <li>You may not exit your kayak while in the sea caves.<br />  </li> <li>Do not disturb wildlife within caves. It is illegal to feed, touch, tease, frighten, or intentionally disturb wildlife.<br />  </li> <li>Please avoid use of artificial lights in caves.<br />  </li> <li>Stay off rocks. Scorpion Rock on Santa Cruz Island and all other off shore islets in the park are off limits.<br />  </li> <li>The Santa Cruz Island shoreline between Arch Point (northwest of Scorpion Anchorage) and the east boundary of Potato Harbor is closed to landing to protect nesting seabirds.<br />  </li> <li>Other island shorelines and beaches may be closed to landing to protect pinnipeds and seabirds.

However, a landing permit is required to land on The Nature Conservancy (TNC) property on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>There are closed and restricted areas on each island. Please note that rocks or islets on or near any of the islands are closed year-round to any landing and pets are not allowed in the park. Please refer to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/limiting-your-impact.htm\">Limiting Your Impact</a> for more information on regulations and guidelines.</p> <p>Kayakers may land according to the following procedures:<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Barbara Island</strong>: A permit is not required to land or hike on Santa Barbara Island. Access to the island is permitted only at the landing cove. The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock.</p> <p><strong>Anacapa Island:</strong> A permit is not required to land or hike on East Anacapa Island or at Frenchys Cove. West Anacapa (except Frenchys Cove) is a protected research natural area and is closed to visitors. Visitors are allowed on Middle Anacapa by permit only and when accompanied by a park ranger.<br /> <br /> The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock.</p> <p><strong>Santa Cruz Island:</strong> Boaters may land and hike on the eastern 24% of Santa Cruz Island without a permit. This area is owned by the NPS and is east of the property line between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage. Due to surf and swell conditions, boaters should use extreme caution when making surf-landings at any beach, especially Smugglers Cove and those beaches facing south and southeast between San Pedro Point and Sandstone Point.</p> <p>A permit to land on the other 76% of Santa Cruz Island is required from TNC. A fee is charged and no overnight island use is permitted. Contact (805) 642-0345 x510 or <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/\">www.nature.org/</a> for a permit; allow 10-12 days for processing.</p> <p><strong>Santa Rosa Island:</strong> Boaters may land along coastline and on beaches without a permit for day-use only. From March 1 to September 15, the back beaches and sand dunes between and including Skunk Point to just north of East Point are closed to hiking to protect the nesting area for the snowy plover, a federally listed, threatened shorebird. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area. The beaches around Sandy Point are closed year-round. A pier is available at Bechers Bay.</p> <p><strong>San Miguel Island:</strong> Kayakers may land only on the beach at Cuyler Harbor. San Miguel Island is owned by the U. S. Navy and open for landing only when National Park Service personnel are on the island. The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> If kayakers are not traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers, it is the responsibility of the kayakers to contact the park to ensure the island is open before coming ashore. A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. Kayakers can obtain these forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trail head entry on San Miguel Island. If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers they will provide the forms to you upon your reservation.<br /> <br /> Visitors are required to be escorted beyond the ranger station. Visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site unescorted. No off-trail hiking is permitted.<br /> <br /> If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers for the day or to camp, park staff will already be scheduled on the island and usually available to provided escorted hikes. Kayakers traveling on their own are required to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/common/utilities/sendmail/sendemail.cfm?o=488DD2A8A2D7A6AF84BA07ACF137A5BD55D341804A&r=/chis/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm\">e-mail us</a> prior to their mainland departure to arrange for an escorted hike by a ranger. Provide your name, phone number, vessel name, and dates of requested escorted hike. Park staff will then reply with available dates and instructions.</p> <p> </p> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "In the village of Hartford, Illinois, the Lewis & Clark Confluence Tower rises an impressive 150 feet above the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, the two longest rivers in all North America. Built to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Lewis & Clark Expedition, construction on the monument was completed on May 14, 2010.<br /> <br /> How does it relate to the Lewis & Clark expedition, you ask? Well, in many ways, it was the first step on what would become known as the Lewis & Clark Expedition. In December of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark established camp at Wood River, otherwise known as Camp Dubois. Located along the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the modern-day Confluence Tower, the camp served as the winter quarters for the two men and those who joined them on their expedition. Here, they spent the winter gathering supplies and recruiting other intrepid explorers from St. Louis. Then, in May of 1804, the group embarked on their historic journey westward from the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.<br /> <br /> For those wishing to get a bird’s eye view of the area, the Confluence Tower has observations decks at the 50, 100, and 150-foot marks, and all three levels are accessible by either stairs or elevator. Exhibits focusing on Lewis and Clark and the importance of the Missouri-Mississippi Confluence can be found on every level. Guests can also request a short, guided tour that ends with a trip to the highest level of the structure. On particularly clear days, parts of St. Louis and the Gateway Arch can be seen from the upper decks.",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phoca vitulina</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The California Channel Islands play an important role in the life cycle of many large marine mammals that live along the west coast of North America.. Harbor seals, <em>Phoca vitulina</em>, can often be spotted on rocks near the water's edge with their head and flippers elevated in order to be warmed by the sun's rays. <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Harbor seal pups can swim at birth and can dive for up to 2 minutes when they are only 2-3 days old. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Harbor seals are estimated to reach an average lifespan of 40 years in the wild. In captivity, the longest recorded lifespan was 47.6 years. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Harbor seals can dive to depths of 1400 feet and remain underwater for nearly 30 minutes without resurfacing.<sup>2</sup></li> <li>Their sensitive whiskers acoustically detect sound waves, which is useful for catching prey. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Contrasted to other pinnipeds, harbor seals are not sexually dimorphic;meaning that is no significant differences is size between females and males. <sup>5</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Pacific harbor seals have spotted coats in a variety of shades from white or silver-gray to black or dark brown. They reach five to six feet in length and weigh up to 300 pounds. They are true or crawling seals, having no external ear flaps. True seals have small flippers and must move on land by flopping along on their bellies. <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Harbor seals are found north of the equator in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the Pacific, they range from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.<sup>1</sup> Harbor Seals are typically found near shore.They are found throughout the California Channel Islands including all five Islands in Channel Islands National Park.On San Miguel Island 1,100 harbor seals breed annually on Point Bennett, which is also an extraordinary haul out area for four other pinniped species.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> They favor near-shore coastal waters and are often seen on islands, rocky coastlines, sandy beaches, mudflats, bays, and estuaries.They often choose to rest close to the water so they have quick access to the water in case of a threat. <sup>1, 5</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Harbor seals are carnivores that consume mostly fish. Despite regional variation in individual diets, the overarching goal of harbor seals is to keep foraging efforts low by eating what is abundant and easily caught. Adults eat mostly fish, consuming the fish whole or head first. Preferred medium-sized fish species include codfish, hake, mackerel, and herring. They also eat octopus or squid, as well as crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. Because newly weaned pups have poorly developed diving abilities, their primary diet consists of crustaceans that are easier to catch. Harbor seals weighing about 220 pounds eat about 11 to 15 pounds of food per day. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In California, harbor seal pups are born between February and April and weigh about 20 to 24 pounds at birth. If born prematurely, harbor seals retain a whitish lanugo coat (which is usually lost before birth). A pup can swim at birth and will sometimes ride on its mother's back when tired. Pups make a bleating noise that sounds like \"maaaa\". After about four weeks, the pups are weaned. Adult females usually mate and give birth every year. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers the harbor seal to be a species of Least Concern. Spring brings harbor seal colonies to rookery beaches that are accessible to humans. Sometimes a pup and mother become separated due to disturbance by beachgoers. Unfortunately, this severely decreases the pup's chance for survival. The worldwide harbor seal population is estimated to be 500,000 individuals. The number estimated to live in California was 34,000 in 2009. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/pacific-harbor-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/pacific-harbor-seal/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Phoca_vitulina/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Phoca_vitulina/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/harborseal.htm\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/harborseal.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=12\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=12</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/harbor_seals/facts.htm\">http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/harbor_seals/facts.htm</a></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The spectacular humpback whale, that performs acrobatic leaps, is common within the Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries. Generally, the humpback whale can be seen from mid-May to mid-September on whale watching boats servicing the public in the vicinity.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Humpback whales produce the most diverse range of sounds known for any whale and some of the longest and most varied sounds of any animal in the world. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>The estimated population on the United States west coast is estimated at about 597 individuals. (2010 review by Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<sup>4</sup></li> <li>Some humpback whales make a round trip journey of 10,000 miles.<sup>4</sup></li> <li>The humpback whale gets its name from fact that the dorsal fin sits on a large \"hump\" on the back, which is noticeable when the whale arches its back and dives.4</li> <li>They are also seen swimming on their backs with both flippers in the air. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Humpback whales are slow swimmers compared to other whales. They can reach up to 16 miles per hour, but average only 2-9 miles per hour.<sup>4</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the \"FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World\", the the humpback whales flippers are extremely long (up to one-third of the body length) with a series of bumps, including 2 more prominent ones in consistent positions on the leading edge, more-or-less dividing the margin into thirds. The flukes have a concave, serrated trailing edge, and the dorsal fin is low and broad based (usually sitting on a hump). The head has a single median ridge, and the anterior portion of the head is covered with many bumps (each containing a single sensory hair). The body is black or dark grey dorsally and may be white ventrally, but the borderline between dark and light is highly variable and seems to differ by population. The flippers are white on the ventral side and vary from all-white to mostly black on the dorsal surface. The ventral side of the flukes also varies from all-black to all-white. There are 270 to 400 black to olive baleen plates, and 14 to 35 ventral pleats extending back to the navel or beyond. The blow is rather low and bushy for a balaenopterid, reaching only 3 m. It may sometimes appear V-shaped. At close range, the humpback is one of the easiest whales to identify. At a distance, however, there can be some confusion with other large whales, especially blue and sperm whales. When a closer look is obtained, humpbacks are generally unmistakable. As far as size, the adult humpback whales are 45 to 56 in length, with females being about 6 feet longer than males on the average.Newborn calves are 16 to 18 feet in length and weigh up to one ton. Weights of at least 35 tons or 70, 000 pounds are attained by adults. Individual humpback whales can be identified using photographs of the distinctive markings on the undersides of their flukes.<sup>2</sup><br />   <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Humpbacks are widely distributed in all oceans, ranging from tropical wintering grounds near islands and continental coasts to open-ocean temperate and sub-polar summering habitats.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Humpbacks feed and breed in coastal waters, often near human population centers, and this helps make them one of the most familiar of the large whales. They migrate from tropics (breeding areas) to polar or sub-polar regions, reaching the ice edges in both hemispheres (feeding areas);their migrations take them through oceanic zones.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> According to NOAA Fisheries, the humpback whale has a unique way of feeding by using a technique of lunging through patches of krill (small shrimplike crustaceans) or fish and then gulping vast mouthfuls of water. Humpbacks also use an impressive skill called \"bubble-netting\" which involves swimming in a spiral beneath their prey and blowing out air from their blowholes. This \"net\" of bubbles surrounds the shoal of fish or krill, then, the humpback swims through the center with its mouth open. These techniques are the most diverse, as well as spectacular of all baleen whales.<sup>3,5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Humpback whales are probably old enough to mate at about 7 years of age.Females are pregnant for about 11 to 12 months and get pregnant approximately every two to four years. Calves are born on wintering grounds in tropical and subtropical regions and are able to swim and can grow 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) per month while nursing.Females nurse their new born calves in warm, shallow water.</p> <p>Humpbacks have very complicated courtship behaviors and many male humpbacks can surround a female and compete with each other to get close to the female.Sometimes the competition involves males lunging at and bashing into each other. Males also appear to compete for access to estrus females, by using their now well-known complex songs as part of their breeding display. At the end of the mating and calving season, humpback whales migrate to cold, productive waters to feed.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Humpback whales were not a favorite target of Yankee whalers. However, because of their relatively slow swimming speeds and coastal habits, they were an early target of modern large-scale commercial whaling, beginning with shore based whaling in many areas. Commercial whalers hunted humpbacks into the 20th century, reducing the number of the species to possibly 10 percent of the original population worldwide.</p> <p>Humpback whales are now protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, making it illegal to harass or kill a humpback whale in United States' waters. In addition, the International Whale Commission gave humpback whales worldwide protection status in 1966. Since then it has been illegal to hunt humpback whales anywhere in the world. Steps are also being taken to try to reduce ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement.</p> <p>In August 2008, the IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature, changed humpback's status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered. The United States, through a review conducted by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, is considering listing separate humpback populations, so smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000-20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpback's extraordinary migrations, which can extend the 5,157 miles from Antarctica to Costa Rica.<sup>1,4,6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/humpbackwhale.ht\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/humpbackwhale.ht</a>m</li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, Jefferson, T.A., S.

In some cases, island deer mice are the only terrestrial mammal occuring on the island. They thrive in the varied habitats on the islands, with populations densities that are higher than anywhere else in the world. The island deer mouse population is an important part in the ecosystem, as food for predators, and as consumers of seeds-including those of non-native plants.</p> <p>Quick and Cool Facts</p> <ul> <li>Deer mice are widely spread across North America; however each of the five Channel Islands has its own distinct sub-species.</li> <li>Deer mice populations at Channel Islands National Park have been monitored since 1992.</li> <li>Island deer mouse population densities are higher, and fluctuate more, than anywhere else in the world.</li> <li>Deer mice exhibit population dynamics that differ markedly from mainland populations of the same species.</li> <li>Climate and predation (by island foxes on some islands, and owls on others) are the most important factors determining island deer mouse population fluctuations.</li> <li>Generally, more rain provides more food for the species, yet abundant rain with cold winters may in fact decrease the deer mouse population.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Deer mice from the Channel Islands have dark brownish-black tipped hairs on their back, a buffy band on their sides and then grey at the base. In general, island mice are darker than mainland mice. Deer mice are the prototype for \"field mice\" with large, bulging eyes, big ears, a bi-colored pattern and a long tail.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus is the most widespread North American rodent. It is found throughout southern Canada, the United States, and north and central Mexico, including Baja California. It is most commonly called the deer mouse, although that name is common to most species of Peromyscus. It is absent from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal plains of the United States, but its range does extend to the coast in east Texas. However, each of the Channel Islands are home to a different subspecies of deer mouse that is found nowhere else on earth.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Due to the diverse habitat of the Channel Islands, nesting is found in the natural cover of the landscape. The deer mouse will nest alone on most occasions but will sometimes nest with a deer mouse of the opposite sex. The deer mouse is generally a nocturnal creature.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Food selection is dependent on both habitat and season. Deer mice feed heavily on larvae from lepidopterans (includes moths and butterflies) and other insects in the spring. They can eat large volumes and are capable of ridding an area of many insects that may be detrimental to trees. In the fall, seeds become a major food source and are stored in caches for use during the winter.</p> <p>Island studies have shown that deer mice occasionally prey on eggs and nestlings of Scripps's murrelets on Santa Barbara Island. However, the annual reproductive success of murrelets was not related to deer mouse densities. Likewise, research on San Miguel Island showed that as seed predators, deer mice had limited impacts on giant coreopsis populations, especially when compared to the negative competitive effects of non-native annual grasses.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Deer mice on the Channel Islands have been found to show definite breeding seasons, with the majority of reproduction occurring during the spring and summer months with generally two litters produced. The normal gestation period range is from 22-35 days, with the average being 26 days, and mice are considered in their juvenile pelage from birth to 11 weeks, while sub adults are from 11-21 weeks.</p> <p>Park research has shown that island deer mouse population densities are higher than anywhere else in the world. However, population dynamics on different islands vary in response to numerous factors, including predator diversity, vegetation community structure, and climate.</p> <p>For example, monitoring data shows that deer mouse densities on San Miguel Island are strongly limited by the endangered island fox (Urocyon littoralis littoralis), whereas on Santa Barbara Island, where there are no foxes, mouse densities are much more variable. Predation by barnowls on Santa Barbara Island can drive th emousr population to extreme lows. Unlike the generalist island fox, barn owls are more specialized predators and do not switch to other prey species when their their primary prey (mice) decline.</p> <p>In addition, research has revealed that rainfall is a strong driver of deer mouse population dynamics. High winter rainfall encourages plant growth which provides food resources, while drought reduces plant growth and limits mouse productivity. However, abundant winter rain combined with cold temperatures may actually increase winter mortality and reduce the number of mice that survive from fall to spring.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The island deer mouse, peromyscus maniculatus, is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and because it is unlikely to be in decline.</p> <p>Deer mice populations at Channel Islands National Park have been monitored since 1992. Nine permanent grids have been established in various habitats on Anacapa, San Miguel and Santa Barbara Islands. These grids are sampled twice each year during the spring and fall seasons and mark/recapture methods are used to determine population densities.</p> <p>The objective of the monitoring is to identify trends in the deer mice population, evaluate the general health of the population utilizing weight, age, sex, and reproductive information and to increase our understanding of how island ecosystems respond to changing environmental conditions.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/16672/0\">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/medn/assets/docs/resourcebriefs/MEDN_ResourceBrief_DeerMice.pdf\">Inventory & Monitoring Program Mediterranean Coast Network</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Cepphus columba</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The pigeon guillemot is a North Pacific seabird belonging to the auk family which includes guillemots, puffins, auklets, and murrelets. The Channel Islands National Park, owing to its isolation and protected environment, provides ideal habitat for the pigeon guillemot breeding colonies. The park's generally abundant food sources are ideally suited for a bird who dives directly to the sea bed, probing rocky recesses and vegetation with their bills for fish and invertebrates. This bird is found along rocky shores in small colonies or isolated pairs. The pigeon guillemot nests in burrows or under rocks, often on small islands that provide protection from predators.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Pigeon guillemots have an extensive breeding range along the western North America coast from Alaska to California.</li> <li>This seabird can scale vertical rock faces by flapping its wings and using its sharp claws.</li> <li>Pigeon guillemots dive into the water to feed on fish and invertebrates.</li> <li>The usually lay their eggs in rocky crevices and cavities along cliffs.</li> <li>Pigeon guillemots will lay one to two eggs.</li> <li>They usually return to their natal colony to breed.</li> <li>Both parents incubate a single egg.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The pigeon guillemots are stocky birds with rounded wings and bodies, and straight bills. In breeding plumage, adults are solid black with white wing patches. The bird's striking red-orange legs and mouth lining play a role in courtship during breeding season. Non-breeding adults and juveniles have white bellies and are mottled gray-and-white above. In all plumages, the birds have bright red feet.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Pigeon guillemots are distributed in subtidal and intertidal marine habitats and on rocky shores from the Russian Pacific coast, to Alaska and down through California. The widest distribution, (as shown on the map), is in the northwestern part of the North American continent. Santa Barbara Island is at the southern edge of their range. Adults are present from February to late August on the Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The pigeon guillemot needs rocky, undisturbed shoreline for nesting, and access to nearby marine waters for feeding. It feeds in shallower waters than most auks, puffins, or murrelets. Although it is known to dive to depths of greater than 150 feet, it feeds best in waters of only 35 to 65 feet in depth.The pigeon guillemot, when not feeding, often rests on sea cliff ledges, or on the surface of coastal waters. By vigorous flapping of its wings combined with the use of its sharp claws on its webbed feet, it often scales vertical rock faces.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> During the breeding season, the pigeon guillemot subsists largely on small fish. It pursues and captures fish in water near coast or island shores. Besides fish, it is also reported to eat small crabs and shrimp as well as mollusks, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. It is reported that parents bring young an average of 16 food loads a day, typically bringing a single fish each time.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Pigeon guillemots nests in cliff crevices and talus slopes, or occasionally in burrows. They also use human-made structures such as pipes, culverts, or crevices in wharves. Eggs are laid within these crevices on bare soil or rock, or sometimes on a loose bed of shells and pebbles. The guillemot is monogamous. It generally forms loose colonies with a few pairs dispersed over suitable nesting habitat, but occasionally a pair will nest solitarily. Clutches usually contain two eggs with an incubation period of 30-32 days. Parents share incubation duties by trading off every 1-2 hours. Nestlings are semiprecocial and downy; nestling period lasts 35-45 days. Fledglings leave the nest at about 90% adult weight. On the Channel Islands, they lay eggs from mid-April through mid-June, with a peak in early May. Chicks hatch from mid-May through mid-July, with a peak in early June. Young fledge from late June through late August, with a peak in mid-July.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Winter range of California's breeding population is unknown. However, individuals banded on the Farallon Islands have been recovered mostly in the north, as far as British Columbia, which suggests a northward movement.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> They readily abandon their nest if disturbed during incubation or brooding. Because they spend much time on inshore waters where oil exploration and development are centered, they are vulnerable to oil pollution. Historically, warm ocean temperatures have produced dramatic nesting failures, such as during the 1983 breeding season. The global population of this bird is estimated to be around 470,000 individual birds. It is believed unlikely that the population trends for this species will soon approach the minimum levels that could suggest a potential decline in population. Therefore, population trends for the pigeon guillemot have a present evaluation level of Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pigeon_Guillemot/sounds\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

When British General John Forbes arrived in 1758, the French forces found themselves outnumbered. Realizing the gravity of their situation, the French burned the fort to the ground and promptly left. Now in control of the area, the British soon built Fort Pitt, a five-sided structure with bastions, on the same site that was, at the time, one of the largest forts in North America. Both the fort and its adjacent settlement, “Pittsborough,” were named in honor of the English Prime Minister, William Pitt.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0ee3508c-67b1-4d9b-848f-606127b046e0}{162}\" paraid=\"464914981\">Years later, the Lewis and Clark expedition constructed their 50-foot keeled boat and assembled supplies from merchants in Pittsburgh. With the boat completed, Meriwether Lewis and eleven other men departed for the journey down the Ohio River on August 31, 1803.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0ee3508c-67b1-4d9b-848f-606127b046e0}{166}\" paraid=\"377111440\">Today, Point State Park encompasses 36.4 acres complete with riverfront promenades, scenic views of the city, and a 150-foot tall fountain. Twenty-three monuments, interpretive plaques, and historical markers are located throughout the park. Visitors can also see three recreated bastions from the original Fort Pitt fortification. The Fort Pitt Museum is built on the footprint of one of the original bastions, educating visitors about the region’s role in early American history through interactive exhibits, life-like historical figures, and a plethora of artifacts. Staff also presents special programs and group tours throughout the year. The Fort Pitt Block House, built in 1764, can also be toured. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0ee3508c-67b1-4d9b-848f-606127b046e0}{170}\" paraid=\"1780193290\">Point State Park is ADA accessible and open to the public every day of the year from sunrise to sunset.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Pituophis catenifer pumilis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is a dwarf endemic species rarely exceeding three feet in length. Contrary to earlier reports of only existing on that island, it is also found on Santa Rosa Island. The species is related to king snakes and rat snake, and is harmless to humans. Its somewhat threatening behavior, mimicking the rattlesnake, will sometimes get individuals of the species killed unnecessarily.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is one of many endemic species in the national park.<br />  </li> <li>When threatened, the species will elevate and inflate its body, flatten its head into a triangular shape, hiss loudly, and quickly shake its tail back and forth to make a buzzing sound which may be a mimic of a rattlesnake rattle.<br />  </li> <li>A powerful constrictor; the gopher snake kills prey by suffocating them in body coils or by pressing the animal against the walls of their underground burrows.<br />  </li> <li>Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a less varied diet than other subspecies of gopher snakes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, <em>Pituophis catenifer pumilus</em> (<em>pumilio</em> is Latin for \"dwarf\"), is just as its Latin translation indicates, a dwarf race rarely exceeding 3 feet in length. By contrast, the Pacific gopher snake, its mainland cousin, can reach 7 feet in length. The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is the only dwarf form of the species, even though three other subspecies also occur on islands (<em>P. c. fulginatus, insulanus</em>, and <em>coronalis</em>).</p> <p>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a rather narrow head that is only slightly wider than the neck and when compared to other races, has a short and flattened snout and a rounded rostral. The adult coloration is typically a light greenish or grayish-white background with a profuse pattern of gloss-black blotches, becoming \"muddied\" or less contrasting with age. Males tend to pull up some bright yellow on their anterior ventral surfaces as they grow. Hatchlings are highly contrasted, being a very light grayish-white with black patterning and range in length from 6.5 to 9 inches.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is found on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands. On the mainland, gopher snakes are found widely throughout western North America.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, like its mainland congeners, is a habitat generalist. It can be found in all vegetation associations on the two islands, but it is most common in open areas such as grasslands, dry streambeds, and oak and chaparral woodlands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes have a less varied diet than other subspecies of gophersnakes. Their diet probably includes mice, lizards, birds' eggs, and nestlings. Juveniles probably take small lizards, mice, and possibly insects.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In spring, juveniles and adults emerge from rodent burrows or rock fissures, where they hibernate during the colder months of fall and winter. Adults probably reproduce in May with females depositing clutches (generally, four to six eggs) from late June through July and hatchlings emerging in September and October.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department for Fish and Game lists the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake as a California Species of Special Concern. The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island was beneficial for Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes. Feral pigs destroyed habitat for snakes and preyed on them as well.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm\">http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm\">http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html</a></li> </ul>",

The Scripps's Murrelet breeds within the park, while the Guadalupe Murrelet visits after breeding season. However, there are unconfirmed accounts of breeding on Santa Barbara Island)</em></p> <p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> Synthliboramphus scrippsi</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This unique small bird of coastal Pacific waters is among the world's rarest seabirds. The park is the nesting location for about a third of the world's population. It is also among the most threatened, nesting in as few as 10 locations. Rarely seen from the coast, Scripps's murrelets prefer the deep, warm offshore waters of the Pacific.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Scripps's murrelet come ashore only to breed, remaining at sea the rest of the year.</li> <li>The park has 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets.</li> <li>Santa Barbara Island has the largest Scripps's murrelet colony in the United States, and possibly the world.</li> <li>Scripps's murrelets nest primarily in natural rock crevices along steep edges around the periphery of islands.</li> <li>Females lay two eggs containing 22% of her body weight which are incubated for about a month.</li> <li>The chicks emerge from eggs fully feathered and well developed.</li> <li>The chicks spend fewer than 48 hours at the nest site and are not fed.</li> <li>A Scripps's murrelet chick will leave the nest for the open ocean at two days old tumbling down steep slopes and cliffs to reunite with parents in the water.</li> <li>The Scripps's murrelet was listed as a threatened species by the state of California on December 22, 2004.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Scripps's murrelet is a small bird. At under 10 inches in length, it is slightly smaller than an American robin. Adults have a 15-inch wingspan and weigh only six ounces. Black above and white on the chin, throat, and belly, Scripps's murrelet is very similar in appearance to Craveri's murrelet, a species that shares a similar range. The two are most easily separated in flight by the distinct white underwing of the Scripp's.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> This species is fond of warm, southerly climates. During the breeding season, the entire Scripps's murrelet population is concentrated within a fairly small region off the coasts of southern California and Mexico. However, birds disperse after breeding, sometimes as far north as British Columbia. Over eighty percent of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets (33.5% of the world's population and the only breeding ground north of Mexico) occurs on the Channel Islands, while the Mexican population nests primarily on the Baja California islands of San Benito, Coronado, and San Jeronimo.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> During the breeding season, southern California's Scripps's murrelets, who are crevice and burrow nesters, lay their eggs on the steep slopes and cliffs of Anacapa, Santa Barbara. and San Clemente islands. They prefer areas with sufficient vegetation for cover. Away from the breeding season, the birds move far out to sea, preferring the deep waters beyond the continental shelf.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Scripps's murrelets feed by diving and swimming underwater in pursuit of small fish and crustaceans. Interestingly, they are nearly always observed feeding in pairs rather than in flocks. Adults are active at the colony only at night. This curious feeding strategy takes place year-round, including during the breeding season. Since one member of each breeding pair is at the nest throughout the breeding season, unrelated birds may pair up to feed cooperatively.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In early spring, females lay two eggs directly on the ground, usually in a rocky area concealed by dense vegetation. No actual nest is constructed. For about 34 days, both parents take turns incubating the eggs, which vary widely in color, from pure white to blue, green, or even dark brown. Some are heavily spotted, while others are unspotted. The eggs are also extremely large, weighing up to a quarter of the mother's total body weight-among the largest parent-to-egg size ratio of any bird. The chicks emerge fully feathered and well developed. They generally spend fewer than 48 hours at the nest site, during which time they are not fed. By the second or third night, the parents coax the chicks away from the nest site, then fly out to sea, leaving the chicks to find their own way to the ocean. The chicks' path often involves a daunting climb over rough terrain, and down steep, rocky slopes. Scripps's chicks have been seen leaping from cliffs as high as 200 feet into the waters below. Once in the ocean, the chicks find their parents, who wait beyond the surf, calling for them constantly. Reunited, adults and chicks swim out to sea, where the parents continue to tend to the chicks for several months.</p> <p><em>Please see Scripps's murrelet nestcam video at bottom of page.</em></p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Once the breeding season ends, the birds move out to sea, following the warm offshore California Current. Though most remain off the coast of central California, a few occasionally relocate as far north as British Columbia. This movement is generally regarded as a post-breeding dispersal rather than a true migration. Young birds are flightless and slow moving at this time.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - 2010 Red List of Threatened Species, this species is considered to have a vulnerable status because of its limited range and small, declining population. Several colonies have gone extinct, and introduced predators are causing declines in some of the remaining nine colonies. Channel Islands National Park has implemented several restoration projects to reverse these declines. On Santa Barbara Island, after feral cats were removed in 1978, numbers of Scripps's murrelets increased to approximately 1,500 in 1992. Additional work on Santa Barbara Island includes restoring seabird nesting habitat by removing non-native plants and planting native vegetation. On Anacapa Island, the National Park Service eradicated the introduced black rat population that had decimated the population of nesting Scripps's murrelets. Notably in 2009 the number of Scripps's murrelet clutches on Anacapa increased 61% over the previous year.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phalacrocorax pelagicus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This seabird is a small member of the cormorant family and is also known as Baird's Cormorant. Analogous to other smallish cormorants, it is also occasionally called the pelagic shag. Being one of the least social or gregarious cormorants, Channel Island National Park, due to its isolation from the mainland, provides an ideal environment for its breeding on all five channel islands. This seabird lives year round along the coasts of the Pacific; during winter it can also be found in the open ocean.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Their North American breeding range extends from Alaska to the Baja Pacific Islands in Mexico.</li> <li>Pelagic cormorants are the smallest of the North American cormorants.</li> <li>During the breeding season the skin under their eyes turns a vivid magenta.</li> <li>The pelagic cormorant is among the least gregrious or social of the cormorants, nesting on steep cliffs along rocky and exposed shorelines, either in loose colonies or far from nearest neighbors.</li> <li>A typical nest has between three and five eggs.</li> <li>The pelagic cormorant uses its own guano to solidify its nest materials and to cement its nest to the cliff face.</li> <li>They prefer to forage near kelp beds or among rocks.</li> <li>The feet of these expert divers are located far back on the body to give them forward thrust underwater.</li> <li>Pelagic cormorants can dive as deep as 100 feet.</li> <li>They can spring straight up out of the water into the air and fly.</li> <li>Pelagic Cormorants are not naturally water-proof and must spend time preening and grooming their feathers with oil collected from a gland at the base of the tail.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The pelagic cormorant is the smallest and most delicate of the north Pacific cormorants. It is slender in appearance, with a long tail, a slim dark bill, and a head that is no wider than its neck. When in flight, the head and neck are held out in a straight profile parallel to the water. Basic plumage is black with a glossy iridescent green and violet-bronze on the body, and violet-purple on the neck. Breeding plumage is similar to basic plumage but also includes white flank patches, red facial skin at the base of bill, double head crests, and white plumes along the neck and upper-back region. Immature birds are dark brown, with the same proportions as adults. Other coastal cormorants are bulkier, with slower wingbeats.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The pelagic cormorant's range extends from the Chukchi and Bering Seas south along the North American Pacific coast to Baja California, and along the Asian coast to southern China. The breeding range extends from north Alaska to the Aleutian Islands and south along the North American Pacific coast to Baja California, as well as, from the Bering Sea to Kurki Island and north Honshu, Japan. Its wintering range is from the Pribilof Islands to the Aleutian Islands and south along the North American Pacific coast to Baja California, as well as from the south Bering Sea along the eastern shores of Kamchatka and south to Hong Kong.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The pelagic cormorant in central and southern California breeds on the rocky shores and cliffs along the coast, but substantial colonies breed on San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Anacapa, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands from March to August. It is rarely seen farther than a few kilometers from land. As with all cormorants, due to their vestigal preen gland, their plumage is not waterproof. Thus, the birds return to a safe roost after foraging to preen and dry their feathers, typically adopting a spread-winged posture.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Cormorants have high energy needs for swimming and flying, and they cannot fast for long periods or store much body fat. The pelagic cormorants energy needs are further exacerbated due to its small size, which demands that its roosting and nesting sites are in close proximity to its foraging sites. The Pelagic Cormorant feeds mainly on nonschooling medium sized fish, but also consumes invertebrates, maine worms and crustaceans. It forages near shore along rocky substrate, and in California it is frequently seen along the fringes of kelp forests. It feeds only during the day and for short periods of time. To catch prey it dives deeply; birds have been taken in fishing nets at depths of 180 feet. This species' small size enables it to spring directly from the water, rather than paddling along the surface as other cormorants are required.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> About 25,000,pelagic cormorants breed along the Pacific coast of North America, excluding Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. About 60% of these are found in California. The initiation of pair formation and nest building varies geographically and relies heavily upon food supply. The southern range usually experiences earlier inititation dates, but on average breeding plumage is usually seen in February and nest building commences shortly thereafter.</p> <p>The male will select a nest site and start nest construction and is then assisted by the female. Nest sites may be used for successsive years but may also change between years. Nest sites are usually on narrow ledges on steep rocky cliffs. Nesting material consists of mainly grass and seaweed, and material will be added to the nest until the chicks fledge. Nests are usually conpact and saucer shape, and guano acts as a cement to hold it together and to the cliff. The nest is repaired and improved in each season if need be; it can thus grow up to 5 ft., but it usually does not grow from year to year.</p> <p>Egg laying usually takes place from early to late spring. Eggs are incubated between the feet and belly, and both sexes share incubation, brooding, and feeding duties. The clutch can range from 3 to 7 eggs but an average clutch is 3 to 4 eggs. Incubation lasts 3 to 4 weeks.</p> <p>At hatching, the young weigh somewhat more than an ounce and are naked, but they soon grow sooty-grey down feathers. In normal years, all young of a typical clutch may be raised successfully and fledge at 40-50 days after hatching. They reach sexual maturity at two years of age, and a maximum age of almost 18 years has been recorded in the wild.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Birds that breed from Washington southward are permanent residents, but birds breeding farther north migrate to winter in northern Washington waters. Breeding colonies disperse but pelagic cormorants south of the Monterey Bay area do not migrate but continue to forage along the rocky coastal areas following the most abundant prey.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Despite the fact that the population trend for the pelagic cormorant appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for vulnerable status. This numerous and widespread species has a very large range and is not considered threatened by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). The bulk of its population is found in the relatively inaccessible waters of the Bering Sea region; about 50,000 each breed in the Kuril Islands, the Bering Sea islands, and the U.S. state of Alaska and its offshore islands (including the Aleuts). Regardless, local populations may be all but wiped out temporarily by oil spills, and on a larger scale competition with gillnet fisheries and drowning in such nets is putting a limit to its stocks. The impact of El Nino on weather and food may also affect the local populations as previously evidenced by historical records. Intrusion in nesting areas by fishermen, kayakers and divers can also be disruptive. Fortunately, most breeding sites in southern California, including Channel Islands National Park are protected areas for this bird.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/pelagic-cormorant.htm\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/pelagic-cormorant.htm\">Birds of North America</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Arctocephalus townsendi</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Little is known about Guadalupe fur seals because they were hunted almost to extinction before researchers began to study them. Although named fur seals, Guadalupe fur seals are members of the otariidae family, meaning they are more like sea lions. They have long flippers and external ear flaps (unlike true seals that have short front flippers and ear holes). By looks alone, juvenile Guadalupe fur seals are very difficult to tell apart from juvenile California sea lions and northern fur seals. Increasing numbers have been seen on California's Channel Islands, and in recent years, several Guadalupe fur seals have stranded along the central California coast. It is not yet known whether these strandings are a result of El Niño events (warmer water pushing their prey northward) or a sign of Guadalupe fur seals returning to their former range. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Guadalupe fur seal was nearly hunted to extinction in the 1880's, with the known population numbering only 7 individuals in 1892. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Guadalupe fur seals breed on Isle de Guadalupe, Baja California, Mexico. But in 1997, a pup was born on San Miguel Island, California. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Mothers and pups identify each other by unique vocalizations and scent. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Guadalupe fur seals nurse their pups for 8 to 9 months.<sup>3</sup></li> <li>The seals are not migratory, but a male and his females will occasionally disperse to new areas. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>They can dive to a depth of 180 feet for about 2.5 minutes. <sup>2</sup></li> </ul> <br /> <br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The fur of Guadalupe fur seals is brownish gray dorsally, with a silvery and yellowish-gray \"mane\" on the nape of the neck. Their snouts are pointed, with a rust-orange color on the sides. This species has great sexual dimorphism. Adult males usually weigh about 275 pounds, and may get up to 350 pounds. Females weigh about 110 pounds, rarely over 120. Males grow to slightly over six feet in length and females to four and one half feet in length.<sup>6</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Guadalupe fur seals breed on Isla de Guadalupe and Isla Benito del Este off the coast of Baja California, Mexico.Guadalupe fur seals are sighted as far south as the Mexico / Guatemala border, and as far north as the Point Reyes National Seashore in California.In 1997 one Guadalupe fur seal was born on San Miguel Island off the California coast. <sup>3</sup><br />  </p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Guadalupe fur seals are found in coastal rocky habitats and caves in the tropical waters of the southern California/Mexico region. Their hauling out habitat is close to the water, as a means to keep cool and protect them from heat exhaustion, owing to their thick fur, which requires them to swim during the heat of the day to protect them from heat exhaustion. Even the territorial males must abandon their territories to cool off in the surf during the middle of the day. <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Guadalupe fur seals feed mainly at night on squid, mackerel, and lantern fish by diving up to depths of 65 feet (20 m).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Guadalupe Fur Seals are polygynous, with males establishing territories that are occupied by an average of six females. Pups are born from mid-June to August with a median birth date of 21 June. Male tenure on territories lasts at least as long as 31 days. Males defend territories with vocalizations, displays, and mutual displays with neighboring bulls. Fighting between males is rare once territories are established. Females select only male territories that provide cover and shade from the sun and all territories occupied by females are fronted by water and include tidal pools. Adult females enter the water daily, presumably for cooling, while otherwise \"ashore\" attending their pups. Most animals breed in small caves, grottos, and cliff and boulder areas on the rugged east coast of volcanic Guadalupe Island. A small breeding colony was discovered on the east side of the easternmost parts of the San Benitos Islands in 1997, and it appears to be growing annually. During the breeding season of 2007, Guadalupe Fur Seals were seen on the three islands of San Benito.<sup>5</sup></p> <p align=\"justify\">Females returning to the rookery for the first time usually arrive at night or early in the morning. Interest by a female to become pregnant once again occurs 5-10 days after a female gives birth, and females can leave for their first foraging trip right after mating, or stay on the colony for another few days before departing. Foraging and attendance patterns are not well-known but the limited information indicates that females may travel from 700 to 4,000 km during feeding trips lasting from 4 to 24 days. Pups are weaned at 9–11 months, and females with pups can be seen on or around the San Benito Islands throughout the winter and into the spring. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The species was considered extinct after most of the population was killed in 1928 but it was rediscovered in 1954. The Guadalupe fur seal is now fully protected by Mexican national legislation, the Isla de Guadalupe having been declared a pinniped sanctuary in 1975. It is protected in the U.S. portion of its range by Californian law, as a Threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and as a Depleted and Strategic species under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. <sup>4</sup></p> <p>According to the ICUN List of Threatened Species, the reduction of this species took place more than three generations (30 years) ago, and its population is now increasing. It is restricted to a single location during the breeding season, but there are no immediately obvious threats that seem likely to drive it to Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period;it is, however, close to meeting criterion D2 for Vulnerable, and so it is listed as Near Threatened. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/guadalupe-fur-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/guadalupe-fur-seal/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Arctocephalus_townsendi/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Arctocephalus_townsendi/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/guadalupefs.php\">http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/guadalupefs.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.pinnipeds.org/seal-information/species-information-pages/sea-lions-and-fur-seals/guadalupe-fur-seal\">http://www.pinnipeds.org/seal-information/species-information-pages/sea-lions-and-fur-seals/guadalupe-fur-seal</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2061/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2061/0</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Enhydra lutris nereis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Today in California, the sea otter is a beloved and almost an iconic marine mammal that plays an important role in influencing and bringing about public policy for the protection of all marine mammals. An occasional visitor to the Channel Islands National Park, it is well-represented in coastal areas from Santa Barbara to just south of San Francisco.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sea otters are members of the weasel or mustelid family. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Sea otters have the thickest fur of any mammal, at 850,000 to one million hairs per square inch. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Adult sea otters can eat 25%-30% of their body weight in one day. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Sea otters are one of the few animals to use tools. They eat animals with shells, like clams and abalone, and use a stone to break open the shells. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Sea otters are the smallest marine mammal. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>The maximum estimated lifespan of sea otters is 23 years in the wild. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Great white sharks are one of the primary predators of sea otters. <sup>4</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, “The sea otter is the most changed of its weasel family origins. The muzzle has a set of thick vibrissae (whiskers). The large head has a blunt snout, and is connected to the body by a short, stocky neck. The forelimbs are short and similar to those of other otters, with a loose flap of skin under each that is used to store food. The hind limbs are large and flattened like flippers; they are oriented backwards. Although the short tail is not noticeably tapered, it is flattened top to bottom into a paddle-like structure.<br /> <br /> The pelage (fur) of sea otters is the densest of any mammal (850,000 to one million hairs per square inch). A layer of sparse guard hairs overlays the dense underfur. Sea otters are completely covered with fur, except for the nose pad, inside of the ear flaps, and the pads on the bottom of the feet. The color of the fur is dark brown to reddish brown. Older individuals become grizzled, with the fur around the head, neck, and shoulders becoming almost white.<br /> <br /> Male sea otters reach lengths of nearly 5 feet and weigh up to 100 pounds. Females can be up to 4 and ½ feet and weigh up to 70 pounds. Newborn sea otter pups weight ranges from about 2 to 4 and ½ pounds.” <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Historically, the California sea otter’s ranged from Punta Abreojos, Baja California, Mexico to northern California and the offshore islands that are now Channel Islands National Park. Due to a period of extensive hunting for sea otter pelts, known as \"the Great Hunt\" between 1741 and 1911, the world population plummeted to as little as 1000 individuals. In 1938, the population in California was only about 50 animals. Presently, through restoration efforts, the sea otter has been increasing in the nearshore area waters along the mainland coastline of California from San Mateo County to Santa Barbara County. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Sea otters inhabit temperate coastal waters with rocky or soft sediment ocean bottom. They live in offshore forests of giant kelp and spend most of their active time foraging below the canopy. They eat, rest, and groom themselves at the water surface. While sea otters are capable of diving to depths of at least 45 meters, they prefer coastal waters up to 30 meters deep. The shallower the water, the less time is spent diving to reach food.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> An According to information provided by the Animal Diversity Web, through the University of Michigan Zoology Department, “the sea otters are carnivorous. They will eat nearly any fish or marine invertebrate they can find in their kelp forest foraging grounds. Their diet consists of marine invertebrate herbivores and filter feeders such as sea urchins, sea stars, limpets, coast mussels, chitons, and purple-hinged rock scallops. Otters also eat crabs, octopus, squid, and fish. Individuals tend to be specialized in their choice of prey; one otter may consume only urchins and crabs while another may eat mostly fish, depending on the abilities of the individual and local food availability. Otters consume 20 to 25% of their body weight each day. They obtain most of their water from prey but also drink seawater to satisfy thirst<br /> <br /> Sea otters commonly feed in small groups. Hunting occurs on the sea floor. They use their sensitive whiskers to locate small creatures in the dense kelp beds and crevices. They use their small, agile forepaws to capture prey and to rub, roll, twist, and pull apart prey. Sea otters collect invertebrates in loose folds of skin under their armpits and eat at the surface. The feeding process, including foraging, eating, and cleaning their fur after a meal, lasts 2 to 3 hours. Sea otters usually eat 3 to 4 times a day.<br /> <br /> Sea otters break open prey items with hard shells or exoskeletons with a rock. Some otters hold the rock on their chest and drive the prey into the rocks. Others leave the prey on their chests and hit the prey with the rocks. The same rock is kept for many dives. Otters often wash their prey by holding it against their body and turning in the water. Males steal from females if they get a chance. For this reason, females tend to forage in separate areas.” <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Sea otters can reproduce year round. The peaks of birth in California are from January to March. Sea otters are one of several species of mammals that undergo delayed implantation in which the embryo does not implant during the immediate period following fertilization, but remains in a state of suspended growth allowing for birth to occur under favorable conditions. Females usually give birth about once a year, though many females experience longer breeding intervals, giving birth every 2 years. A single pup is born weighing from 3 to 5 pounds. Twins occur in 2% of births, but only one pup can be raised successfully.<br /> <br /> Male sea otters do not provide any care to their offspring. Pups are weaned at around 6 months of age but start to eat solid foods shortly after birth. Females carry their pups on their bellies while they nurse. Their milk is 20 to 25% fat. While a mother is foraging, she wraps her pup in kelp at the water surface to keep it from drifting away. At any sign of a predator, the female clamps onto her pup’s neck with her mouth and dives. Females groom their pups extensively for 3 months as their coat develops. A pup’s coat traps air, which keeps the animal afloat. Pups start diving at 2 months of age. The pup remains dependent on the mother for about 6 to 8 months. <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The southern sea otter is designated a fully protected mammal under California state law (California Fish and Game Code §4700) and was listed as a threatened species in 1977 (42 FR2965) pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). As a consequence of its threatened status, the southern sea otter is considered by default to be a “strategic stock” and “depleted” under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.). <sup>2</sup><br /> <br /> Based upon a 2010 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN) list of threatened species considers the sea otter to be endangered due its vulnerability to large-scale population declines. The species is believed to have undergone a decline exceeding 50% over the past 30 years (approximately three generations). Recent studies have found infectious disease to be an important mortality factor in California Sea Otter populations. Around 280 Sea Otters found dead have been linked “to a pair of protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Sacrocystis neurona.</p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/\">Marine Mammal Center</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/\">Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World</li> <li><a href=\"https://lsa.umich.edu/ummz/\">Animal Diversity Web</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\">The IUCN List of Threatened Species</a></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Uta Stansburinia</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The interesting and unique side-blotched lizard is found on both Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands in the national park, as well on the southern Channel Islands of Catalina and San Clemente. It is a smallish lizard with novel mating behaviors that have been documented in recent studies. Although it is a common and widespread species on the mainland, it nevertheless has an important niche in the park's ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The specific epithet, stansburiana, is in honor of Captain Howard Stansbury of the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers, who collected the first specimens while leading the 1849-1851 expedition to explore and survey the Great Salt Lake of Utah. <em>Uta</em> is a reference to the state of Utah.</li> <li>Different color morphs, or types, occur in males of this species. Males can have yellow, orange or blue throats, each color indicative of a respective, unique mating strategy.</li> <li>Recent research on the different-colored males has revealed evidence of cooperative mating behavior in this species.</li> <li>Males use a push-up display to defend their territory.</li> <li>This lizard is short-lived, living only about one year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The side-blotched lizard is a small brownish gray lizard ranges from 1.5 - 2.5 inches long from snout to vent. It has small smooth granular scales on the back, larger scales on the head and limbs, a gular fold, a long thin tail and a dark blue-black mark on the sides of the chest behind the front limbs, which gives this lizard its name. This mark is sometimes faint or absent. The lizards overall color is brown, gray, yellowish, or black, with dark blotches, spots, and sometimes stripes. Often there is a double row of dark spots or wedges on the back, edged with white on the rear. The underside is whitish to gray and mostly unmarked. The throat is mottled with dark and light. Males are more colorful than females, having blue speckles on the upper surfaces, which are most visible during the light phase. Males also have a swollen tail base and enlarged postanals, but no distinct blue coloring on the belly (which can be found on male lizards of many other species.) The throat is marked with blue, orange, or yellow. Males often have many blue speckles on the tail and the posterior of the body.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The side-blotched lizard is found throughout most of western North America. It is common to abundant throughoutarid and semi-arid regions of the state, excluding most of northern California, the Sacramento Valley, the Sierra-Cascade ranges, and several of the Channel Islands. Its elevation range extends from below sea level to over 8000 ft. Prefers open habitats including desert, coastal scrub, chaparral, grass, juniper, pine-juniper, Joshua tree and valley-foothill.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Side-blotched lizards are found in habitats comprising a wide variety of arid and semi-arid situations with scattered bushes and/or scrubby trees; soil may be sandy, gravelly, or rocky. The species is often found in sandy washes with scattered rocks and bushes. As a diurnal reptile, it is usually the first lizard species out in the morning due to its small size which allows it to warm up quickly. It is active mostly on the ground, but it is also a good climber. The side-blotched lizard is often seen basking on rocks, hopping from boulder to boulder, or running quickly along the ground.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Side-blotched lizards eat a wide variety of insects and other arthropods. Little time is spent foraging. Lizards feed opportunistically on any moving insect of suitable size that passes nearby as they bask or move about their home range. Food also includes scorpions, spiders, mites, ticks and sow bugs. Some vegetable material is eaten either accidentally or possibly for water.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Biologist Barry Sinervo from the University of California, Santa Cruz has discovered a rock-paper-scissors strategy in the mating behaviour of the side-blotched lizard species <em>Uta stansburiana</em>. Males have either orange, blue, or yellow throats and each type follows a fixed, heritable mating strategy. Orange-throated males are strongest and do not form strong pair bonds; instead, they fight blue-throated males for their females. Yellow-throated males, however, manage to snatch females away from them for mating. The large size and aggression is caused by high testosterone production. Blue-throated males are middle-sized and form strong pair bonds. While they are outcompeted by orange-throated males, they can defend against yellow-throated ones. Because blue-throated males produce less testosterone they are not as large as the orange-throated males, but it gives them the advantage of being less aggressive and able to form strong pair bonds. Yellow-throated males are smallest, and their coloration mimics females. This lets them approach females near orange-throated males and mate when the males are distracted. This is less likely to work with a female that has bonded with a blue-throated male.This can be summarized as \"orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange\", which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.</p> <p>The breeding season lasts from March to August. Mating occurs from April to May; egg deposition occurs from late April to August. Females store sperm for delayed fertilization. Side-blotched lizards are monogamous. Clutch size is positively related to size of female, winter rainfall and spring annual production, and inversely related to season and density. Clutch size varies from 1 to 8 eggs (average = 4). Hatchlings appear from June to late September. Development time also decreases with season and is 61 to 77 days. Males and females reproduce the first spring following hatching at approximately (1.72 in) snout-vent length.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the species <em>Uta Stansburinia</em> is of Least Concern owing to this lizards very large number of occurrences or subpopulations. The total adult population size is unknown but surely exceeds 1,000,000. The extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of subpopulations, and population size are large and relatively stable. Additionally, the species occurs in many protected areas, such as national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. No direct conservation measures are currently needed for this species as a whole.</p> <p>Side-blotched lizards are monitored annually on Anacapa Island in the park, as part of the park's long-term ecological monitoring program. Transects of coverbaords have been placed in several habitat types, and the number and size of lizards found under the coverboards is recorded several times per year.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/u.s.elegans.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/u.s.elegans.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_side-blotched_lizard\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_side-blotched_lizard</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/lizardland/male_lizards.overview.html\">Overview of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Lizards</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/64180/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/64180/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17658\">California Department of Fish and Game Report</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.tws-west.org/transactions/Tietje%20Vreeland.pdf\">http://www.tws-west.org/transactions/Tietje%20Vreeland.pdf</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Elgaria m.multicarinata</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The southern alligator lizard is found on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands in the national park as well as almost any natural habitat in California (except most of the deserts and very high elevations.) They can be fairly large in size. Active during daylight, they are frequently seen moving on the ground, and occasionally up in bushes. They are also often found underneath debris, beach driftwood, and near human settlements. Alligator lizards do not typically bask in the sun out in the open or on top of a rock like many other lizard species. They seem to prefer sunny spots with some cover nearby. This is a lizard that is often seen in yards and garages in Southern California.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Alligator lizards live up to 15 years.</li> <li>Just like snakes, alligator lizards shed their skin in a single intact piece by essentially turning it inside out as they crawl out of it.</li> <li>Observations suggest that they are able to eat animals close to or greater than their own body length.</li> <li>As with most lizards, they may detach their tail deliberately as a defensive tactic, however the tail will grow back, although generally not as perfectly as the original.</li> <li>Tail regeneration is energetically expensive. Reproductive fitness and survival have been shown to be decreased during the regeneration process.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Alligator lizards have slender gray-brown colored bodies, although juveniles are marked differently than adults with a broad stripe on the back of tan, reddish, yellow, gray, or beige and side bars may be less distinct. In size they range from 2 7/8 - 7 inches in snout to vent length and up to approximately 12 inches in total length. With their large heads and powerful jaws, alligator lizards are capable of inflicting a nasty and painful bite. Their limbs are short, but alligator lizards have long tails, sometimes as much as twice the body length.</p> <p><strong>Range Distribution</strong><br /> The species <em>Elgaria multicarinata</em> ranges from southern Washington mostly west of the Cascades and Sierras into northwestern Baja California, including some of the Channel Islands. In his 2003 field guide, Robert C. Stebbins, noted herpetologist, states that this species occurs from sea level to 5,000 feet, but has been observed by others at 6,200 ft. and there are unconfirmed reports of their occurrence as high as 8,000 ft.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Preferred habitat for alligator lizards includes grassland, open forest and chaparral, and they are also found in foothill oak woodlands. Inidividuals can be found under rocks, logs, boards, trash, and other surface cover.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The alligator lizard is carnivorous, feeding on various invertebrate species, and occasionally on w small, young mammals and birds. Of their invertebrate prey, insects and their larvae, especially ground beetles, grasshopper and crickets, are prominent in their diet. Aligagtor lizards eatoOther arthropods, such as spiders (including black widow spiders), centipedes, scorpions, sow bugs andsnails. Frog tadpoles, when they occur near alligator lizard habitat, are sometimes taken as well. Observations suggest that they eat animals close to or greater than their own body length. Some reports suggest bird eggs are eaten; other studies question this. Cannibalism for this species is not uncommon, as young adults are often preyed upon by mature adults. Other lizards, especially western skinks, are also a food source for the alligator lizard owing to the fact that they can be active when other kinds of lizards need to rest.</p> <p>It has been shown that movement of prey helps to stimulate feeding behavior by alligator lizards, but they can also consume non-moving food such as spider egg contents, dead lizards, baby mice, and insects. Edible objects are approached and visually inspected by moving the head up and down, side-to side, or in small circles to judge size and distance . Being satisfied, the lizard then inspects with the tongue if possible. When ready to strike, the lizard arches its back upward, straightens the front limbs, bends the head and neck downwards, and attacks with a swift downward stroke.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Alligator lizards will hibernate in underground dens during cold winter months, emerging in early spring. Mating is thought to generally occur between April and May. Unlike some lizard species that engage in elaborate mating displays, breeding behavior of alligator lizard males is more succinct. They simply pursue a female of interest, and mating ensues. In an unexpected behavior, observations show that females share egg-laying sites. Interestingly, significant differences exist for number of clutches between populations of <em>Elgaria</em> in different areas. Normally 5 to 20 eggs laid between May and June and July. Eggs are placed in rock crevices orburrows of rodents. The lizards hatch after 11 weeks and are about one and one-third inches in length,weighing about 2 ounces. The alligator lizard reaches its maturity in about 18 months and can live as long as 15 years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The alligator lizard is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/e.m.multicarinata.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/e.m.multicarinata.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheet.htm\">http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheet.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/63703/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/63703/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/794874/details\">http://eol.org/pages/794874/details</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Due to their relative isolation and protection, the tidepools in Channel Islands National Park are some of the best within southern California. Anemones, sea stars, urchins, limpets, periwinkles, chitons, barnacles, mussels, and many other beautiful species can be seen at numerous pristine tidepool sites. The most accessible sites include: Frenchy's Cove on Anacapa Island; Smuggler's Cove on Santa Cruz Island; Becher's Bay at the pier, Southeast Anchorage, East Point on Santa Rosa Island; eastern end of Cuyler Harbor on San Miguel Island. Check with the park's boat and plane concessionaires for trips to these tidepooling areas.</p> <p>The area between the land and the sea is not distinct, but is a zone of transition. This area may be covered with water during high tide or exposed to sunlight during low tide. Life in this intertidal region must be the hardiest within the marine environment-able to withstand hours of exposure and the incessant pounding of the energy-filled surf.</p> <p>Intertidal life has adapted to the sea and the land. When looking at a tidepool area, notice how plants and animals may be found in certain areas and not in others. Those living in the upper splash zone are tolerant to sunlight, heat, and water loss and have either a means to \"shelter\" themselves or the ability to move into an area of greater moisture. An animal with a tightly closed shell or a shell firmly attached to rock will hold water within, so that it does not require water surrounding it at all times. Animals found in rock crevices and submerged pools usually require more moisture to prevent them from drying out.</p> <p>How an animal feeds often depends on its ability to move. An animal that moves about is able to search for its food. Some graze the rocks for algae, while others feed on settled debris. An animal that remains stationary feeds on food particles suspended within water.</p> <p>Because space is a limiting factor, there is competition between organisms. Many animals and plants are found in a small area, some may live on each other, or use an old shell as a surface on which to live. This is one important reason why collecting is not permitted-you may be taking away a home.</p> <p>Although hardy against the forces of nature, the plants and animals of the intertidal zone cannot entirely endure the impact of humans. Since individuals interact with one another, minute changes in the area could disrupt the entire community. While exploring, please keep in mind these tidepool tips:</p> <ul> <li>Watch your step! The rocks can be very slippery and there may be small animals on the rocks.</li> <li>Keep an eye on the waves. The surge can sneak up on you.</li> <li>Take your time and look carefully. Tidepool organisms are often very small and camouflaged.</li> <li>Do not collect anything! Not only is it unlawful, but if animals and shells are taken, there may be nothing left for others to enjoy.</li> <li>If you pick up an animal to observe, please place it back where it was found. That particular spot is its home territory.</li> <li>Although you may not know the animals by name, through simple observation a great deal of information can be learned. Consider, for example, what keeps it from drying out? Why doesn't it get swept out to sea? Does it search for food or wait for food to come to it?</li> </ul>",

The Santa Cruz big-eared bat colony is one of only a handful known in the state of California.</p> <p>Quick and Cool Facts</p> <ul> <li>A Townsend's big-eared bat's average lifespan is 16 years; bats may live up to 30 years.</li> <li>Highly maneuverable flyer; capable of flying at slow hovering speeds.</li> <li>Large ears funnel sound into ear canal, and may also provide lift during flight and assist with temperature regulation.</li> <li>Townsend's big-eared bats are very sedentary, with movement by females during the nursing season rarely exceeding 15 km., and movement at other times usually being less than 50 km.</li> <li>When it's roosting or hibernating, Townsend's big-eared bat curls up its long ears so they look like ram's horns.</li> <li>When flying they can rapidly extend or contract their ears. When flying with their ears extended the ears point forward and are nearly parallel to their body.</li> <li>They do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do, but prefer open roosting areas in large rooms with their fur erect to provide maximum insulation and with their ears coiled back.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Townsend's big-eared bats, previously called lump-nosed bats, are a medium-sized bat with very long ears. Their fur is pale gray or brown above and buff colored on the underside. This bat's ears are enormous, reaching a length of 38 mm. When the ears are laid back they extend to the middle of its body. The face is marked by two large glandular lumps on either side of its nose.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Townsend's big-eared bat occurs throughout the west and is distributed from the southern portion of British Columbia south along the Pacific coast to central Mexico and east into the Great Plains, with isolated populations occurring in the central and eastern United States.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, big-eared bats are found only on Santa Cruz Island. The species was first observed in 1939 on Santa Cruz Island in a historic 2-story ranch house at Prisoner's Harbor, which hosted a large maternity colony of over 300 individuals. Subsequent studies showed that the population resided in the same area until 1974, when the structure was removed. From 1974 to 1988, no other Townsend's Big-eared Bats were seen on Santa Cruz Island, before Dr. Pat Brown of UCLA, in 1991, was made aware of a colony of Townsend's roosting in the bakery room of the Scorpion adobe building. Presently, a large maternity colony continues to use the building and, occasionally, the rock caves in the Scorpion area. According to the 1994 Department of Fish and Game report, the Scorpion roost is one of only two or three coastal maternity colonies known to exist south of Pt. Conception.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Big-eared bats have been reported in a wide variety of habitat types ranging from sea level to 3,300 meters. Habitat associations include: coniferous forests, mixed meso-phytic forests, deserts, native prairies, riparian communities, active agricultural areas, and coastal habitat types. Distribution is strongly correlated with the availability of caves and cave-like roosting habitat, with population centers occurring in areas dominated by exposed, cavity forming rock and/or historic mining districts. They prefer open roosting areas in large rooms and do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Radio-tracking has shown that the Scorpion bats forage up to 5 kilometers away to feed on moths and other insects among the native oak and ironwood forest on the north-facing slopes of Scorpion Canyon, returning to the roost each morning. In contrast to other southwest bats, due to its relatively poor urine concentrating ability, it drinks water.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Winter hibernation colonies are comprised of males and females and range in size from a few individuals to several hundred bats. If undisturbed, colonies will occupy the same site indefinitely.</p> <p>In the summer, the females form a nesting roost. Males are solitary during the maternity periods. The maternity colonies consist of one or more small clusters, which rarely exceed 100 bats. Females are alert and active in the maternity roosts and prefer dark places for their roosts. These colonies form between March and June (depending on climate), with pups born between May and July. Maternity colonies choose sites that have warm, stable temperatures for pup rearing. Female bats usually only have one young a year. The newborns range in weight from 2.1-2.7 grams. There is a strong maternal bond and the young bats squawk when the mother is away. The young bats, however, grow quickly, being able to fly within three weeks. After two months, many of the young bats have left the nursery roosts, with male bats leaving before female. In their first year, male bats are almost certainly incapable of breeding while female bats are able to reproduce at the age of four months.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Historically, this species has declined due to direct killing by people and because of destruction or disturbance of roost sites. These animals are sensitive to light and movement so if they are disturbed during the day, they awake and their ears begin to move as they try to identify the intruder. If the disturbance occurs for more than a few seconds, the entire group takes flight and the roost may be abandoned.</p> <p>A study sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Game in the late 1980's documented a population decline of 40-60% in the past 30 years. Only about half of the maternity colonies known to exist in California prior to 1980 were active by 1991, resulting in an estimated 54% decline of adult females. Only three maternity colonies increased in size during the period, and all three are located in National Park areas (Point Reyes National Park, Lava Beds National Monument, and Pinnacles National Monument). Of the 23 roosts that are no longer available to bats, 9 (mostly buildings) have been demolished, 4 (all buildings) have burned, 4 (all buildings) have been renovated in such a way that bats were excluded, and 6 (including buildings, caves, mines, and a water diversion tunnel) have had the entrance closed.</p> <p>Consequently, for this species to exist, it is essential that human disturbance is minimized and the habitat preserved.</p> <p>Human intervention may have helped conserved the population on the west coast of North America, because man-made structures provide a shelter for big-eared bats.1 Channel Islands National Park staff continues with a program of monitoring and surveying this species to ensure its well-being.</p> <p>In 2008, the ICUN listed this species as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, the occurrence in a number of protected areas and because it wasis unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. However, today the Townsend's Big-eared Bat, is state-listed as an Endangered species in Washington, a Sensitive species in Oregon, and as a Species of Special Concern in Texas, Montana and California, and they are on the Blue List in British Columbia.</p> <p>Additional Information</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html\">www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php\">www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html\">http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html</a></li> <li>California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System, California Department of Fish & Game, California Interagency Wildlife Task Group, M037, Updated by CWHR Program Staff, May 2000</li> <li><a href=\"http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2\">http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li>British Colombia, Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks. 1998. <em>Wildlife at Risk: Townsend's Big-eared Ba</em>t.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Eumetopias jubatus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Steller sea lions are the largest members of the Otariid, or “eared seal,” family. Steller sea lions that are also known as northern sea lions are sometimes confused with California sea lions, but are much larger and lighter in color. At one time, this species were found here in abundance. Only an occasional male Steller sea lion has been seen since the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Steller sea lions are the largest of the sea lions.</li> <li>They have thick, hairy necks that look like a lion's mane.</li> <li>They don't need to drink water - they get all the water they need from the food they eat.</li> <li>Male Steller sea lions don't eat during the breeding season. They care more about protecting their territory and making sure their females don't run off with another male!</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Steller sea lion is called “seevitchie” by the Aleuts and “sivuch” by the Russians, each translating to “seawolf.” The name that the animal now bears comes from George Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist aboard the 1741 Vitus Bering expeditions. Steller thought the creature resembled a lion because the male’s large neck and shoulder region look similar to the mane of a lion.<br /> Steller sea lions, being otariids or eared seals, differ from the phocids, or “earless” seals, by having visible external ear flaps and long hind flippers that can be turned under, making travel on land easy. Steller sea lions are light tan to reddish brown in color. Males are visibly larger and appear lighter in color than females. Female sea lions average seven feet in length and about 600 pounds. Male sea lions, slightly longer at nine feet, weigh more than twice as much as females at an average of 1,500 pounds with “beach masters” reaching up to 2,400 pounds. Juveniles are chocolate brown in color and appear in early June. Pups stay dark for their first four to six months and then molt to a lighter color. Males are visibly larger and appear lighter in color than females. Juveniles are chocolate brown in color and appear in early June. Pups stay dark for their first four to six months and then molt to a lighter color.<sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Steller sea lions live in an arc around the north Pacific from central California to Japan. The animals seen in our area of Alaska are from the western stock. Steller sea lions do not migrate, but individuals disperse widely outside of breeding season. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In early May, adult male sea lions haul out on established rookeries to claim their area. A returning bull will attempt to reclaim a spot he has held in past years. Eventually, he will be too old (between 13 to 15 years) to compete and will spend his retirement at a haul-out or possibly hold down some less desirable territory at the rookery edge. Haul-outs and rookeries are mostly located on remote and rocky coasts and islands with easy access to the open sea.<sup> 1</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Steller sea lions are opportunistic marine carnivores. Their most important prey species include: pollock, Atka mackerel, pacific herring, capelin, pacific sandlance, pacific cod, and salmon. Haul-outs and rookeries are mostly located on remote and rocky coasts and islands with easy access to the open sea. Steller sea lions often feed at night, but hunt schooling prey by day in large groups. It is believed that group feeding may help in controlling the movement of schooling fish and prey. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> In the years 1976 and 1977, there was a warming period in the Gulf of Alaska waters. This warming lessened the availability of some of the sea lion’s prey, specifically oily fish like sandlance, white capelin, and herring. Sea lions now rely on pollock as a main dietary source. This diet switch may be a contributing factor in the decline of the sea lion as pollock lacks the oil critical to the maintenance of sea lion blubber. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Female Steller sea lions are sexually mature at four to six years of age. Bulls become mature at three to eight years, but cannot defend territory until they are nine or 10 years old. The competition for territory consists of aggressive displays: roaring, hissing, and chest-to-chest confrontations with open mouths that sometimes end in severe injury. The victor stays out of the water as long as months before any females visit him. Male sea lions fast during this time. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> In late May or early June, female sea lions arrive at the rookery. Their main objective is to find a good beach on which to give birth. The male with the best birthing territory ends up with the most females. Just 10 to 14 days after giving birth, the female is ready to mate. After fertilization occurs, the embryo develops for a few weeks and then stops. After three to four months, in September or early October, the embryo implants in the uterine wall and resumes growing. This delayed implantation allows the pups to be born at an optimal time. Total gestation time is 11 and one half months. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> Pups, usually one per female and weighing 35 to 50 pounds, are born mid-May to mid-July. For five to 13 days the mother stays with the pup; she then leaves the pup alone while she goes out to forage. At 10 to 14 days the pups form groups of their own—sleeping and playing together while the mothers forage. Pups are able to crawl and swim soon after birth but do not enter the water for about four to six weeks. The mother and pup find each other through scent and vocalizations. Pups will sometimes approach other females, but females will not accept pups that are not their own. A pup will continue nursing from the mother even after it starts foraging on its own. Some pups nurse until the mother’s next birth and some until they are three years old. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> In the 1960s, there were between 250,000 and 300,000 Steller sea lions worldwide. The Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands historically contained the largest percentage of this population. In 1977, this area contained 74 percent of the global population, but by 1989 it dropped to 56 percent. In 1990, the Steller sea lion was listed as threatened throughout its range. Later studies of mitochondrial DNA from Steller sea lions suggest that there are at least two stocks, an eastern stock (California through Southeast Alaska) and a western stock (Prince William Sound and areas west). The decline was happening solely to the western stock and in 1997, the listing of the western stock was reclassified as endangered. <sup>2</sup><br /> <br /> The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (ICUN), Red List Category & Criteria states that based upon current trends this species is declared near threatened. This assessment was made in June of 2012. This is a dramatic change from the 20 year downward trend in species numbers beginning in the late 1970s.<br /> In explanation Steller sea lions experienced a dramatic and unexplained population decline of about 70% between the late 1970s and 1990 with the steepest decline occurring between 1985 and 1989 when the population was reduced by 15% per year. The population reached its low point in approximately 2000 and has shown an overall annual increase of 1.5–2% since that year. However, in the western Aleutian and Commander islands the trends have continued to show persistent declines. Overall, the Asian portion of the population declined through the 1990s and began to slowly increase in 2000 due to increases in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands. The decline of the 1980s and 1990s weights the trend such that the subspecies has experienced a population reduction of 57% during the last three generations (1981–2011), which qualified the species for Endangered. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>Write up by Kenai Fjord NP - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion-decline.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion-decline.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/steller-sea-lion/?\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/steller-sea-lion/?</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller_sea_lion\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller_sea_lion</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8239/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8239/0</a></li> </ol>",

Meriwether Lewis gives a brief description in his journal when he writes on September 7, 1803, that he and his men “passed Charles town on the E. shore above the mouth of Buffaloe over which there is built a handsome wooden bridge, this has the appearance of a handsome little Village, containing about forty houses.” Notably, Patrick Gass, a sergeant and the chief carpenter of the expedition, later settled in Wellsburg, where he died in 1870 at the age of 98. He was the oldest surviving member of the expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{562258c8-8b6b-4ab4-9ef2-0a0b905e9301}{151}\" paraid=\"222227026\">Wellsburg boasts a number of historic locations for visitors to see. In 1982, the Wellsburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Included in this section of the town are Millers Tavern and the Wellsburg Wharf, both notable for predating the expedition and among the collection of village structures noted by Lewis. Millers Tavern, built in 1797, houses the Brooke County Historical Museum. Also located in the historic district is the Patrick Gass Cottage, originally built 1797, which Gass occupied during the final decades of his life. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Larus occidentalis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Western gulls are the most abundant breeding seabird in the Channel Islands National Park, with a population estimated at more than 15,000. The western gull, a big bulky bird, is a bold, skillful hunter and scavenger. For the most part, western gulls are coastal dwellers that concentrate mainly in the Southern California area. Due to their opportunistic nature and adaptability, they can also thrive in an urban environment. Unfortunately, because of close proximity to human environs, they are also subject to abnormal environmental pressures.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Found along the along Pacific Coast of North America with breeding sites from central Baja California north to Washington.</li> <li>Relatively limited in distribution compared to most North American gulls.</li> <li>Large colonies are found on Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands.</li> <li>Western Gulls nest on offshore islands, rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries.</li> <li>They nest on the ground and fill the nest with vegetation, feathers, rope, plastic, or other items they find.</li> <li>In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood.</li> <li>The female-biased sex ratio of some western gull colonies may have been the result of pollution by pesticides that acted like estrogen and made some male embryos develop as females.</li> <li>It takes four years for a western gull to achieve its gray and white appearance.</li> <li>They can live up to 25 years old.</li> <li>Western gulls feed only on the ocean's surface and do not dive like many other seabird species.</li> <li>Like most gulls, the western gull is an opportunistic feeder, capturing its own live prey, scavenging refuse, or stealing food from seals and other gulls.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The adult western gull has a deep gray back and wings, with black wing-tips that blend into the rest of the wing, unlike many species where the black is clearly defined. The underwing is white with a narrow band of gray. The head is mostly white, with a limited amount of brown streaking, especially in non-breeding plumage. The large bill is yellow with a red spot, and the eye is dark yellow. The western gull is a four-4 year gull, meaning that it takes four years to achieve adult plumage. Juveniles are mottled brown, with a dark bill and dark eyes, and pinkish-gray legs. This plumage varies and takes on more of the adult plumage characteristics in each successive year.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The western gull is confined to the immediate Pacific coast and its adjacent waters. The islets of Anacapa, which is part of the Channel Islands National Park, hosts the largest protected breeding colony of western gulls in the world with over 10,000 gulls gathering during nesting season from May through July. There is also a sizeable colony of western gulls (approximately 7,000 pairs) on Santa Barbara Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Western gulls spend their life along the ocean and its adjacent waters. They usually breed on near-shore islands and human-made structures, but search for food at sea, along estuaries, and on the shoreline. Wintering gulls may move farther out to sea, but also forage and rest on buildings, parking lots, seaside parks, landfills, and jetties.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Western gulls feed over the open ocean or along rocky shores. When the western gull spots its prey, it captures it by pecking, grabbing, and shallow diving. The bird's omnivorous diet includes squid, clams, mussels, sea urchins, eggs, chicks, adult birds, zooplankton, and small fish like anchovy, whiting, eel, and rockfish. Other oceanic species use the western gull to find prey. In turn, this gull may follow seals to locate food. This resourceful bird scavenges the carcasses of large mammals and when their normal sources of food are diminished, gulls are quick to take advantage of an easy food source such as trash and leftover scraps. By exploiting unnatural food resources their population may be growing larger than it would naturally thus upsetting the ecosystem balance.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Western gulls choose a nest site out of the wind, and out of sight from other gulls. In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood. In late April or May, the female lays two to three light olive to green eggs with dark markings. Both parents incubate; after 4 -5 weeks the gray, downy chicks with black spots hatch. Within a day, the chicks can walk and soon leave the nest. They freely scramble after regurgitated food. If the third chick is not fed enough, it may leave the territory. Neighboring gulls sometimes kill wayward chicks, but adoption is frequent. Chicks play by chasing or tugging on objects. Juveniles fledge in about seven weeks and are usually fed for three months, but sometimes follow adults and beg for up to six months.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Many western gulls do not migrate; the rest cover very short distances to remain on the Pacific coast of North America. Some move south of the breeding range into Baja California. Fall movements peak in October and most adult birds return to their breeding grounds in March.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Populations of western gulls have restricted range and therefore, are vulnerable to oil pollution, ocean acidification, and climate change. In addition, they have also suffered from human disturbances and in the past, introduced black rats on Anacapa Island. Visit Seabirds for more information about restoration activities on Anacapa to remove black rats.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Reithrodontomys megalotis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse is the smallest of the rodent species found in Channel Islands National Park. It occurs only on Santa Cruz Island within the park, but also on Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands. The species may have reached San Clemente Island via hay bales in the 1930s, whereas harvest mice may have been inadvertently introduced to Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina in native American canoes.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>In 1951, noted zoologist and professor at UC Berkeley, Dr. Oliver Pearson, named and described this species on the islands.</li> <li>The western harvest mouse has a broad range in western North America but is only found only on three of the eight Channel Islands-Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente Islands.</li> <li>Females can breed at 4 months of age, and in a year will have from two to three litters.</li> <li>The western harvest mouse appears to be strictly nocturnal.</li> <li>The initial census of this species on the islands thought the numbers to be very small, which subsequently proved inaccurate.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse is a slim, medium sized mouse with adult lengths ranging from 4 ½ to 6 ½ inches in length and weight from 3 to 8 ounces. It is distinguishable from the island deer mouse by its smaller head, body size and it's relatively much longer tail, including the grooves on the anterior face of the upper incisors. It has a brownish back, buff-colored sides, and a white underside. There is an indistinct dark broad stripe along its spine. The tail is from about 2 to 4 inches in length, sparsely haired, dorsally grey while white underneath. The ears are naked giving them a prominent, flesh-color or a buffy-cinnamon color. The western harvest mouse only has 4 digits on the forefeet. The hind feet are ½ inch to ¾ inch in length with 5 digits.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse, besides having a range through much of western North America, is distributed throughout California. It is common to abundant in shrub lands, grasslands, and in early several stages of most habitats statewide (except at some high elevations, although lower than 1600 feet).</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Across its range the western harvest mouse inhabits sagebrush, steppe, and agricultural areas. The western harvest mouse dwells in areas below 1600 feet. It forages in grasslands bordering riparian areas such as irrigation right of ways, coastal marshes, streams, or lakes. The western harvest mouse is often considered an edge species. It is important for the western harvest mouse to have shrub or grass overstory with tall lush herbaceous cover to conceal its nests. They typically build above-ground nests in dense grass or herbaceous vegetation.</p> <p>On Santa Cruz Island, their distribution was previously thought to be limited to the marsh area at Prisoner's Harbor. Recent surveys found them to be much more widely distributed on the island, but at relatively low numbers (especially when compared to the numerous island deer mice), due to their need for dense grass or herbaceous cover (which is patchily distributed on Santa Cruz. The species is more numerous on Santa Catalina Island, which may be an indication of that island's recovery from non-native grazers.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse appears to be strictly nocturnal. It is most active before midnight, on moonless or overcast nights. Minimum activity occurs between 6:00 am and noon. This mouse is active year round utilizing trails built by other small mammals. Their food is mostly vegetable matter, chiefly seeds, leaves, and stems of grasses and forbs, although occasionally insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets, and beetles, may be eaten.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse may have more than one nest within its home range to use as rest sites. The nests are about the size and shape of a baseball, consisting of grass lined with fine plant material. These nests are located on the ground in clumps of grass, shrubs, or logs, or hanging from vegetation. Each nest has a small entrance on its underside leading to a golf ball sized chamber lined with dandelion fluff or a similar material.</p> <p>The western harvest mouse has a high potential reproductive rate. Females can breed at 4 months of age. It births litters averaging 4 young, but ranging anywhere from 1-9 young. The female is able to become pregnant more than once a year, with a gestation period of 23 or 24 days. It breeds throughout the year with the exception of late winter in the southern part of its range. In northern parts of its range, this harvest mouse breeds only in late spring and summer (usually 2-3 litters).</p> <p>The young weigh ½ ounce or less at birth and are naked, pink, and blind. The mouse's eyes open 10-12 days after birth and they are weaned 19 days after birth. The western harvest mouse goes through 3 pelages: juvenile, sub-adult, and adult. The juvenile pelage is rather wooly and dull grey. The adult pelage is relatively brighter. Molting starts on the ventral surface and spreads over the flanks to meet on the back. A second point of origin is on the muzzle, the new coat spreads back forming a molt line behind the ears. This specie molts once annually during the summer.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN, (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources), this species is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and because it does not appear to be under threat and is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.</p> <p>In 1998 the California Department of Fish and Game considered the species to be one of special concern.</p> <p>The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island should improve habitat for harvest mice, which may become more widely and densely distributed on the island.</p> <p>Additional Information</p> <ul> <li>Jack C. von Bloeker, Jr. Land Mammals of the Southern California Islands</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.sibr.com/mammals/M113.html\">http://www.sibr.com/mammals/M113.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://iws.org/CISProceedings/7th_CIS_Proceedings/Drost_et_al.pdf\">http://iws.org/CISProceedings/7th_CIS_Proceedings/Drost_et_al.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328436/overview\">http://eol.org/pages/328436/overview</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www4.uwsp.edu/biology/facilities/vertebrates/mammals%20of%20wisconsin/reithrodontomys%20megalotis/reithrodontomys%20megalotis%20page.htm\">http://www4.uwsp.edu/biology/facilities/vertebrates/mammals of wisconsin/reithrodontomys megalotis/reithrodontomys megalotis page.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/\">http://www.dfg.ca.gov</a></li> <li>Terrestrial Mammal Species of Special Concern in California, Bolster, B.C., Ed., 1998</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/19410/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/19410/0</a></li> <li>Collins and George 1990: <a href=\"http://www.nhm.org/site/sites/default/files/pdf/contrib_science/CS420.pdf\">http://www.nhm.org/site/sites/default/files/pdf/contrib_science/CS420.pdf</a></li> </ul>",

During the breeding season, March through September, plovers can be seen nesting along the shores, peninsulas, offshore islands, bays, estuaries, and rivers of the United States' Pacific Coast.In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island.

Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Plovers are small birds with long, dark or grayish feet and legs, a short dark bill, large eyes, a rounded head, and long, narrow wings that end in a sharp point. These birds have cryptic coloration. The color of their dorsal areas matches and blends with their surroundings, making them well camouflaged and difficult to see against the sand. They turn away from predators, sometimes crouching to hide their darker head and breast markings. When the birds stop running they seem to disappear, blending into the surroundings.These little birds are sand-colored above and white below, with a narrow dark stripe on the forehead and a dark stripe behind the eyes. They have two, small, dark, partial breast bands and dark ear patches. In breeding season the distinctive markings are darker in males than in females. In winter the difference in sexes is less apparent.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Most western snowy plovers that breed in California's Central Valley and the Great Salt Lake migrate to California and Mexican coasts for the winter. During the winter months they rest and eat to build up their fat reserves for the migration to their summer breeding habitats. The California Pacific coast resident population usually congregates on sand spits and dune-backed beaches. In more urban areas they can be found on bluff-backed beaches.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island. On the Channel Islands they forage in the wet sand and amidst surf-cast kelp in the intertidal zone and in dry, sandy areas above the high tide. In winter, snowy plovers are found on many of the beaches used for nesting as well as on beaches where they do not nest, and on estuarine sand and mud flats.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Snowy plovers are primarily visual foragers, using the run-stop-peck method of feeding. They forage on invertebrates in the wet sand and amongst surf-cast kelp within the inter-tidal zone, in dry, sandy areas above the high tide, on salt pans, on spoil sites, and along the edges of salt marshes, salt ponds, and lagoons. They sometimes probe for prey in the sand and pick insects from low-growing plants. Western snowy plovers have a unique way to catch a meal of kelp or wrack flies. Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air. Adults forage on invertebrates primarily along the water's edge.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The nesting season extends from early March through September, with peak nesting occurring from mid-April through mid-August. Their nests typically are shallow scrapes or depressions on the ground on flat, open areas with sandy or saline substrates, where vegetation and driftwood is sparse or absent. Plover nests are camouflaged and are barely visible to even the well-trained eye. 7 Typically, the plover lays three highly camouflaged eggs in the incubating process;this takes about 28 days, with the females sit on the eggs during the day, the males at night. To distract a potential predator away from the nest, the snowy plover performs broken-wing displays. By acting injured the bird appears to be easy prey and the predator's attention is drawn to the bird. The snowy plover frequently raises two broods a year, and sometimes three in places where the breeding season is long.The female deserts her mate and brood about the time the chicks hatch and initiates a new breeding attempt with a different male.</p> <p>Snowy plover chicks are about the size of a person's thumb when they hatch. They leave their nest within three hours of hatching. They flatten themselves on the ground when a parent signals the approach of people or potential predators. They walk, run, and swim well and forage unassisted by parents, but require periodic brooding for many days after hatching. Chicks reach fledging age about one month after hatching.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Pacific coast population of the western snowy plover was listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. The population has declined due to many factors. Recreational and other human disturbance, loss of habitat to urban development, introduction of beachgrass and other nonnative species, and expanding predator populations have all contributed to a decline in active nesting areas and in the size of the breeding and wintering populations. It is estimated that about 2,000 snowy plovers may breed along the U.S. Pacific Coast and that there are 157 current or historical snowy plover breeding or wintering locations along the U.S. Pacific Coast (USFWS 2001).</p> <p>Channel Islands National Park is one of the few locations in southern California that still supports breeding and wintering populations of western snowy plovers. In the 1990s Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands had both breeding and wintering populations, but numbers have declined precipitously. A few birds also lived on The Nature Conservancy portion of Santa Cruz Island. On Santa Rosa Island the birds inhabited about 16 miles of coastline, while on San Miguel Island they were present on about 10 miles of shoreline (USFWS 2001). The Skunk Point area on Santa Rosa Island is an important nesting area and foraging area for juvenile and migrating plovers. Forty to fifty percent of the nests in this area have been found on rocky outcrops in the back dunes, about 490 to 980 feet (150 to 300 meters) from the shoreline (USFWS 1995).</p> <p>Much of the work done in the recovery and restoration of the western snowy plover on the west coast was based on a plan developed by the Pacific Coast Western Snowy Plover Recovery Team.This plan was acknowledged and utilized in 2007 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their effort as the spearhead in the recovery effort. Much of the plan was implemented by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.</p> <p>A survey was taken in May 2012 that found the overall numbers of western snowy plovers on the west coast to be 1855, which was an increase from the initial recovery program survey in 2005. It is also a significant improvement over the population number of 1537, the number of plovers found in 2007 when the restoration program began. However, the species showed disappointing decline from a count of 1917 plovers in 2011.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory</a></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/\">http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx\">http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx</a>?</em></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover\">http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html\">http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf</a></li> <li>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2007.

Other whale watch operators are located in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Channel Islands Harbors as well as down in the Los Angeles area.</em><br /> <br /> The waters surrounding Channel Islands National Park are home to many diverse and beautiful species of cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises). About one third of the cetacean species found worldwide can be seen right here in our own backyard, the Santa Barbara Channel. The 27 species sighted in the channel include gray, blue, humpback, minke, sperm, and pilot whales; orcas; Dall's porpoise; and Risso's, Pacific white-sided, common, and bottlenose dolphins.</p> <p>This diversity of cetacean species offers a great opportunity to whale watch year-round. The most common sightings are of gray whales from mid- to late-December through mid-March, blue and humpback whales during the summer, and common dolphins throughout the entire year. Whales and dolphins can be seen either from shore or from a boat. The best shore viewing is from a high spot on a point that juts out into the ocean. Some examples include Point Dume in Malibu, the Palos Verdes Peninsula near Los Angeles, and Point Loma in San Diego. The park visitor center has a tower with telescopes, which can be used for whale watching as well as island viewing. Watching in the early morning hours, before the wind causes whitecaps on the water's surface, will provide you with the best opportunity to see whales from shore.</p> <p>Closer viewing of whales is possible from public whale watching boats or private boats. Whales have been known to approach boats quite closely. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, boaters must stay at least 100 yards from whales unless the whale chooses to approach the boat.</p> <p>Many whales are on the endangered species list and should be treated with special care. All whales are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act; it is illegal to disturb or harm any marine mammal. Boaters who use private craft to watch whales must remember to stay at least 100 yards away from whales. Boaters who frighten or interrupt the whales' activities by approaching too close could drive the whales away from food or young calves. Please remember that whales are wild animals and can be unpredictable.</p> <p>We need to continue to explore the world of whales and dolphins. The well-being of the cetacean population is a good indication of the health of the ecosystem. Our ability to bring these species into the next century and beyond is an indication of the future of life on this planet. Every day we learn more about these mysterious and unique creatures that dwell beneath the water, yet rise above it to breathe.</p>",

Despite initial popularity, the Cliff House failed to hold people's attention into the 1870s. The management introduced a new strategy: the tried and true combo of booze and gambling. The rather obvious ploy backfired, and the Cliff House sank further into disfavor.<br /> <br /> That is until 1881, when the property was bought by self-made millionaire, philanthropist and one-day mayor of San Francisco, Adolph Sutro. Sutro reimagined the Cliff House closer to its original vision of a family-oriented place for wholesome entertainment. To help facilitate his business at the Cliff House, he bankrolled the construction of a railroad that would take people from San Francisco to Lands End, greatly increasing the number of people who could travel to the coast at a reasonable price. Everything was going smoothly until a fire burned the wood-frame Cliff House to the ground on Christmas Day, 1894.<br /> <br /> But Sutro was a lemons-to-lemonade kind of guy, and two years later opened a new 8-story castle-inspired Cliff House, complete with art galleries, a gem exhibit, ballrooms, bars and restaurants. Tragically, in 1907, fire again destroyed the second Cliff House. By that year, Sutro had died. His daughter, Emma Sutro Merritt, devised plans to build a third, less grandiose Cliff House made of fire-proof concrete and steel, which remains to this day.</p>",

In the early 1920s, Rudolph Agassiz hired well-known Cambridge, Massachusetts, landscape architect Warren H. Manning to design a park dedicated to his father and former C&H President, Alexander Agassiz. The full design was never realized, and today, a modern housing addition has encroached on the park's west end.",

The park is named after Alexander Agassiz, an immigrant form Switzerland who had an enormous impact on the Calumet and Hecla mining company and the Copper Country. The park features a large open area with three of the original starburst shaped paths running through it. Each of the paths are lined with trees.",

By 1908, there were four houses on lot 8, the south lot, and a four-story apartment building with two commercial storefronts had been constructed on the front half of lot 7, the north lot. This impressive building was probably built by the Vertin family. In 1908, the storefronts on lot 7 were occupied by a grocery store, and a tailor.     <br /> By 1917, there were four storefronts; two were occupied by barbers, one by a tailor, and one by a print shop. By 1928, Lot 8 was occupied by a one-story garage known as Taxi Pete’s. The lots now used for parking were once home to other historic buildings as well, including Gately-Wiggins Company’s three-story department store, the Swedish ME Church and parsonage, and two other houses. Taxi Pete’s, the Vertin apartment building, and the Gately-Wiggins store were all destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1972. The church and parsonage were later demolished.",

Inside, you would have found various items necessary for mining - from helmets and boots, to spare nuts and bolts.",

Tall windows on the first and second floors, run the length of the building and provided much needed natural light to this large industrial building. Two side entrances include a loading dock platform at the middle of the east side of the building with a small gabled entrance just to the north of the loading dock. A large gravel parking lot to the east of the building extends to Mine Street with trees and grass to the south of the parking lot. The pitched roof is a gray asphalt roof with a dormer at the center of the length of the building.",

The tracks have been removed, but the large doors allowing trains to pass through the building remain. The building is now privately owned. Please respect private property.",

This long rectangular building extends perpendicular to Red Jacket Road. Its main entrance is just of the road and consists of two large wooden doors with a person door located just to the right of it. Paneled windows almost completely coat the building near the roofline around its entirety. The warehouse is made from green-colored corrugated metal. The foundation is dark-grey poor rock with evident light-grey grout lines. The building has a very shallow pitched roof with corrugated metal on top.",

            "bodyText": "The Calumet & Hecla Mining Company built a massive railroad operation to transport copper ore from the mine to stamp mills and smelters, and to import other materials. The roundhouse was built to service this Hecla & Torch Lake Railroad. At the time most steam locomotives could only drive in one direction, so a turntable was needed for them to turn around. The circular house built around the table was often used for storage and servicing of railroad equipment. Altered for modern use, the rounded sides of the building indicate its former use beside a central turntable. The building is now privately owned. Please respect private property.",
            "audioDescription": "The Roundhouse is located at the corner of Depot Street and Mine Street. This building was originally constructed of dark-grey poor-rock but has received numerous additions and updates. This side of the building can be seen standing at the intersection of Depot and Mine Streets. The right side, that one closest to Depot Street still has the original poor-rock wall visible that also maintains the curve of the original structure. The Depot Street face has a small white metal garage door. Around the corner to the Mine street side has a single person door with a brick arch above it along with two old windows with brick arches above now covered with white siding. To the left of these windows is a large rectangular aluminum structure that propped above the ground. To the left of this is a dark-grey brick addition with a loading dock door and single person door. Finally, to the left of the addition is another portion of the original poor-rock building. This section has a single person entrance with a brick arch above it. This door sits above the ground surface and is accessed by metal stairs. There are also three loading dock doors in this section of the building.",

The three in the center are wide enough to accommodate trucks and have green-painted garage doors. The two other arches, which flank the middle three, are much narrower. On the second story there are six tall rectangular windows with arched tops. The roof is flat, but the eastern front has three different types of arches. The northern one is a smooth peak.

A false arch roof stands over the main entrance while the rest of the building has a flat roof. A large block of sandstone mounted over the entrance doors reads “public library.” Two large rectangular windows with red sandstone slabs on top flank the main entrance. Ornate dark red stone trim highlights the space between the top of the windows and the roofline. An iron fence runs along the edge of the path leading from the street to the main entrance. The Carnegie Museum building started its life as a public library in 1910. In 2006 the library moved, and the building was repurposed as a museum by the fall of that year. In 2012 the museum underwent an extensive renovation and preservation project to ensure its life for the future.

The support of C&H allowed the company influence over curriculum and activities.

The original building was moved, and additions were made to support this larger body of students.

All three buildings are constructed from red brick. The building on the west as seen from Calumet St. is the oldest and darkest red in color. It is four stories tall with the first story partially underground. Two main entrances for this building are in the center of the U, or the east side of this building. The south side facing the road has a zigzagging metal fire escape leading to the top floor. White Greek-revival concrete runs as trim for the roof. The northern most building is the newest and runs parallel to Calumet St. Three large, paneled windows sit in the middle of this building with two entrances flanking them to the right and left. The eastern building has a gothic style of architecture that stands in contrast to the other buildings. One entrance is located on the face near the road and three are in the center of the U. Windows run around the building. A digital sign encased in brick and a flagpole are located in the very center of the U next to Calumet St.",

It is a single-story building with a primarily flat roof that peaks in the center. The front has a large roofed-over entrance area with impromptu seating near the entrance to the building. The building itself is made from round timbers at the base and wooden panels above it. Four windows, tow on each side of the entrance door located in the middle of the building, are framed with red shutters. The main door and the window trim are all white while the building is painted a deep brown. The Delaware mine operated for forty years but never made a profit for its investors. Despite its commercial failure, it is a prime example of what mines in the Keweenaw looked like during the 1800s. Visitors can explore the ruins still left above ground and venture below ground to view one of the shafts and the technology used to extract ore.",

            "bodyText": "This Dougherty wagon was purchased by Johnny Grant in 1862. It was shipped up the Missouri River from St Louis, Missouri, to Fort Benton, Montana aboard the steamboat Emilie. When Grant sold the ranch to Conrad Kohrs in 1866, this wagon was included in the purchase and its believed that it was used to carry the newly-wed Conrad and Augusta Kohrs, from Fort Benton to their new home here on the ranch.<br /> <br /> The Dougherty wagon was originally designed as a passenger wagon. They typically featured side doors, two or three rows of seats, and canvas or leather sides that could be rolled up with ease.  Another feature was that the seats could be folded down to create a flat surface or bed and were often converted into use as an ambulance, especially by the Army during the Civil War. Following the battle of the Big Hole (Big Hole National Battlefield) on the morning of August 9, 1877, this wagon was called into such service and was temporarily used as an ambulance to transport wounded soldiers from the battlefield to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Deer Lodge.<br /> <br /> These wagons were also constructed to travel long distances and were desirable for their comfort and safety when riding over rough terrain. The Kohrs family used this wagon for a seven-week tour of Yellowstone National Park in 1883.<br /> <br /> There are only a handful of Dougherty wagons known to exist, which makes this wagon a unique artifact of the National Park Service and the nation’s transportation history.",

However, this was not necessary and by 1870 the army permanently abandoned the facility. The fort was made into a Michigan state park in 1923. It now serves as an example of mid-19th century army life on the northern frontier. Today 19 buildings survive including 12 original structures from 1844. The park also includes copper mine sites, museum exhibits, lighthouses, and outdoor interpretive trails.<br /> <br /> The Keweenaw Heritage Sites are official partners of Keweenaw National Historical Park, but are privately owned. Each site interprets and preserves an important aspect of the area's copper mining history and provides a unique visitor experience. Please contact individual sites for more information.",
            "audioDescription": "Fort Wilkins Historic State Park is located on US 41 in Copper Harbor. The giftshop pictured here is located just west of the oval-shaped parking lot. It is a single-story building made from wood and prominent red and white Jacobsville sandstone corner foundation and wall accents. The rest of the walls are made from wood painted green. Paneled windows with white wooden trim are present on the left side of the building. The entrance to the building is in its center which functions as a covered walkway. The giftshop is located on the left and restrooms are on the right. The building has a gable roof with black asphalt shingles. The rest of the expansive park is located west of the giftshop. Visitors can explore recreated buildings from the park and learn about the life of the people that lived there over the years. Reenactors are present in select buildings throughout the park to teach visitors about the history of the fort and provide a more real-life window into the past.",

The right, east side, building is a two-story building with a shallow pitched roof sloping west and east. Two garage doors form the front of the building with person entrances on the eastern face for both the first and second story. A large four panel window sits in the center of the main building just above the garage doors. A large sign on the front of the main building says, “Calumet Twp. Fire & Rescue.”",

The building is two stories tall with a gabled roof. It is made from many-colored poor rock with brick accents on the corners and around the windows. The popular bath house soon had its own facility, and this became the Calumet & Hecla Public Library. At the library, the company offered a careful selection of educational materials in many languages as an effort to educate and assimilate their workforce into American society. Now known as the Keweenaw History Center, it houses NPS Lake Superior Collection Management Center staff, historical artifacts, and archives. Research appointments are available. ",

Red brick adds a decorative detail around windows, on the corners of the building, and as a visual break between the basement and first floor level. Tall, double hung windows run the length of the second floor and are just below the decorative roof cornice trim. At the center of the first floor is an entrance to the building that has 7 stairs leading to two black wooden doors with windows. The entrance has a gabled roof the width of the stairs and peaks just below the second story windows. Two double hung windows are on either side of the gabled entrance on the first floor. A sidewalk along Red Jacket Road is fifteen feet from the building with an additional sidewalk going to the stairs and entrance. Just a few feet from the sidewalk is a wooden sign that says Keweenaw History Center in white routed letters. This lettered sign hangs from a tall wooden post with a wooden arm that extends from the main post.",

The front entrance is covered by a two-story gable roof with four ornate Romanesque pillars supporting it as it extends from the house. A porch sits on the second story of this entrance extension. Porches also wrap around the ground floor of the house and have covered roofs supported by smaller Romanesque columns like those in the front. A round set of windows on the front corner of the right side of the building harkens to Queen Anne style construction. The third floor has two dormer windows facing the road and a brick chimney rising from the back of the building. The manor was built by Thomas H and Cornelia Hoatson in 1908. Now the 13,000 square foot house serves as a bed and breakfast and also hosts tours so visitors can see the grand style some of Calumet’s residents used to live in.",

The Locomotive Shop is now surrounded by young birch trees, and most of the rail tracks surrounding it have been removed.",

The original depot was a single-story wooden structure with a hipped roof. A one-and-one-half story entrance was built on the south side of the depot. Between 1908 and 1917 the depot was re-built to a three-section brick building with a hipped roof and a wooden awning running around its entire perimeter. The central section is two stories tall with an office located on the western side. Two sets of double doors are located on the eastern face of this section with two rectangular windows between them. Rectangular double-pane windows are on the eastern and western faces of the second story. The southern section is a single-story with rectangular windows ringing it and a door located on this section’s southern face. The northern section was used as a baggage room and had rectangular double-pane windows ringing it. A brick chimney can be found in the center of the roof located between the central and northern building sections.",

Festivals were held on the grounds, and troops camped here during a major labor strike in 1913-14. Today, the National Guard remains in the Calumet area with a new Readiness Center located just north of town. Three of the buildings that used to stand on the parade ground: the armory, warehouse, and painting shop, have all been removed.

A total of three buildings had the name of Italian Hall and stood in this location. The first two were made of wood; the first was three stories tall and the second was two. During a party here on Christmas Eve 1913, a false cry of \"fire\" incited a panic that claimed the lives of over 70 people, many of those children. After the fire, a new two-story brick building was constructed. This building was razed in 1984 and a memorial park was created with the original stone archway repositioned in the center of the lot. Each year on December 24th, a memorial service is hosted at the site.<br />  ",

Mining operations were directed from here and the offices housed engineers, draftsman, and accountants. Miners or family members would wait inside the attached shed to collect their wages. Many in the community are more familiar with the building as the offices of Drs. Gilbert and Baron from the late seventies until the early 1990s. The National Park Service has occupied the building since 1993, serving as the headquarters for Keweenaw National Historical Park. An interior rehabilitation project was completed in 2008, while masons maintain the exterior.",

Located west of Highway 41 and north of Red Jacket Road, the two-story, L-shaped building is prominently located between the former C&H Industrial Core and managers homes that line either side of Highway 41 to the north. Directly across the paved drive to the west is a large three story home that was once the C&H Mine manager's summer house. Red brick adds a decorative detail on building corners, around windows, and three feet from the roof's edge. Tall windows with wooden panes delineate offices within the building and add to the buildings grandeur. Mowed grass surrounds the building between the sidewalk and the mosaic rock foundation. The L-shaped building has a small green, one story addition to the north that is made of metal wainscoting.",

Today, grasses and flowers grow over mine rock rubble mounds on either side of the original entrance and a gravel path leads from the sign to the former entrance. The entrance is completely covered by a makeshift cage consisting of weathered brown steel bars and fencing attached to the bars. The flat cage top extends across the former entrance and then angles into the ground on the east side at an angle. The cage was constructed for viewing access into the former entrance while also allowing bats to leave the entrance as the former shaft serves as an important bat habitat. A small wood platform and fence allows for viewing into the cage and entrance. The man engine shaft entrance is within 20 feet of U.S. Highway 41 on the east side. Some poor rock is piled on the west side of the cage.",

The smelter is a complex of brick and stone buildings, old rail trellises, and hard packed gravel surfaces between and around each building. The complex is large with a recreational snowmobile/walking trail bordering the fence to the north and the Portage Canal to the south. Hardened, melted slag from the smelting process sits in a pile a few acres in size between Highway 26 and the recreational trail. Part of a trellis remains and extends from the smelter to the slag pile. Another trellis leads from the eastern end of the site into the top part of a two-story building. Below the trellis is a long mound of gray stamp sand particles and a cluster of birch trees that have taken hold and are growing among rusted smelter carts.",

This building housed two groups of four boilers which were separated by brick partitions. Coal fired boilers boiled water, producing the necessary steam. The steam flowed through pipes to provide power to machines sometimes located far away from the boiler house. Decorative features on the #7 boiler building include red brick archways over the doors and windows along with Jacobsville Sandstone quoins or building corners. An air pump was housed in an attached addition on the western face of the building and a stone chimney also stood next to the building on this side.",

The building runs northeast to southwest and had two stories; the roof is now missing. The lower story had tall red brick arch-topped windows and doors. The second story has numerous rectangular red brick topped windows. A large square entrance can be seen on the north side of the second story. The corners of the buildings are accentuated by large red and white stripped Jacobsville sandstone blocks. A square single-story addition can be seen on the southwestern corner of the building. Just to the north of this addition is a square chimney base made in the same style as the Boiler House.",

On a two-hour tour, visitors take a guided walk through the hoist house, ride a cog-rail tram, and enter the mine to learn about mining life. Shorter, surface-only tours are also available.<br /> <br /> The Keweenaw Heritage Sites are official partners of Keweenaw National Historical Park, but are privately owned. Each site interprets and preserves an important aspect of the area's copper mining history and provides a unique visitor experience. Please contact individual sites for more information.",

The welcome building and gift shop is a one-and-a-half story structure made from red and white Jacobsville sandstone that was the Supply Headquarters during the mine’s operation. The building now has a silver-colored corrugated metal roof. A wooden raised porch wraps around the western and southern sides of the building which sit adjacent to the parking lot. The entrances for the building have arched tops with brick accents. Visitors to the Quincy Mine which operated for 99 years as “old reliable” can explore numerous ruins, learn about the history of the mine, and take tours underground to see the shafts and some of the mining equipment used by the men who worked there.",

The main entrance, and tallest building is located at the south and is in the shape of a square. It is made from grey poor-rock. The main entrance to this building is on the south face with a large garage door on the left-hand side. The rest of that face has three arched and brick-topped windows. The roof of this end of the building slopes steeply to a central point. A brick chimney can also be seen rising out of the south face of the roof. On the east face of this building a tall brick smokestack rises from an attached brick extension. This stack is fluted for support and is a rare construction style in the Keweenaw. The other portion of the building which is in the shape of a rectangle running parallel with Mine Street extends to the north of the first portion of the building. The northern portion is made from red sandstone and has numerous small arched windows along its faces. The tops of the windows are made from brick. The roof of both buildings is made from rusting corrugated metal.",

The building is approximately 30 feet east of U.S. Highway 41 and has a large gravel parking lot to the north of the building. Visitors to the site park in this lot and can walk into the building's interior with the entrance located on the north side of the building. To the east, a tall metal pulley stand remains and was used to support the large cables that traveled from the hoist house into the shaft-rockhouse near the top of the building. At the base of this pulley stand, is a small rock masonry building. To the south of the shaft-rockhouse, are some abandoned wooden rail cars and beyond, an open landscape with stone foundations of former buildings. The building's height and unique shape are directly linked to the underground below. When positioned in the parking to the north and looking at the building, the roof angles down to the ground at a 50 degree angle. This same angle extends underground and is the angle by which skip cars and man engine cars traveled into the ground",

The back truck resembles a conventional boxcar with small window openings and built in storage compartments. The front truck is comprised of a pilot's house behind a large double curved wood plow resembling the prow of a ship. This large v-plow has a metal blade just above the tracks. Two large retractable steel plow extensions are located to either side of the pilot's house which extend out to cut snow banks back along the track. The snowplow was designed to be positioned in front of a steam locomotive and pushed from behind to clear drifted snow.",

These plains are preserved because there isn't enough running water to erode them away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{177}\" paraid=\"243194751\"><strong>Changing Landscape </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{187}\" paraid=\"1917273038\">Look for the following features to see evidence of an ever-changing landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{193}\" paraid=\"867655576\">Bajada: Find bajadas where alluvial fans merge to form a vast sediment slope at the mouth of canyons. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{203}\" paraid=\"234409128\">Pediment: These sloping bedrock surfaces covered by gravel can be seen along the edges of mountains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{209}\" paraid=\"469425288\">Dry Wash: Washes transport sediment downhill.

A fast-running stream moving down a steep canyon can carry more sand, rocks, and pebbles, but when the water reaches the flat plains, it flows more slowly and can't carry the larger rocks and sand anymore. (Picture how fine silt settles out of a still lake, whereas a rushing river can push along sand, pebbles, and even large rocks.) These sediments accumulate in a fan shape at the mouth of canyons or washes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c8b25ca6-7d5c-4ee3-8812-23f7bbbe8b2c}{16}\" paraid=\"1705513765\">Bajada: A bajada is where many alluvial fans meet and converge.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c8b25ca6-7d5c-4ee3-8812-23f7bbbe8b2c}{20}\" paraid=\"1585616390\">Pediment: A relatively flat or slightly concave surface of bedrock.  </p>",

Confederates built winter quarters, similar to the reproduction log hut visible from this point. This was a training camp for volunteers: they were mustered into Confederate regiments at this site, practiced their drills, and worked on the construction of the fort.<br /> <br /> According to post-battle accounts, the huts were burned after the battle.<br /> <br /> Weathering and erosion impacted the fortification since the Civil War. We urge you to protect these cultural resources by not walking on the fort wall.",
            "audioDescription": "The 15-acre fort sits upon a high point along the Cumberland River. The remains of the fort encircle a large \"bowl\" or hollow. The fort walls were built on top of the ridges surrounding this hollow. One reproduction log hut can be seen (and you may go inside) just adjacent to the parking area. It is believed that Confederates built winter huts similar to this during the winter of 1861-1862. Two wayside exhibits are accessed from this location: one in front of the log hut, and the other near a field gun across the park road. The walls of the fortification have eroded in the years after the 1862 battle. Signage directs visitors to stay off the fort walls to preserve the cultural resource. The walls have been sodded with grass and a few trees grow from the wall too.",

If you walk in front of the gun battery emplacement at the Lower Gun Battery, you will find interpretive signs explaining the ironclads and a War Department plaque which describes the battle. Wayside intepretive exhibits are also located on the observation deck.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "This historic area has both gun emplacements and cannons at two locations: the lower gun battery and the upper gun battery. The lower battery consists of seven 32-lb cannons and one columbiad. Two 32-lb cannons are resting on the grass near the park roadway. The upper gun battery has three guns, two 32-lb carronades and one rifled columbiad. Today, these features are separated by a parking area and limestone rock wall. The Cumberland River has been impounded by dams, thus it appears differently than it would have in 1862. The area across from this artillery battery is managed by the US Corps of Engineers. Depending on the season, you may see migratory waterfowl, duck blinds, flooded waters, or you may see crops such as soybeans or corn. The description of this area reflects the flow of the Cumberland River. The river flows north at this point; therefore, you pass by the Upper Gun battery first, and drive a little further, and you arrive at the Lower Gun battery. The Upper Gun battery can only be reached by trail. The trail is steep. The Lower Gun battery has an observation deck and one sidewalk. Exhibits may be found at both locations. Exhibits are also located on the observation deck. Walking around the gun emplacements at the Lower Gun battery, you will find interpretive exhibits and a War Department plaque which tell the story of the ironclad gunboats and 1862 battle.",

            "bodyText": "<strong>“What Is Significant About the Gas Station?” </strong><br /> <br /> Visitors to the site often are curious about the restored gas station and how it relates to the stories of Central High School. The Magnolia Mobil service station located at the corner of Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive and Park Street was built in the 1920s, about the same time that Little Rock Central High School was built. Throughout the years, the building has served as a gas station, a hangout for students, a temporary “office” for reporters during the desegregation crisis, storage for a wholesale florist business, and a National Historic Site visitor center. <br /> <br /> <strong>The History of the Gas Station </strong><br /> <br /> This service station was built for the Magnolia Petroleum Company of Texas in the 1920s. Called the “Southwest” model, this station in Little Rock was identical to many others throughout Texas and Arkansas. The Magnolia Petroleum Company was one of many regional oil companies owned by Magnolia Oil Corporation. Founded as Vacuum Oil Company of Rochester, New York by Matthew Ewing and Hirman Everest in 1866, the company became a subsidiary of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Corporation of Ohio in 1879 and later a part of the Standard Oil Trust. In response to a 1911 Supreme Court decree against monopolies, the Standard Oil Group was broken into thirty-four companies. One of the successor companies, Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY), acquired full interest in the Magnolia Petroleum Company of Texas and some other regional oil companies before merging with the Vacuum Oil Company (another member of the Standard Oil Group) in 1931. <br /> <br /> As Socony-Vacuum the company led the way in pioneering lubricants and new energy sources. The name changed to Socony Mobil Oil Company in 1955, Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966, and Mobil Corporation in 1976. In the late 1950s, the station featured both Mobil and Magnolia signs to capitalize on regional and national brand identification. The station was in operation into the 1980s, when it closed and the building was acquired by the wholesale florist that was once located across the street. The company used it for storage until 1996, when Central High Museum, Inc., a nonprofit organization, purchased the property to use as a visitor center. The Mobil Foundation assisted in restoring the exterior of the station to its 1957 appearance. Mobil’s corporate archives supplied the architects with the original specifications for the vintage signage, the paint scheme, and the gas pumps. The visitor center opened in September 1997 for the 40th anniversary of the desegregation events at the school. <br /> <br /> In November 1998, President Clinton signed legislation designating Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park Service. Central High Museum, Inc. donated the property to the National Park Service; the station served as the interim visitor center until September 2007 when the new permanent center opened on the 50th Anniversary of Central High's integration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>During the 1957-58 School Year </strong><br /> <br /> The service station was one of the few businesses in the immediate neighborhood and had a pay telephone on site. During the early days of the desegregation crisis, when reporters from all over the state, nation, and world converged on Little Rock, many phoned in their reports from the station. The press included a number of local and international reporters from magazines and newspapers such as <em>The New York Times, Life, Look, Arkansas</em> <em>Gazette, Arkansas Democrat, Arkansas State Press, Der Spiegel </em>(a German Periodical), <em>Chicago Defender,</em> and <em>Baltimore Afro-American</em>. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, television was entering mainstream America as a medium for news, and the events in Little Rock were among the first major news events to be televised. Reporters representing the major networks featured live footage of the events as Arkansas National Guard troops, on orders of the governor, kept nine African American teenagers out of the school. <br /> <br /> <em>“...the world media took a moral stand on Little Rock and they were horrified...there was so much media coverage, even though we knew [the people in the crowd] were crazy we also knew that they would have to be really crazy to kill one of us in public.”</em><br /> Minnijean Brown Trickey, Little Rock Nine<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "The Magnolia Mobil Station is located across W. Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive from the park visitor center. The one-story white stucco structure with terracotta barrel tile roofing features three Mobil gas pumps beneath the service station's pull-through. Two former service bays are at the left side of the station with \"Mobilgas\" and \"Mobilubrication\" in lettering above the left and right doors, respectively. Above the main entrance door is a \"Public Telephone\" plaque. On the northwest corner of the station is a large metal Mobil sign mounted above the street corner. The west side of the building is bounded by grass and sidewalks leading to a side door and former location of the station's restrooms. The east side of the station is bounded by a parking lot with 7 parking spaces and 1 accessible parking space. The north side of the station has ballasts to keep vehicle traffic from entering on to the station grounds and is bordered by a sidewalk that shifts to a driveway apron on W. Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive. Today, the building serves as offices and storage space for the park's facilities/maintenance department and is not open to the public.",

This native shrubland is a remnant of the plants and trees that once blanketed every side of Haleakalā. Long before humans ever set foot upon the Hawaiian archipelago millions of years ago, native plants, insects, and birds arrived on these slopes through wind, water, and wings.<br /> They built a pilina (interconnection) into a tight diversity of life that’s dependent on each other. Along this stretch of trail look for plant identification signs pointing out different shrubs.<br /> <br /> Many of these plants serve in critical roles to provide food and homes for other endemic and endangered species, including the nēnē (Hawaiian goose). Berries from the shrubs of ʻōhelo, kukaenene, and pukiawe provide key food sources. Shrubland foliage is also critical to the geese for nesting season. Yellow flowers of the māmane tree provide nectar for native ʻiʻiwi honeycreepers. Notice how an ‘iʻiwi’s beak fits perfectly into the curve of a māmane bloom. Please give all wildlife space, never approach or feed them, and drive cautiously along park roadways.<br /> <br /> Hosmer Grove is a stark contrast to a native shrubland around you, what are some of the differences you observe? Curiosity continues through ongoing studies on Hosmer's forested plots, giving researchers a chance to see how the introduced tree species cohabitate with native birds, insects, and their affect on native vegatation. </p>",

Each island population is recognized as a separate endemic or unique subspecies.<br /> <br /> The island fox, a descendant of the mainland gray fox, is the largest of the Channel Islands' native mammals, but one of the smallest canid species in the world.<br /> <br /> Although foxes have always existed at low population sizes, four island fox subspecies underwent catastrophic declines in the 1990s. On San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands at Channel Islands National Park, the decline was attributed to predation by golden eagles. The presence of non-native ungulates as a food source in addition to the DDT-caused decline of bald eagles, a natural competitor, facilitated the establishment of golden eagles as resident breeders on the islands. By 2000, predation on island foxes resulted in population declines to 15 individuals on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, and less than 80 on Santa Cruz Island. In 2004, each of the park's island fox subspecies were federally listed as endangered.<br /> <br /> In 1999, Channel Islands National Park began an island fox recovery program that included captive breeding and reintroduction of foxes, removal of resident golden eagles, re-establishment of bald eagles, and removal of non-native ungulates. This coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Today, the population has recovered within the park. Population trend and annual survival are currently monitored to ensure that recovery continues and future threats to the park's island fox subspecies are identified.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>It is the only carnivore unique to California.</li> <li>Although the island fox is one of the smallest canids in the world, it is the largest native terrestrial mammal on the Channel Islands.</li> <li>The island fox is one-third smaller than its mainland ancestor, the gray fox. At 12 to 13 inches in height and 4 to 5 pounds, the island fox is about the size of a housecat.</li> <li>Some individuals have been known to live up to 15 years.</li> <li>Unlike nocturnal gray foxes, which hunt exclusively at night to avoid predators, island foxes have no natural predators, allowing them to be active duringdaylight hours with peaks in activity occurring at dusk and dawn.</li> <li>Visually, island foxes show signs of dominance or submission through facial expressions and body posture.</li> <li>They communicate by barking and sometimes growling.</li> <li>Their keen sense of smell plays an important role in the marking of territories. Island foxes are known to scent-mark their territories with a few drops of urine and tend to concentrate scats in particular areas, often conspicuously positioned on well-traveled paths.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong></p> <p>The island fox is one third smaller than its mainland ancestor the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size.</p> <p>The island fox has similar markings to the gray fox. They have gray coloring on the back, rust coloring on the sides,and white underneath. The face has a distinctive black, white, and rufous-colored patterns.</p> <p>On each of the six islands, a different subspecies occurs, distinguished by both genetic and physical differences. For example, San Miguel Island foxes have shorter tails, due to one less tail vertebra, and longer noses than the other island foxes.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong></p> <p>The island fox is found on six of the islands in the Southern California bight, including the three largest islands in the Channel Islands National Park (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands). The other three islands which island foxes inhabit San Nicolas and San Clemente, owned by the US Navy, and popular Santa Catalina Island, which in large part is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy.</p> <p>Older research on the island fox dated them back on the northern Channel Islands to 10,400 to 16,000 years ago. Yet, geologists believe the northern Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland. The most plausible and accepted theory for foxes crossing the water barrier of the Santa Barbara Channel is one of \"rafting.\" During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today's. The channel between the islands and mainland narrowed, perhaps to just four to five miles across. The northern islands became one large island we call Santarosae. The gray fox could have rafted on debris propelled by storms and/or currents. As the climate warmed and the ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae became the islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel. Due to the lack of a fresh water source, the foxes did not persist on Anacapa, but the other three islands had suitable habitat for foxes.</p> <p>Recent archeological work, however, only dates the oldest island fox fossil at about 6,000 years before present, which is several thousand years after native people populated the island. This raises the possibility that gray foxes were brought to the islands by humans, and rapidly evolved into a smaller, separate species after that.</p> <p>Island foxes brought to the southern Channel Islands of Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente by the Chumash native people who traded with the Gabrielino people of the southern islands. The Chumash considered the fox to be a sacred animal--a pet of the sun, and possibly a dream helper. The island Chumash performed a fox dance and probably used the pelts of foxes to make articles like arrow quivers, capes, and headdresses.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong></p> <p>The climate of the California Channel Islands is semi-arid, and though rainfall amounts differ among islands the average rainfall across all islands is less than six inches per year. The native island vegetation is mostly coastal scrub, but these habitats have been heavily modified by the effects of introduced grazing animals and other human impacts. The northern islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz) have significant areas dominated by non-native plant species, such as annual grasses and iceplant, whereas the southern islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas) have greater development impacts such as the naval bases and the town of Avalon. The larger islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente) also have perennial streams that support riparian vegetation and tree species. Foxes are found in most of these habitats on these islands, but they prefer shrubby or wooded areas such as chaparral, coastal scrub and oak woodlands.</p> <p>Island foxes give birth to their young in simple dens, which are usually not excavated by the foxes themselves. By two months of age, young spend most of the day outside the den and will remain with their parents throughout the summer. Some pups disperse away from their natal territories by winter, although others may stay on their natal territories into their second year.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong></p> <p>Island fox diets vary based upon food item diversity of the individual islands. On San Rosa Island, where food item diversity is high, deer mice, Jerusalem crickets, beetles, and earwigs are the preferred food. On other Channel Islands, diets include plant items such as fruits from cactus, manzanita, saltbushes and seafigs, as well as insects and deer mice when they are present. Occasionally, foxes forage along the shoreline for crabs and other marine invertebrates.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong></p> <p>Island foxes are generally monogamous (mate for life), and breed only once a year. Pairs are seen together frequently beginning in January, and mating takes place in late February to early March. The gestation period is thought to be similar to the gray fox, which is around 52 days, and pups are born from late April through early May. Litter size ranges from one to as many as five pups, but two or three is considered average. Born in the protection of a den, pups are blind and helpless with short dark brown hair at birth. They emerge from the den at about one month of age, much furrier but still considerably darker than adults. They begin to resemble their parents by late summer.</p> <p>It is believed that island fox pups undergo a period of extended parental care. In a recent study of island foxes, scientists found adults and pups in the same trap on 22 occasions. In 24 traps containing only pups, they found killed mice and other prey items outside the traps, apparently left by the parents for their young. As with most wild canids, males play an important role in the rearing of young.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong></p> <p>The island fox, which only a short time ago was on the brink of extinction, provides an instructive example of how a coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Additional information about the strategies developed and implemented to reverse this situation may be found at <a href=\"http://www1.islandfox.org/p/about-island-fox.html\">Island Fox Conservation</a>.</p> <p>Due to these successful efforts, the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species now lists the island fox as near threatened.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf\">http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.islandfox.org/\">http://www.islandfox.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm\">http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm</a></li> </ul>",

From the creators of the earliest known cave painting and carvings to 20th century practitioners of modern art and even to today's tourists, humans have tried to grasp the essence of this magnificent creature – its enormous size, strength and beauty and its coexistence with and importance to humans. In 1994, paleontologists made the remarkable discovery of a pygmy mammoth on Santa Rosa Island, the most complete collection of its kind in the world.</p> <p>Found only on the California Channel Islands and nowhere else in the world, the pygmy mammoth was probably a small form of the Columbian mammoth found on the mainland. Pygmy mammoths varied from 4.5 to 7 feet high at the shoulders and may have weighed only about 2,000 pounds, compared to the 14-foot tall, 20,000 pound Columbian mammoth. In other respects, they were probably similar, with short fur, a typical mammoth body form, and a relatively large head.</p> <p>The first remains of \"elephants\" on Santa Rosa Island were reported in 1873. Additional excavations over the years have given a basic understanding of a population of mammoths on the islands which became smaller in body size through time and which perished as the Pleistocene ended. Paleontological excavations on Santa Rosa Island in 1927 and 1928 resulted in the retrieval of a significant collection of a new species described as <em>Mammuthus exilis</em>. Philip Orr of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History recovered additional materials during archeological and geological work on Santa Rosa Island during the 1940s and 1950s.</p> <p>Remains of mammoths are most common on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, with smaller numbers recovered from Santa Cruz Island and from San Nicolas Island, outside the park. The recovered specimens range in size from 4 to 8 feet at the shoulder, compared to the 12 to 14 foot height of mainland mammoths.</p> <p><strong>The Journey to the Islands</strong><br /> Approximately 40,000 to 20,000 years ago, a small group of 14-foot tall, 20,000-pound Columbian mammoths embarked on a journey that would eventually end in the development of a new species—the Channel Islands pygmy mammoth. Leaving the heavily grazed mainland behind, these Columbian mammoths swam towards the scents of abundant vegetation from the huge, mountainous island of Santarosae.</p> <p>Approximately 20,000 years ago when sea level was about 300 feet lower than it is today, the four northern islands joined together to form an Ice Age “superisland” known as Santarosae. This island was only 6 miles from the mainland at its closest distance. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p> <p>But how did they reach the island? With their snorkel-like trunk and buoyant mass, elephants, living relatives of mammoths, are considered excellent distance swimmers, among the best of all land mammals, and skilled at crossing watergaps. Documented accounts demonstrate that Asian elephant swim to islands they cannot even see – some up to 23 miles away—guided by the odor of ripening fruit and vegetation. There is no reason that Pleistocene mammoths were not just as seaworthy, and just as good at swimming.<span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Evolving into a New Species</strong><br /> Once on the island, the population of mammoths increased and, eventually, the food supply became scarce as the island decreased in size due to climatic changes – glaciers and ice sheets melting, and sea levels rising. Those mammoths that were smaller and could survive with less food and water were at an advantage, especially in times of seasonal shortages. Over time, smaller animals that required fewer resources became the norm. In addition, the absence of predators on the islands also may have contributed to this downsizing: large size was no longer needed for predator avoidance and defense.</p> <p>Within less than 20,000 years, natural selection favored smaller-sized mammoths that stood less than 6.5 feet tall at the shoulder, less than half the height of their mainland ancestor. Thus, the small mammoths became a new species, the Channel Islands pygmy mammoth.</p> <p>The pygmy mammoth is an extinct member of an ancient and unique group of mammals collectively known as probiscideans. This name comes from the Greek word probiscis and refers to the large or extended noses. While the fossil history of this group spans over 55 million years and more than 160 different species, today’s elephants are the last survivors of this widespread group of animals.</p> <p><strong>Extinction</strong><br /> After 200,000 years as one of Earth's most dominant species, mammoths, which once thrived across Europe, Asia and North American, became extinct nearly 10,000 years ago. The extinction of the mammoths was also part of the much wider phenomenon of disappearance of the world's larger mammals, which started about 40,000 years ago and reached its peak between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Just what caused the demise of this Pleistocene megafauna is still unknown: nearly 30 years of research and testing has not yet provided an answer that is universally convincing.</p> <p><strong>Special Islands</strong><br /> Mammoth finds are by no means rare. Complete skeletons to cave paintings have been discovered on four continents in a wide variety of locations: an engraving of a mammoth on mammoth ivory found in a rock shelter southwestern France; a preserved frozen carcass of a baby male mammoth in the permafrost of Siberia; a sinkhole with more than 100 mammoth remains in Hot Springs, South Dakota; and, of course, our own mammoth find right here in our backyard, within Channel Islands National Park – the discovery of the world's first virtually complete pygmy mammoth skeleton in 1994.</p> <p>Studying the pygmy mammoth reveals how important the Channel Islands are in illuminating the mysteries of evolution. The isolation of the islands have made them natural laboratories of evolutionary extravagance, as seen not only in the pygmy mammoth, but also in the extinct giant mouse, the diminutive island fox, the munchkin dudleya, and the giant, bright blue Island Jay. Isolated from their mainland relations and exposed to unique environmental conditions, the ancestors of these plants and animals, along with over 70 others, responded by becoming new species unique to the island – found nowhere else on earth.</p>",

Unlike the island fox and the island deer mouse, the island spotted skunk shows little differentiation between the two islands as well as the mainland subspecies, suggesting recent colonization of the species. In recent times, the species was limited in numbers. However, island spotted skunk populations on both islands began increasing in the late 1990s, coincident with the decline in island foxes caused by golden eagle predation. As the only two terrestrial carnivores on the islands, skunks and foxes are natural competitors.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Island spotted skunks on the two islands differ only slightly, with those on Santa Rosa spotted skunk being slightly longer than those on Santa Cruz.</li> <li>Island spotted skunks are only about a third as large as their competitor, the island fox.</li> <li>They are more carnivorous than foxes, and more nocturnal. However, their diet became a little more omnivorous in the absence of the fox, during the late 1990s.</li> <li>Skunks may live only one to two years in the wild.</li> <li>Historically, skunks have been classified as a subfamily in the weasel family, the Mustelidae. Recent genetic data has resulted in skunks being reclassified into its own family, <em>Spilogale</em>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island spotted skunk can be identified by its complex pattern of white markings on a blackbackground consisting of four to six broken white stripes, a triangular white forehead patch, a series of shorter white stripes resembling spots, and white on part of the abdominal surface and tip of the tail.</p> <p>It is distinguished from spotted skunk subspecies on the mainland by its shorter tail and less white abdominal coloration, slightly larger size, broader skull, and proportionately less white and blacker in the fur. Like the mainland subspecies, the island spotted skunks exhibit sexual size differences, with males averaging 28% larger than females. This skunk is considerably smaller than striped skunks on the mainland and has softer, glossier fur.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Channel Islands spotted skunks currently occur only on Santa Cruz and Santa RosaIslands where they are widely distributed. Spotted skunks occurred on San Miguel Island, probably until the late nineteenth century. Fossil material has been collected on San Miguel Island and a spotted skunk was reportedly collected from San Miguel Island sometime during the 1870s. However, there have been no records of skunks on San Miguel since then.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands show habitat preferences similar to those reportedfor the mainland subspecies. Based on radio telemetry studies, spotted skunks on Santa Cruz Island showed a preference for chaparral-grassland, open grassland, fennel-grassland, and ravines. On Santa Rosa Island, spotted skunks were found to be associated with rocky canyon slopes, cactus patches, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, open woodland, other scrub-grassland communities, and riparian habitat along streams. On both islands, the species has also been recorded in or under human dwellings and ranch outbuildings. The elevational range of the Channel Islands spotted skunk extends from sea level to approximately 2000 feet.</p> <p>Channel Islands spotted skunks are nocturnal. Activity begins at dusk, peaks during the early evening, and continues intermittently until dawn. On Santa Cruz Island, spotted skunks nest in cavities, burrows, and other natural crevices, as they do on the mainland. Dens are constructed in roots and earth under shrubs, cavities in rocks, open grassy areas, road cuts, human-made structures, and trunks and roots of oaks. Individuals use several dens distributed throughout their home range; some dens are used by two or more individuals either sequentially, or for females, simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands have similar diets as those reported on the mainland. Studies on Santa Cruz Island showed skunks to be carnivorous, consuming primarily island deer mice and insects along with occasional lizards. Jerusalem crickets were the most frequent prey, but other prey included grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, caterpillars, earwigs, and ants. Seasonally available fruits and berries were collected on Santa Cruz Island consisting of grapes, summer holly stems and berries.</p> <p>In recent years skunks have begun preying on seabirds nesting in sea caves on Santa Cruz Island. Expansion of skunk foraging to sea caves is likely a result of their substantial population increase following decline of foxes.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The breeding season for spotted skunks on the islands is probably similar to spotted skunks on the mainland. Western spotted skunks mate in September and October, and following delayed implantation and a 210-310 day gestation, give birth in April and May to 2-6. Counts of three and five uterine scars were recorded from two skunks collected at Santa Cruz Island in September.</p> <p>On Santa Cruz Island, California, in a 1994 study of 47 dens used by island spotted skunks, 29.8% were under shrubs, 21.3% in open grassland, 21.3% in cavities in rocks, 10.6% in road cuts, 10.6% under human structures, and 6.4% in cavities in roots and trunks of trees.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN Red List (2008), the Western Spotted Skunk is listed as Least Concern as they are widely distributed in a variety of habitats including human altered habitats. The species may be declining in parts of the United States but not at a rate fast enough to be threatened. In contrast, prior to the recent upswing in skunk numbers on the islands, the island spotted skunk was thought to be rare, and was listed as a Species of Special Concern by the state of California. when the Island Spotted Skunk had a small population and was not well-studied, the skunk that time was designated as a species of concern. However, recent surveys now show a remarkable recovery in the species. On Santa Rosa Island, skunks are marked and counted during annual population monitoring for island foxes, and as of 2011 there were approximately 3,000 skunks on Santa Rosa Island.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/sudden-increase-rare-endemic-carnivore-ecology-island-spotted-skunk/\">Ecology of the Island Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/ssc/docs/mammal/species/46.pdf\">Channel Islands Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136797/0\">ICUN Red List</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

The American subspecies, , <em>F. p. anatum</em>, inhabits western north America, from Mexico to Canada and Alaska. This falcon species was a resident on the Channel Islands in years past, but largely disappeared due to harassment, shooting, egg stealing, and reproductive failure caused by organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT. However, this species has made a comeback due to reintroduction efforts. Peregrines were reintroduced on the islands in the 1980s and as of 2013, there are 45 active peregrine falcons on the eight Channel Islands.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>The peregrine falcon is one of the most widespread birds in the world. It is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands.</li> <li>The name \"peregrine\" means wanderer, and the peregrine falcon has one of the longest migrations of any North American bird.</li> <li>People have trained falcons for hunting for over a thousand years, and the peregrine falcon was always one of the most prized birds.</li> <li>Formerly called the \"duck hawk\", peregrines are formidable hunters that prey on other birds (and bats) in mid-flight.</li> <li>Peregrines hunt from above and, after sighting their prey, drop into a steep, swift dive, or stooop, that can top 200 miles an hour.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This raptor is identified by its long, pointed wings and a long tail. Its shape as well as its size makes it stand out—the long primary feathers give the peregrine a long-winged shape. As with most raptors, males are smaller than females, so peregrines can overlap with large female merlins or small male gyrfalcons. Adults are blue-gray above with barred underparts and a dark head with thick sideburns. Juveniles are heavily marked, with vertical streaks instead of horizontal bars on the breast. Despite considerable age-related and geographic variation, an overall steely, barred look remains.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The peregrine is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands. Within Channel Islands National Park, a 2011 survey revealed that peregrine falcons are found on all five islands in the park. Although the numbers are not large, historic evidence shows that the peregrine was sparsely distributed on the islands. Owing to factors relating to the imperative of protecting nesting sites, peregrines tend remain in the Channel Islands for life.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Habitat for the peregrine is closely associated with the nest territory and their foraging areas. On the Channel Islands this generally would generally include coastal strands, bodies of water, and shorelines.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Foraging areas are associated with the nest territory. This generally includes coastal strands, bodies of water, shorelines, open grasslands, marshes and wooded areas. Peregrines hunt in the air, and the usual method of hunting prey is by attacking flying birds from above or chasing them from behind (Recovery Plan, 1982). Prey consumed by California peregrines is highly varied, nevertheless, they feed primarily on other birds, such as songbirds, shorebirds, ducks, and, in urban areas, starlings and pigeons. Flying high above their intended prey, peregrines will \"stoop\" or dive and strike in mid-air, killing the prey with a sharp blow. At no nest sites do peregrines concentrate on a single prey or few species. Peregrines are generalists which hunt the large variety of prey that occur in their home range (Walton, 1997).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Generally speaking, peregrines are monogamous, mate for life, and breed in the same territory their entire life. On the Channel Islands, pairs remain in the area around the nest cliff enough from July to January (i.e. the non-breeding season) to maintain possession of the nest site and drive out competitors (Walton, 1997).</p> <p>Peregrines do not make stick nests; although they may use old common raven (<em>Corvus corax</em>) or great horned owl (<em>Bubo virginianus</em>) stick nests. The cliff usually has a small cave or overhung ledge large enough to contain three or four full-grown nestlings. Several holes or ledges that can be used in alternate years are apparently not an absolute requirement but probably increase the suitability of the cliff (Recovery Plan, 1982).</p> <p>Peregrine falcons generally reach breeding maturity at 2 years of age. Usually, the male arrives at a nesting site and begins a series of aerial acrobatic displays to attract a mate. An average clutch of four eggs is laid in the spring, hatching about a month later. Peregrines vigorously defend their nests, although they may abandon them if severely or continuously harassed.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The use of DDT as a pesticide during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s resulted in a precipitous decline of peregrine falcons in North America. During this period of DDT use, eggshell thinning and nesting failures were widespread in peregrine falcons, and in some areas, successful reproduction virtually ceased.</p> <p>As a result, there was a slow but drastic decline in the number of peregrine falcons in most areas of its range in North America. By the time peregrine falcons were listed as endangered in 1970, the eastern population of the American peregrine falcon was gone and the populations in the west had declined by as much as 90 percent below historical levels. By 1975, there were only 324 known nesting pairs of American peregrine falcons.</p> <p>An aggressive recovery program began in 1974 and resulted in over 6,000 falcons being reintroduced to the wild. Now there are about 3,000 breeding pairs of American peregrine falcons in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Territory occupancy, nest success, and productivity are all at levels considered normal for healthy peregrine falcon populations.</p> <p>In August 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the American peregrine falcon from the list of endangered and threatened species, marking one of the most dramatic successes of the Endangered Species Act. Post-delisting monitoring will continue until 2015.</p> <p>Surveys in 2013 recorded a total of 45 peregrine falcon territories on the eight Channel Islands, and 27 of those territories had eggs or chicks by the end of April 2013. In 2013 there were 5 territories on Anacapa, 16 on Santa Cruz, 13 on Santa Rosa, 9 on San Miguuel, and 3 on Santa Barbara (Sharpe 2013).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/Peregrinefactsheet.pdf\">Peregrine Falcon Fact Sheet, US Fish and Wildlife</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Peregrine_Falcon/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19000\">Comrack, Lyann A. and Randi J.

Island night lizards are the most morphologically distinct of the endemic vertebrates on the Channel Islands, indicating they have been isolated from the mainland for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>In the park, the island night lizard is found only on Santa Barbara Island.</li> <li>Studies on Santa Barbara Island has shown that the island night lizards are not nocturnal as suggested by their name, but instead are most active at midday, with little activity in the cool early morning or late afternoon, and none at all at night.</li> <li>The island night lizard gives birth to live young (as opposed to laying eggs), which is not common among reptiles.</li> <li>Island night lizards are slow growing and long-lived, with some individuals reaching at least 25 years of age.</li> <li>During the course of their long lives, they accumulate a lot of injuries including regenerated tails, scale, and miscellaneous cuts, missing toes, eye injuries, infections and the presence of cactus spines.</li> <li>All larger lizards have some injuries, while only about 1/3 of the smaller lizards do.</li> <li>With their unusually low metabolic rate, the lizards do not have high energy demands and can live on about half the food that other similar-sized lizards require. Therefore, they have very small, overlapping home ranges.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island night lizard is a medium-sized lizard, with adults ranging from 2 ¾ to 4 inches in body length. It is endemic to the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California where it occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. Both the color and pattern of the back of adult island night lizards are highly variable. Though these patterns grade into one another, there are serveral distinct types of which the mottled pattern is the most common (44% of the lizards). Less frequent patterns include plain, blotched, striped, broken stripes, ocellated, and finely mottled. Lichen-covered rocks and ground which make up their habitat and appear to provide good camouflage. Such cryptic coloration is oftern associated with the sort of sedentary lifestyle that the lizards have. However, the variety of colors and patterns present among the lizards is unusual. Few other terrestrial vertebrates show the marked color and pattern differences seen in island night lizards. In those that do, it is generally seen as geographic variation over a comparatively large range.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Island night lizards are an endemic Channel Islands reptile, known only to occur on Santa Barbara Island in the park and on San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. They are the most morphologically distinct of the endemic vertebrates on the Channel Islands, indicating they have been isolated from the mainland for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The island night lizard is veru very secretive, preferring habitats with dense vegetation cover, such as boxthorn and prickly pear cactus, as well as cracks and crevices in and around rock outcrops and surface boulders. These areas provide protection from predators. They are also often found under rocks, driftwood, and fallen branches. Suitable habitat on Santa Barbara is in all of the canyons and on some of the sea cliffs, especially on the south side of Signal Peak. Island night lizards are very sedentary and have very small home ranges, averaging about 183 square feet.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Island night lizards feed on a wide variety of terrestrial spiders and insects, but they also eat an unusually large amount of plant material for a small lizard. Common animal food items include ground-dwelling spiders, pillbugs, a ground beetle (Amara sp.), moth larvae, and ants. Common plant food items include fruits of Australian saltbush, flowers, fruits and leaves of boxthorn, fruits of iceplant, and composite (Asteraceae) flower parts.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Night lizards have a low reproductive rate compared with other lizards, likely because they are so long-lived. Only about half of the adult females bear young in a given year and a female may not have her first brood until she is nearly five years old. Seasonal activity peaks in the spring when mating takes place, then continues at a lower level through the summer and fall. Island night lizards breed in April, and 2 - 9 young are born fully developed in September. Giving birth to live young (as opposed to laying eggs) is not common among reptiles. Young of the year are active throughout the year, while adults are active primarily during the spring and summer.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The island night lizard is listed as Threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, due to habitat alteration and predation resulting from introduction of alien species (e.g., feral cats, goats, pigs, and rabbits). However, according to the Channel Islands Species Recovery Plan of 1984, habitat on the islands \"probably has not been altered to the detriment of the [island night] lizards by grazing mammals\". Goats and pigs have recently been removed from San Clemente Island. Today, the island night lizard is not thought to be in imminent danger of extinction, and could be a candidate for delisting. Santa Barbara Island is part of the Channel Islands National Park. The entire island of San Clemente, used for military training, has been designated as Critical Habitat.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.werc.usgs.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectID=148\">USGS WERC Projects - Island Night Lizard Population Ecology on the Channel Islands</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20-%202007\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20%20-%202007</a></li> </ul>",

Their beaks and bodyparts adapted to their food source, some grew long curved beaks to get into bell shaped flowers, while others adapted with sharp beaks for prying into bark and cracking seeds. Watch what each bird is doing to learn about how its beak helps it to eat food.<br /> <br /> Today these native forest birds have been pushed up higher to this elevation on the mountain due to habitat loss, climate change, and mosquitos that spread the disease avian malaria. A single bite by an infected mosquito can be fatal. Only 17 species remain, some with fewer than 500 individuals left. Without swift action, several species of honeycreepers will become extinct in the next ten years. One technique to saving our forest birds is of a naturally occuring bacteria called Wolbachia that acts as “mosquito birth control.” Male mosquitoes infected with the bacteria can mate but don’t produce offspring, causing populations to crash. To learn more about the “Birds not Mosquitos” effort visit, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/saving-our-forest-birds.htm\">Saving our Forest Birds - Haleakalā National Park (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a><br /> <br /> The remaining forest bird species on Maui and most common are ʻamakihi, ‘apapane, ʻiʻiwi (scarlet honeycreeper), and ʻalauahio (Maui creeper). Very uncommon, restricted just to east Maui and rare are the ʻAkohekohe (crested honeycreeper), and critically endagered Kiwikiu (Maui parrotbill). They represent a colorful thread that runs through the evolutionary history of the Hawaiian Islands, with the strongest and most adaptable species persisting through time. Learn more about these species on our forest bird website <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/birds-of-the-summit-district.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/birds-of-the-summit-district.htm</a>  <br /> <br /> For 20 seconds, close your eyes and count the different bird calls/sounds that you hear, how many did you count? Taking the time to stop, observe and listen affords you an experience you can find no where else in the world. Take a look through the binoculars and read the information wayside panel to learn about these elusive native Hawaiian honeycreeper birds. Continuing along the trail you'll discover the pilina (interconnections) also found within the native shrubland habitat.  </p>",

The building is based on more than a decade’s worth of archaeological research at the site, which began in the 1990s where a large village of the Cathlapotle Nation once stood. It took over 100 volunteers two years to complete it, and the official opening ceremony was conducted on March 29, 2005.<br /> <br /> Meriwether Lewis and William Clark mention the village in their journals, both when they passed the town on November 5, 1805, and on their return journey on March 29, 1806. According to the explorers’ entries, they traded deerskins with the Cathlapotle in exchange for dogs and other provisions during both encounters. Their visit spelled disaster for the local populations since, only 20 years later, European diseases like smallpox took a heavy toll on the Chinookan People. By the late 1830s, those who survived abandoned the site. In 1840, the Carty family claimed the land and built a homestead. It became part of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge in 1965.<br /> <br /> Today, the Cathlapotle Plankhouse plays an important role in the life and community of the Cathlapotle Nation and other Chinookan tribes. It also serves as an outdoor education center and is used by tribal members for special events throughout the year.<br /> <br /> From spring to fall, the plankhouse is open to the public on weekends only. Volunteer docents staff the site, providing tours and information for visitors. The Cathlapotle Plankhouse, the path leading to it, the pedestrian bridge, and the parking log are all ADA accessible. For more information on operating hours and events or to schedule a tour, please call (360) 887-4106.",
            "audioDescription": "The replica pankhouse measures 37 feet by 78 feet and is constructed mainly from cedar timber donated by local landowners and national forests. The two side walls of the building are low to the ground, standing at roughly shoulder-height. From there, the wooden roof rises to a peak that is approximately 20 feet above the ground and is held up by the front and rear walls of the structure. The peak is supported by a cedar log painted red. The front wall features a round entry hole, the top of which is about shoulder-height. A long painted geometric design in red, white, black, yellow, and gray stretches vertically from the ground around the entrance all the way to the peak. Horizontally, the design is just a few inches wider than the entry hole, outlining the entrance in red and white.",

The arch was designed as both an entrance portal and an equestrian overpass, to convey hikers and riders on the Pacific Crest Trail. Designed in the NPS Rustic Architecture style using natural materials, the arch is 90 feet long and the deck of the \"bridge\" rests on two cedar logs, 36 inches in diameter. Two more logs, 30 inches in diameter, serve as guardwalls. The stone abutments are masonry, consisting of irregular, mostly five-sided stones gathered from the roadsides. Built in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the rustic-style arch became deteriorated by the elements and nearly eight decades of use, prompting Mount Rainier National Park to undertake a massive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/photosmultimedia/chinook-entrance-arch.htm\">restoration project</a> to preserve this historic structure in 2011 and 2012.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> The Chinook Entrance Arch is located near Tipsoo Lake. The area experiences heavy snowfall in winter, with snow lingering well into June or even July. A network of easy trails, suitable for all ages, leads through the subalpine meadows and around the lake. <strong>Naches Peak Loop Trail</strong> is a popular hike. Starting from Tipsoo Lake, the 3.4 mi (5.5 km) trail connects to the Pacific Crest Trail on the eastern edge of the park, crosses over the Chinook Entrance Arch, then returns to Tipsoo Lake. This trail features superb wildflower displays in midsummer, huckleberries in early fall, and brilliant autumn colors. Note that while <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets</a> are allowed on the Pacific Crest Trail, they are not permitted on the portion of the loop trail within the park or around Tipsoo Lake. Swimming or wading is not permitted in the lake. Please <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/meadow-preservation.htm\">stay on the trails</a> at all times to avoid damaging the delicate meadow plants. Picnic tables are available near the parking area.<br /> <br /> Tipsoo Lake can experience heavy visitation and parking can be limited. Plan ahead with an alternate destination in mind or come early or late in the day or on a weekday to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/congestion.htm\">avoid congestion</a>.<br /> <br /> Please note that <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft (drone) is prohibited</a> in Mount Rainier National Park (36 CFR 1.5 (a)(1) Superintendent's Compendium). </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Tipsoo Lake is a small alpine lake set into a glacier-carved bowl surrounded by rocky mountain peaks. Subalpine meadows ring the lake, with patchy forest on the surrounding slopes. Traveling east along SR410, the main parking area for Tipsoo Lake forms a horseshoe shape on the left side of the highway. Continuing past the parking area, the highway climbs in a loop around the lake before passing under the Chinook Entrance Arch at Chinook Pass. The entrance arch is not a true arch, but a foot bridge built out of large cedar logs set into stone abutments on either side of the road. The entrance arch marks the park boundary and serves as a crossing for the Pacific Crest Trail which travels north-south along the mountain range. Additional parking is available along the north side of the highway within the park, with a small pull off halfway between the main parking area and the arch providing access to the south side of the lake. The main parking area has two pit toilets located in the center of the horseshoe shape with picnic tables and an information bulletin board located at the top of the horseshoe. The main trail starts next to the bulletin board but quickly splits into several trails weaving through the subalpine meadows around the lake. One trail skirts the edge of the lake. The Naches Peak Loop Trail climbs up the mountain slope to the north, connecting to the Pacific Crest Trail which crosses over the highway using the arch. Trails on the south side of the lake connect to the smaller pull off then cross the highway to reach a secondary smaller lake and the other end of the Naches Peak Loop Trail. Trails are often very narrow, with limited room to pass, and bordered by thick meadow vegetation. Small footbridges cross streams and marshy areas that feed into the lakes in several locations.",

The Knife River Indian Villages are spread out over 1,758 acres of land where the Knife River winds its way north before cutting back southwest. Here, at the confluence of the Missouri and Knife Rivers, was the home of the Corps of Discovery during the winter of 1805. It was at this location that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first met Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau, central figures to the expedition as it headed west in the spring of 1806. But while this area is significant to the history of the Corps of Discovery, the land has a long and rich history of its own.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee77148d-e173-4f42-9b08-6d0f3e96a988}{176}\" paraid=\"1730831961\">With a Native American history dating back to at least 1300 CE, the land is home to the Mandan and Hidatsa people. Evidence of their long history is still visible in the site’s three villages. The southernmost of these villages, called the Awatixa Xi’e Village (also known as the Lower Hidatsa Site), is just a short distance (quarter mile) north from the Knife River Indian Village Visitor Center. Visitors can see the site of what once was home to 50 earth lodges, set out upon about 10 acres of land. Not too far north is the second village, called Awatixa Village, a stone’s throw from the Knife River itself. Of particular note to those interested in the history of the Corps of Discovery is that this village was the home of Sacagawea; in fact, it’s referred to as the Sacagawea Site. Originally, the site consisted of around 60 earth lodges, but today only 31 lodge sites are still visible. Awatixa Village is under threat from the river itself as nature gradually erodes the banks and edges closer to the lodge sites. But the erosion does allow for a unique experience along the walking trail: the chance to see artifacts from the village itself, buried between layers of earth that are gradually eroding, revealing the history below.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee77148d-e173-4f42-9b08-6d0f3e96a988}{246}\" paraid=\"171397149\">The largest, and newest village (established around 1600 CE), is the Hidatsa Village (also known as the Big Hidatsa Village). This is the northernmost site of the Knife River villages and also sits near the Knife River. At one time, the 15.5 acres contained over 100 earth lodges and, at its designation in 1964 as a National Historic Landmark, its remaining constructions were considered among the best examples of Native American earth lodges.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{9}\" paraid=\"1571515515\">Before heading out on the trail to explore the Villages, be sure to stop by the Visitor Center and step inside a modern earth lodge construction, built in 1995 by the National Park Service. Here visitors can get an idea of the varied uses and complexity of these lodges. The earth lodge is available to visitors during regular park hours. In addition, the Knife River Indian Villages website offers more extensive history about the earth lodges and a helpful schematic of what the lodges looked like.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{19}\" paraid=\"48969615\">Admission to the site, its museum, and visitor center is free for all. The site is seasonal, so be sure to check with the visitor center to plan ahead. Keep in mind that the weather also varies in the extremes, from -35 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, to upwards of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{41}\" paraid=\"1778755593\">While there is no camping on the Knife River Indian Villages NHS grounds, there are trails of different length throughout the site that link up and loop around all three villages. As you snap photos along your hike, be sure to share them on the iNaturalist app! This app helps the Knife River Indian Villages NHS research and study the plants and animals found throughout the park. Instructions on how to get and use the app are available through the Knife River Indian Villages NHS website.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{61}\" paraid=\"1513733091\">No food is sold at the visitor center, but hikers are permitted to bring their own food and picnic at designated picnic tables along the trails. In addition to the Indian Villages, there are ample natural sights and wildlife to see. If you are planning to visit the site over multiple days and would like to camp, the Stanton City Park (located at 501 Harmon Avenue, Stanton) is open to campers.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{80}\" paraid=\"1103688598\">Before your visit, check out the Knife River Indian Villages website where you can read up on the history of the area and download a checklist for wildlife viewing. Kids can join the Junior Park Ranger program on the site, as well. If visiting during the summer months, kids are welcome to join the kids camp (free to all) where they can learn about Native American history and partake in canoeing, fishing, crafts, Native American games, and hiking.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{90}\" paraid=\"1923339244\">To get the latest on hours of operation, or to find out more, call the Knife River Indian Villages NHS at (701) 745-3300. </p>",

As a major trailhead for cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, the center also has a warming hut for skiers and recreationists, a 24-hour restroom, a snowmobile parking log, and maps and information pertinent to winter visitors.<br /> <br /> For more information or current Lolo Pass conditions, visit <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nezperceclearwater/recarea/?recid=80112\">Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests - Lolo Pass Visitor Center (usda.gov)</a> or call (208) 942-3113. ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Before European settlement, the high, fog-drenched ridge that dominates central Santa Rosa Island was covered with a \"Cloud Forest\"—a forest of tall oak and pine groves growing out of a cover of shorter chaparral plants, named for the fog that it needs to survive. The trees and plants here harvest water from the heavy fog that regularly rolls across the island and condenses on leaves and twigs, eventually dripping to the ground like rain. Each piece of the cloud forest is integral to its survival: the fog waters the plants, the trees shelter the chaparral shrubs, and the chaparral plants act as a nursery for the trees –they form a deep, moist, and shady leaf litter bed so that acorns and other seeds can sprout and grow. It is the chaparral plants that form the backbone of this relationship, by allowing bigger trees to establish themselves, helping those trees to reproduce and spread, and protecting those trees from eroding soil.</p> <p>However, beginning in the mid-1800s, grazing by non-native animals like sheep, feral pigs, cattle, horses, deer, and elk eliminated most of this cloud forest, along with over 75% of the entire island's native vegetation. When Santa Rosa Island became a part of Channel Islands National Park efforts began to encourage the recovery of native vegetation, beginning with the removal of all non-native grazing animals. The recovery that has followed these actions has been remarkable. Many native plants are now spreading beyond the canyon walls and cliffs where they remained protected from grazing for over 150 years, reestablishing themselves throughout the island.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Santa Rosa Island's cloud forests are not recovering. The areas where they were once found have become too harsh for the chaparral plants that protected and nourished the oak and pine trees to reestablish themselves. Grazing animals stripped the soil down to bedrock, creating deep, barren gulleys that are prone to extreme wind and water erosion. Without the chaparral shrubs, stands of ancient island oaks, which grow nowhere else in the world except on the California Channel Islands, are having the soil and bedrock worn away around them by winds of up to 50 mph. Once their roots are exposed, sometimes to depths of 5 feet, these trees topple, leaving behind more barren ground where acorns and other seeds find no moist nursery in which to grow.</p> <p>Now that the grazing animals have been removed from the island, we have an opportunity to help this amazing environment fully recover. To restore the chaparral and, ultimately, the cloud forest, the US Geological Survey is working closely with Channel Islands National Park and other collaborators to do what the absent chaparral cannot, in order to start the recovery cycle: slow wind and water erosion, trap leaf litter on the ground, collect native seeds, and harvest fog with artificial structures to water plants grown in the island nursery.</p> <p>The details of these restoration efforts include:</p> <ul> <li>Pinning natural fiber wattles along slope contours to slow wind and water erosion at the ground surface</li> <li>Placing rock bags on steep bedrock slopes where anchoring wattles is not possible because of the hard rock.</li> <li>Making check-dams and rock groins in gulleys to slow water, collect sediment, and fill in the ditches</li> <li>Rehabilitating roads to stop erosion</li> <li>Stretching fences across the ground near oaks to trap blowing leaves and tumbling seeds</li> <li>Collecting native seeds and growing them in the island nursery</li> <li>Planting seedlings with the wattles so that their roots can bind sediment into the soil</li> <li>Starting a pine and scrub-oak forest upwind of the island oaks for a windbreak</li> <li>Putting \"fog fences\" –wire fences covered with fabric –around plants to drip water to the ground around them</li> <li>Harvesting and storing fog water in tanks on the ridge to use in the restoration work</li> <li>Monitoring progress by surveying sedimentation and litter build-up in plots along t</li> </ul>",

The maternity roosts are established in areas with ideal temperature and humidity, and are easily disturbed; this has made the species somewhat rare. At the park, the species occurs only on Santa Cruz Island, where it forms an annual maternity roost in a historic building in the Scorpion Ranch area. The Santa Cruz big-eared bat colony is one of only a handful known in the state of California.</p> <p>Quick and Cool Facts</p> <ul> <li>A Townsend's big-eared bat's average lifespan is 16 years; bats may live up to 30 years.</li> <li>Highly maneuverable flyer; capable of flying at slow hovering speeds.</li> <li>Large ears funnel sound into ear canal, and may also provide lift during flight and assist with temperature regulation.</li> <li>Townsend's big-eared bats are very sedentary, with movement by females during the nursing season rarely exceeding 15 km., and movement at other times usually being less than 50 km.</li> <li>When it's roosting or hibernating, Townsend's big-eared bat curls up its long ears so they look like ram's horns.</li> <li>When flying they can rapidly extend or contract their ears. When flying with their ears extended the ears point forward and are nearly parallel to their body.</li> <li>They do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do, but prefer open roosting areas in large rooms with their fur erect to provide maximum insulation and with their ears coiled back.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Townsend's big-eared bats, previously called lump-nosed bats, are a medium-sized bat with very long ears. Their fur is pale gray or brown above and buff colored on the underside. This bat's ears are enormous, reaching a length of 38 mm. When the ears are laid back they extend to the middle of its body. The face is marked by two large glandular lumps on either side of its nose.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Townsend's big-eared bat occurs throughout the west and is distributed from the southern portion of British Columbia south along the Pacific coast to central Mexico and east into the Great Plains, with isolated populations occurring in the central and eastern United States.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, big-eared bats are found only on Santa Cruz Island. The species was first observed in 1939 on Santa Cruz Island in a historic 2-story ranch house at Prisoner's Harbor, which hosted a large maternity colony of over 300 individuals. Subsequent studies showed that the population resided in the same area until 1974, when the structure was removed. From 1974 to 1988, no other Townsend's Big-eared Bats were seen on Santa Cruz Island, before Dr. Pat Brown of UCLA, in 1991, was made aware of a colony of Townsend's roosting in the bakery room of the Scorpion adobe building. Presently, a large maternity colony continues to use the building and, occasionally, the rock caves in the Scorpion area. According to the 1994 Department of Fish and Game report, the Scorpion roost is one of only two or three coastal maternity colonies known to exist south of Pt. Conception.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Big-eared bats have been reported in a wide variety of habitat types ranging from sea level to 3,300 meters. Habitat associations include: coniferous forests, mixed meso-phytic forests, deserts, native prairies, riparian communities, active agricultural areas, and coastal habitat types. Distribution is strongly correlated with the availability of caves and cave-like roosting habitat, with population centers occurring in areas dominated by exposed, cavity forming rock and/or historic mining districts. They prefer open roosting areas in large rooms and do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Radio-tracking has shown that the Scorpion bats forage up to 5 kilometers away to feed on moths and other insects among the native oak and ironwood forest on the north-facing slopes of Scorpion Canyon, returning to the roost each morning. In contrast to other southwest bats, due to its relatively poor urine concentrating ability, it drinks water.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Winter hibernation colonies are comprised of males and females and range in size from a few individuals to several hundred bats. If undisturbed, colonies will occupy the same site indefinitely.</p> <p>In the summer, the females form a nesting roost. Males are solitary during the maternity periods. The maternity colonies consist of one or more small clusters, which rarely exceed 100 bats. Females are alert and active in the maternity roosts and prefer dark places for their roosts. These colonies form between March and June (depending on climate), with pups born between May and July. Maternity colonies choose sites that have warm, stable temperatures for pup rearing. Female bats usually only have one young a year. The newborns range in weight from 2.1-2.7 grams. There is a strong maternal bond and the young bats squawk when the mother is away. The young bats, however, grow quickly, being able to fly within three weeks. After two months, many of the young bats have left the nursery roosts, with male bats leaving before female. In their first year, male bats are almost certainly incapable of breeding while female bats are able to reproduce at the age of four months.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Historically, this species has declined due to direct killing by people and because of destruction or disturbance of roost sites. These animals are sensitive to light and movement so if they are disturbed during the day, they awake and their ears begin to move as they try to identify the intruder. If the disturbance occurs for more than a few seconds, the entire group takes flight and the roost may be abandoned.</p> <p>A study sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Game in the late 1980's documented a population decline of 40-60% in the past 30 years. Only about half of the maternity colonies known to exist in California prior to 1980 were active by 1991, resulting in an estimated 54% decline of adult females. Only three maternity colonies increased in size during the period, and all three are located in National Park areas (Point Reyes National Park, Lava Beds National Monument, and Pinnacles National Monument). Of the 23 roosts that are no longer available to bats, 9 (mostly buildings) have been demolished, 4 (all buildings) have burned, 4 (all buildings) have been renovated in such a way that bats were excluded, and 6 (including buildings, caves, mines, and a water diversion tunnel) have had the entrance closed.</p> <p>Consequently, for this species to exist, it is essential that human disturbance is minimized and the habitat preserved.</p> <p>Human intervention may have helped conserved the population on the west coast of North America, because man-made structures provide a shelter for big-eared bats.1 Channel Islands National Park staff continues with a program of monitoring and surveying this species to ensure its well-being.</p> <p>In 2008, the ICUN listed this species as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, the occurrence in a number of protected areas and because it wasis unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. However, today the Townsend's Big-eared Bat, is state-listed as an Endangered species in Washington, a Sensitive species in Oregon, and as a Species of Special Concern in Texas, Montana and California, and they are on the Blue List in British Columbia.</p> <p>Additional Information</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html\">www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php\">www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html\">http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html</a></li> <li>California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System, California Department of Fish & Game, California Interagency Wildlife Task Group, M037, Updated by CWHR Program Staff, May 2000</li> <li><a href=\"http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2\">http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li>British Colombia, Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks. 1998. <em>Wildlife at Risk: Townsend's Big-eared Ba</em>t.

The western gull, a big bulky bird, is a bold, skillful hunter and scavenger. For the most part, western gulls are coastal dwellers that concentrate mainly in the Southern California area. Due to their opportunistic nature and adaptability, they can also thrive in an urban environment. Unfortunately, because of close proximity to human environs, they are also subject to abnormal environmental pressures.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Found along the along Pacific Coast of North America with breeding sites from central Baja California north to Washington.</li> <li>Relatively limited in distribution compared to most North American gulls.</li> <li>Large colonies are found on Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands.</li> <li>Western Gulls nest on offshore islands, rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries.</li> <li>They nest on the ground and fill the nest with vegetation, feathers, rope, plastic, or other items they find.</li> <li>In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood.</li> <li>The female-biased sex ratio of some western gull colonies may have been the result of pollution by pesticides that acted like estrogen and made some male embryos develop as females.</li> <li>It takes four years for a western gull to achieve its gray and white appearance.</li> <li>They can live up to 25 years old.</li> <li>Western gulls feed only on the ocean's surface and do not dive like many other seabird species.</li> <li>Like most gulls, the western gull is an opportunistic feeder, capturing its own live prey, scavenging refuse, or stealing food from seals and other gulls.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The adult western gull has a deep gray back and wings, with black wing-tips that blend into the rest of the wing, unlike many species where the black is clearly defined. The underwing is white with a narrow band of gray. The head is mostly white, with a limited amount of brown streaking, especially in non-breeding plumage. The large bill is yellow with a red spot, and the eye is dark yellow. The western gull is a four-4 year gull, meaning that it takes four years to achieve adult plumage. Juveniles are mottled brown, with a dark bill and dark eyes, and pinkish-gray legs. This plumage varies and takes on more of the adult plumage characteristics in each successive year.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The western gull is confined to the immediate Pacific coast and its adjacent waters. The islets of Anacapa, which is part of the Channel Islands National Park, hosts the largest protected breeding colony of western gulls in the world with over 10,000 gulls gathering during nesting season from May through July. There is also a sizeable colony of western gulls (approximately 7,000 pairs) on Santa Barbara Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Western gulls spend their life along the ocean and its adjacent waters. They usually breed on near-shore islands and human-made structures, but search for food at sea, along estuaries, and on the shoreline. Wintering gulls may move farther out to sea, but also forage and rest on buildings, parking lots, seaside parks, landfills, and jetties.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Western gulls feed over the open ocean or along rocky shores. When the western gull spots its prey, it captures it by pecking, grabbing, and shallow diving. The bird's omnivorous diet includes squid, clams, mussels, sea urchins, eggs, chicks, adult birds, zooplankton, and small fish like anchovy, whiting, eel, and rockfish. Other oceanic species use the western gull to find prey. In turn, this gull may follow seals to locate food. This resourceful bird scavenges the carcasses of large mammals and when their normal sources of food are diminished, gulls are quick to take advantage of an easy food source such as trash and leftover scraps. By exploiting unnatural food resources their population may be growing larger than it would naturally thus upsetting the ecosystem balance.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Western gulls choose a nest site out of the wind, and out of sight from other gulls. In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood. In late April or May, the female lays two to three light olive to green eggs with dark markings. Both parents incubate; after 4 -5 weeks the gray, downy chicks with black spots hatch. Within a day, the chicks can walk and soon leave the nest. They freely scramble after regurgitated food. If the third chick is not fed enough, it may leave the territory. Neighboring gulls sometimes kill wayward chicks, but adoption is frequent. Chicks play by chasing or tugging on objects. Juveniles fledge in about seven weeks and are usually fed for three months, but sometimes follow adults and beg for up to six months.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Many western gulls do not migrate; the rest cover very short distances to remain on the Pacific coast of North America. Some move south of the breeding range into Baja California. Fall movements peak in October and most adult birds return to their breeding grounds in March.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Populations of western gulls have restricted range and therefore, are vulnerable to oil pollution, ocean acidification, and climate change. In addition, they have also suffered from human disturbances and in the past, introduced black rats on Anacapa Island. Visit Seabirds for more information about restoration activities on Anacapa to remove black rats.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> </ul>",

Contrary to earlier reports of only existing on that island, it is also found on Santa Rosa Island. The species is related to king snakes and rat snake, and is harmless to humans.

By contrast, the Pacific gopher snake, its mainland cousin, can reach 7 feet in length. The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is the only dwarf form of the species, even though three other subspecies also occur on islands (<em>P. c. fulginatus, insulanus</em>, and <em>coronalis</em>).</p> <p>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a rather narrow head that is only slightly wider than the neck and when compared to other races, has a short and flattened snout and a rounded rostral. The adult coloration is typically a light greenish or grayish-white background with a profuse pattern of gloss-black blotches, becoming \"muddied\" or less contrasting with age. Males tend to pull up some bright yellow on their anterior ventral surfaces as they grow. Hatchlings are highly contrasted, being a very light grayish-white with black patterning and range in length from 6.5 to 9 inches.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is found on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands. On the mainland, gopher snakes are found widely throughout western North America.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, like its mainland congeners, is a habitat generalist. It can be found in all vegetation associations on the two islands, but it is most common in open areas such as grasslands, dry streambeds, and oak and chaparral woodlands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes have a less varied diet than other subspecies of gophersnakes. Their diet probably includes mice, lizards, birds' eggs, and nestlings. Juveniles probably take small lizards, mice, and possibly insects.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In spring, juveniles and adults emerge from rodent burrows or rock fissures, where they hibernate during the colder months of fall and winter. Adults probably reproduce in May with females depositing clutches (generally, four to six eggs) from late June through July and hatchlings emerging in September and October.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department for Fish and Game lists the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake as a California Species of Special Concern. The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island was beneficial for Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes. Feral pigs destroyed habitat for snakes and preyed on them as well.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm\">http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm\">http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html</a></li> </ul>",

During the breeding season, March through September, plovers can be seen nesting along the shores, peninsulas, offshore islands, bays, estuaries, and rivers of the United States' Pacific Coast.In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island.

Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Plovers are small birds with long, dark or grayish feet and legs, a short dark bill, large eyes, a rounded head, and long, narrow wings that end in a sharp point. These birds have cryptic coloration. The color of their dorsal areas matches and blends with their surroundings, making them well camouflaged and difficult to see against the sand. They turn away from predators, sometimes crouching to hide their darker head and breast markings. When the birds stop running they seem to disappear, blending into the surroundings.These little birds are sand-colored above and white below, with a narrow dark stripe on the forehead and a dark stripe behind the eyes. They have two, small, dark, partial breast bands and dark ear patches. In breeding season the distinctive markings are darker in males than in females. In winter the difference in sexes is less apparent.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Most western snowy plovers that breed in California's Central Valley and the Great Salt Lake migrate to California and Mexican coasts for the winter. During the winter months they rest and eat to build up their fat reserves for the migration to their summer breeding habitats. The California Pacific coast resident population usually congregates on sand spits and dune-backed beaches. In more urban areas they can be found on bluff-backed beaches.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island. On the Channel Islands they forage in the wet sand and amidst surf-cast kelp in the intertidal zone and in dry, sandy areas above the high tide. In winter, snowy plovers are found on many of the beaches used for nesting as well as on beaches where they do not nest, and on estuarine sand and mud flats.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Snowy plovers are primarily visual foragers, using the run-stop-peck method of feeding. They forage on invertebrates in the wet sand and amongst surf-cast kelp within the inter-tidal zone, in dry, sandy areas above the high tide, on salt pans, on spoil sites, and along the edges of salt marshes, salt ponds, and lagoons. They sometimes probe for prey in the sand and pick insects from low-growing plants. Western snowy plovers have a unique way to catch a meal of kelp or wrack flies. Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air. Adults forage on invertebrates primarily along the water's edge.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The nesting season extends from early March through September, with peak nesting occurring from mid-April through mid-August. Their nests typically are shallow scrapes or depressions on the ground on flat, open areas with sandy or saline substrates, where vegetation and driftwood is sparse or absent. Plover nests are camouflaged and are barely visible to even the well-trained eye. 7 Typically, the plover lays three highly camouflaged eggs in the incubating process;this takes about 28 days, with the females sit on the eggs during the day, the males at night. To distract a potential predator away from the nest, the snowy plover performs broken-wing displays. By acting injured the bird appears to be easy prey and the predator's attention is drawn to the bird. The snowy plover frequently raises two broods a year, and sometimes three in places where the breeding season is long.The female deserts her mate and brood about the time the chicks hatch and initiates a new breeding attempt with a different male.</p> <p>Snowy plover chicks are about the size of a person's thumb when they hatch. They leave their nest within three hours of hatching. They flatten themselves on the ground when a parent signals the approach of people or potential predators. They walk, run, and swim well and forage unassisted by parents, but require periodic brooding for many days after hatching. Chicks reach fledging age about one month after hatching.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Pacific coast population of the western snowy plover was listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. The population has declined due to many factors. Recreational and other human disturbance, loss of habitat to urban development, introduction of beachgrass and other nonnative species, and expanding predator populations have all contributed to a decline in active nesting areas and in the size of the breeding and wintering populations. It is estimated that about 2,000 snowy plovers may breed along the U.S. Pacific Coast and that there are 157 current or historical snowy plover breeding or wintering locations along the U.S. Pacific Coast (USFWS 2001).</p> <p>Channel Islands National Park is one of the few locations in southern California that still supports breeding and wintering populations of western snowy plovers. In the 1990s Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands had both breeding and wintering populations, but numbers have declined precipitously. A few birds also lived on The Nature Conservancy portion of Santa Cruz Island. On Santa Rosa Island the birds inhabited about 16 miles of coastline, while on San Miguel Island they were present on about 10 miles of shoreline (USFWS 2001). The Skunk Point area on Santa Rosa Island is an important nesting area and foraging area for juvenile and migrating plovers. Forty to fifty percent of the nests in this area have been found on rocky outcrops in the back dunes, about 490 to 980 feet (150 to 300 meters) from the shoreline (USFWS 1995).</p> <p>Much of the work done in the recovery and restoration of the western snowy plover on the west coast was based on a plan developed by the Pacific Coast Western Snowy Plover Recovery Team.This plan was acknowledged and utilized in 2007 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their effort as the spearhead in the recovery effort. Much of the plan was implemented by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.</p> <p>A survey was taken in May 2012 that found the overall numbers of western snowy plovers on the west coast to be 1855, which was an increase from the initial recovery program survey in 2005. It is also a significant improvement over the population number of 1537, the number of plovers found in 2007 when the restoration program began. However, the species showed disappointing decline from a count of 1917 plovers in 2011.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory</a></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/\">http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx\">http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx</a>?</em></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover\">http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html\">http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf</a></li> <li>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2007.

Their diet probably includes mice, lizards, birds' eggs, and nestlings. Juveniles probably take small lizards, mice, and possibly insects.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In spring, juveniles and adults emerge from rodent burrows or rock fissures, where they hibernate during the colder months of fall and winter. Adults probably reproduce in May with females depositing clutches (generally, four to six eggs) from late June through July and hatchlings emerging in September and October.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department for Fish and Game lists the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake as a California Species of Special Concern. The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island was beneficial for Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes. Feral pigs destroyed habitat for snakes and preyed on them as well.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm\">http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm\">http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html</a></li> </ul>",

In November of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark stopped to visit with Lorimier's family and purchase supplies for the expedition ahead. <br /> <br /> The reconstructed house displays several exhibits depicting the lives of the area's early settlers. Visitors can peruse 19th-century merchandise in Lorimier's Trading Post or visit the Lorimier Room to see how a home of this period may have been decorated. In the Girardeau Room, a large map of the territory under control of Don Louis Lorimier for the Spanish Government is on display. Visitors can also walk through the Historic Gardens on the north side of the house which contains flowers, vegetables, and herbs typical of a garden in 1803. <br /> <br /> Today, the Red House Interpretive Center is maintained by the City of Cape Girardeau and is open to visitors from May to October.

The museum is nestled inside the retired M.V. Sergeant Floyd, a boat once used by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The boat was named after Sergeant Charles Floyd of Kentucky, one of the members of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{64365f7f-e189-485b-8dbd-359a969b7a05}{184}\" paraid=\"83\">Floyd joined the expedition on August 1st, 1803. He was described as a “man of much merit” by William Clark and was likely chosen for the Corps of Discovery because of the close relationship between the Floyd and Clark families. Sergeant Floyd tragically died, likely of a ruptured appendix, on August 20th, 1804 in present-day Sioux City, Iowa, making him the only member of the Lewis and Clark expedition to die on the journey. The M.V. Sergeant Floyd was created over a century later, keeping the memory of the fallen sergeant alive. </p> <p paraeid=\"{64365f7f-e189-485b-8dbd-359a969b7a05}{198}\" paraid=\"85\">The M.V. Sergeant Floyd was deployed in 1932 in Jeffersonville, Indiana. The boat was mostly utilized by the Corps of Engineers for menial work, such as water inspection and towing. She was used until 1975, at which point she became a moving exhibit for the Army Corps of Engineers to celebrate their Bicentennial. M.V. Sergeant Floyd functioned as an exhibit for 18 months, before finally being decommissioned. After her decommissioning, the boat was moved around and considered for various uses before she finally became the museum she is today. </p> <p paraeid=\"{64365f7f-e189-485b-8dbd-359a969b7a05}{216}\" paraid=\"87\">The museum currently offers free admission to its various exhibits covering the history of transportation on the Missouri River and the Lewis and Clark expedition. The restored third level of M.V. Sergeant Floyd’s Motor Vessel is available for visitor viewing. </p> <p paraeid=\"{64365f7f-e189-485b-8dbd-359a969b7a05}{226}\" paraid=\"89\">For more information about the Sergeant Floyd River Museum and Welcome Center, call (712) 279-0198 </p>",

They hunted and fished the lush land and bountiful waters. Over time, the area was home to encampments, burial mounds, and at least one village, the remnants of which can still be seen.

Once the largest population of native peoples in the area, Clark noted in his journal that the majority of them had been wiped out by diseases like smallpox and cholera. At the time of Lewis and Clark’s visit, there were fewer than 400 members of the Missouri tribes left. No longer an independent nation and dealing with raids from the Sac and Fox tribe, the survivors eventually left the area to join with the Otoes, Little Osage, Kansa, and Ioway tribes.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{659851cf-adbf-4a6c-928d-455d880187c3}{253}\" paraid=\"1679316117\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Annie & Abel Van Meter State Park park boasts over 1,000 acres of trails, freshwater marshes, lush forests, and camping. The Missouri's American Indian Cultural Center is also located within the park and features exhibits detailing the nine tribes that inhabited the region, namely the Otoe-Missouria, Osage, Delaware, Ioway, Ilini-Peoria, Kanza, Kickapoo, Sac and Fox, and Shawnee. Murals and artifacts show visitors what life was like in the 19th-century, as well as the impact and long-lasting effects that European exploration had on the tribes. A 10-minute video also gives an overview of the area’s geology and the settlement of the area by the Vanmeter family and development of the park.

            "bodyText": "<p>Located on Quechan and Cocopah lands, the Colorado River State Historic Park interprets and perserves a significant site in the history of Arizona and the American West. The first non-indigenous contact with the Quechan happened in 1540, when Hernando de Alarcón sailed passed this site. Alarcón became the first to navigate a Spanish ship from the Gulf of California up the Colorado River in his mission to resupply the Coronado overland expedition. Many years later, Padre Eusebio Kino may have looked out over the river from this site in 1683.<br /> <br /> The Anza expedition crossed the Colorado River near Colorado River State Historic Park with the help of the local Quechan guides in November of 1775. Padre Font wrote in his expedition journal: \"I estimated the width of the river, where we forded it, at some three or four hundred yards, and this at a time when the water is at its lowest, for when the river rises it is leagues wide\". When the expedition members safely reached the other side, they were treated to a feast of watermelon courtesy of the Quechan leader Salvador Palma. Padre Garces of the expedition chose to stay in this area only to see the relationship between the Spanish and Quechan erode. In 1781, the newly established Catholic mission across the river was destroyed and Garces was killed.<br /> <br /> The area began to experience the American westward surge when countless immigrants crossed by ferry from Yuma on their way to the California gold fields in 1849. In 1850, a military post was established at Yuma, and when rich placer gold strikes on the Colorado River precipitated a gold rush in 1858, Yuma experienced a boom. In 1871 Yuma incorporated and became the county seat of Yuma County.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the diverse history of this place by visiting the <a href=\"https://azstateparks.com/colorado-river/explore/facility-information\">Visitor Center</a> or visit the <a href=\"https://azstateparks.com/colorado-river/\">park's website</a>.

            "bodyText": "<p>Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park comprises six sites in the greater Dayton, Ohio, area. The park boundary at these six sites encompasses 111 acres. Established in 1992, the partnership park preserves and interprets resources related to inventors Wilbur and Orville Wright, writer Paul Laurence Dunbar, and sites in Dayton associated with the early development of aviation.<br /> <br /> There are five national historic landmarks and two national register historic districts within Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. These include the Wright Cycle Company building, Hoover Block, Huffman Prairie Flying Field, 1905 Wright Flyer III, Hawthorn Hill, and the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial. Together, these sites tell the stories of the lives and legacies of Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, and Paul Laurence Dunbar. The fourth Wright Cycle Company building and the Hoover Block are located at South Williams and West Third Streets. The fourth location of the bicycle shop operated by the Wrights is the only building remaining as testament to their bicycle business. The site was designated a national historic landmark in 1990. Wilbur and Orville Wright operated Wright & Wright, Job Printers, on the second floor of the Hoover Block from 1890 to 1895. The building houses the Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center. The Hoover Block was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the West Third Street Historic District in 1988. The Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center is co-located with the Aviation Trail Visitor Center and Museum. Aviation Trail, Inc., is one of the park’s partners.<br /> <br /> Not far from the Wright Cycle Company and the WrightDunbar Interpretive Center is the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial. Paul Laurence Dunbar, a transformational African-American poet, novelist, and playwright, lived in the house in west Dayton with his mother, Matilda Dunbar, from 1904 until his death in 1906. After Matilda Dunbar’s 1934 death, the State of Ohio acquired the property and opened it for public visitation as the first house museum commemorating an African American. It was designated a national historic landmark in 1962. The Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial is owned by the State of Ohio, managed by the Ohio History Connection, and operated jointly by NPS staff and Dayton History. The Ohio History Connection and Dayton History are two of the park’s partners. Occupying the grounds of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Huffman Prairie Flying Field is where the Wright brothers proved the aeroplane was a practical invention in 1904 and 1905. The 84-acre Huffman Prairie Flying Field was designated a national historic landmark in 1990. The Flying Field is on an active military installation, and as such, it is subject to unannounced closure<br /> <br /> At Carillon Historical Park, the 1905 Wright Flyer III is the centerpiece of the Wright Brothers Aviation Center. The world’s first practical aeroplane, it was built by the Wright brothers in 1905 and flown at Huffman Prairie Flying Field. The Wright Flyer III was designated a national historic landmark in 1990 and a historic mechanical engineering landmark in 2003. Carillon Historical Park and the Wright Flyer III are owned and managed by Dayton History, one of the park’s partners.<br /> <br /> Hawthorn Hill, south of central Dayton, is open for tours through Dayton History. In 1914, Orville Wright, Katharine Wright, and Milton Wright moved into this large Georgian revival style mansion in Oakwood. Orville, later joined by servants Charles and Carrie Kayler Grumbach, lived at Hawthorn Hill until his death in 1948. Hawthorn Hill was designated a national historic landmark in 1991.<br /> <br /> The Wright Company factory in west Dayton opened in 1910 as the first factory in the United States designed especially for building aeroplanes, a testament to the brothers’ attempt to commercialize their invention. Students at the Wright School of Aviation also came here to learn plane controls on a simulator. The factory, currently in private ownership, is a new part of the park and is not yet open to the public.<br /> <br /> Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park is part of the National Aviation Heritage Area. Authorized by Congress in November 2004, the National Aviation Heritage Area honors the region’s leadership in the nation’s aviation history. The National Aviation Heritage Area provides visitors with an opportunity to experience several significant sites associated with aviation, including the sites of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park.</p>",

It is possible that this pond is in the process of changing into \"muskeg,\" which is a spongy, wet bog. As muskeg is highly acidic, it is difficult for things to grow.

However, the tree frog is probably the most abundant frog found in California as well as the western United States.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can find the extended family of treefrogs in your backyard, along the beach, in the Mojave Desert, in woodlands, in grasslands or pastures, and even at 11,000 feet on Mount Whitney.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs change color based on the air temperature and humidity.</li> <li>Baja California treefrog's color change is to reduce the likelihood that it will become a meal for a bullfrog, raccoon, heron, snake, or other predator.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs have special \"sticky pads\" on their feet that help them climb.</li> <li>Treefrog are the only frog in the West that makes the classic \"ribbet\" vocalization - the sound that Hollywood film producers have made familiar around the world.</li> <li>Frog music is heard most often in the spring, but treefrogs vocalize all year unless the temperature dips below freezing.</li> <li>Interestingly, the treefrogs coordinate their vocalizations, creating a frog chorus. One male acts as the \"chorus master\" and starts calling. Other males in the vicinity gradually join in as the chorus swells.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Male Baja California treefrogs are just under 2 inches long and generally green or dark gray, with a creamy underside. Females are gray or brown and a bit larger than the males. The color of both sexes can vary, but you can verify the Baja California treefrog identification by looking for a dark brown or black band that runs from the eyes to the shoulders and white underside.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Even though the Baja California treefrog exist on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Catalina islands, the range of this frog is not clear, due to the small number of specimens sampled for the study that described the species. It is apparently found throughout southern California, south of Santa Barbara County and Bakersfield and on the offshore islands, excluding most of the southeast deserts. It ranges farther east into Nevada, and south into Baja California.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> This species utilizes a wide variety of habitats, often far from water outside of the breeding season, including forest, woodland, chaparral, grassland, pastures, desert streams and oases, and urban areas. Although, in the breeding season, shallow bodies of water act as habitat due to its component in the laying of eggs. During active periods, adults are most commonly found in close proximity to and along stream channels. During the daytime, individuals seek refuge in cavities or small depressions on the surfaces of the boulders lining streams, often fully exposed to direct sunlight. These perches are usually within a few jumps from the nearest pool.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog eats a wide variety of invertebrates, primarily on the ground at night, including a high percentage of flying insects. During the breeding season, they also feed during the day. Typical of most frogs, prey is located by vision, and then the frog lunges with a large sticky tongue to catch the prey and bring it into the mouth to eat. Tadpoles are suspension feeders, eating a variety of prey including algaes, bacteria, protozoa and organic and inorganic debris.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Breeding is aquatic. Fertilization is external. Breeding and egg-laying occurs between November until July, depending on the location. Adults probably become reproductively mature in their first year. Males move to breeding waters and begin to make their advertisement call. These calls attract more males, then eventually females. Males call while in or next to water at night, and during daylight during the peak of breeding when calling can occur all day and night. Some males and females have been observed staying only a few weeks at a breeding site. Some males have been observed moving to another site. And others have been observed staying at a site the entire breeding season.Males are territorial during the breeding season, establishing territories that they will defend with an encounter call or by physically butting and wrestling with another male. Satellite male breeding behavior has been observed - a silent male will intercept and mate with females that are attracted to the calling of other territorial males.</p> <p>Females lay on average between 400 - 750 eggs in small, loose, irregular clusters of 10 - 80 eggs each. Egg clusters are attached to sticks, stems, or grass in quiet shallow water. The eggs hatch in two to three weeks. Eggs appear to be resistant to the negative effects of solar UV-B radiation and even to increased water acidification. Eggs can also survive freezing temperatures for a short time. Tadpoles aggregate for thermoregulation and to avoid predation.</p> <p>Tadpoles metamorphose in about 2 to 2.5 months, generally from June to late August. In summer, there are often large congregations of new metamorphs along the banks of breeding pools. Metamorphosed juveniles leave their birth pond soon after transformation, dispersing into adult habitats.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. This frog is not included on the Special Animals List, meaning there are no significant conservation concerns for it in California according to the Dept. of Fish and Game.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm\">https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html\">http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog\">http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/</a></li> </ul>",

It is the national bird and symbol of the United States of America. This sea eagle has two known sub-species and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. Bald eagles typically can be found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. In Channel Islands National Park, due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands.<br /> <br />  </p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The scientific name means \"a white-headed sea eagle\" and comes from the Greek words <em>halos</em>, meaning sea; <em>aetos</em> meaning an eagle; <em>leukos</em> meaning white; and <em>kephalus</em> referring to the head. Bald is from the Middle English word <em>balled</em>, meaning shining white.</li> <li>Rather than do their own fishing, bald eagles often go after other creatures' catches. A bald eagle will harass a hunting osprey until the smaller raptor drops its prey in midair, where the eagle swoops it up.</li> <li>Had Benjamin Franklin prevailed, America's emblem might have been the wild turkey not the bald eagle.</li> <li>The largest bald eagle nest on record, in St. Petersburg, Florida, was 10 feet in diameter and 20 feet tall. Another famous nest—in Vermilion,Ohio—was shaped like a wine glass and weighed over 2 tons. It was used for 34 years until the tree blew down.</li> <li>Immature bald eagles spend the first four years of their lives in nomadic exploration of vast territories and can fly hundreds of miles per day. Some young birds from California have reached Alaska.</li> <li>Bald eagles can live a long time, with a longevity record of 28 years in the wild and 36 years in captivity.</li> <li>Bald eagles occasionally hunt cooperatively, with one individual flushing prey towards another.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but reversed sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many raptors, is evident in the species in that females are 25 percent larger than males. The beak, feet, and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. It presently occupies historical habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England. Northern eagles are migratory,while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year.</p> <p>Historical records indicate that in the early 20th century bald eagles bred on all islands within the park, with at least two dozen nesting pairs over the 8 Channel Islands. Breeding bald eagles provided important ecosystem functions in the northern Channel Islands. For example, bald eagles were once the top marine aerial predator and probably fed upon a variety of seabirds and fish. Bald eagles are generally highly territorial, and in the past this behavior may have prevented golden eagles from colonizing the islands. Due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands. Bald eagles have also been reintroduced on Santa Catalina Island</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The bald eagle explores sea coasts and other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish as well as rivers,large lakes, and mountainous open country. The bald eagle prefers old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Selected trees must have good visibility, an open structure, and proximity to prey, but the height or species of tree is not as being in close proximity to water. The bald eagle is extremely sensitive to human activity, and is found most commonly in areas free of human disturbance.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The bald eagle's diet is opportunistic and varied, but most feed mainly on fish. When fish sources are unavailable, eagles may rely largely on carrion, especially in winter, and they will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales, though it seems that carcasses of hoofed animals and large fish are preferred. They also may sometimes feed on subsistence scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps. Mammalian prey includes rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, and deer fawns. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, egrets, and geese. Most live prey are quite a bit smaller than the eagle, but predatory attacks on large birds such as the great blue heron and even swans have been recorded. Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans (especially crabs) are preyed on when available.</p> <p>Fishing is a learned behavior for the bald eagle, and so juvenile eagles spend their first year eating carrion (carcasses) until they become proficient at fishing (Dooley et al. 2005). Prey remains from bald eagle nests on Santa Catalina Island contained almost 90% fish (Newsome etal. 2010), but an historic bald eagle nest on San Miguel contained more bird remains than fish (Collins et al. 2005). The abundance of seabirds and pinnipeds on the northern Channel Islands means eagles likely take advantage of those resources more than in other areas. This could pose a problem for recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands (see below), because pinnipeds and seabirds contain more DDE than do marine fish, due to bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Bald eagles nest in trees except in regions where only cliff face sor ground sites are available. They tend to use tall, sturdy conifers that protrude above the forest canopy, providing easy flight access and good visibility. In southern parts of their range, bald eagles may nest in deciduous trees, mangroves, and cactus. It's unknown whether the male or the female takes the lead in selecting a nest site. Nests are typically built near the trunk, high up in the tree but below the crown.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, where large trees are scarce, bald eagles have built nests on cliff faces, rock shelves and shallow cliffs, as well as in island pines and Torrey pines. One pair even attempted nesting in a grassland on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>Bald eagles build some of the largest of all bird nests—typically5 to 6 feet in diameter and 2 to 4 feet tall and ranging in shape from cylindrical to conical to flat, depending on the supporting tree. Both sexes bring materials to the nest, but the female does most of the placement. They weave together sticks and fill in the cracks with softer material such as grass, moss, or cornstalks. The inside of the nest is lined first with lichen or other fine woody material, then with downy feathers and sometimes sprigs of greenery. Ground nests are built of whatever's available, such as kelp and driftwood near coastal shorelines. Nests can take up to three months to build, and may be reused (and added to) year after year. The female lays one to three eggs with a usual clutch size of two eggs. The eggs are incubated for approximately 35 days, and the young eagles fledge 10 - 12 weeks after hatching. Bald eagles become sexually mature at five to six years with maturity usually corresponding to when their head and tail feathers become white.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The bald eagle's recovery is a spectacular conservation success story. Once abundant in North America, the species became rare in the mid-to-late 1900s—the victim of trapping, shooting, and poisoning as well as pesticide-caused reproductive failures. In 1978 the bird was listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Since 1980, gentler treatment by humans along with the banning of DDT (the bird's main pesticide threat) has led to a dramatic resurgence. By the late 1990s, breeding populations of bald eagles could be found throughout most of North America.</p> <p>In 2002, with funding from the <a href=\"http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/southwest/montrose/index.html\">Montrose Trustees Restoration Program</a>, the park (in conjunction with partner, <a href=\"http://www.iws.org/\">Institute for Wildlife Studies</a>) began to introduce juvenile bald eagles to the northern Channel Islands. This was done using a technique called \"hacking\". Birds of approximately 8 weeks of age were kept in one of two hack towers on Santa Cruz Island until they were ready to fly (at approximately 3 months of age). Sixty-one young bald eagles were introduced to the northern Channel Island between 2002 and 2006.</p> <p>Today, bald eagles are again an important part of the island ecosystem. 2006 marked the first successful bald eagle nest on the Channel Islands in over 50 years, and since that time, the recovering bald eagle population on the islands has grown. As of 2013 there were five breeding pairs on Santa Cruz Island, two on Santa Rosa, and one on Anacapa, and a total of over 40 bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p>Recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands was seen as critical to recovery of the endangered island fox, since nesting bald eagles might dissuade dispersing golden eagles (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>) from establishing breeding territories on the islands (Coonan et al. 2010). Golden eagle predation was responsible for the massive decline of island foxes on the northern Channel Islands in the 1990s.</p> <p>In June 2007, the bird's recovery prompted its removal from the Endangered Species list. Continuing threats to bald eagle populations include lead poisoning from ammunition in hunter-shot prey, collisions with motor vehicles and stationary structures, and development-related destruction of shoreline nesting, perching, roosting and foraging habitats.</p> <p>Based upon information of population trends, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has listed the bald eagle a species of Least Concern and current data demonstrates that the population is presently increasing.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species/baleag\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bald_Eagle/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005688/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.peregrinefund.org/subsites/explore-raptors-2001/eagles/baldeagl.html\">The Peregrine Fund</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.J., C.A.

Today, BiJian resides in Camarillo and still creates paper sculptures, but has also expanded to other materials.<br /> <br /> In this exhibit, BiJian artistically transformed PVC into 3D kinetic sculptures of a pygmy mammoth, island fox, bald eagle, and other island species.<br /> <br /> BiJian's artwork has exhibited internationally and earned numerous recognitions.<br /> <br /> <u><strong>Channel Island Slender Salamander Natural History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Batrachoseps pacificus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Channel Island slender salamander is found on Santa Cruz, San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa islands and is the only endemic amphibian found on any of the California islands. This secretive creature is found under rocks and logs (mainly near streams) and also in the soil litter, or duff, during the winter and spring rainy season.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Channel Islands slender salamander is a member of family Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders.</li> <li>Lungless salamanders breathe through their skin, requiring them to live in damp environments on land, not in water, and to move about on the ground only during times of high humidity.</li> <li>Typical of most slender salamanders, when disturbed, this salamander may coil up and remain still, relying on cryptic coloring to avoid detection.</li> <li>It might also uncoil quickly and spring away, repeatedly bouncing over the ground, or drop its tail to distract a predator.</li> <li>The tail is easily broken off, but it can be regenerated.</li> <li>The cool marine climate of the Channel Islands, including summer fog, provides enough moisture for this species to be active all year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is a small slim salamander with 18-20 costal grooves, which denote its rib connections. It has short limbs, a narrow head, long slender body, very long tail, and with its conspicuous costal and end of torso grooves, this species has the worm-like appearance typical of most slender salamanders. There are four toes on the front and hind feet, which is also typical of slender salamanders. Fairly robust for a slender salamander, with relatively long legs. Its coloration is brown to pinkish above with a wide dorsal stripe with indefinite borders, and may be made up of many light speckles. The throat and underside of the tail are pale and the abdomen area is whitish or slate, with light and dark speckling.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is an endemic species found only on the Channel Islands, although not on Santa Barbara Island. Interestingly, Channel Islands slender salamanders share their habitat on Santa Cruz Island with another similar species, the black-bellied slender salamanders without interbreeding. In one February survey, researchers recorded 155 Channel Islands slender salamanders and 152 black-bellied slender salamanders in similar habitat. However, only Channel Islands slender salamanders were found under driftwood on a sandy substrate near the ocean. In general, when only one species is found at a more open site, it is usually Channel Islands slender salamanders.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Channel Islands slender salamanders occur in grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, oak woodlands, and pine forest communities. They have been found under rocks and logs, especially near streams. Dense populations have been found in open areas near the ocean; in February at the west end of Santa Cruz Island, salamanders were abundant under driftwood on sand within 200 feet of the ocean. Periods of surface activity correspond generally to the rainy season, especially in drier inland valleys (e.g., Santa Cruz Island). However, the moderating influence of cool, marine air, combined with daily fog, extends activity throughout the summer.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Feeding probably occurs both above and below ground. Studies describe that a similar species, the California slender salamander (B. attenuatus) capture prey using a projectile tongue and feed on small invertebrates, which consist of on earthworms, small slugs, a variety of terrestrial arthropods including sowbugs and millipedes, and insects including collembolans, aphids, caterpillars, small beetles, beetle larvae, and ants. The Channel Islands slender salamander probably eats a similar array of prey items.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander do not have the ability to dig their own burrows, but use excavations of other animals and cracks in the soil, in addition to man made tunnels and crevices. Because of this they must descend from the surface to moist areas underground before the late spring. Eggs are laid while the female is below ground during late fall and winter. Egg sets have been found from December 8 to January 18. The number of eggs per set ranged from 13 to 20. Hatchlings emerge during winter and early spring. It is not known if adults tend their young, and the adults and the young animals migrate to the surface during the early rains in the fall and winter. The timing of this cycle is highly dependent on weather, and varies greatly between wet and dry years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The most recent edition of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the Channel Islands slender salamander as of Least Concern since, although its Extent of Occurrence is much less than 5,000 per square kilometer, it is common and occurs in an area of extensive, suitable habitat which appears not to be under threat, it has a presumed large population, and it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>Natural History of The Islands of California, Schoenherr, Feldmeth & Emerson</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.amphibiaweb.org/\">http://www.amphibiaweb.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626\">http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626</a></li> </ul>",

This wondrous site remains revered and spiritual to many, including non-Native Americans.<br /> <br /> This site features the park's only visitor center. It is located at at 16062 State Route 104, Chillicothe, OH 45601. Visitor center hours are 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, every day of the week (except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day & New Year’s Day). Park grounds are open every day of the year from dawn until dusk.<br /> <br /> Please be mindful that Mound City Group is still considered a sacred place by many people, so we ask all visitors to treat the earthworks with respect. There are no trails within the enclosure. Visitors are welcome to stroll reverently amongst the mounds. Please, <u><strong>do not walk on</strong></u> the mounds or earthen walls. Park trails include a nature trail and a beautiful paved river walk along the Scioto River. The nature trail winds through a young forest and passes masonry stones from a lock of the Ohio-Erie Canal that ran along the west border of the park in the 1800’s.

But they may help other trees survive by becoming \"nurse logs”, which play an important role in forest ecology. On the forest floor, the dense cover of ferns can impede the growth of new trees. Downed trees can provide an excellent perch for seedlings to take root. Also, by falling the dead tree opens up space in the forest canopy allowing light to reach the forest floor. As the logs decay, their accumulated nutrients become available to young trees and moss that also grows on the log helps retain water. Eventually nurse logs will rot away altogether, but by then the younger trees growing out of them may have extended their roots into the soil so they can survive on their own. In some places you will find rows of trees growing around seemingly hollow spaces where nurse logs once existed.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Are you ready to step back in time over 2,000 years ago to experience a prehistoric culture that created enormous earthen monuments and crafted intricate artwork out of exotic natural materials that paid homage to their own? Well, you won’t need to arrange a trip to the ancient pyramids of Egypt or the preserved ruins of the Roman Empire in Italy. Look no farther than the heartland of the United States; Ohio. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hocu/index.htm\">Hopewell Culture National Historical Park</a> protects the remains of a dynamic social and ceremonial phenomenon that once flourished in the woodlands of eastern North America.<br /> <br /> Long before the first Europeans ever set foot on the continent, American Indians were constructing earthen mounds and embankments that enclosed hundreds of acres of land throughout the south-central Ohio area. Burial mounds to mark the locations of their dead and earthworks formed into huge geometric patterns, like circles, squares, and octagons, were the signatures of this ancient culture. The people now known as the Hopewell built these ceremonial places and gathered at them for feasts, funerals, and rites of passage.<br /> <br /> When you come to the park’s visitor center at Mound City Group, you walk in the footprints of American Indians who constructed these sites from about 200 B.C. to A.D. 500. As you walk among the burial mounds, you can read about their significance and what was discovered by archeologists who tell us the story through their research. Taking a tour inside the visitor center, you’ll witness pieces of ancient, priceless artwork crafted by American Indian hands. Effigy birds crafted from copper brought from the Lake Superior region, earspools made of silver from southern Ontario, and a spear point blade fabricated from obsidian brought from Wyoming, more than 2,000 miles away!<br /> <br /> As your tour at the Mound City Group comes to an end, journeying to the park’s other sites will leave you equally astounded and in awe of the accomplishments of the Hopewell culture. The grand scale of the geometric earthworks is enough to tire out visitors, figuratively and literally. Trails at each of the park’s sites will take you on journeys that will have you counting your steps in miles, not feet. A small jaunt at any of the sites is enough to make us appreciate the engineering, manpower, and skill involved in creating these ancient monuments.<br /> <br /> Located in Chillicothe, Ohio, the park’s visitor center at Mound City Group offers an award-winning 19-minute orientation film and a world-class museum filled with exquisite artifacts that are over 2,000 years old. The park is less than 60 miles south of Ohio’s capital, Columbus, and is only 77 miles southeast of Dayton and 105 miles northeast of Cincinnati.

            "bodyText": "Historically, ranchers had to manually build their large haystacks by using tools such as pitchforks and wagons. This took a great deal of hard work and manual power to stack enough hay to feed their livestock through the harsh winter. Over time more efficient ways to stack hay were developed, which used large machines with cables and pulleys to speed up the process.<br /> <br /> This Jenkins hay stacker was patented in 1906 and is an automatic swinging hay stacker, which rotates or pivots to move hay from one location to another and place it in a pile, or haystack. It only required one person and one horse to operate it instead of needing a team of men and horses. The cut hay was placed on the front of the stacker on the fork, which laid on the ground. The person operating the device would then set the pulleys and gears to “control” the movement of the stacker. Once everything was set, the operator guided the horse to pull on the cables. This caused the fork to rise and pivot to one side and dump the hay on to the stack and then return the fork back to the ground, where it was ready for more cut hay to be lifted. <br /> <br /> The cutting, stacking, and storing of hay became a critical task on western ranches by the turn of the century.  As grazing lands were fenced in to create pastures, livestock needed supplemental feed, especially in the winter months when heavy snows made access to grass more challenging. Just a single cow or single horse can consume 24-27 pounds of hay each day in the winter. While some ranchers in the Open Range Cattle Era were using hay to feed some livestock, the need to prepare and store enough hay for all livestock to survive through harsh winters proved to be a necessity, and not just an option, following the Hard Winter of 1886-1887.<br /> <br /> It is also crucial to build and shape the haystacks properly to protect the feed from storms and winter weather. While the outside layer of the hay is exposed to the elements, most of the snow and rain will gently roll off the top and trickle down the sides, which protects the inner layer of hay within the stack from mold and moisture. <br /> <br /> This Jenkins hay stacker is a conserved artifact at Grant-Kohrs Ranch and repair and restoration efforts were completed in July of 2004. The work done on the stacker included replacing rotten wooden beams, and rusted iron bolts. The entire hay stacker was also raised off the ground and placed on pedestals to slow down the weathering and decay process of its wooden base. <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "The Jenkins hay stacker is approximately 18 feet tall and 15 feet wide. It is over 1200 pounds in total weight. The wood beams have a pyramid shape to create the main framework which is angled down and looks like a slide. On the ground is a large wooden fork attached to the stacker on which the cut hay is placed to be stacked. The fork is 10 feet long and 14 feet wide. White Oak wood is one of the materials used in the conservation work to replace decayed timbers. It is located in the western fields of the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site property, near the western park boundary. There is a ranch road walking trail along the base of the hills near the hay stacker. The land to the north, east and south of the hay stacker slopes down to the banks of the Clark Fork River, which is approximately a quarter of a mile away. To the west of the hay stacker, the hills are approximately 100 feet high.",

            "audioDescription": "(1012 words)C&O Canal Lock 4 is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, east of 31st street, NW, west of Thomas Jefferson street, south of M street, and north of K street.From the intersection of M and Thomas Jefferson streets, travel south four hundred forty feet on Thomas Jefferson street. Turn right along the brick walkway about seventy feet and Lock 4 will be on your left.A red wood railing runs along the edge of the walkway. Just beyond is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads: \"Lock 4.\" A three by four-foot wayside sign sits two feet left along the rail. The sign is titled in the top right corner: \"At All Hours.\" A subtitle in read below reads:It shall be their duty, at all hours, by night as well as by day, to pass all boats and floats presenting themselves at their locks.Charles Mercer, President, C&O Canal CompanyText below describes the operation of the canal lock operators and system:At All HoursIt shall be their duty, at all hours, by night as well as by day, to pass all boats and floats presenting themselves at their locks.Charles Mercer, President, C&O Canal CompanyEvery time his boat passed through a lock, a boat captain put his life and livelihood in the hands of the locktender. The wooden lock gates were a delicate balance between safety and efficiency. They had to be light enough to allow one man to move them, yet strong enough to hold back 140,000 gallons of water. A skilled locktender could judge and adjust the flow of water in or out of the lock to minimize the risk to boat and lock.Locktenders were responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of liftlocks. Neglect or carelessness could mean disaster. In exchange for a small monthly salary, an acre of land and a house, locktenders heeded the horn blast of boatmen even at 2 a.m. or on Sunday. After all, time was money.A black and white picture below shows a canal boat sitting at a lock. A man holds ropes connected to the boat from the towpath on the right. A woman stands behind him further along the towpath.Along the right side of the sign are three drawings with green backgrounds showing a boat as it passes through the blue water of a canal and lock. The top of the column states: How A Lock WorksLift locks raised and lowered boats to overcome changes in elevation.The top image shows a boat entering a lock. The upstream gate is open. Text below reads:A boat heading downstream enters the lock. Mules are unhitched and the locktender closes the upstream gates.The image below shows the upstream gate closed. The boat seems to be sitting lower in the canal. Text reads:The locktender opens the downstream paddles. Water flows out and the boat is lowered.In the bottom image, the boat is leaving the lock area, and continuing down the canal. Text reads:With water levels equal, the locktender opens the downstream gates. The mules are hitched and the boat moves on.The wayside stands between the upstream and downstream lock gates. To the right about twenty feet an oak tree sits along the canal edge. Just beyond it is a wood walkway, about ten feet long, that leads from the brick walkway to the canal's edge. Wood rails line the sides and the space is chained off at the walkway. A six-inch wide cobblestone border lines the walkway edge. Six feet to the right along the path and before a second oak tree is another wayside, titled:Creating a National ParkAn image above shows about ten people walking along a path A man in white hat and shirt is in the center. Text in the top right corner reads:Douglas, in the white shirt, and his companions hiked over 20 miles a day. Few hikers could maintain Douglas's pace.Text below reads:Creating a National ParkIt is a refuge, a place of retreat, a long stretch of quiet and peace at the Capital's back door...William O. DouglasLook around you. The park you stand in exists because people cared. In January 1954, William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court of the United States responded to a Washington Post editorial recommending that the C&O Canal be turned into a parkway. Writing in support of preserving the canal as a national park, Douglas wrote, \"It is a sanctuary for everyone who loves woods - a sanctuary that would be utterly destroyed by a fine two lane highway.\" He invited the editors and other reporters to join him on a hike of the entire canal to enjoy its beauty and better understand his point. Merlo Pusey, who wrote the editorial, and his editor Robert Estabrook accepted the challenge. On March 22, 1954, the hike began near Cumberland. Douglas and his companions invited authorities on the natural and cultural history of the Potomac River and the C&O Canal to join them. The hikers learned about the canal and enjoyed the scenery. After the hike, Estabrook wrote an editorial in the Post supporting setting the canal aside as a national park. The walk, and the news stories it generated, motivated hundreds to fight to save the canal. In 1961 the C&O Canal was preserved as a National Monume",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Taft birthplace home and a portion of the cultural landscape has been restored to its appearance of 1857 - 1877 when Taft was growing up here. The Taft property, during the family's occupation, demonstrated qualities associated with both rural and urban landscapes. The front of the property contained simple plantings of trees, flowers and shrubs that fit into the urban landscape of the neighborhood. While the back of the property was more rural in nature. The suburban setting of large homes in which Taft grew up changed as the city grew around it. The restoration of the natural setting is important in helping to retain something of the original setting. Visitors to the site today will get a glimpse of the natural environment that William Howard Taft saw as a boy in this Mount Auburn neighborhood.<br /> <br /> The Taft family house was built in two phases.  The original section of the house was the front portion of the house, constructed in essentially a two-story, squared shape, facing Auburn Avenue.  It was completed in 1840.  Eleven years later, Alphonso Taft, William Howard's father, purchased the house for he and his expanding family.  Not long after purchasing the house and additional property around it, he began expanding the home by adding the portion on the house's eastern side, transforming the house into an \"L\" shape.  The new rear section followed the contour of the land and added a level to the overall plan.<br /> <br /> On September 15, 1857, William Howard Taft was born.  He and his siblings were raised in the home as the family played host to many social and political friends and events in the large house.  William would wind up leaving the family home when he entered Yale University in 1874.  The home would still house the Taft family for several more years, until 1889 when Alphonso and his wife moved to San Diego due to his declining health.<br /> <br /> The Taft family attempted to sell the home several times after Alphonso's death in 1891 but it wasn't until 1899 that his widow did sell the house.  Years would go by with the home changing hands a few times until the National Park Service became involved in plans to set aside the house and property as a National Historic Site in the 1960's.  Together, with William Howard Taft's son, Charles Taft, the home would finally be set aside and protected on December 2nd, 1969 when President Richard Nixon signed the legislation authorizing William Howard Taft National Historic Site.<br /> <br /> Read the story of how the Taft family home became a National Historic Site in the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/wiho/adhi/adhit.htm\">Administrative History book</a>.</p>",

It was placed here in 1966. Today it sits about five feet higher than it did then. Also, if you look across the cove, you’ll notice a point which juts out into the bay. From this angle, it’s evident that the trees are shorter closer to the shoreline. That’s because they’re younger, growing on land that only recently emerged from the sea.</p>",

Turn right and proceed along the brick walkway about one hundred twenty feet. Lock 3 will be on your left.<br />Lock 3 has been restored and the twenty-five-foot wood beams, gates, components, and stone blocks that line the canal walls all appear new. Two sets of wood lock gates sit about ninety feet apart from each other in the canal. Water cascades down about four feet from the upstream western gate and passes through the downstream eastern gate and under the 30th street bridge.<br />The south side brick plaza of Lock 3 features a two-foot high wood bench that spans about sixty feet along the walkway. Five six-foot tall young trees are set in the plaza along the canal on this side.<br />The north side is situated with four wood benches set about ten feet back from the canal's edge. In front of them is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads: \"Lock 3.\" Behind the benches is a small patch of grass, about twenty by ten feet. A water fountain is at the east end of the lawn. Set at the western end is a bronze bust statue. <br />The bust is about three feet tall and depicts Justice William O. Douglas in open collared dress shirt. It rests on a four-foot-tall, two square foot granite pedestal. Etched on the pedestal front face is written:<br />In Recognition of Justice William O. Douglas for his Contributions Toward the Establishment of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park<br />National Park Service <br />May 17, 1977<br />At the north east corner of 30th street and the canal walkway sits a one square foot bronze plaque with cement base atop a brick platform. An inscription on the plaque reads:<br />Georgetown Historic District<br />Has Been Designated a Registered National Historic Landmark<br />Under the Provisions of the Historic Sites Act of August 21, 1935 This Site Possesses Exceptional Value in Commemorating and Illustrating the History of the United States<br />U.S. Department of the Interior<br />National Park Service<br />1967<br />Towards the west end of the lock, the canal widens about four feet on either side. The walkway rises slightly at an incline towards the west end and a bridge carrying over Thomas Jefferson street, where another wood gate sits underneath the bridge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Turn right onto the brick walkway and proceed eighty feet. Set in the ground about ten feet off the walkway on the left, to the south, is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads in white lettering: \"Lock 2\"<br />A brick office building is on the north side of the walkway at this location. To the south, a strip of grass runs about one hundred feet west and fifteen feet south to a one-foot stone border that lines the canal edge. As you face the canal to the south a forty-foot oak tree is ten feet to the left, along canal's edge. Another twenty feet to the left a 29th street bridge goes over the canal.<br />Still facing the canal, about forty feet to the right are two twenty-foot long wood lock beams set above both sides of the canal, connected to wood frames that line the canal walls. The beams are angled upward from west to east above the canal edge. Water in the canal drops from this point about five feet down as it flows from right to left.<br />Further to the right, about twenty wood beams, six feet long each, lay across the canal floor in tall grass, about two feet apart. This is the dry dock. The walkway and canal rise to the west, as they approach a bridge over the canal on 30th street. The canal widens about four feet from east to west after the lock. The walls of the canal arch inward again and narrow about four feet at the bridge underpass to the west under 30th street.<br /> END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

            "bodyText": "<p>This repair shop was built in 1935 by Conrad Warren and was used for maintaining and repairing ranch equipment, machinery, and vehicles. The shop was instrumental in the economic stability of the ranch throughout the nation’s economic depression and during wartime when it became vital to a rancher’s finances to be able to maintain and repair their own equipment.</p> <p>The building was originally divided into two spaces. The north end contained a garage area with three large overhead doors and housed automotive equipment. The south end was a multipurpose ranch repair shop and included a forge, blacksmith tools, line shaft, grindstones, acetylene welding setup, wood working equipment, and some accommodations for shoeing and branding livestock.</p> <p>There were no professionally trained blacksmiths or carpenters working inside the shop. The work was done by cowboys and ranch hands who were not formally trained, but possessed skills in managing livestock, shoeing horses, repairing machinery, and working with wood and metal. Through hard work and repetitive practice, they were able to create or repair almost anything that the ranch needed.</p> <p>Some of the work done in the repair shop included:</p> <p>· Sharpening sickle bar blades and other tools</p> <p>· Drilling</p> <p>· Rough Carpentry</p> <p>· Acetylene and forge welding</p> <p>· Blacksmithing</p> <p>· Shoeing</p> <p>· Branding</p> <p>· Oiling and greasing machinery</p> <p>Although the blacksmithing history associated with Grant-Kohrs Ranch began in the early 1860s there were no professional blacksmiths working on site. Most Montana ranches were located several miles away from populated areas, but this ranch has been located adjacent to the town of Deer Lodge ever since the mid 1860’s. Historically there would have been numerous blacksmith shops located in Deer Lodge where horses could be shod, iron work could be ordered, and machinery could be repaired. Johnny Grant stated in his memoir that he once owned a blacksmith shop, but it was likely located in somewhere in town and the finical records of Conrad Kohrs note several payments to local blacksmiths for shoeing and iron work.</p> <p>This repair shop also reflects a change in the agricultural and business operations of the ranch in the early 20th Century. The Open Range Era largely depended on animal and human labor to make a profit, but as ranching evolved it quickly relied on the effectiveness and use of modern mechanized machines and equipment. Conrad Kohrs once observed that “the changes of the past have been many; and those of the future may be of even more revolutionary character.\" His prediction came true as the shop became vital to the economic stability of the ranch as agricultural and business operations changed across the west.</p>",

While Patriot leaders worked to ease tensions with Great Britain, they also made enemies within their own colony. Loyalists were those colonists who remained loyal to Great Britain. Many of these were new immigrants from the Highlands of Scotland.<br /> <br /> This trail is only one mile along a paved walkway and boardwalk. The landscapes you will see may appear like many others – a winding country road, a narrow bridge across a creek, a swampy tidal wetland. But something here is different. Christened by combat, commemorated by proud descendants, this place is now a national treasure. Follow this path and you will discover why. <p> </p>",

Your group will join them later this morning when it’s safer to move the elderly, but for now you are warm in your tipi.<br /> <br /> But what’s that?! A shot?<br /> <br /> You hear a horn. The soldier’s horn!<br /> <br /> You spring up. You are barefooted and barely dressed. You look from your lodge and see white army soldiers riding - charging - toward the village. They are yelling and shooting at your friends and family that are emerging, confused and scared, from their tipis.<br /> <br /> You run, still barefooted, to the river. The water is icy and deep. You stumble as the bullets fly past. Go faster, down the river...Someone next to you falls. Gunshots everywhere.<br /> <br /> All is chaos.<br /> <br /> If only we had left yesterday....</p>",

The skyline of Manhattan lies ahead. Ellis Island is at eleven o'clock. The Brooklyn Bridge is at one o'clock. The water's edge is bordered by a ten-foot-wide red brick path with a three-foot tall black metal guard rail. The guard rail is just over three-feet high, with black posts spaced every four feet and rectangles of black metal mesh on the bottom two-thirds. There are four coin-operated viewfinders nearby and an informational wayside sign entitled \"Manhattan Skyline\".<br /><br />The two-feet by four-feet wayside sign sits on a triangular shaped black granite pedestal angled at forty-five degrees front to back. The pedestal is elevated on a twenty foot-long black granite rectangular base that is about two feet high. The background of the sign is a photograph of the Manhattan skyline against blue sky. The text reads: \"In 1886, the Statue of Liberty standing on her pedestal stood taller than any other structure in New York City. At 305 feet one inch, 92.9 meters, it exceeded even the Brooklyn Bridge, which had been completed three years earlier. However, the statue was soon surpassed in height by the forest of tall buildings which gave Manhattan its world famous skyline.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />The following structures are labeled: Empire State Building, 1 World Trade Center, Bank of Manhattan, U.S. Customs House, Citibank Farmer's Trust Company, Brooklyn Bridge\"<br /><br />Three are three rectangular photographs across the bottom of the sign, inserted over the waters of the harbor. They show the changing skyline through the decades.<br /><br />The first photograph is black and white. It is captioned: \"Lower Manhattan Skyline, 1908\". Two buildings are identified in the photograph: Singer Building 1908-1970 and U.S. Customs House 1907.\"<br /><br />To the right of 1908 photograph, there is a black and white photograph captioned: \"Lower Manhattan Skyline, 1934\". Three buildings are identified: Woolworth Building, 1913, Bank of Manhattan, 1929, Citibank Farmer's Trust, 1931.\"<br /><br />In the lower right hand corner, there is a color photograph captioned: \"Lower Manhattan Skyline 1997.\" Two buildings are identified: The Empire State Building, 1931, World Trade Center, 1973 - September 11, 2001\"<br /><br />A fourth caption, describing the overall background photo reads: \"Background: View of Manhattan Skyline 2013.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />Be aware that two of the view finders are directly in front of the black granite rectangular base, just to the right and left of the sign. They sit on a three-inch high circular granite base. Two more viewfinders are on the other side of the granite base, close to the harbor barrier. A fifth viewfinder is twenty-five feet to the right, mounted on a metal pole that extends two foot into the walkway next to the harbor barricade.<br /><br />End of Message",

The hot springs and post office/store continued to be operated as a concession by Maggy and H. Baylor Smith. Maggy operated them alone from 1944, when her husband died, until 1952. She was known for her kindness and ability to get along with her neighbors south of the border, often assisting as mid-wife and rendering first aid. In 1974, Hot Springs was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

To the southwest there is a covered overlook and a parking lot for the park.",

The confluence of Tornillo Creek and the Rio Grande was especially inviting as important food sources are available in greater quantities than the area further from the river. The hot water emanating from the edge of the river was, and is, inviting to all who found this spot. Evidence of ancient people is found on the rocks in the form of pictographs and petroglyphs. While the meaning is lost to time, one can ponder their relevance, or simply enjoy the view. <br /> <br /> J.O Langford had heard of the springs, and since he was in ill health, decided to homestead here since hot springs were purported to heal all ills. He improved the water catchment and started to develop a commercial enterprise that attracted tourists and those seeking health benefits. Mr. Langford left for a few years during the Mexican Revolution, but returned to begin business once again. He constructed the motor court, found just down the trail, to provide overnight lodging to guests. The business attracted customers from the United States and Mexico. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Maggie Smith took over operations and continued doing business even after the creation of the park. The post office and resort closed in 1952.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The route off the trail to the pool is sometimes wet and slippery.",

Langford, his wife, Bessie, and their 18-month old daughter, Lovie, moved to land he had recently acquired around the hot springs. Their first home was an abandoned<strong> </strong>dug-out, over whose rock walls they stretched a tent. In November 1909 Langford completed a one-room adobe cabin, 12x14 feet and 9 feet high, on a bench of land 150 feet above the river and overlooking the hot springs. During their second year of occupation, Langford enlarged his house by building two more rooms of stone. Unfortunately, this structure has since entirely disintegrated. The only elements that can be seen today are the remains of the poured concrete floor of the stone addition.<br /> The picture shown was the two-room stone addition to the original adobe structure, which can barely be seen through the doorway. The date of the photo is unknown, but the fact that the structure is deteriorated suggests that it was photographed after 1942, when the land was sold for eventual donation to the national park.",

From this location, one has a view of the river and the surrounding terrain, both in the United States, and across the river into Mexico. The vegetation includes low desert cactus, ocotillo, creosotebush, and mesquite, as well as low trees, cane, and tamarisk that are associated with water. The only visible remains of the Langford house are the concrete floor that was poured when the addition was built.",

Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with a slot for dropping one of two registration payment receipts into an individual square. Low and to the right of the registration board are two brown boxes with lids holding campground registration envelopes. The 3-foot-tall metal cannister for depositing an envelope with payment stands on the right. On the face of the cannister, at the top, is a slot for slipping in the envelope. Above the boxes of envelopes is posted information regarding where to camp, quiet hours, food storage, campfires and wood, pet regulations, what fees are required, a ban on fireworks, and firearms and weapons. Fishing regulations are also posted stating the fishing season dates and license information. On the opposite side of the bulletin board are additional posts about river safety, campfire wood, phone locations, nearest services, a map of the area, and information about hiking trails. To the left of the bulletin board is a brown and white welcome sign with a list of registration instructions. Next to this sign, a directional sign with text and an upward pointing arrow that reads, Restrooms and Campground. To the right of the bulletin board is an all gender, single stall, accessible restroom building with a vault toilet on a concrete pad. Enter on the right front side beneath an open alcove.

There is a two-inch high metal lip across the front surface of the bridge. A sign at the end of the bridge on the left reads: Staircase Rapids with an upward pointing arrow, and Shady Lane with a left pointing arrow. Underneath, a second sign reads, No Pets. Along the flat gravel trail on the right is a brown covered box holding trail brochures. A sign on the lid reads: Welcome. We hope you enjoy exploring Olympic National Park. Donations for these trail brochures are accepted at park visitor centers. Thank you for your support. The sign ends with this quote by John Muir: In every walk with Nature one receives far more than he seeks. Further up trail on the right is a tall informational sign with a map of the trail system marked in white lines. Above the map is a trail profile illustrating the elevation gain for three trails. Below these images, text reads: Staircase Trailhead. The main up-valley trail follows the North Fork Skokomish River Valley, climbing through lowland, montane and subalpine forests. Side trails lead to mountain ridges, lakes and scenic vistas. The first mile of this trail shares one leg of the 1.9 mile Staircase Rapids Loop Trail. Text continues: Evolving Wilderness. On the way to Staircase you have passed logged-over land and man-made lake Cushman, dammed to harness hydroelectric power. The Olympic interior was unexplored until 1889. Lieutenant Joseph O’Neil, leader of an 1890 expedition, brought infantrymen and pack mules up this valley on his way to map and survey a swath across the peninsula. A few settlers and miners later tried to extract a living from the steep canyons and rugged peaks. Since 1938 the National Park Service has been charged with preserving the Olympic backcountry. To the left of the text is a drawing of Lieutenant O’Neil with mustache and beard, standing on a slope wearing a blue, short-brimmed square hat and a blue uniform jacket with several medals pinned on his chest. He holds a pair of binoculars. To the left of the Lieutenant in the distance, are the three human figures traversing the snowy slope. In the far distance are pine trees and a snowy mountain ridge under a blue sky.",

On the far right is a hitching post. Text on each notice, reads: Wilderness Regulations. Wilderness Camping Permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry. Food, garbage and scented items must be stored away from wildlife at all times. Campfires are prohibited above 3500 feet elevation. Pets are not allowed on trails, beaches, and in the wilderness. Weapons, bicycles and vehicles are prohibited in the backcountry Backcountry Safety. Plan your trip and know you limits. Tell someone where you are going and when you will return. Be aware of the weather. Carry the 10 essentials which are food, water, extra clothes including rain gear, knife, flashlight, and batteries, first aid kit, map, compass, fire starter and matches, sunscreen and sunglasses. Stock Use in the Quinault Area. Ride only on trails designated for stock use. Wilderness Camping Permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry. Food, garbage, and scented items must be stored away from wildlife at all times. Tying stock to a single tree for more than one hour is prohibited. For long stays, hitch racks and lines must be at least 200 feet from water. Feed must not contain viable seeds. Grazing is permitted with one-quarter mile of stock camps. Wildlife, Food and Your Safety. Many animals, including bears, rodents, birds, deer, elk and racoons can become habituated to humans. Often that are attracted by food. This leads to unnatural tameness, unpredictable aggression, and other safety and health concerns. These changes in behavior may result in area closures or the death of the animal. Keep your distance. Stay at least 50 yards away from animals. Do not touch or disturb. All foot (human and pet), drinks, cooking tools and supplies, and anything else with a strong odor must be secured from wildlife. Put garbage in dumpsters or pack it out. Do not put garbage in fire pits. Backcountry food storage includes using bear cannisters which are available for loan from ranger stations or hanging food at least 12 feet high and 10 feet out from the nearest tree trunk.",

Bernon's house was near this spot.The grove was initially established by Bernon descendants and parishioners of St. John's Cathedral who considered it an extension of the newly-created green space of Roger Williams Spring Park (todays Hahn Memorial).

            "bodyText": "<h3>How to get there</h3> From the Visitor Center, head south on Highway 85 for approximately 5 miles. Look for a turn off on the left hand side of the road with a sign indicating the “Camino de Dos Republicas.” Continue on the Camino de Dos Republicas for 2 miles until you reach the small dirt parking area by Gachado Line Camp. Do not drive beyond Gachado Line Camp onto the border road and please do not approach or touch the border fence. This area is closed to the public. <h3>What’s a line camp?</h3> A line camp is a place on the outskirts of a larger ranch for workers to stay. Line camps may also be located closer to the ranching operations so workers can keep a closer eye on their livestock. In this case, this line camp served Dos Lomitas Ranch run by the Gray family a couple miles to the east. Henry and Abe Gray, the two eldest Gray sons, built this line camp in 1921 and lived here for several years.<br /> <br /> Robert Lee (Bob) Gray bought the Blankenship ranch (now known as Dos Lomitas), wells, water rights, and cattle from Lonald Blankenship in 1919. Bob Gray and his sons built numerous structures and water facilities until their control extended over much of the Organ Pipe area. <h3>Ranching in desert extremes</h3> How were the Grays able to run cattle in a desert with so little grass? With the meager forage and water available, the Grays had to range their cattle over a very large area (over 350 square miles) to sustain their herd of cattle.<br /> <br /> With livestock scattered over such a large area, rounding up all these cattle would have been incredibly time consuming. However, the Grays pioneered a system where they operated a series of wells and water sources surrounded by mesquite corrals. In the dry seasons, cattle had to enter the corrals daily to drink. The gates were specifically constructed so that when they were closed, the livestock could enter the gate with a gentle push but could not exit. After the cattle were trapped in the corrals, they could be easily loaded onto a truck and sent to market.<br /> <br /> This extensive grazing did not come without consequences for the desert. The cattle decimated the sparse vegetation and trampled vast areas, creating erosion and leaving the landscape overgrazed and barren. Even though cattle were removed from the monument in 1978, desert environments take a long time to recover. The damage is still visible in many areas, including those surrounding Gachado Line Camp. <h3>What does “Gachado” mean?</h3> “Gachado” means old twisted mesquite. While the original namesake mesquite is no longer present, the current large tree next to Gachado line camp is actually a nonnative tamarisk tree. Although tamarisks have a reputation of being highly invasive in other parts of the country, this subspecies is sterile and is the only tamarisk tree in the monument. Notice mounds of fine, dark sand underneath the tree. This site used to be an active Mexican Leafcutter Ant colony, and though this colony has long collapsed, several active colonies persist throughout the monument.   <h3>Gachado Line Camp and Restoration</h3> This adobe house exemplifies the resourcefulness of ranchers in the southwest. The building was originally made using mostly native materials. The Grays used ocotillo stems and organ pipe ribs to thatch the structure’s roof. Thick adobe walls were made from mud, grass and reeds found locally, and insulated the structure from the sweltering desert temperatures.<br /> <br /> This is an active restoration site. The foundation is original while the rest is under restoration. While adobe is effective insulation made from readily available materials, it also requires constant maintenance. For the Gray family, adobe upkeep was part of their regular chores. Since monument staff lack the resources to constantly maintain historic adobe, the restored bricks are made using a combination of mud, other natural materials, and Portland cement to hold the bricks together longer.    <br /> <br /> Learn more about the National Park Service’s work to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/photosmultimedia/videos.htm\">restore Gachado Line Camp</a> amidst the challenges of climate change. <h3>The Gray Family and the National Park Service</h3> When the monument was established in 1937, the Grays had been on the land for 17 years and were understandably threatened by its establishment, especially because lacked an official deed to the land.  <br /> <br /> With the support of Senator Carl Hayden, in 1939, the Grays were able to obtain a lifetime permit to graze. The permit allowed them to have 550 cattle on monument lands. When the Park Service surveyed the cattle a couple years later, they found that the Grays had 1,600 cattle on park lands.<br /> <br /> The ecological damage of long-term overgrazing created tenuous relations between the National Park Service and the Grays, and eventually the Department of Interior terminated the Gray’s grazing permit in 1968. Yet the Gray sons continued to run cattle on monument lands without a permit until the death of their last member in 1976.<br /> <br /> When the last of the Gray brothers passed, it marked the end of cattle ranching in the monument. When the cattle were rounded up and removed in 1978, there were 1,700 cattle removed, which greatly exceeded the terms of the grazing permit.",
            "audioDescription": "As one approaches Gachado Line Camp, there are dilapidated wooden fence posts, troughs, and the surrounding area is relatively flat and lacks vegetation. A giant tamarisk tree grows next to the line camp. The actual building is a one-room, rectangular, tan colored, adobe building with several small, square windows and one door. Only sections of the building are covered with an outer layer of adobe, the rest of the building shows exposed brick. Large tree beams stick out of the front of the building. Inside the building are dirt floors and construction equipment from the ongoing restoration. To the south of Gachado is the international border and border fence.",

Lynsea Montanari & Robin Spears III, both Narragansett, served as summer arts interns at the memorial for this project. They incorporated their own cultural knowledge with teachings by tribal elders regarding first contact with European settlers, genocide, displacement, assimilative practices, enslavement, continuation of language, ceremony, and other cultural practices. The artists chose to create a cairn as it is a part of the history of all indigenous peoples. There are many historic cairns in the Narragansett landscape.",

The text reads, \"An Ounce of Prevention: The dramatic waterfalls and scenic cascades of Cedar Run and Whiteoak Falls make this canyon popular with hikers. But these canyon trails are some of the toughest in the Park. They're very steep, and there are big rocks and roots to climb over. Consider these safety tips: Wear sturdy shoes Take plenty of water for yourself and your companions, including your pet! Review the map and make sure you have enough time to complete your hike before dark. Be honest with yourself and your group about your physical capabilities. After all, you want to return with only good memories.\" \"Leave No Trace: More than a million people visit Shenandoah each year, many of them hikers. That's a good thing, but it's still a lot of feet tramping through the Park!\" \"Leave No Trace is a set of outdoor ethics that guides lovers of the outdoors toward treading lightly and lessening their impact on the earth. If all visitors practiced Leave No Trace principles, it would help Shenandoah stay clean, beautiful, and wild. In addition to heeding the safety tips above, remember: leave what you find; pack out what you pack in; stay on the trails; maintain a safe distance from , and do not feed , wildlife; and be considerate of others.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Cedar Run Trail and Whiteoak Canyon Trail. The trail is marked in yellow. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: Cedar Run Falls and Whiteoak Falls - 7.3-mile circuit, very strenuous, 6.25 hours hiking time, 2,794-foot elevation gain, several stream crossings. Descend on Cedar Run Trail. Cedar Run Falls follows the trail on the left. Cross the creek, and turn left on Whiteoak Canyon Trail. You'll see the Lower Whiteoak Falls and Upper Whiteoak Falls on your left as you ascend on the trail. After leaving the last of the waterfalls - Upper Whiteoak Falls - cross the creek and follow Whiteoak Canyon Road. Turn left onto the Skyland-Big Meadows Horse Trail, which will take you back to the starting point at Hawksbill Gap.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. It's dangerous and potentially deadly to climb on the rocks near waterfalls. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking.\"",

            "bodyText": "<h4><em><b>Imagine your environment changed, and you needed to leave your home. Where would you go? What would you need to build a new life?</b></em></h4> <hr /> <p>Weedpatch Camp, officially the Arvin Farm Labor Supply Center, was a federal relief camp for migrants who had fled the Dust Bowl of the 1930s to seek work in California. The documentary photographer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/manz/learn/photosmultimedia/dorothea-lange-gallery.htm\">Dorothea Lange</a> chronicled conditions in the camp. Visits inspired the novelists Sanora Babb and John Steinbeck.</p> <h4>The Dust Bowl & Migration</h4> <p>The Dust Bowl was an environmental disaster that devastated the Great Plains region of the United States in the 1930s. Poor farming practices and drought conditions caused the area’s topsoil to dry up and blow away in the form of gigantic dust storms that blanketed farms and towns. Crops failed. Banks foreclosed on small farms. The crisis, combined with the hardships of the Great Depression, forced millions of people to move out of the Great Plains states to survive. Often called “Okies” though they came from a range of states, they participated in one of the largest migrations in US history.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of Okies traveled west along <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelroute66/index.htm\">Route 66</a> to California’s Central Valley, where they had heard there was work picking crops. But they found themselves facing stiff competition for jobs and discrimination from many Californians who viewed them as undesirable and a threat to social stability. With few resources or choices, many migrants lived as squatters in camps along roads and stream banks. They had no running water and only tents, cars, or lean-tos for shelter. Tuberculosis spread through these camps, and child mortality was high.</p> <h4>Weedpatch Camp</h4> <p>Concerned about the squalid conditions in the squatters’ camps, the federal government intervened to assist the migrants. The Works Progress Administration (WPA), a New Deal agency, constructed Arvin Federal Camp, near the town of Weedpatch, California, in 1935. With running water for showers, bathrooms, and laundry rooms, and wood platforms designated for tents, the facility was a step up from squatters’ camps.<br /> <br /> Three original structures remain from the camp: the post office, the community hall, and the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2017770962/\">library</a>.[1] The post office doubled as a medical clinic and hospital. The community hall hosted religious services and social activities, like dances and community meetings. Adults looked for work in the nearby fields of Central Valley.<br /> <br /> Female staff and residents of Weedpatch Camp played a particularly important role in creating community there. Members of the “<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2017770925/resource/ \">Mothers’ Club</a>” organized themselves to take care of practical needs, like how to equally distribute resources like kerosene to all residents at the camp. They worked with staff to organize a <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/fsa.8b29870/ \">nursery</a> and a school for migrant children so that mothers could work for pay.</p> <h4>Legacy</h4> <p>Some Okies returned to the Great Plains as the crisis passed, but many remained in California. The state’s defense industry expanded rapidly during World War II, with job opportunities that pulled many migrants into the middle class. As the Okies’ economic fortunes improved, Californians’ discrimination against them began to ease. Nevertheless, their experience is memorialized in classic cultural works like John Steinbeck’s <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, which features the Joad family’s stay at Weedpatch Camp and is dedicated to the facility’s administrator, Tom Collins.[2] The Okies also left a permanent cultural imprint on California, particularly through country music and evangelical Christian religion.<br /> <br /> The area around the historic buildings at Weedpatch Camp remains in use as housing for migrant laborers.<br />  </p> <h4>Notes</h4> <p>[1] Weedpatch Camp was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 22, 1996.<br /> [2] Two of John Steinbeck’s residences are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The John Steinbeck House in Monte Sereno, California, where he wrote <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> and <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, was listed on December 29, 1989. The John Steinbeck House in Salinas, California, the author’s boyhood home, was listed on August 8, 2000.</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Babb, Sonora. <em>Whose Names Are Unknown</em>.

Improvements were quickly made, including expanding the existing powder storage. The bombproof casements in the sallyport were expanded to hold powder, but an officer was worried about having large amounts of powder stored in a frequently used area where smoking was common. Thus, a Powder Magazine outside of the fort was contracted in 1863 and completed in 1864.

The gate features a vehicle gate that is wide enough for one vehicle to go through at a time. Vehicles entering and exiting the park should alternate to keep traffic moving. On either side of the main gate are two pedestrian gates to allow pedestrians and bicyclists to enter the park. All three gates open at 9 am and close 5 pm in the fall, winter, and spring, or 6 pm in the summer (Memorial Day to Labor Day).</p>",

It is an agricultural region where cotton was once king, and where ‘precision-ag’ rules today. It is a place that saw the struggles of the Civil War and the cultural revolution of the Civil Rights Movement. It is the home of the Great Migration, and a land of rich culinary, religious, artistic and literary heritage.</p> <p>The MDNHA is a partnership between the people of the Mississippi Delta and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">National Park Service</a>. It is one of 55 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/heritageareas/\">National Heritage Areas</a> in the United States designated by Congress that tell nationally important stories, celebrating our nation's diverse heritage through community-based partnerships and local collaboration.<br /> <br /> A recently launched web-based Mississippi Delta Civil Rights Heritage Archive is now available, and illustrates the various ways the MDNHA has expanded its community efforts to collaborate with both local and national organizations to “interpret, preserve and commemorate Civil Rights heritage in the region.” This digital archive follows the MDNHA theme of “Moving Toward Freedom: Changing America’s Character in the Struggle for Rights,” by acknowledging that “the Delta was home to pivotal events both horrible and inspirational, including Emmett Till’s murder, Freedom Summer and the Poor People’s Campaign. Leaders and activists such as Amzie Moore, Fannie Lou Hamer, the delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and the Freedom Riders are among those who paved the way for changes that are still unfolding today.”<br /> <br /> Other civil rights heritage development projects facilitated by the MDNHA includue: </p> <ul dir=\"ltr\"> <li>2016: A collaboration between the town of Mayersville, MDNHA, Visit Mississippi and Mississippi’s Lower Delta honored former Mayersville mayor Unita Blackwell with a Freedom Trail marker. She was the first Black woman to be elected mayor in Mississippi and served in this position for 27 years. During this time she was also active in the Civil Rights Movement, Head Start and Democratic Party.</li> <li>MDNHA’s grant program supported The Shaw Civil Rights Project and Delta Hands for Hope in their production of the “Wade Through the Waters” stage play. The play was performed during the 2019 Homecoming Weekend in Shaw where residents and visitors commemorated the 50th anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Hawkins v. Town of Shaw. The stage play focused on the challenges the Hawkins family faced in filing and litigating the lawsuit for equitable access to municipal services based on race.</li> <li>2019: MDNHA’s grant program supported the 1969 Delta State University Sit-In Project in the development of their documentary film showing the March 10, 1969 sit-in featuring 52 Black Delta State students. The project won the Mississippi Historical Society’s 2020 Excellence in History Award.</li> </ul> <p dir=\"ltr\"><br /> As a partnership between the people of the Mississippi Delta and the National Park Service, the Mississippi Delta Civil Rights Heritage Area is listed as “one of 55 National Heritage Areas in the United States designated by Congress that tell nationally important stories, celebrating our nation's diverse heritage through community-based partnerships and local collaboration.” The stories that have been preserved and shared in their archival spaces are incredibly important to the history of Black Americans locally and nationally.<br /> This Heritage Area includes the following sites:<br />  </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/vick/\">Vicksburg National Military Park</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://civilrightstrail.com/attraction/bryants-grocery/\">Bryant’s Grocery Store</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://msdeltatop40.com/friars-point\">Town of Friars Point Historic District</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://msdeltatop40.com/como\">Historic Downtown Como</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://birthplaceofthefrog.org/index.html\">Jim Henson Museum </a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dockeryfarms.org/\">Dockery Farms</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/mississippi/about-forest/districts/?cid=stelprdb5209587\">Delta National Forest</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.deltabluesmuseum.org/\">Delta Blues Museum</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://deltacenterdsu.com/\">Delta Center for Culture and Learning</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.highway61blues.com/highway_61_blues_museum.htm\">Highway 61 Blues Museum</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.grammymuseumms.org/\">GRAMMY Museum Mississippi</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://bbkingmuseum.org/\">B.B.

Philip Randolph, who had been contemplating a march since the 1940s and who served as its director. However, the organizational genius behind it was Bayard Rustin, a gay pacifist, civil rights activist, and a genius planner of non-violent protests who worked out of the Harlem rowhouse for months on nearly every one of the complicated details that made the march a success. </p>",

All this in just 0.41 miles. This trail is not accessible.</p> <h3><b>The Wildflowers</b></h3> <p>Castle Crest Wildflower Trail hosts over 200 species of wildflowers, and is surrounded by trees, shrubs, grasses, and moss.

Shooting stars (Dodecathean alpinum) unfurl from slender stems and American bistorts (Polygonum bistortoides) flash white florets. Different species bloom as summer brings the warmth of drier, hotter days. Two of the most prolific wildflowers are Lewis' monkeyflower (Mimmulus lewsii) and paintbrush (Castillejaspp). Other favorites are the bog orchids such as (Platanthera dilatata var. leucostachys), blue stickweed (Hackelia micrantha), Columbia monkshood (Aconitum columbianum) Pacific bleeding heart (Dicentra formosa), and a variety of asters.

            "audioDescription": "The official parking area and trailhead is located 0.25 mile east of Park Headquarters on East Rim Drive. Walking counterclockwise, the trail begins by crossing a bridge over a stream and winds under a canopy of conifer trees. It soon shifts from a shady dirt path to uneven steppingstones. Early season, the stones may be covered in water flowing down from springs along a 2000-foot towering ridge. Grasses give way to mosses and flowering shrubs, and ultimately both sides of the trail become colorful eruptions of wildflowers. The trail takes a few gentle turns with upward stone steps that guide the visitor through knee and waist high plants which bloom in a succession from late spring to early fall. While lingering snow melts, tiny yellow violets, yellow buttercups, and pinkish spreading phlox (Phlox diffusa) bloom just above the soil. Purple shooting stars (Dodecathean alpinum) unfurl from slender stems and American bistorts (Polygonum bistortoides) flash white florets. Different species bloom as summer brings the warmth of drier, hotter days. Two of the most prolific wildflowers are the boldly pink Lewis' monkeyflower (Mimmulus lewsii) and the pink to orange paintbrush (Castillejaspp). Other favorites are the white bog orchids such as (Platanthera dilatata var. leucostachys), blue stickweed (Hackelia micrantha), deep purple Columbia monkshood (Aconitum columbianum) pink Pacific bleeding heart (Dicentra formosa), and a variety of aster species that are mostly yellow and pastel purple. Even when the seed heads and dried flowers remain, pollinators and their predators are seen and heard throughout the meadow and along the trail. Leaving the meadow area along its western edge, the trail passes a pumice hillside where white-pollen-skyrocket (Ipomopsis aggregata ssp. formosissima) a gorgeous, tubular, orange flower grows. As the meadow is now behind you, and you cross streams via two bridges, once again a forest canopy of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta),) creates an evergreen backdrop for the meadow and the trail as you follow it back to your car.",

He stated that “the spring, where in 1636 Roger Williams landed, was and is one of the truly hallowed spots on this continent.” Judge Hahn donated the park in an act of “gratitude to the people of Rhode Island who honored him as well as his father with offices of public trust” as well as an “homage to the spirit of Roger Williams who first in this hemisphere transformed liberty from a private luxury into a commodity available to all.”",

Owned and operated by the Salish, Kootenai and Pend d’Oreille tribes, the new Three Chiefs Culture Center is temporarily housed in a log building built several years ago for Colonel Doug Allard as his first restaurant. It will continue to be more than a museum; it is a vital, living encounter with Native American culture.</p> <p>Three Chiefs Culture Center is a place to experience the rich cultures of the Salish, Kootenai and Pend d’Oreille tribes. The traditions of these people have been passed down orally from generation to generation. As their lifestyles change with time and technology, they continue to preserve and protect their heritage, history and culture. Explore the artifacts and exhibits, hear the stories of their people, and participate in cultural activities, traditional arts and crafts, cultural education, Native games and other events. Visit the Center’s Gift Shop which has a beautiful collection of Native arts and Native made crafts.</p> <p>From 2003 to 2006, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes were very active in the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial commemoration which shared the tribal perspective of the Expedition. They worked together with the Circle of Tribal Advisors in telling the Native American story. Compiled by the Salish-Pend d’Oreille Culture Committee and the Elders Cultural Advisory Council, the University of Nebraska Press published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salish-People-Lewis-Clark-Expedition/dp/0803216432\"><em>The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition</em></a>. The tribes also created a tribal history pageant, and tribal artisans made thousands of handmade, traditionally tanned leather pouches for the US Mint commemorative Lewis & Clark coin and pouch set.</p> <p>The Three Chiefs Culture Center illustrates how the Salish, Kootenai and Pend d’Oreille lived before and after the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Today, the Tribes still thrive in their homeland and the Center honors this rich cultural heritage.</p> <p>“Our elders knew the curves of the hillsides and the lines of the trails as intimately as they knew the curves and lines of their mother’s faces. Today, our grandparents lament that children born on the reservation are like buffalo born behind a fence. Along with our many rights and privileges we bear responsibilities for teaching our children about their birthright.”<br /> — Germaine White (Salish)</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Located near Antietam National Battlefield in western Maryland, Tolson’s Chapel is a log-and-frame church built by an African American congregation in 1866. The congregation later established a cemetery on the property, and the church served as a school during Reconstruction. This small church in the town of Sharpsburg powerfully illustrates the importance of churches, schools, and cemeteries to African Americans in the Southern and border states during the transition from a slave society to a free society after the Civil War.<br /> <br /> John R. Tolson, a Black Methodist preacher, organized the African American congregation in Sharpsburg in 1865, one year after slavery ended in Maryland. The congregation joined the Washington Conference, an annual conference in the Methodist Episcopal Church (not to be confused with the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church). Organized in 1864, the Washington Conference was composed entirely of African American churches. As part of the Washington Conference, members of the African American congregation in Sharpsburg could hold leadership positions within the conference, worship independently from whites, and serve as preachers. Prior to 1864, most Black members of the Methodist Episcopal Church could do none of these things.<br /> <br /> The Sharpsburg congregation completed the church building in 1866. By 1875, it was known as “Tolson’s Chapel,” in honor of its founding preacher, who died in 1870. The congregation that gathered in Tolson’s Chapel included men, women, and children who had been enslaved, as well as people who were free before the Civil War. In Sharpsburg and other communities in the former slave-holding states, African Americans who had been free before the war provided crucial support for churches. For instance, African American landowners often provided the land on which to build the church. This was the case in Sharpsburg, where Samuel and Kate/Cassey Craig donated the land for Tolson’s Chapel.<br /> <br /> For African Americans who endured and resisted whites’ attempts to control their religious lives during slavery, churches such as Tolson’s Chapel embodied freedom and independence.<font color=\"#337ab7\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.25px;\"><b> </b></span></font>Preachers and lay leaders were often leaders in the community as well. Though excluded from positions of formal leadership, women in the churches organized fundraisers and other events. Because African Americans owned and controlled their churches, they also used the buildings for activities that whites opposed, such as schools and political meetings.<br /> <br /> For one term in 1868 and another term in 1869, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-americans-and-education-during-reconstruction-the-tolson-s-chapel-schools.htm\">the church hosted a school</a> taught by Northern teachers sent by the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau\">Freedmen's Bureau</a> Local African Americans and Northern benevolent societies supported the teachers. Starting in the early 1870s, Tolson’s Chapel was the home of the public school for African Americans in Sharpsburg. The public school remained in Tolson’s Chapel until 1899, when it moved to a new schoolhouse down the street.<br /> <br /> Like many rural African American churches during Reconstruction, Tolson’s Chapel established a cemetery. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, municipal cemeteries often segregated burials by race or excluded African American burials altogether. Even as some African Americans challenged these policies, they also created their own cemeteries where they – not whites – could control their final resting place. The Tolson’s Chapel congregation purchased the land surrounding the church for $75 in 1883. However, they may have started using this land as a cemetery several years before that. The cemetery contains the graves of Union Army veteran Wilson Middleton, people who witnessed the Battle of Antietam (September 17, 1862), and many who were instrumental in founding and sustaining both the church and the schools in Tolson’s Chapel.<br /> <br /> The Tolson’s Chapel congregation remained active through the early 1900s. Starting in the 1950s, the number of members declined as African Americans moved out of Sharpsburg. The church was deconsecrated in 1998, two years after the death of Virginia Cook, the last surviving member. Preservation efforts began in 2000. The non-profit Friends of Tolson’s Chapel currently owns the building, which is open to the public. Tolson’s Chapel was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 and designated a National Historic Landmark in January of 2021.

In his early years at Frederica he slept in a tent, even as he urged others to build fine houses. He finally built a home just outside the town—a modest estate known simply as “The Farm.”<br /> <br /> Today Oglethorpe’s fort still proudly flies the British King's Colors (1603-1801). For six years, Oglethorpe improved his defenses, convinced that the battle for the debatable lands would be decided here. There were higher, more comfortable sites for a fortress, but few better suited to a tactical defense.<br /> <br /> Fort Frederica did not face the ocean, where an entire Spanish fleet could surround it. A lookout post, Fort St. Simons, at the south end of the island watched for approaching vessels. Before hostile forces reached Frederica, they would have to sail past the guns of Fort St. Simons, then continue up the river on the inland side of the island. Fort Frederica stood at a sharp bend in the river, her guns facing south and west, though Oglethorpe knew Spanish strategy would bring an assault from the south.<br /> <br /> On the wayside a drawing of the fortification, circa 1742, shows that the island once extended farther into the river. Storms and erosion have washed away the shoreline where the spur was built.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "1037 wordsBare white sand covers the distance between the parking area and the beach. Some posts and ropes define a wide path to the beach. Some tufts of sea grasses dot the edge of the parking area and some dunes in the distance. Three interpretive panels stand in wood frames at the edge of the parking lot.Interpretive panel: Santa Rosa Area.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall. Across the top is a photograph of low white sand dunes with tufts of dune grass. The bottom of the panel has a map of the section of Santa Rosa Island that includes the park. Symbols mark the locations of parking and of the facilities at Opal Beach near the middle of the park's section. Text at upper left reads, \"This section of Gulf Islands National Seashore encompasses a day-use area of Santa Rosa Island. Here you may enjoy wildlife and other natural features of this coastal peninsula. Hike on the Florida National Scenic Trail or bike on the multi-use trail. Swim, fish, and do some beachcombing. Facilities at Opal Beach are basic: picnic shelter, restrooms, and outdoor showers. Avoid walking on the fragile sand dunes and remain outside of nesting area closures.\"Interpretive panel: Share the Shore.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall. Across the top of the panel is a photograph of the shoreline of a beach, sand on the right and water on the left. Several people of all ages sit and stand near a low rocky point of land farther up the beach. Across the bottom of the panel is a photograph of a green sea turtle with its large shell moving across the sand towards the water in the background.Text at the top of the panel reads, \"While you are here, keep in mind that you are sharing the shore with birds, turtles, and small mammals. Some of them are threatened or endangered species. Do not disturb the animals or their nests, burrows, eggs, or young. Stay out of protected areas. Use boardwalks to protect fragile dunes and habitats. Wildlife can choke on or become entangled in litter, so please carry out what you carry in and remove any debris you find on the beach.\"Below the text is a row of three smaller photographs. At left, the first one shows a black skimmer, a seabird with black back and white belly standing at the water's edge. It has a long orange and black bill and orange legs. The middle picture shows a ghost crab perched on the sand, all white except for its button-like black eyes. The third picture shows a Perdido Key beach mouse, a tiny brown rodent with a white face sitting in a sandy depression underneath grasses.Below the photographs more text reads, \"A Wildlife Habitat. Least terns, snowy plovers, and black skimmers make nests in the sand. Stay out of protected areas. Kemp's Ridley, loggerhead, green, and leatherback sea turtles crawl ashore and lay eggs in the sand. About 60 days later the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the sea. Biologists and trained volunteers mark nests of endangered and/or threatened sea turtles to monitor and protect nests from predators. The Perdido Key beach mouse is nocturnal and feeds on seeds of sea oats and beach grass. This small mouse is threatened with extinction because of diminishing coastal habitat. The National Park Service provides boardwalks for beach access and to protect the dunes. Untrampled, plants thrive and stabilize the dunes.\"To the right of the text is a small photograph showing a sea turtle tangled in a net. The caption reads, \"Marine Debris Kills. Many animals including birds and turtles die when they become entangled in nets and fishing lines or ingest plastic trash.\"Orientation panel: Beach Safety.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall and has text in both English and Spanish. Text at the top reads, \"In just a few minutes a wonderful day at the beach can turn into a disaster. Stay alert for sudden storms and marine life that could sting or bite. Watch your children. In emergencies, dial 911.\"At the bottom is a photograph with labels showing the smooth water of a rip current as it flows away from shore between two sandbars covered by white frothy waves. On the far side arrows point sideways in both directions with a label reading \"Swim to the side.\" Text below the picture reads, \"Rip Currents Kill. Rip currents commonly form after storms. If you are caught in a rip current, stay calm. Do not try to swim against the current. Swim right or left to escape the flow.\"Down the left side of the panel are specific warnings, each with a small photograph as illustration. Text reads, \"Avoid overexposure to the sun, especially between 10 am and 2 pm. Use sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, and long sleeves to protect skin. Drink plenty of water to help prevent dehydration.\" (Picture of the sun.)\"Thunderstorms develop quickly. If swimming or fishing, get out of the water immediately and seek shelter.\" (Picture of lightning.)\"Jellyfish and sea nettles can inflict painful stings. To reduce pain apply vinegar and do not touch.\" (Picture of a jellyfish.)\"Sharks are p",

It proved to be one of the very largest of the cordon of forts which encircled the city.” - Alfred Seelye Roe, Union soldier and historian <h3>Image caption:</h3> The fort’s namesake is Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote, who died in 1863.

Attached to the panel, is a table 3 feet wide by 1 and a half feet deep, and 3 feet off the ground. This table supports a bronze model of the fort. The panel is at the edge of the parking lot. Ahead is a dirt path, that leads to the fort. The background is a red map of Washington, DC, and the surrounding area. At the top, is the text quoted in this entry's body text, in yellow and white. Under the text, is a black-and-white photograph of 9 Boy Scouts sitting or standing on a Rodman Gun, lying in the grass. Students and scouts used the site in the early 1900s. The National Park Service took over the fort in 1931, changing the fort’s mission from defense to recreation and conservation. At the right, is a large black-and-white portrait of a standing Union Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote. He is bearded and dressed in military uniform, with prominent epaulettes, or decorative fringe, on his shoulders. His left arm wraps around his sword hilt. He died in 1863. He is known for his heroic actions on the Mississippi River. Across the bottom of the panel, is a black-and-white photograph of the fort under construction in 1863-1864. In the center, is a large earthen mound with wooden footings. To either side of the mound, is a flattened path. On the outer sides of the path, are earthen walls and wooden structures. Most of the structures are finished with round, earthen roofs, but some are still being built. The surrounding area is devoid of trees, unlike today. Across the bottom, is a transparent yellow banner. Within the banner, on the right, is the quote by Alfred Seelye Roe in red text. The other side of the panel is filled with a blue, green, and off-white map. Virginia is at left, Maryland is at right, and the Potomac River is in between. Washington, DC is at the top. Several National Parks Service sites are located in this region along the river. On the map, they are shaded green and labeled by name. The map shows hiking trails, off-road bicycle trails, on-road bicycle routes, food services, marinas, boat ramps, and canoe or kayak launches. Across the bottom, is a color photograph of a farm. This is Oxon Hill Farm at Oxon Cove Park, which is 4 and a half miles, or 7 kilometers, north of Fort Foote. At left, are 2 brown cows lying on green grass. In the background, at right, is a red barn with a gray roof. A red hay loader sits in front of the barn. In top left corner of the photograph, is white text: Your Adventure Continues End of Text At the right end of the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. On the left side, in the middle, is a color photograph of Fort Washington Park. The fort is a gray stone and concrete building on a grassy hill. It was built on the east bank of the Potomac River.

            "audioDescription": "A large vinyl banner secured between two steel posts. This banner is two-sided and has different information and images on each side. If you are standing in front of the banner facing north, the banner is divided into six sections, dissected by a large dark green x. At the center of the x is a dark green rectangle with rounded corners. Inside the rectangle, in teal letters, the banner reads, you are here. Inside the top section of the x, the background is a light-green map. The National Park Service arrowhead logo is in the center of the map background. Moving clockwise from the logo, the next section is an image of a river at sunset. There is a small rainstorm in the background and the riverbanks are forested with evergreen trees. Below that, the next section is an image of one person in a canoe. The person is wearing a hat and backpack and is sitting below a small waterfall. The next section is the bottom of the x. It has a light green map as a background. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail logo is atop the background. It is a white, rounded triangle with two men at the center. One of the men is pointing. The outside of the triangle reads, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. The next image is of a National Park Service ranger showing an item to some children who are sitting in the grass. Behind her, a brown banner reads, National Park Week. The final image is of a person standing on a wooden pier overlooking a bright blue body of water. Behind the person a stand of trees and a rock face are visible. At the bottom of the banner is a dark green section with white words. The section reads, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Visitor Center and Headquarters. Nps.gov/LECL National Park Service Regional Office Department of the Interior Regions 3, 4, & 5. Nps.gov/MWRO. If you are standing in front of the banner, but facing south, the top of the banner is dark green and has teal words inside the dark green. The words read, “this trail is 4,900 miles long.” Under the dark green is a teal horizontal stripe and some lighter green beneath that. There are stylized mountains and a sun added to a picture of two people on bicycles. They are cycling on a dirt trail with prairie grass on either side. There are deciduous trees in the distance. Beneath the cyclists there are white words that read, “Omaha is a point along the 4,900 mile Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, a historic corridor that connects 16 states and over 65 tribes. Beneath the words are three horizontal blocks of color. The top is sage green, the next is teal, and the bottom is dark green. At the bottom of the sign are teal words that read, “Check out the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Visitor Center to learn more.” Just above the words are two red arrows pointing toward the National Park Service building. Next to the words and arrows is the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail logo. It is a white triangle with rounded sides with a smaller off-white triangle with rounded sides inside. Around the outside edge are words that read, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Inside the off-white triangle are brown silhouettes of two frontiersmen. One is pointing with an arm outstretched.",

For Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, their experiences with the Warm Springs Tribe was at times cordial and friendly, but other times distrustful and hostile. The Celilo Falls and The Dalles sites on the Columbia River were considered one of the most important fishing and trading centers of the northwest region. The importance of this area and the people who lived there were overlooked by the Expedition.</p> <p>Today, the Museum at Warm Springs provides visitors the opportunity to learn about this very same land, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, which now represents the Wasco, Warm Springs and Paiute Peoples. The Paiutes were moved to the reservation in the late 1870s following the Bannock wars. Entering the museum begins with a walk next to a live stream, then into a circular stone drum, and up to an exquisite door with handles shaped like a bustle. The exterior, designed to resemble a traditional encampment among beautiful cottonwood trees, is situated alongside Shitike Creek which empties into the majestic Deschutes River. The impressive museum entry is the first glimpse into a rich, unique culture.</p> <p>The 25,000 square-foot museum provides an impressive sight to the public as well as a safe conservatory for the traditional treasures of the Tribes. Its mission includes educating the public as well as preserving the history, culture, and traditions of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. “We wanted the museum to tell the story of our People,” explains Delbert Frank, Sr., President of the museum’s Board of Directors in 1993 and an influential member of the Tribal Council. “We wanted it to tell the truth. To educate both the public and our own children. To tell them who we are.”</p> <p>After entering the building, the stream continues as a gray polished slate floor. Visitors encounter huge columns of what was once tall native trees of the Reservation. This is the main lobby of The Museum, and the entrance to the Permanent Exhibit Hall.</p> <p>The Permanent Exhibit details the culture and history of The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. “Technically one of the best unified exhibition plans in any museum in America,” states James Nason, Curator of New World Ethnology, Burke Museum, University of Washington, commenting on the permanent exhibit gallery. The curatorial department has one of the largest and most complete Native American artifact collections in the country, including an exquisite collection of Plateau Native American artifacts.</p> <p>The museum also features a rotating exhibit gallery, library and archives, education room with cooking facilities, conference/board room, artifact collection space and office, and an administrative area. The gift shop offers a tremendous array of locally-made beadwork and arts, Pendleton products, huckleberry products, jewelry, books and traditional and contemporary Native American music. Performances, demonstrations and other public events are held at a small outside amphitheater.</p> <p>In addition to special exhibits, annual events at the museum include the Warm Springs Tribal Member Art Exhibits in October, and the Annual Warm Springs Tribal Youth Art Exhibit in January.</p>",

The Rodman Gun and its steel carriage stand on a round gray concrete platform, with circular tracks on top so the gun can rotate. A soldier stands at the left end of the gun. He is turning to his left and has his left hand near his ear. His right hand loosely holds the lanyard, which was used to ignite the friction primer and fire the gun. The ground around the gun is brown. To the right of the concrete platform, is a pile of black cannonballs, ready for the next shot. In front of the cannonballs, is a wooden box of gunpowder. Dark blue sky fills the top half of the panel. At the right end of the panel, is a bronze model of half of a cannonball. Below the model, is a rectangular bronze plate that displays Cannonball in English and Braille.

In 1861, the Union capital city was an easy target if Confederate ships sailed up the Potomac River. In just two years, a protective ring of over 60 forts sprouted around the city. Fort Foote, perched here on Rozier’s Bluff, was built with haste in eight months. The fort’s claim to fame was its high-tech coastal artillery—but its cutting-edge cannons were never tested in battle.<br /> <br /> “We are putting up an extensive water battery…which may be an object of interest to you: the excursion on the water is pleasant & the locality a beautiful one.”<br /> - John G.

            "audioDescription": "Slanted Wayside Panel: New Forts for a New War 543 words / Panel Description: 3.5 minutes In front of you, is a panel 3 feet wide by 2 feet tall, and 3 feet off the ground, on dark brown painted aluminum posts. In metric, that is about 1 meter wide by a half meter tall, and about 1 meter off the ground. The trail continues to your right and your left. To the right, is where the barracks used to stand. To the left, is the trail toward the fort. Behind you, on the other side of the trail, is a concrete horse trough, which is about 6 feet long by 1 foot wide and 2 feet tall. In metric, that is about 2 meters long by a quarter meter wide by a half meter tall. Ahead of you, is a dense forest. A color illustration fills the panel. The illustration shows a busy fort, the Potomac River with many ships, and Alexandria in the distance. On the left, is the six-sided earthen fort. The fort is longer than it is wide. To the right, is a grassy landscape with several buildings. The buildings are labeled with white text on green backgrounds. From left to right, are the hospital, horse trough, barracks, and officers’ quarters. Around the horse trough and barracks, horses pull covered wagons with supplies. A dirt road runs from the bottom left corner of the panel, up and to the right, and past the fort. It ends at a rectangular dock on the top right edge of the landscape. Across the middle of the panel, is the light blue Potomac River. The other side of the river is Virginia, which was Union occupied. On the top right, is the City of Alexandria, made up of red-roofed buildings. To the right of the dock, is black text on a blue background: Distances are exaggerated for interpretive purposes. End of Text Across the top of the panel, is dark text on a light background: New Forts for a New War. As the Civil War loomed, Union forces battened down the hatches of Washington, DC. In 1861, the Union capital city was an easy target if Confederate ships sailed up the Potomac River. In just two years, a protective ring of over 60 forts sprouted around the city. Fort Foote, perched here on Rozier’s Bluff, was built with haste in eight months. The fort’s claim to fame was its high-tech coastal artillery—but its cutting-edge cannons were never tested in battle. End of Text On the left, is a graphic that shows a yellow outline surrounding Washington, DC. Red text identifies Virginia to the bottom left and Maryland to the upper right. Blue stars represent over 60 Union forts. Fort Foote is located at the bottom of the map. There is dark text below and to the right: Fort Foote is the southernmost defensive site. The Union also built 93 gun batteries, 20 miles, or 32 kilometers, of rifle pits, and 32 miles, or 51 kilometers, of military roads around its capital. End of Text In the bottom right corner of the panel, is dark text on an orange and green background: “We are putting up an extensive water battery…which may be an object of interest to you: the excursion on the water is pleasant & the locality a beautiful one.” John G.

Once abandoned, many of Fort Foote’s structures began to crumble beyond repair. End of Text Below the text, is a color illustration that shows how the King’s Depression Carriage Mount works. A black Rodman Gun sits on a gray concrete foundation dug into the earth. The gun is about 15 feet long by 8 feet tall, or 5 meters long by 2 and a half meters tall. The reddish-brown dirt is cut away to show the underground supporting structure. The gun consists of a large horizontal carriage with a bottle-shaped cannon on top. The gun points to the left, toward the river. Below ground, are stacked gray counterweights to balance the gun for raising and lowering it. On the right, four soldiers stand at the base of the gun, ready to push it up and over the fort wall to fire. On the left, two soldiers stand on top of the fort wall. The fort wall is built of upright logs and topped with green grass. One soldier points towards the river. Over the color illustration, is a ghosted illustration of the Rodman Gun in firing position. To fire, the soldiers pivot the enormous gun on its mount to raise it over the fort wall. At the same time, the counterweights below drop into a deep pit. After firing, the gun’s recoil slides it back down the mount to its resting position. [End of message]",

The nomination of this building, individually, focuses on the commercial storefront spaces at the ground level, and the “back of house” spaces in the basement, where the venue Darcelle XV has been owned and operated by Walter Cole since 1967. As a nightclub and drag venue, the aesthetic of Darcelle XV Showplace reflects the improvised, low-budget, and self-reliant illusion of glamour that resulted from its development during the late 1960s and early 1970s when drag was celebrated mostly behind closed doors due to gay discrimination and the threat of harassment.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{53895e91-61b7-49dc-80e9-bd2385ce59f2}{19}\" paraid=\"2123660187\">Through fundraising, drag sponsorship and events, philanthropy, and nightly entertainment, the nightclub has a long history of standing up for LGBTQ rights. The club is deeply associated with its owner, Walter Cole/Darcelle, who, at 89 years old, holds the Guinness World Record as the World’s Oldest Performing Drag Queen. Darcelle XV Showplace falls under the National Park Service’s LGBTQ nomination themes of “peopling places” by supporting and demonstrating different concepts of gender as a venue that consistently featured gay and trans performers, developing the American economy as a long-running business, creating social institutions and movements as a nightclub accessible to and beloved by a community, expressing cultural values as the home of Darcelle and Roxy’s drag show and many other drag performance competitions.  </p>",

It looks out over the turquoise waters to the square platform at the end of the pier where people lean against the railings, many with fishing rods in their hands.Text at the left side of the panel reads, \"The national seashore's Fort Pickens Area offers an idyllic setting to reflect on the past and enjoy recreational activities. Tour the fort and learn about its role as a Union stronghold during the Civil War in the 1860s, then tour a series of fortifications that protected Pensacola Bay from the 1890s to the 1940s.

Text reads, \"Avoid overexposure to the sun, especially between 10 am and 2 pm. Use sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, and long sleeves to protect skin. Drink plenty of water to help prevent dehydration.\" (Picture of the sun.)\"Thunderstorms develop quickly. If swimming or fishing, get out of the water immediately and seek shelter.\" (Picture of lightning.)\"Jellyfish and sea nettles can inflict painful stings.

The pier may be reached through an opening in the four-foot wide concrete wall that extends around the end of the island from Fort Pickens to the west. From the entrance platform a ramp leads to the right down to the beach. To the left a boardwalk with a board railing parallels the beach for about 200 feet to reach the end of the pier. Here at the entrance platform is a panel titled \"Fishing Pier Rules.\"Along the boardwalk to the left are two more graphic panels titled \"Anglers. What should you do?\" and \"What Did I Catch?\" Along the left side of the boardwalk are a couple of places with benches. Sets of steps lead down to the beach near the graphic panels and also at the end of the pier itself. The pier is 20 feet wide. At the end is a 35-foot square platform. Seabirds, such as gulls and pelicans, are common around the pier. You may hear them calling or the splash of water as they dive for fish. Out in the water to the right of the pier is an open rectangular structure on pylons which is a common perch for many of the birds.End of Description.",

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion. On the sheer face of Half Dome, exfoliation causes rockfalls that occur every few years.<br /> <br /> Please follow the path to your left toward the Merced River to find the next stop. As you walk to the next stop, think back to the sign we saw at the beginning and recall that image of Yosemite Valley underwater. How does that image contrast with the Merced River that you see today?</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>On March 26, 1872 the famed naturalist and conservationist, John Muir, was sleeping in a cabin nearby when he was shaken awake by a strong earthquake. This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event. Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams with fresh granite. You'll notice that most of the boulders along the trail here are covered with lichen and moss. This tells us that these boulders have been sitting here undisturbed for a very long time. In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872. As you make your way to the final stop on this tour, look around at the vast field of boulders and imagine the chaos that took place here just a few thousand years ago.</p>",

Together these waterfalls plunge a total of 2,425 feet, or about 740 meters, making Yosemite Falls one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls. What caused the creek to shift position? We can't see it from here, but behind Yosemite Falls there is a moraine left behind by one of those ancient glaciers. The moraine diverted the Yosemite Creek from its path down the steep gully and forced it directly off the cliff. This unique geological accident created one of the tallest waterfalls in the world and one of the most iconic features in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop make some observations about the ground surface that surrounds the trail.</p>",

These boulders were once a part of the cliff face and broke loose in events called rockfalls in which boulders fall, bounce and roll down the cliffs and talus piles. The gigantic boulder in front of you now is from a rockfall that occurred about 3,000 years ago. This boulder is one of the largest you will see in Yosemite Valley but boulders like this are actually fairly common. All of them represent past rockfalls. Since glaciers retreated from Yosemite Valley, rockfalls became the dominant geological force eroding the cliffs and they still occur today. Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>On most days, the Merced River flows peacefully beneath Superintendents Bridge. However, on January 2, 1997 the Merced was a raging torrent. The 1997 flood is the most damaging in Yosemite's recorded history. In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar. The combination of heavy rain and melted snow across the entire watershed produces extreme flood events. It is under these conditions that the largest, most damaging floods in Yosemite's history have occurred. As global temperatures warm the snowline in Yosemite is likely to increase in elevation also increasing the likelihood of future floods.<br /> <br /> Our next stop is at a huge boulder behind the Chapel, across Southside Drive. To get there, please use one of the two crosswalks crossing Southside Drive and watch for cars. The trail picks up at the far end of the parking lot next to the Chapel.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A wooden bridge with wood posts and railings expands across the Merced River. Trees line the banks of the river, up and down stream. A wayside exhibit is affixed to the wooden railing and is titled Twentieth Century Floods. The exhibit panel has a background photo of Half Dome and surrounding rock formations reflected in a large body of water in an area that spills into a meadow. Panel text reads, in the 20th century, five dramatic winter floods inundated this area. This marker indicates how high the Merced River floodwaters rose during those years. A table shows three columns with headers that read, date, cubic feet/second at Happy Isles Gauging Station, and Height of water level above this bridge. Five rows of data are below each header. The first row reads, December 11, 1937 - 8,400 cubic feet/second - 2.7 feet. The second row reads, November 18, 1950 - 9,260 cubic feet/second - 3.9 feet. The third row reads December 23, 1955 - 9,860 cubic feet/second - 4.1 feet. The fourth row reads, December 23, 1964 - 9,240 cubic feet/second - 3.8 feet. And, the fifth row reads January 2, 1997 - 10,100 cubic feet/second - 5.3 feet. <br /><br />A bronze water marker is located on the bridge next to the wayside exhibit. It is over five feet tall and about one foot wide. Wavy strips of metal, only a few inches apart from each other, connect two thick poles on both ends of the strips, from bottom to top. Five dates are embedded within the poles. The bottom date is 1937 and is placed about three feet above the bridge. Then 1964, 1950, and 1955, are stacked on top of each other, about four feet above the bridge, and 1997 being the top date, is just over five feet above the bridge.",

Between them Dan McColl and Claude H. Stone, Sr., tended the Ship Island Lighthouse for 40 years. Their wives and children helped them fuel the lanterns, clean the glass lenses, and maintain the boats and buildings, but the children had plenty of time to play and explore the island. The first lighthouse, built in 1853, guided ships traveling between New Orleans and Mobile away from shallow waters in the Mississippi Sound and into the deep-water channel west of the island. Over a century, Confederates and a fire damaged or destroyed the original brick tower and its wooden successor.\"<br /><br />Below the text a quote from Recollections and Memories of a Lighthouse Family by Rev. Claude Howard Stone, Jr. reads, <br /><br />\"Were we going fishing, walking on the beach, swimming, boating or just playing in the cool shade of the porch? Boy! What a terrible decision we had to make as ... kids.\"<br /><br />On the right side are three smaller photographs of the light house at various times. The top picture shows a solid white round tower with a cylindrical lamp on top. The middle picture shows a square white wooden tower with a many-sided lamp on top. The bottom picture shows a similar-looking lighthouse as viewed from the water. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"The 1853 brick lighthouse (below, top) was replaced in 1886 by the wooden tower (large image). The tower was later enclosed (below, middle). Fire destroyed it in 1972. A replica of the wooden lighthouse was built in 2000 (below, bottom), but Hurricane Katrina destroyed it in 2005.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

            "audioDescription": "The Massachusetts Gate serves as the primary entrance for visitors who travel to Bunker Hill. The gate is located along Monument Square, at the intersection with Monument Avenue. The Bunker Hill Museum is located across the street. The Massachusetts Gate consists of a series of steps which lead to the Bunker Hill grounds. The steps are divided into two sections, left and right, by a iron railing which lays down the center of the gate’s staircase. There are three tiers of steps with a landing in between: the first tier has five steps, second tier has six steps, and the final tier has five steps. On the sidewalk before the stairs are a series of 16 waist-height granite pillars. There is a handicap accessible ramp on the southeastern part of the gate, which leads visitors to the top of the Connecticut Gate and the Monument grounds. On the first lasting, there are two stone markers on either side of the Massachusetts Gate. The marker on the southwest reads, “Colonel William Prescott of Massachusetts led the colonial forces on Breed’s Hill. His commanding figure and strong will inspired the farmer soldiers to the greatness of the day. Dr. Joseph Warren, commissioned a Major General, elected to serve Prescott as a private in the battle. Dr. Warren, an early leader in the Revolution, was killed on this battlefield in the waning moments of the conflict.” The marker on the southeast consists of an insignia and inscription. The Insignia is an adult male dressed in colonial clothing. A sword is in his right hand, while his left holds a document. The text wrapped around the figure in a circular pattern reads, “ Massachusettensis 1775 Sigillum Coloniae.” There is text to the right of the insignia. It reads, “June 17, 1775. This hand opposed to tyrants searches with a sword for peaceful conditions under liberty.” There is a final inscription on the bottom that reads, “Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Metropolitan District Commission.”",

            "bodyText": "The Church of the Holy Apostles, listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and amended in 2020, is significant for its early association with a number of important LGBT political, social, and religious organizations. From 1969 to 1974, the Church of the Holy Apostles in Chelsea was one of the most important meeting places in New York City for organizations of the early post-Stonewall gay rights movement, including the West Side Discussion Group, Gay Liberation Front, and Gay Activists Alliance. It essentially served as New York City’s first LGBT community center.<br /> <br /> Founded in the decade after Stonewall, the June 1969 uprising by patrons at the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village gay bar, was a key turning point in the history of the LGBT rights movement. From 1969 to 1977, the Church of the Holy Apostles, with a congregation that welcomed members of the LGBT community, essentially served as New York City’s first LBGT community center, hosting meetings of the West Side Discussion Group, the Gay Liberation Front, and the Gay Activists Alliance, among the city’s earliest and most important activist organizations in the fight for LGBT civil rights. Holy Apostles also provided space, between 1970 and 1975, for three early LGBT religious congregations that were founded there: the Church of the Beloved Disciple, the Metropolitan Community Church of New York, and Congregation Beth (Beit) Simchat Torah, the first permanent LGBT synagogue on the East Coast. <br /> <br /> Meetings by these LGBT organizations took place in both the church and the adjacent, attached parish house. One singularly significant event was the January 1977 ordination as a priest of Ellen M. Barrett by Bishop Paul M. Moore. She was one of the first American women to be ordained (and one of the first in the Diocese of New York) and was also the very first openly lesbian or gay Episcopal priest. The establishment of places where groups of gay men and lesbians could meet openly and/or worship the religion of their choice in an era of open hostility toward them was important because these places served as sources of comfort, community and stability for people who often lacked families or other sources of support.",

Their hooves have adapted to allow them to cling to rocky slopes and steep ravines. The mountain environment is especially attractive to turkey vultures, eagles and ravens that nest in the canyons and ride the air currents that canyons provide. Caves and rock shelters within the canyon walls are also great roosting places for bats. The lesser long-nosed bats, which have already been mentioned, especially like to roost in the cool shaded canyons during the heat of a summer day.<br /> <br /> Just up the road is the Arch Canyon trailhead parking. There are picnic tables and signs describing the geology of arch formation here in the monument, as well as a two-mile round trip trail that leads hikers into the foothills of the high country. The parking area is also a great place to pull over for scenic views of the arches – there are two visible, if you look closely.",

A few yards down the trail is a small building with restrooms on the left of the path. To the right of the kiosk is a picnic table. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the southern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National ark. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Botzum Trailhead.

It is 2.5 miles north to Beaver Marsh, a popular place to view wildlife. Head south through a commercial district. The towpath intersects Cascade Valley and Sand Run metro parks in 2.5 miles.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

(27.4 meters) high and extends from the steep sea cliffs into the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <br /> This formation is beautiful, but temporary, and has a limited life span. The sea arch will eventually crumble into the sea. However, others will replace it as the cliff slowly migrates inland.<br /> <br /> This impressive sea arch was cut into the cliff of an ancient lava flow from about 550 years ago due to \"differential erosion\", referring the difference in the hardness of various layers of lava. <p><strong>Note: </strong>the observation area for Hōlei Sea Arch has moved and is now located about 1,000 feet (300m) past the gate at the end of Chain of Craters Road. <br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking on flow fields can be hazardous due to deep earth cracks, uneven and unstable terrain, and razor-sharp lava.</strong></p> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/nature/sea-arches.htm\">Learn more about these elegant formations sculpted by the sea</a>",

This olive green shrub you see all around you is one of the most drought-tolerant plants in North America. Long after the soil is too dry for most species, creosote still manages to absorb water. Its adaptations allow it to survive without water for two years before completely dying. <br /> <br /> This supple plant sports small yellow blossoms in the spring and summer. It may occasionally bloom during other times of the year if rainfall is sufficient. The seeds are gray fuzzy balls that resemble droplets of water hanging from the branches. The waxy coating on creosote’s leaves protects the plant from excessive water loss. Locals often say that the Sonoran Desert “smells like rain” because of the intoxicating aroma the leaves give off during a rain storm or on a foggy winter morning. <br /> <br /> Creosote is found abundantly, all over the southwest, in three deserts – the Chihuahuan, Mojave and Sonoran. It also is very long-lived, creating clonal colonies; one found in California is believed to be over 10,000 years old and is considered one of the oldest single living organisms on the planet. <br /> <br /> Creosote is useful to many desert species. The kangaroo rat likes to build its nest within the roots of the creosote bush. The seeds are a life source to many jackrabbits. The desert kit fox prefers to make its den within the roots of the creosote. Many cactus species use the<br /> creosote for shelter when the cactus is young and establishing its own root system.<br /> <br /> This unassuming shrub originated in South America but it is clearly one of the most well-adapted plants found in the monument. The creosote has not only made its home in the heart of the Sonoran Desert but in the hearts of many desert natives as well.<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<h4><b>Stop 3</b><br />  </h4> <h3><b>A Sonoran Desert Icon</b></h3> <p>You would think that the saguaro cactus, which dominates the landscape, would be one of those well-adapted, hardy desert species. It is certainly the tallest and largest cactus in the United States, growing as high as 50 feet and weighing several tons. It can live to be 200 years old. In Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument we think that these cacti flower for the first time at approximately 65 years of age and might produce their first arms at around 90. Of course there is no way to know exactly how old a saguaro is (it doesn’t create growth rings like a tree). What we know comes from averaging data from hundreds of cacti all across the Sonoran Desert. Cacti living in washes or over by Tucson, where the water is more abundant, grow faster. Cacti growing in the valley flats, where water is scarce, can live their whole lives and never have the resources to support arm growth. A saguaro is entirely dependent on location and rainfall, as well as the ability of its shallow roots to suck up as much rain as possible to store in its spongy flesh.  <br />  <br /> Saguaros have adapted to the Sonoran Desert. They arrived in the region only 8,000 years ago, more recently than humans. Humans living here adapted their lives to include, even revere, the giant cactus. The Tohono O’odham have strong cultural ties to the saguaro. The first saguaro fruit harvest coincides with the Tohono O’odham New Year, when the summer monsoon rains fall on the parched desert floor. The O’odham use woody ribs of dead saguaros to create a tool, called a <i>ku-pit</i>, enabling them to reach the fruit clustered at the tops of the arms and crowns of the cacti.  <br />  <br /> The timing of the fruit ripening is impressive. Flowers appear in May and June when the desert is at its hottest and driest. The nectar is the only moisture in town, attracting important pollinators like birds and bats. The fruits ripen in July, in time for many animals to eat the delicious red fruits and transport thousands of seeds to new homes. Once the seeds are spread and the monsoon rains start, those seeds have the chance to grow into new giant saguaro. <br />  <br /> Even with all of the saguaro’s adaptations to capture and conserve water, without the help of other species it would not survive here at all. It needs animals to pollinate and spread the seeds, and the assistance of other plant species to shelter young seedlings during the first fragile years of their lives. Its appearance as the master of the desert is deceiving. As you travel along what other plants dominate this habitat?</p> <h3> </h3>",

Roosevelt and protects most of the natural habitat of the organ pipe cactus within the United States. While commonly found in the southern sections of the Sonoran Desert, these cacti are rare north of the US-Mexico border but have adapted to life in the monument. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument experiences only a few frosty nights a year, allowing the cacti to stay warm and flourish like their Mexican neighbors. Notice how these plants to your left are standing on the south-facing slopes with little vegetation near them. Organ pipe cacti crave the sun’s heat and do not require nurse plants. At night the rocks surrounding the plant release heat stored during the day, thus keeping the plants from freezing.<br /> <br /> In June and July, flowers and fruits cover the arms of these columnar cacti. The flowers only open at night, closing for good in the early morning light to keep water loss at a minimum. These lavender-tinged white flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract lesser long-nosed bats. Each summer these bats migrate from Mexico to feast on flower nectar and the pregnant females give birth and nurse their young. They congregate at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, roosting within the monument’s caves, buildings and historical structures, such as abandoned mines, rock shelters and old ranch houses. As summer progresses, the mothers and their babies gorge themselves on cactus fruits and distribute the seeds across the desert helping to ensure the survival of the organ pipe cactus.",

            "bodyText": "<h3>Stop 7</h3> <h2><i>Hermana </i>Means Sister</h2> <br /> Scenic views are spectacular from the little rocky ridge to the west. Just below the ridge, the upper portion of Diablo Wash emerges from a steep canyon. Looking west from the ridge, the large, dark double summit of Twin Peaks rises above the Kris Eggle Visitor Center. The more distant craggy Cubabi Mountains to the south lie just beyond the town of Sonoyta, Mexico. Behind the Cubabis lies Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar or El Pinacate to the locals. This Mexican national park is the sister park to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, meaning the two parks work together on monitoring projects including wildlife migration, climate and weather trends, and human impacts on the park resources.<br /> <br /> As you look across the desert, you are viewing a complex network of migratory routes for many animals that live in the Sonoran Desert. Washes just like Diablo Canyon serve as primary routes of travel for hummingbirds, coyotes and javelina. Humans have traditionally used these pathways as well. Other species, like the endangered Sonoran Pronghorn, prefer the open creosote flats. Biologists from both Organ Pipe and El Pinacate are studying wildlife migration, determining human impacts on wildlife and how the two park sites can better manage wildlife populations. State, federal and Mexican biologists have created the Sonoran Pronghorn Recovery Team, which conducts aerial surveys of pronghorn, provides support to local parklands and operates a captive breeding program.<br /> <br /> This relationship with our sister park allows us to share information across a political boundary, collaborate efforts to protect animals like the pronghorn and to cooperate with each other in preserving and conserving two vividly different wild lands.",
            "audioDescription": "Stop 7, indicated by a small white road sign with the number \"7\" on it, is located at a scenic vista overlooking the dry desert wash, Diablo Wash. A picnic table perches on this rocky overlook. To the south is United States-Mexican border wall, and the large Cubabi mountains looming in the distance. The town of Sonoyta, in Mexico, rests beneath the Cubabi mountains. To the east are the Ajo Mountains, lush with desert vegetation, organ pipe cacti and saguaros. Close to stop 7 is a cristate saguaro, whose body grows straight but then radiates into a fan-like formation at the top.",

The Lighthouse Trail is not an accessible trail, however there is an accessible entrance that provides a small parking lot at the top of the trail. The trailhead parking lot is comprised of natural shell and stone and is the first parking lot on the right after entering through the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge fee booths. A vaulted toilet is available by the east entrance to the trail. The trail is unpaved, uneven and is made up of several natural materials such as dirt, stone, pine needles, and shell. The trail is in the shape of a horseshoe. As you enter the trail, maritime forest will stand tall on both sides of you. Loblolly Pine trees, catbrier and poison ivy are just a few of the plants you will observe. The trail continues to wind around lone standing pines until leading you gradually up a 22 foot tall dune. At the midway point (1/8 mile) you arrive at the top of the dune in a clearing and are facing the 145 foot tall red and white striped historic Assateague Lighthouse and oil shed. As you continue along the trail, you re-enter the maritime forest and gradually descend the dune. You will likely hear the peeps and songs of songbirds rustling through the forest undergrowth. The trail continues to wind around stand-alone pine trees and between low-lying areas of freshwater pools. You will then return to the parking lot on the opposite side from where you entered.",

            "audioDescription": "The parking lot to the Wildlife Loop is the first left-hand turn after entering through the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge. There are vaulted restrooms available in the paved parking lot before entering the trail. There is a set of auto-gates at the entrance to the Wildlife Loop. If it is before 3 pm, the arms to the gate will be down restricting vehicle access. Walkers and bicyclers are welcome to pass by the gate. This is a paved, accessible, 3.25 mile trail. When you enter the trail, veer to the right, and stay on the paved trail. The Wildlife Loop is one large circle of a trail, and you will be consistently turning slightly to your left. On your right you will see a small portion of maritime forest and on you left you will see freshwater marsh habitat. About a ¼ to a 1/3 of a mile into the trail, there will be a wooden bench made of large logs. Between this bench and the next bench if you look to the right at the stand of tall pine trees, you may be able to see the Bald Eagle’s nest. On the left side of the trail, you may see a shallow water pool in the winter full of waterfowl or a mudflat in the summer with wading birds. Freshwater pools on the Wildlife Loop are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for migratory birds. You may also see marsh grasses and non-native invasive Phragmites plants growing along the trail edge. In a couple hundred feet you will see the entrance to the Black Duck Trail to your right. Continuing around the Wildlife Loop you will notice freshwater pools or mudflats on each side of the trail with tall Phragmites plants growing. About 1 ½ miles into the trail you will see the entrance to the Swan Cove Trail on your right. This trail will lead to the Beach. Once you pass the entrance to the Swan Cove Trail you will enter a portion that winds through a shrub thicket and small maritime forest area. A couple hundred feet into this area you will see a small parking lot on your left with a vaulted toilet. There is also an accessible wooden boardwalk that leads out to an observation deck that overlooks the center of the Wildlife Loop. Here you may see woodland birds and Delmarva fox squirrels. When you exit the maritime forest, you progress down a long strait portion of the trail. To your left you will see the center of the Wildlife Loop filled with grasses and wet areas. To your right, there is a large pool of water likely boasting birds and snapping turtles. As you near the end of the strait roadway, you will see a gravel road to your right. This is the entrance to the 7.5 mile Service Road trail (not accessible) and northern OSV fishing access. Continuing around the trail to your left be mindful of two-way traffic. Vehicles may be present prior to 3 pm if they are accessing the northern OSV fishing zone. To your right you will see shrub thicket and maritime forest, and to your left you will see grasses, freshwater marsh area and cattail. In about a ½ mile, you will see an unpaved trail on the left that leads to an elevated observation deck that looks out over the center of the Wildlife Loop. This unpaved trail is also an entrance to the Marsh Trail (not accessible). In a half mile, you will pass the other entrance on your left to the marsh trail and notice a crossover to the parking lot on your right. If you continue a few hundred feet on the trail, you will return back to the entrance of the Wildlife Loop and the parking lot will be on your right.",

Located in the city’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, it was designated an Historic Landmark in 1977. The Neill family lived in it from 1774 to 1795 on 262 acres that is now part of Schenley Park, one of two large city parks in Squirrel Hill. It was first built and occupied by a soldier stationed at Ft. Pitt. The complete story can be accessed by the link to the “Lewis and Clark Trail Experience,” on the Home Page of the Squirrel Hill Historical Society – <a href=\"https://squirrelhillhistory.org/\">https://squirrelhillhistory.org/</a></p> <p>The historic connection between the Neill Log House and Lewis and Clark’s Expedition is believed to have taken place in May of 1803, when Meriwether Lewis traveled to Pittsburgh to launch the keelboat he had constructed up-river from Pittsburgh. Several months later, he began his trip down the Ohio River from the Point, the confluence of the Three Rivers in Pittsburgh and early Gateway to the West.</p> <p>From here, Lewis traveled to the Falls of the Ohio at Clarksville, Indiana, across from Louisville, Kentucky. Soon after, he met up with William Clark.  It is said that “When they shook hands in Clarksville, the Lewis and Clark Expedition began.” More crew members were added and they traveled to winter quarters outside of St. Louis, in final preparation to journey west. This was all after earlier preparation on the rivers of Pittsburgh, where their keelboat was first constructed and launched.</p> <p>May of 1803 was Lewis’ second trip to Pittsburgh, having traveled earlier as a young Virginian volunteer to put-down the Whiskey Rebellion. On both trips, he journeyed from Maryland to Pittsburgh on the ancient Nemacolin Indian Trail, later called Braddock’s Road. There is also evidence that Lewis later traveled with two wagons, close-by the Neill Log House, on his last 4 miles overland to the Point. Early travelers on the Nemacolin Trail through what is now Schenley Park would water their horses at Snyder’s Springs, source of the historic Catahecassa Fountain at the Neill Log House. Research for all of this appears in articles on our linked site.</p> <p>Squirrel Hill is a scenic residential city neighborhood with a vibrant central business district, and the largest green-space in Metropolitan Pittsburgh with historic Frick and Schenley Parks. It is also home to both Chatham and Carnegie-Mellon Universities, and near the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Institute. Great dining, culture, recreation and, of course, history are all abundant here. Look for links to all of this on our website.</p> <p>To experience Squirrel Hill’s history, geography and notable sights, go to the interactive map of our neighborhood.

The towering tree stands taller than the tower of Van Buren's home, and requires multiple people to join hands at its base to go around it. Sycamore trees can live for over 200 years under the correct circumstances, but it is impossible to know for sure exactly how old our sycamore is without damaging it. This is because depending on environmental factors trees can grow at different rates, the only way to know exactly how the old the tree is would be to take cores out and count rings. By growth estimates however the tree is believed to have originated from Van Buren's time on the property making it the only witness tree to his time here.",

            "audioDescription": "The text explains that Crystal Cave is a dark, beautiful, fragile underground world. It is paved and lit. The trail winds through large and small cave passages. There is a photo of the historic Spider Web Gate, a metal gate made to look like a web across the cave's opening. Others include a brimstone dam in a cave room and water polished marble bedrock. A map of this area shows our location in the parking area. Safety information, Getting to Crystal Cave It is a half mile walk from here to the cave where the tour starts. The downhill trip to the cave entrance takes approximately 20 minutes. The trail is paved but has stairs, uneven ground, steep drop offs, and can be slippery. It can be icy in early summer or late fall, or slippery at any time. After the tour, the uphill return trip is steep and strenuous, with a 320-foot (or 100 m) elevation gain; take your time and enjoy the scenery. Consider the strenuous nature of the trail before participating in a cave tour, especially if you have heart, respiratory, or mobility concerns. The total walking distance, including the tour, is 1.5 miles (or 2.4 km) There are no restrooms on the trail to the cave or at the cave. From the time you leave this parking area, no restrooms will be available for at least 1 and a half hours. Use restrooms here before heading down the trail. Drinking water is not available at the cave. Bottled water can be purchased at the information booth. On future visits, consider bringing drinking water in a reusable bottle. Protect Crystal Cave Do not touch cave formations. These \"growing rocks\" are easily damaged by touching. Oils and dirt from human hands discolor them and prevent them from growing. Leave bulky items in your car or at the cave entrance. Backpacks, tripods, hiking sticks, and other items that can damage cave formations cannot be carried into the cave. Child carriers of any kind are not allowed; babies are safest when carried in front. Pets are not allowed on the trail or in the cave. Pets may not be left unattended in the parking area or in your vehicle. Food and drink cannot be consumed in the cave (except water). Leave all natural and historic objects undisturbed. Please do not take rocks, cones, cultural artifacts, or other items. Protect Yourself All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Rattlesnakes and bees may be seen along the trail to the cave. If you see them, keep your distance and inform cave staff. Poison oak, which can cause a rash, grows here. Avoid touching plants along the trail and near the cave. Stay on trails. Watch out for uneven or slippery footing. The trail is paved, but can be uneven, wet, or even icy. It is not brightly lit. Watch for stairs, narrow passageways, and low ceilings. The cave trail is steep and strenuous for some visitors. If you have physical limitations that will make it difficult for you to complete the cave tour and return trip, reconsider your plans to visit.",

This desert covers 110,000 square miles (280,000 sq km), an area about the size of the state of New Mexico. The Sonoran Desert is the most diverse desert in North America, home to over 4,000 species of plants and animals. Why is this place so diverse? What makes this desert different from the Great Basin Desert to our north, Mojave to our west or the Chihuahuan to our east? Many factors make the Sonoran Desert unique. Our winters are mostly frost-free, and there are two rainfall periods, one in the winter/spring and another in July and August. The high mountain ranges affect how much rain falls in an area, creating a diversity of<br /> habitats for specially adapted plants and animals to thrive. Everything seems to be related or connected to something else in complex ways.<br /> <br /> Based on plant evidence, scientists believe this is a young desert, only about 10,000 years old, with its ancestry in the tropics. Many of our perennial plants (cacti and other succulents) and animals (such as lizards and snakes) migrated from the tropics or are descendants of tropical species. They prosper in the brief summer storms that occur here. Annual plants, like many wildflowers, rely on the soaking winter rains that help make the Sonoran Desert so diverse. Many plants and animals in the Sonoran Desert have adapted to reproduce or grow after sufficient rainfall in winter or summer. Most animals that live here are either nocturnal or crepuscular (dusk- or dawn-active) to thwart the high daytime temperatures. These adaptations, along with many more, allow the Sonoran Desert life to thrive.<br /> <br /> Welcome to the Green Desert! As you travel down this road, we encourage you to travel slowly, pay attention to details, and discover some of these unique relationships for yourself.<br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Rim Trail is a mostly paved path that stretches roughly 13 miles (21 km) along the southern rim of Grand Canyon from South Kaibab Trailhead in the east to Hermits Rest in the west. Most people won't hike the whole trail in one go, but walking short sections of the rim can provide an excellent chance to stretch the legs after a long car ride, take a break from riding the shuttle, or to get away from a busy viewpoint for a moment. No matter how much of it you walk, you'll get lots of good views along the way!<br /> <br /> <strong>One-way Distances from Mather Point along the Rim Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> South Kaibab Trail - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum - 0.7 miles (1 km)<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Bright Angel Trailhead - 2.5 miles (4 km)<br /> Hermits Rest - 11 miles (18 km)</p> <h2>Popular Sections</h2> <h4>Mather Point to Yavapai Geology Museum</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 0.7 mi (1 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong>: </span>15–30 minutes<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. <br /> <br /> This short section of the trail is one of the most popular as it is easily accessible from both Mather and Yavapai Points and it offers constant views of Grand Canyon, as well as Phantom Ranch and a glimpse of the Colorado River far below. Even walking part of this section guarentees some great Grand Canyon vistas. <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Kaibab/Rim (Orange) Route shuttle bus is running to Mather Point and the Yavapai Geology Museum it links the two ends of this section for an easy one-way hike.  </p> <h4>Mather Point to Grand Canyon Historic Village</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 2.5 mi (4 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong></span>: 45 minutes to 2 hours<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibbility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. (It is largely downhill heading east to west from Mather to the Village)<br /> <br /> This 2.5 mile stretch of the Rim Trail includes the section above, and expands it west to include the trail to/from the historic village. While you can walk this section in under an hour it is recommended to plan for a longer trip as you'll want to take your time to appreciate all the good views, snag a few pictures, and experience the Trail of Time, which overlaps this section of the rim. The 2 mile (3.5 km) section between Yavapai Geology Museum and the Grand Canyon Historic Village can be hot and sunny in the summer time so be sure to take water, snacks, and sun protection. Water and restrooms are available at the Geology Museum, Grand Canyon Visitor and at multiple spots in the village. This section of the trail is quite popular as well, but offers more opportunities for solitude and quiet moments along the canyon's edge. <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Village (Blue) Route shuttle bus is running transportation will run between the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village to help complete a one-way loop. </p> <h4>Grand Canyon Historic Village to Hermits Rest</h4> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Length</span>: </strong>7 mi (11 km) one way<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Time:</span> </strong>3+ hours<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Accessibility:</span> </strong>The section between Monuement Creek Vista and Pima Point is paved and accessible, but the rest of the Rim Trail along the Hermit Road is <strong>NOT</strong> accessible. The rest of the trail is a mix of dirt and paved paths with the paved sections including steep grades and steps. <br /> <br /> The views along this section of the Rim Trail offer some of the best views of the Colorado River along the Hermit Road and can help get you away from the crowds at the major viewpoints along the way. There is limited water and restrooms availability along the Hermit Road so be prepared for longer hikes. Most hikers will use the shuttle system to jump along the road to do shorter sections of the trail and to return to the beginning of the scenic road. <i>Most</i> of the stops are about 1 mile from each other, though a few are longer, check your <strong>Pocket Map</strong> for a break down of the Rim Trail from point to point.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Hermit Rest (Red) Route shuttle bus is running it will stop at each of the major viewpoints and access points along the Rim Trail through this section. </p> <h4><span style=\"color:#cc0000;\">Safety - Hike Smart</span></h4> <p>- Take water, snacks, and sun protection with you on your hike. At 7,000 ft (2000 m) in elevation even a hike on the rim can leave you dehydrated, tired, and sun burnt. <br /> - Stay on designated trails and walkways and always keep a safe distance of at least six feet (2 m) from the edge of the canyon rim.<br /> - In areas where there is a railing or fence, do not climb over the barrier.<br /> - Know where the edge is. Watch foot placement and look for trip hazards.<br /> - Never throw rocks, coins, trash, or anything else over the edge.<br /> - Early summer temperatures can be HOT. Highs will often reach the low to mid 90s <sup>o</sup>F (...<sup>o</sup>C) and even the canyon rim can reach temperatures above 100<sup>o</sup>F (38<sup>o</sup>C). Check the weather and be prepared.<br /> - The late summer season brings rain and thunderstorms to Grand Canyon. Remember, \"If it roars, Go indoors\". Lightning can and often does strike the edge of the canyon as thunderstorms pass over the area. </p>",

            "bodyText": "SPRINGWELLS<br /> <br /> Arguably one of the most historic sites in the State of Michigan, the Springwells site has deep cultural significance going back more than a millennium to the area’s first native inhabitants. From Woodland times (400-1200 CE) through the War of 1812 and up to the present, Springwells has been a central and integral component of the cultural mosaic and evolving landscape on the Detroit.<br /> <br /> Springwells, now referred to as Historic Fort Wayne, is located just south of the city of Detroit. The freshwater springs located behind the sandy bluff at Springwells attracted long-term indigenous settlements and served as a major burial site dating from the Woodland period (400 CE -1200 CE) up through the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> Earthworks<br /> Researchers suggest that the Springwells’ earthworks along the riverside bluff ranged from six to as many as nineteen mounds. The earthworks stretched from the mouth of the River Rouge downstream, along the northern shoreline of the Detroit River and upstream, to an area due east of the Fort. The presence of a large group of burial mounds, within such a small area, suggests that the Springwells Mound Group was an important ceremonial context in southeastern Michigan for much of the 1st millennium CE.<br /> <br /> Historical accounts suggest that on the eve of the War of 1812, the Springwells area continued to function as an important burial site, drawing Native people of the Great Lakes to the earthworks for mortuary ceremonies and to live. The springs were close to river bottomlands for seasonal cultivation and to nearby forest areas for hunting and gathering year-round. In front of the bluff at Springwells flowed the Detroit River, which offered nearby marshes, rich fishing sites, and access to communication and transportation routes throughout the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> First Shot Fired of the War of 1812<br /> Michigan Territorial Governor William Hull was appointed the new General of the Northwest Army in preparation for war in 1812. Knowing that Detroit was isolated, one of Hull’s first challenges was to build a military supply road from Ohio to Detroit. Starting in late May near Dayton Ohio, Hull and his soldiers moved north building a corduroy road and reached the Maumee River in present-day Toledo, Ohio in late June. While at the Maumee River, General Hull secured a boat to send supplies and some sick soldiers across western Lake Erie to Detroit, not realizing that war was declared. The British, already learning that war was declared captured the boat, seizing the supplies and sick soldiers.<br /> <br /> On July 5, 1812, as General Hull approached Springwells, just south of Fort Detroit, he heard the distinct sound of artillery fire a few miles north in the vicinity of Detroit despite of his orders received three days prior from the Secretary of War William Eustis, informing him that War had been declared against the British but to await further orders before proceeding with the planned invasion. As Hull approached the Springwells, he learned his men fired the first artillery shots of the War of 1812 from this site into British Canada on the other side of the Detroit River.<br /> <br /> General Hull immediately ordered the construction of floating batteries in order to bombard and burn Amherstburg downstream closer to Lake Erie and additional batteries to be erected at Springwells, opposite Sandwich in preparation for an invasion of Canada. Hull sent Colonel Lewis Cass from Springwells across the river and downstream to Fort Malden (Amherstburg) with a flag of truce to request the return of baggage and prisoners captured by the British. Hull’s message to British Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas St. George included an apology: “Sir, since the arrival of my army at this Encampment (five o’clock P M yesterday) I have been informed that a number of discharges of Artillery and of small arms have been made by some of the Militia of the Territory, from this Shore [Springwells] into Sandwich, I regret to have received such information, the proceeding was not authorized by me.” Despite an apologetic tone, Hull’s request for the return of baggage and prisoners was refused. Cass was blindfolded and escorted back to the encampment at Springwells. With Cass’s subsequent return to Detroit, antagonism grew on both banks of the Detroit River.<br /> <br /> General Hull decided to establish a military encampment at Springwells. The location was ideal for a military encampment because the sandy bluffs created a better elevation, its closer to Canada than Fort Detroit, and was long considered a superior location for the defense of Detroit. On July 7th, five additional artillery pieces were brought from the Fort in Detroit to Springwells and placed on the riverbank in front of the military encampment to fire on the enemy at Sandwich and the U.S. Infantry marched from Springwells to Detroit.<br /> <br /> Invasion of Canada<br /> On July 8, 1812, the Ohio militia, who were camped at Springwells, marched to Detroit. The next day, General Hull received discretionary orders allowing him to invade the British in Upper Canada. According to Captain McAfee, “on the evening of 11th, the regiment of Colonel M’Arthuer, accompanied by some boats, was marched down to the Springwells, to decoy the enemy.” As Hull prepared to invade Canada, 200 Ohio Militiamen suddenly refused to go, stating that they could not serve outside the American territory. On July 12th, Hull’s army, weakened by the absence of 200 Ohioans, crossed over the Detroit River by way of Hog Island (Belle Isle) and landed in Canada unopposed. The British had evacuated Sandwich (“D” on the July 1812 map) to Ft. Malden hours before Hull’s invasion. Hull marched further down river to Sandwich and issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of Canada promising to protect them, urging their militiamen to abandon the British, and warning them that if they fought alongside the Native Warriors, they would experience a “war of extermination… No white man found fighting by the side of an Indian, will be taken prisoner. Instant destruction will be his lot.”<br /> <br /> Surrender of Detroit<br /> August 15, 1812 10:00 a.m.: British officers crossed the river to Detroit under a flag of truce carrying General Brock's demand for General Hull to surrender. Brock threatened that if Hull did not surrender, “uncontrollable” Native warriors would destroy the entire settlement. Hull ordered a council with his officers during which time he sent another messenger inquiring about the return of Colonel Duncan McArthur with the River Raisin expedition back to Detroit.<br /> <br /> Native Confederation forces, led by Shawnee War Chief Tecumseh and the Mohawk War Chief John Norton (Teyoninhokarawen), left Amherstburg by canoe early on August 15th planning to disembark at Brownstown and to move north to Detroit along the American side of the river. Instead, Tecumseh and his forces paddled directly to Sandwich on the Canadian side, avoiding a difficult walk across the marshlands below the Rouge River, to assemble with Brock at Sandwich directly across from the open bluff at Springwells.<br /> <br /> August 15, 1812 3:00 p.m.: Following the officer council, Hull brashly responded to General Brock’s threat, despite his troop losses in previous ambushes and shortage of soldiers, since his detachment had not returned. Hull refused to surrender in hopes that his errant forces would arrive and come to his aid: “I am ready to meet any force which may be at your disposal, and any consequences which may result from its execution in any way you may think proper to use it…”<br /> <br /> August 15, 1812 evening: After Hull’s response reached General Brock, the British vessels Queen Charlotte and General Hunter moved closer to bombard Fort Detroit and its batteries. The British began to fire upon soft targets within the Fort, opening weak spots for Native Warriors to infiltrate the Fort, which was densely packed with women and children seeking safety. Portions of the Fort were set on fire and some civilians were killed. No U.S artillery could fire south or west towards the British at May’s Creek, because it was too far, and the views were obscured by trees, houses and fences.<br /> <br /> During the evening, American Brigade Major Jessup, Major Taylor, Captain Snelling and Quartermaster Dugan “rode down the river [the short distance] to Springwells to view the enemy at Sandwich” and the “position of the Queen Charlotte,” concluding “that the enemy intended to effect a landing at that place” (McAfee 1816). Springwells was the most logical location for the British invasion as it was the narrowest river crossing and out of range of the American guns at Detroit. It was also on an open sandy bluff below the ribbon farms and above the marsh at the Rouge in an open area suitable for assembling and moving troops after crossing the river.<br /> <br /> That same night, Native Warriors crossed the river and landed at Springwells. They then advanced along the western edge of the woods bordering the farmlands below the Fort. The Confederation Warriors moved undetected about 1 mile west from the shoreline as they surrounded the Fort.<br /> <br /> August 16, 1812: On the morning of August 16th, with ample cover fire from British batteries on the opposite shore and from the British ships the Queen Charlotte and the General Hunter anchored on the river about a half-mile above Sandwich, General Brock led the British across the Detroit River to Springwells unopposed. They marched just north to May’s Creek and setup a defensive position along the ravine.<br /> <br /> General Hull was confronted with a dilemma: lacking supplies, no reinforcements coming from River Raisin, situated within range of British guns, surrounded by Native Warriors, and General Brock positioned just outside of his artillery range, and a large civilian population. General Hull made the decision to capitulate. He hoisted a white flag and sent an officer out to meet General Brock. Brock had advanced to within twelve hundred yards of the Fort and was preparing to storm the walls, when he saw the American coming to make terms. Fort Detroit was subsequently surrendered and placed under British control. About 2,500 Americans soldiers were taken as prisoners of war and marched to British Canada. After securing Detroit, Native Warriors and British Soldiers proceeded to the River Raisin and took control of Frenchtown.<br /> <br /> Treaty of Springwells,1814<br /> On December 24th, 1814, the Treaty of Ghent finally ended the war between the United States and Great Britain. The British had attempted to secure an independent Indian State for the Tribal Nations in the Great Lakes during negotiations, but the United States refused. The Treaty of Ghent did obligate the United States to cease “hostilities with all the Tribes or Nations of Indians with whom they may be at war at the time of such Ratification, and forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively all the possessions, rights, and privileges which they may have enjoyed or been entitled to in one thousand eight hundred and eleven previous to such hostilities (Treaty of Ghent 1814)\". Nearly six months after the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the Great Lakes Native people stated that no treaty of Peace had taken place between them and the United States and “no measures had been taken to remove the original cause of hostilities”. Without a representative at the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, the Native Nations believed that \"they were as much at War at this time as they have been during the whole contest.”<br /> <br /> Lacking a Treaty recognized by the Native Nations to end the War of 1812, Native leaders, American military, and territorial officials, gathered once again on the bluff at Springwells below Detroit on September 8, 1815, to officially end hostilities. Against the backdrop of Springwells’ Woodland Period burial mounds and by the sacred spring, General William Henry Harrison, territorial officials and the leaders of eight Native Nations (Chippewa, Delaware, Miami, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Shawnee, Seneca and Wyandot) met to negotiate peace. The treaty terms absolved Native warriors for their part in the War of 1812 and placed them under the protection of the U.S. government, as the Treaty of Ghent had tried to accomplish nearly nine months prior. Tribal signatories were pardoned for their actions during the war and the U.S. agreed to restore Native possessions, rights, and privileges as of 1811. In effect, like the Treaty of Ghent, the Treaty of Springwells called for returning to the pre-war boundaries and agreements. Once signed, the Treaty of Springwells officially ends the War of 1812 and hostilities between the U.S. and the assembled Native Nations.<br /> <br /> After the War of 1812<br /> Following the War of 1812, Springwells drew additional attention for its strategic location on the Detroit riverfront. In 1815, newly promoted Brigadier General Duncan McArthur again suggested, “At Spring Well (sic), there is a natural position which completely commands the surrounding country and river for several miles”. During the implementation of “Indian Removal” in the aftermath of the River Raisin, Springwells functioned as a military encampment where local militias held meetings to support the 1832 Black Hawk War. Fears on both sides of the border that political turmoil among factions in Canada and supporters in the U.S. would erupt into another international conflict further intensified with “Indian Removal” and the Patriots War of 1837 that briefly resulted in some U.S. forces entering British Canada. By 1843, with continuing concerns over future disputes with Canada and fears of another British invasion like the one that crippled the United States at the River Raisin in 1813, construction of a massive fort at Springwells finally began. Christened Fort Wayne after General “Mad” Anthony Wayne, the star-shaped fort was built on the strategic flat sandy bluff overlooking the north bank of the river adjacent to the springs, largely displacing the remaining Woodland burial mounds.<br /> <br /> PLAN YOUR VISIT Location: Historic Fort Wayne 6325 West Jefferson Avenue Detroit, MI 48209, Phone: 734-324-7295 Hours: 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Admission Fee: YES<br /> <br /> THINGS TO DO Parking: Parking Lot available River Access: River View Only Trail Access: Onsite Walking Paths<br /> <br /> Passport Stamp: NO<br /> Guided Tours available by the Historic Fort Wayne Coalition.

            "bodyText": "MACON RESERVE<br /> <br /> History<br /> As a part of the westward expansion, the United States began occupying lands in southeast Michigan in 1796. The Potawatomi Indians call the vast fertile land along the River Raisin from Lake Erie westward home. The newly established Post of Detroit consisted of six miles inland from the water edge starting at Lake St. Claire in the north to the River Raisin settlement in the south. As the U.S. moved into their new “post of Detroit”, they began removing the Native Americans.<br /> <br /> The Macon Reservation is physically located on a 60-acre portion of the original Macon Indian Reserve that was established in 1807 by the Treaty of Detroit. William Hull, Territorial Governor of Michigan coerced the Potawatomi and other Native Nations to cede land to the United States. A small portion of the land where the Macon Creek flows into the River Raisin (about six square miles or 207,000 acres) was reserved for the Potawatomi.<br /> <br /> On November 17, 1807, the U.S. Government created the Macon Reservation eight miles outside the Post of Detroit along the River Raisin. The reservation consisted of only three square miles of land around the confluence of the Macon River, the Saline River, and the River Raisin. Several Potawatomi Indians were relocated to the Macon Reservation, but many chose to live elsewhere.<br /> <br /> As the United States claimed their lands, the Potawatomi and other Native Americans nations did not want to give up their homelands and way of life. The Potawatomi took up arms against the U.S. in the War of 1812 and fought on the side of the Indian Confederation and Great Britain in hopes of retaining their villages in Southeast Michigan. With the help of many great Potawatomi war chiefs, tremendous battles were won along the River Raisin and Detroit River.<br /> <br /> When the war ended, Great Britain abandoned the Native tribes and the United States quickly began forcing tribal nations farther out. The new Michigan Territorial Governor, Lewis Cass, started forcing the Potawatomi off the Macon Reservation in the Treaty of 1817 at the Foot of the Rapids of the Miami of Lake Erie, the Macon Reserve was re-designated to benefit Catholic members of the Potawatomi, Ottawa and Chippewa tribes that desired to educate their children. The land was granted to the St. Anne Catholic Church of Detroit and to the corporation of the College of Detroit. The land was then sold and used to start what today is known as the University of Michigan. The Macon Reservation was lost piece by piece until it was completely taken away from the Potawatomi in the 1830s.<br /> <br /> Current Day<br /> Much of West County Park – A Prairie Preserve on the Macon Reservation, which fronts the River Raisin, was used as farmland. In 2002, it was enrolled in the USDA Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and planted with a mixture of native trees, shrubs, grasses, and wildflowers. The Park is owned and managed by the County of Monroe Parks and Recreation Department and managed in partnership with the National Park Service. The park has parking and includes beautiful walking trail throughout the restored tallgrass prairie and along the River Raisin. Today, visitors walking through the park can experience the same kind of tallgrass prairie encountered by Native people in this part of southeast Michigan in the early 1800’s.<br /> <br /> Directions<br /> Visit the Macon Reservation walking trail and exhibits located at West County Park.

Later, residents of Monroe who died from the cholera epidemic of 1830 were buried at this location, and some of their graves can still be seen here.<br /> <br /> In 1872, surviving veterans of the War of 1812 from Kentucky and Ohio gathered on this spot to honor their fallen comrades. However, by the early 1900s, the cemetery had fallen into disrepair and there was pressure to abandon it. The “Civic Improvement Society of the Women of Monroe” stepped in to protect the site. They took over the cemetery, restored it, and then were able to persuade city officials to designate the old burial ground as a park.<br /> <br /> The State of Michigan provided funding for the monument, which was dedicated in 1904. Since then, the monument has stood as a permanent tribute to Kentucky and the militiamen from that state who came to the aid of the habitants of the Territory of Michigan during the War of 1812.  <br /> <br /> The continuing close tie between these two states is reflected in the fact that River Raisin National Battlefield Park is one of only a few places outside of Kentucky where the Kentucky State Flag is authorized to fly. A contingent of officials from the State of Kentucky travelled to Monroe for the dedication of the Kentucky Monument on September 4, 1904, including H.V. Mc Chesney (Secretary of State), Colonel Bennet Young who had fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, Governor Thomas T.

After the long cold winter, the icy waters keep air temperatures cool in the spring. This helps to prevent fruit trees from blooming too early when a killing frost might still occur.

The steel-hulled Liberian freighter was bound for Holland via the St. Lawrence Seaway loaded with 940-tons of general cargo.<br /> <br /> The 24-year-old captain, Eduardo Trivizas, and a multi-national crew of 13 men sailed the ship. Captain Trivizas had five years of sailing experience and was a graduate of the Greek Navy School. The Francisco Morazan was his first command. The Captain's wife and traveling companion, Anistasia, age 29 and pregnant with their second child was also aboard.<br /> <br /> By the next day, a 40-MPH wind blew out of the northwest, and the Morazan's decks were awash. After the ship passed the Point Betsie Light, blinded by fog and heavy snow, she ran aground about 300 feet off the southwest shore of South Manitou Island. The ship was in contact with two Coast Guardsmen at the North Manitou Island Lighthouse and with a state forester stationed on South Manitou Island who flashed light signals to the stranded ship. Rescue vessels arrived the next morning along with two helicopters and an amphibian airplane from the Traverse City Coast Guard Station.<br /> <br /> The lake was wild all day, but the ship did not seem to be in immediate danger, but the Captain was worried that some of the big waves might lift the ship off the shoal and carry it into deeper water. He arranged to have his wife lifted from the ship by helicopter on Friday, December 2. By Sunday, Dec 4, the crew abandoned ship and was taken by the ice-breaker Mackinaw to Traverse City.<br /> <br /> The owners of the Francisco Morazan could never be found and nothing was done about removing the ship. It is now home to cormorants and gulls.<br /> <br /> Fierce weather stymied efforts to salvage the cargo. Only about 5 tons of canned chicken and hides were recovered before the wreck, buffeted by heavy seas, began to break up.<br /> <br /> Over the years, cargo was salvaged by islanders for their own use: locals spoke highly of the Blue Star brand canned chicken and the boys especially enjoyed the balsa wood model aircraft kits.</p>",

The Morazan, which ran aground rocks about 300 feet off the island's south coast, is known as the largest and most exposed shipwreck of the more than 50 known wrecks that have occurred in the waters surrounding the Manitou Islands. The Morazan's massive hull-broken but with its tall stack still intact-sits in shallow water. On the bluff you will find a small wooden platform with a wooden railing running along its front edge and a wayside panel providing additional information about the ship. What remains of the Morazan is now home to gulls and double-crested cormorants, which you may see perched atop the ship's tall steel lifeboat davit arms, 2 each located on both the port and starboard sides.",

The water from this oasis supports a vibrant plant and wildlife community, including a cluster of California fan palms, making this a good location for viewing desert plant and wildlife. <br /> <br /> The Oasis of Mara has also long supported human life in the area. Named \"Mara\", meaning \"the place of little springs and much grass\" by the Serrano, this oasis is believed to be their first home in this world. According to their traditions, the fan palms at this oasis were first planted for every boy born in the village. The water of this oasis was able to support a village to live in the desert by providing the necessary water for the plants needed for food and materials to make items such as baskets, sandals, and homes.</p>",

Rocky mountains rise up along the horizon to the south.",

The Georgian style home was designed to Ted and Eleanor Roosevelt’s satisfaction by their son-in-law, Baltimore architect William G. McMillan, Jr.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and Eleanor Alexander Roosevelt</span><br /> <br /> Eleanor Butler Alexander was born in New York’s Upper East Side to Henry Addison Alexander and Grace Green in 1888. Although a native New Yorker, Eleanor spent the first years of her life on move, living in California and Paris, France for a period of six years. She returned to the United States in 1900.<br /> <br /> Eleanor and Ted had several encounters at social functions since Eleanor was acquainted with Ted’s younger sister, Ethel. The two were married in New York City at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church on June 20, 1910. Together, Theodore and Eleanor Roosevelt had four children: Grace, Theodore II, Cornelius and Quentin II (named for Ted’s baby brother who was killed during the First World War.)<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Old Orchard House </span><br /> <br /> The Old Orchard house was built of brick and intended to be painted white, but left exposed because Eleanor found the color to be “so good.” Instead, the doors, shutters and trim of Old Orchard were painted off white. The exterior brick would eventually be covered in English ivy, which remained until the National Park Service acquisition in 1962.<br /> <br /> The elegant home was filled with mementos of world travel, including Chinese furniture collected by Eleanor in the 1920s as well as reminders of Ted’s service in the infantry during World War I. The large eighteenth-century front door was found in back yard of a parish in Dublin by Ted and Eleanor.<br /> <br /> The entrance hall to the home was lined with family portraits dating back four generations, and some of Ted’s flags, including those from his governorships and of other prominent positions he held. Ted shared his father’s love of reading, and Eleanor stated that books \"…have overflowed into every room in the house, both upstairs and down.” Eleanor referred to the inside of the home as her province and wanted color everywhere. Some rooms had a color theme –the drawing room, “happily combined every shade of red from deep crimson to pale rose”—while others were filled with items from a trip to China, gifts from family and friends and other family treasures.<br /> <br /> The upstairs was home to the family bedrooms. One for Ted and Eleanor and one each for their sons, Quentin and Cornelius (their daughter Grace and son Theodore III had moved out years earlier), as well as one for their maid and two spare rooms.  As was typical in some English country houses at the time, the Roosevelts decided to name some of the bedrooms in their home, with names as exotic as “Chengtu,” after Quentin’s interest in China or as American as “Vermont,” after the state where some of the furniture in Ted and Eleanor’s room was purchased.<br /> <br /> Along with the house, the Old Orchard compound also included a multi-bay garage for the family’s automobiles; a cottage for the site foreman, and a cold storage all located within close proximity to the home.<br /> <br /> Ted Jr. lived in the Old Orchard House until his death in 1944 and his wife Eleanor Alexander Roosevelt lived in the house until her death in 1960. <h4> </h4>",
            "audioDescription": "The Old Orchard House sits on four acres of Theodore Roosevelt's original estate in Oyster Bay, NY. It is in the northeast area of the estate. The house is a large Georgian-style brick home with white shutters. The area around the house has many apple and pear trees and the nature trailhead is located to the southwest.",
