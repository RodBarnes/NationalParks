            "audioDescription": "Pulse of the River Wayside. 3 minutes Half-buried logs laid horizontally define the edge between this narrow parking area along the river and a narrow grass surface picnic area with a table. At the far end of the grassy section is a three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel with a brightly colored illustration that assembles, in one scene, many of the plants and animals living in this river habitat. Green ferns, pillows of yellow-green mosses, and plants with purple berries grow low to the ground. Bright red shrubs growing beneath green pine trees and deciduous trees with yellow, red, and green leaves line the riverbanks. Slim gray river otters and brown beavers with rounded flat tails are on the bank and in the water. A brown frog hides among fallen leaves while a gray bird pulls a worm from the ground. A blue, white and red Kingfisher perches on a branch, a brown and white Osprey watches for fish from a dead tree branch, a red-headed duck with a gray body stands on a river rock, and a bald eagle with a white head and white tailfeathers, flies above the river, its long black wings extended. In the river, red and yellow trout keep to a deep pool, and schools of salmon with bright red markings swim upstream. On the top left of the panel text reads: Pulse of the River. The Sol Duc River launches its conversation with the landscape at 5,000 feet near High Divide. A trickle of mountain water feeds tiny rivulets that merge into streams. The route steepens, waters plunge down hanging paths carved by Ice Age glaciers. Fallen old-growth leaves, logs and branches change the course of the river, crafting pools that provide crucial habitat for beaver, mink, river otter, salmon and salamanders. Tumbling rocks and abrasive sediments create fresh rhythms as the river flows to sea. The Sol Duc River begins and ends with gentleness, but its overriding temperament is vigorous. It is rarely hushed, never resting in one pool for long. Time is its vehicle, change a constant companion. Text in the lower right reads: Coho Cadence. A unique stock of coho salmon with unusual behavior inhabits the Sol Duc River. While most stocks of coho swim up western Washington rivers in October and November, when water levels are high, summer coho enter the Sol Duc in July when stream flows are low. They spawn from late September to November. Winter steelhead and cutthroat trout also swim in these silvery waters.",

            "audioDescription": "Washington Geology Wayside. 3 minutes The header on this three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel reads, Washington Geology. Below, text reads: Tsunamis. Devastating waves called tsunamis can strike Washington’s coast at any time. These giant waves are usually caused by great undersea earthquakes. Such earthquakes can occur along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, one of the largest active faults in North America. This fault zone lies 32 to 70 miles offshore and roughly parallels the coast. A tsunami on the Washing Coast may also result from an earthquake striking areas as far away as Alaska or Japan. Tsunamis are dangerous and destructive. They have struck the Washington coast repeatedly and will again in the future. Tsunamis can follow within minutes of an earthquake. They move rapidly, but quickly run out of water as they sweep inland and uphill. Flooding can occur several miles inland along rivers and streams. Remember, most tsunamis are not solitary giant waves; instead, many large waves. What to do to escape a tsunami. Drop, cover, and hold during an earthquake. After the earthquake, immediately move uphill or inland. Do not return to the beach after the first tsunami wave – more waves may arrive for several hours. Wait for official notice from authorities that the danger has passed before returning to the beach. For additional information, contact the Washington Emergency Management Division 1-800-562-6108 or your local Emergency Management Division: Clallam County 1-360-417-2305. In the center of the panel, a rectangular diagram illustrates this text: Cross Section. A portion of the Earth’s crust, called The Juan de Fuca Plate, is moving away from the Pacific Plate, several hundred miles off Washington’s coast. The Juan de Fuca Plate is being forced under the North American Plate. The geologic process is called subduction. On the left side of the panel is a map of the west coasts of Washington and Oregon. In the Pacific Ocean, a dark red line marks the location of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. A caption reads: The earth’s surface consists of a series of plates. These plates are constantly shifting and sliding over, under, or past each other. When a sudden movement occurs between two plates, we experience an earthquake.",

At the end of the trail is a wooden platform overlooking the cascades. The left side railing and one-half of the front railing on the left are about four feet high. The remainder of the front railing and the right side are lower, about three feet high. Upstream is to the left, where flat, dark green water flowing from left to right, soon meets rocks of many sizes becoming frothy white as it cascades over dark brown boulders and rocks of various sizes. Changes in creek bed elevation from high to low create a series of water falls until finally downstream, the water flattens out again. The light brown rocks lining the river are rough in texture and covered in places with green moss. On the far riverbank, small deciduous trees with white bark stand in front of a dense forest of green pine trees. Just before the platform on the left side of the trail, is a three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel titled, Leaps of a Lifetime. Filling the panel’s background is a color cutaway illustration of a creek, two-thirds underwater and one third above. Underwater in the foreground, three salmon swim in shallow water above a gravelly creek bottom. One has bright red sides with a green and black spotted back, a hook nose that overhangs its mouth, a fin on its back and three fins on its belly. The other two salmon are greener with black spots and have pointed noses. In the near background, red and green salmon swim above a deep pool, and in the far background, two salmon leap out of the water at the base of a waterfall on their journey upstream. Text at the top left reads: Strength, endurance, instinct - how do tools of survival guide you through life’s challenges? Watch these powerful forces at work as coho salmon leap 11 feet up Salmon Cascades. Born in gravelly river beds above the cascades, thousands of juvenile coho salmon memorize river scents on their 70 mile swim to sea. For up to two years coho range hundreds of miles from Oregon to British Columbia. Ocean temperatures and salinity, angle of the sun and magnetic fields help guide them back to the Sol Duc River. These unique summer Coho enter the river in July when water levels are low and they can navigate the cascades. By recalling river scents, about 1,000 coho return to their birthplace from late summer to early fall. When they spawn and die, coho salmon bring new life. Their marine nutrients benefit forests and over 130 wildlife species. A caption in the bottom right corner reads: Do coho salmon share all their secrets of survival? Sometimes, when nature envelops us with wonder, and we are left with more curiosities than conclusions.",

            "audioDescription": "Era of Elegance Wayside. 3 minutes This three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel stands in a grassy area to the right of the Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort entrance. An old black and white photograph of a large four-story hotel and adjacent buildings fills the panel. The photo shows one side and the front of the building. The windows on the top floor are encased in dormers that protrude off the roof, five on the front of the building and two on the side. The third and second floors each have twelve windows flush to the building across the front and six windows on the side. The first floor is wrapped in a covered porch with large windows spanning each side. In the distance, in line with the hotel, are smaller buildings. In front of the hotel is a manicured lawn with a few bushes and trees. Text across the top reads: Era of Elegance. Excitement and bustle fill the air as passengers board a steamship on a misty Seattle morning in 1912. They cruise seventy-five miles to Port Crescent, shuttle twenty miles by auto stages, ferry across Lake Crescent on the steamboat Betty Earles, and travel the final fourteen miles via Stanley Steamers to celebrated Sol Duc Hot Springs Hotel. Michael Earles built the original hotel on this site between 1910 and 1912. He was convinced the hot mineral waters offered cures for rheumatism, liver diseases, alcoholism and other disorders. Rustic yet elegant, the 165-room hotel sported a large veranda encircling three sides. The nearby sanitorium featured a medical staff, operating room and sun parlor. As many as 10,000 guests each summer sipped mineral waters and soaked in hot baths. Horseback riding, tennis, croquet, bowling and dancing ensured a full agenda. After only four years of grandeur, sparks from a defective flue set the cedar roof afire. Within a few hours much of this magnificent resort had burned to the ground. On the left below the text are two old color advertisements for the Sol Duc. Each ad shows massive snow-covered mountains rising up behind the red roofed hotel with its large green front lawn where people are walking. A banner across the bottom of the ad on the left reads, Magnificent Hotel and Playground, and across the ad on the right, Baths and Sanitorium. Below the ads is a quote from Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound Company, circa 1912 that reads: The mail lobby, capacious and ornate, with massive columns running through the center greets the eye of the guest while near the front entrance is a great fireplace, lending an air of comfort and cheeriness.",

Each square is numbered and corresponds to a campsite. Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with a slot for dropping one of two registration payment receipts into an individual square. A brown lidded box holding campground registration envelopes is to the left of the board. Standing alone to the left is a 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing the envelope with payment. On the face of the cannister, at the top, is the slot for slipping in the envelope. A green and white sign attached to the left leg of the bulletin board frame reads, All pets must be on a leash. Clean up after your pet. Posted notices provide information about campground regulations, pet regulations, firewood, bear warnings, and wildlife, food, and your safety. A map of the Sol Duc area is also posted here. On the back side of the bulletin board is information about wilderness regulations, backcountry safety, bear awareness, cougars, and park preservation. Emergency information is provided. Contact a ranger or dial 911 in an emergency. Other notices include no fireworks, day hikes at Sol Duc, fee checklist, and fishing regulations. Behind the bulletin board and up a slight rise is a rectangular restroom building with entrance doors on each side. A dirt path leads to the women’s room on the left and a dirt path leads to the men’s room on the right.",

The view beyond the short, grassy cliff, is off the Appomattox River to the left, and the James River to the right and straight ahead. The rivers are wide and on the other side, the land is covered in trees with a few small buildings to see. There are two interpretive waysides next to each other, both waysides have a black band on top, with the National Park Service arrowhead in the top right corner. The text is all in black and the background of both panels is a light tan color. The panel on the left reads, “Resistance and Punishments. Prior to the Civil War, Dr. Eppes commanded his sales to not get drunk, steal, commit adultery, damage property, nor attack him, the overseers, or each other. The enslaved people resisted by stealing, feigning illness, breaking tools, and at least one slave fought an overseer. In an attempt to make his laborers follow the rules, Eppes commonly took away his slaves’ ability to leave the plantation or he decreased their food allotment. He and his overseers whipped those who resisted and had slaves whip each other as punishment for fighting or stealing from one another. Eppes sold a man named Bins in 1859 for his continued resistance. Though none of the slaves here tried to escape before the war, between May and August of 1862, 106 of Eppes’ 122 slaves escaped. Of the escaped slaves, at least four served in the Federal Navy during the war and at least two others served in United States Colored Troop regiments by war’s end.” On the left under the text is a photo of an enslaved person looking away from the camera, with multiple whipping scares on their back. Underneath the text in the middle is a quote in bold letters that states, “Patience and Dilsy received a few blows for laziness, by Richard Eppes on June 18, 1858”. The last photo on the right is a drawing of an enslaver whipping an enslaved woman who is tied with her hands up on a pole. The caption reads “From a slave narrative published in 1858”. The panel on the right is titled “Beyond the Big House”. “By 1860, Richard Eppes owned 2,300 acres divided into four farms on all sides of the confluence of these two rivers and held 113 people as slaves ranging in age from a few months old to 79 years old. He hired two men as overseers and one free black man before the Civil War. Enslaved field hands planted, tended, and harvested wheat, corn, and oats; they also fished, slaughtered livestock, picked fruit, and did other jobs that generated income for the Eppes family. Eppes’ skilled enslaved men worked as carpenters, blacksmiths, and sawyers. One enslaved woman was a weaver, and another was a midwife. The enslaved community worked on Eppes’ Bermuda Hundred farm (across the Appomattox River where the factory is), on Eppes’ Island to the east (across the James River), and south of here at the Appomattox and Hopewell farms. Only the island remains undeveloped today”. To the write of the text is a drawing of a map showing the different farms of the Eppes’ family as was described in the text. Beneath the text is a drawing of enslaved people stacking wheat and using ox to pull flat wagons. It is titled “Culpeper, VA, Stacking wheat by Edwin Forbes (LOC)”.",

Grant chose the Eppes family Appomattox Plantation at City Point for his headquarters and supply depot because of its strategic location. It provided easy water communication with Fort Monroe and Washington D.C. Supplies could be sent up the James River directly to City Point. From here the old City Point Railroad ran from the waterfront to the rear of the United States Army at Petersburg, allowing Grant to easily send reinforcements and supplies to the field.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "General Grant's cabin is a wooden cabin with the planks constructed together while placed vertically. It is shaped like a wide \"T\", with the front door on one side. This door is currently covered with plexiglass. There are windows on each side of the building with a fireplace in the back. The chimney is made of red bricks. The interpretive panel in the grass to the front states the following. \"From November 1864 through March 1865, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant lived in this modest cabin. From here he directed Union armies in the climactic final campaigns of the war and hosted some of the notable figures of the era: President and Mrs. Lincoln, Major General William T. Sherman, Secretary of State William Seward, and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. This was one of 22 cabins that stood on the Eppes property. After the war, Grant's cabin was moved to Philadelphia, where it remained on display for 116 years. In 1981, the National Park Service returned the cabin to City Point and reassembled it on its original site. About 10 percent of the structure is original. It is one of the few vestiges of the Union occupations of City Point.\" The background of the panel is tan, with a sepia photo of eight wooden cabins in a row leading up the Eppes family front door. It is captioned, \"Grant's cabin is at the left of this photograph. The cabin was built in November 1864 to replace the tents that had served as headquarters during warmer months\". To the right of the photo is another black and white photo of three men standing in front of the cabin dressed in uniform. It is captioned, \"Grant and some of his staff officers pose on the porch of the cabin. Grant is in the center\".",

            "bodyText": "Along the 184.5 miles of the canal are 74 lift locks. These locks were put into place to help boats overcome the 605-foot elevation change between Georgetown and Cumberland. The C&O Canal is like a staircase, canal boats traveled along the flat sections and used the locks to take a “step up or down” about eight feet. The locks typically had hand-operated miter gates that were simple and followed Leonardo da Vinci’s original 1485 design. Entering the lock was the most demanding part of canalling.  <br /> <br /> Lock 69, also known as Twigg’s Lock, was completed in late 1849 to early 1850. It is the 11th of the upper 13 locks that was constructed as a “composite lock”, or a lock made with more than one material. It is made of kyanized (treated) wood and uncut stone. However, the use of wood created many problems. The wood lining in many of these locks were replaced by concrete from 1891–1924. A stop gate was placed on the upstream end of the lock to keep water in the canal as part of the Battie Mixon fishing area. On the other side of the lock is a bypass flume that allowed water to bypass the lock to water the level below.<br /> <br /> The name of the lock comes from the family that used to serve as locktenders. No remnants of the lockhouse remain. <br /> <br /> Locks 69-71 are considered as the Oldtown Locks. This watered section of the canal is part of the Battie Mixon fishing area.",
            "audioDescription": "(387 words) Lock 69 is located in Oldtown, MD. To access it, go to the parking lot off of Green Spring Road SE. The parking lot is laid out as a circle, but the parking spots don’t start until about 100 feet in from the turn off from Green Spring Road. In the first row of parking spots, on the side closest to the parking entrance within the circle, is a park bulletin board. Just to the left, is a little dirt walkway with a slight incline that veers to the left. This little 20-foot path leads to a grassy area along a watered section of the canal. Once on flat surface, walk about 20 feet forward and the canal will be about 30 feet away from your right. About 50 feet straight ahead is Lock 70. There is a small, 15-foot wooden bridge that crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Once across the bridge, walk about 5 more feet to get to the gravel towpath. Turn left to head downstream. About 70 feet ahead are gates blocking vehicles from entering the towpath from Green Spring Road with enough space for pedestrians and cyclist to pass through. After walking past these, about 10 feet away is Green Spring Road. Once you cross the road, there will be another set of gates blocking vehicles from entering the towpath. Go straight through and head down about a quarter of a mile. On the left, about 5 feet from the towpath, is the lock, which runs parallel to the towpath. It is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. A wooden bridge crosses over the downstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge puts you in a 15-foot wide grassy area between the lock and a bypass flume. The bypass flume runs from a basin above the lock and discharges through a sloping wall. A stop gate was placed on the upstream end of the lock to keep water in the canal. No remnants of the lockhouse remain. End of description.",

            "bodyText": "In June of 1923, a group of public-spirited women met in the home of wealthy socialite Josephine Wheelwright Rust, a descendant of the Washington Family, to discuss plans to develop George Washington's birthplace for the anniversary of his 200th birthday in 1932. During this meeting, the Wakefield National Memorial Association (WNMA) was born and Rust became the group's president. As president, Rust's vision was to build from scratch a \"Memorial House\" at the place of Washington's birth and surround it with the appearances of an 18th century plantation environment. This romantic, but unrealistic vision would create a series of challenges to the entire development of the Historic Area and the Memorial House Museum.<br /> <br /> Rust initiated her plan by approaching Congress for funding to build the house. Congress agreed to the request and sent instructions to build a house as close as possible to the originial design. With no surviving images of Washington's birthhouse to use as inspiration, it is rumored that Rust decided to base the house on the architecture of local colonial structures that she had known growing up, including her childhood home, Twiford, still located in Westmoreland County today. Rust's \"Memorial House\" would not resemble the birthhouse of George Washington as it would be much larger and grander than the 1732 home. <br /> <br /> Rust was determined to place the Memorial House at the same location of the monument the War Department had placed in 1896. Although the monument stood on grounds that were reputedly the location of the birthhouse, there were many who doubted that it was the actual location. Moving the monument was also costly, and seemed to some to be a frivolous expense, considering the nation was in the midst of the Great Depression. Nonetheless, Rust perservered. The funds to move the monument arrived, and it was removed from its existing base, loaded on carts in pieces, and installed on a new base at the entrance to the park. <br /> <br /> With the arrival of the National Park Service (NPS), who arrived after the creation of George Washington Birthplace National Monument in January 1930, Rust found challenges with her ideas for not only the Memorial House, but the Colonial Revival Garden, and the buildings and layout of the Historic Area. <br /> <br /> Rust's plans for the Memorial House Museum went forward, and the house was completed in the summer of 1931, in time for the Bicentennial of Washington's birth. On June 26, 1931, Rust died, only four days after turning over the deed for the property to the National Park Service. A tribute service was held for her on February 11, 1932, in the Memorial House Museum with many WNMA members in attendance. On May 14, 1932, the Memorial House Museum was officially opened by the National Park Service. ",

The front door is in the center section and is flanked on each side by large windows. Above the door and windows, four evenly spaced thick logs jut straight out from the front wall each coming to rest atop a tall, square wooden vertical column anchored to the concrete patio in front of the building. The front cut of each log is adorned with a round, orange, metal face design, each having a different facial expression. Laid horizontally across the top of the logs are three horizontal timbers upon which sits a carved, wooden canoe painted in traditional black artistic designs. Attached to the front of the two center columns are tan colored animal designs carved from wood. On the right side of the patio is a red square wooden structure with a wide peaked roof that frames the Heritage Center sign attached in the center. The front edge of the roof is adorned with black half-moons. On the top horizonal framing board are the words, Strong People. The Heritage Center sign has a black background edged with two red lines. At the top, words in yellow read, Elwha Klallam. At the bottom, Heritage Center. In the center is a white, circular tribal seal outlined in black and red with three thick horizontal red lines on each side. The top lines have three half-moon designs, the second line, two half-moons, and the bottom line, one half-moon. Curving along the inside top of the seal are the words, Elwha Klallam Tribe, in black. In the center, a red, black, and white thunderbird design shows a bird with open wings, it’s head and large beak facing left, and yellow lightning bolts crisscrossed behind it. Below the bird on the left and the right facing each other are killer whales, designed in red, black and yellow. Along the bottom horizontal framing board is black text in the Elwha Klallam language.",

Filling the top of the panel is a map of the trail with the text, You Are Here, noted toward the bottom. Text below the map reads, Hurricane Hill Trail. The 1.6-mile trail to Hurricane Hill ascends gradually at first, then climbs more steeply through subalpine meadows. From the top there are views of the Olympic Mountains to the south and Vancouver Island, British Columbia to the north. Average hiking time to top is one and one-half hours. Elevation gain is 650 feet. Text continues: Window on the Wilderness. On this hike you can get a taste of Wilderness without packing deep into backcountry. No roads slice the interior. Except for the trail, there are few signs of human impact. To the left of the text is a black and white illustration of a robust black bear in profile facing right. Trees grow in the background. On the right side of the bulletin board are posted park notices and regulations. About 20 feet up trail, a two-foot-tall log post stands in the center of the trail. To its right is a sign on a taller post that reads: No pets, weapons, or vehicles.",

Text at the top of the panel reads: Ancient Lake Morse. Thousands of years ago, a great ice sheet from Canada flowed south through the Puget Sound and west through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The ice sheet abutted alpine glaciers flowing from the Olympic Mountains. As warming occurred, meltwater from mountain glaciers was dammed by the ice sheet, forming ancient Lake Morse. Continued warming caused the ice sheet to withdraw, draining the lake. Morse Creek now parallels the road. In ancient times it flowed over a ridge of soft sediments connecting Blue and Round Mountains. When glaciers dammed the creek, it was diverted to a new path between Round Mountain and the present road, cutting through hard lava rocks. The resulting gorge is visible as you drive down the road or from the short trail at the Tunnels parking area. Below the text are two side-by-side images that compare the ancient landscape to present time. On the left, a color drawing depicts a past landscape. In the foreground, a green hill with scattered tall, dark pine trees, slopes into the expansive blue waters of Ancient Lake Morse. The lake extends into the distance cutting between the peaks of Round Mountain on the left and Blue Mountain on the right. The image on the right is a black and white photograph of the present-day landscape. Where the lake once existed is now a deep winding gorge filled with dense pine forests. Without the lake, the full height of Round Mountain and Blue Mountain is exposed.",

            "audioDescription": "Hurricane Ridge Road Wayside Overlook. 4 minutes Along the front edge of the parking lot is a flat, gravel overlook area completely outlined by a six-inch-high concrete bumper. The landscape beyond the overlook begins with low tree covered hills and open areas with structures, then a wide expanse of water, with mountains in the distance on the opposite shore. On the left side of the gravel area are three wayside panels, each in a three-foot-tall, angled metal frame. The wayside on the extreme left is titled, Siege of Ice. Text reads: Only ice, sky, and a few jagged islands of rock – an ocean of ice filled the horizon. If there is valley fog, imagine it is ice, and you will have a picture of the continental glacier, grinding against the terrain. Glaciers were the prime architects of the scenery before you. But in this green landscape the only way to comprehend the extent of the ice is to examine the aftermath. A thousand feet above this spot the melting glacier dumped tons of rock and gravel debris. Only glaciers could have carved this valley’s steep walls. Filling the left side of the panel, a black and white drawing shows dark finger-like edges of mountains in a white landscape. A smaller image beneath the text shows three large rocks on white ground with a dark hill in the background. The caption reads: House-sized boulders lie scattered around the park, their crystals foreign to Olympic rock. Moving to the right, the next wayside is titled, Oh say can you see? Filling the top of this wide panel is an illustration of the landscape before you with various points of interest labeled and the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the center. From left to right, Victoria, Canada, Mt. Douglas, Haro Strait, Discovery Island, San Juan Islands, American Camp, San Juan Island National Historic Park, Bellingham Washington, Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge, Mt. Baker 10,778 feet, Sequim, Washington, Protection Island, North Cascades National Park, Puget Sound, and Glacier Peak. Text below reads: In clear weather you can see Canada and the volcanic peaks of the Cascade Mountains. Visibility here is becoming increasingly impaired, however, by pollutants from sources including industry, wood stoves, and the automobiles we drive. A quote by Thoreau reads: Simply to see a distant horizon through clean air is wealth enough for one afternoon. The final wayside on the right is titled, Rainshadow. Text reads: Farmland to the northeast must be irrigated. Less than 20 inches of rain falls there annually. Behind you only 40 miles to the west grows a dense rainforest, a dripping jungle of ferns and giant spruce in a Jack-in-the-beanstalk environment nurtured by 140 to 180 inches of rainfall per year. Mountains cast the shadow. Saturated Pacific winds rise steeply up the coastal slopes. As sudden altitude cools and condenses the air, most of the moisture is wrung out over the peaks by the time clouds reach this corner of the peninsula. Filling the left side of the panel is a drawing of a snow-capped mountain with clouds overhead, one cloud dropping lines of blue rain on the left side of the mountain. A white arrow in the rain points up slope. A smaller image to the right captioned, Rain forest, shows tree branches covered with draping moss.",

            "audioDescription": "(301 words)<br />The US Navy Memorial is located on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue, NW between 7th street to the east and 9th street to the west, midway between the White House and Capitol Building. The National Archives is directly across Pennsylvania Avenue to the south.<br />A one hundred-foot diameter circular plaza is surrounded by six flagpoles, lined with triangular-shaped fountains at its southern corners, and features a black and white granite map of the world in its center. The plaza slopes slightly from its southern end to the north. Set in the north center of the plaza is a seven-foot tall bronze statue of a sailor in a cap and his hands tucked in the pockets of his jacket. His collar is raised, and his packed duffel bag stands to his left.<br />Two eight-story curved buildings each fronted with thirteen columns sit at the top two sides of the plaza, their curved facades following that of the round plaza. The east-side building houses the Navy Visitor Center in its ground floor.<br />Stairs lead down into the plaza from its north end and granite benches curve around the northeast and northwest sides of the plaza. <br />The southern half of the plaza features twenty-six thirty-two-inch by thirty-six-inch bronze bas-reliefs panels set along the outer side of curved walls lining the southeast and southwest sides of the plaza. Each depicts an important person or event in naval history.<br />Granite benches line the south side of the plaza with inscriptions.<br />Inside the memorial at the bottom of the south entry steps, a bronze compass is set in the granite walkway approaching the memorial. In its center is an eagle standing on an anchor that sits behind it.<br />Inscribed on the outer walls of the memorial at its southern entrance is written:<br />\"UNITED STATES NAVY MEMORIAL\"<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Follow a droplet of water. Standing here you can view most of its route. Restless. Hitchhiking a ride on Pacific breezes, moisture blows inland. Fog breathes through the forest turning trees dark green. Drifting upslope, the drop cools and condenses, freezes, and floats down on white peaks. From the highlands melting snow tumbles down this steep-walled canyon and join other torrents to form a stream on its way to the sea. Saltwater surrounds three sides of the Olympic Peninsula. Viewed from the air the glaciated mountains are the heart; streams and rivers are veins and arteries. Water flows so steadily here that people once thought the source must be a great lake in the unexplored center of the mountains. On the left side of the panel is a black and white drawing of two mountains with white snow fields. At the V-shaped base of the mountains, a white line represents a stream. High on the left, an arrow extends upward from a snowy slope, pointing to a white cloud in the sky. On the right, a second arrow next to a snow field points downslope, and a third arrow above the stream, points downward, indicating the streams direction of flow. Below the text, a black and white drawing shows a low, front view perspective of a winding forest stream, swollen with water, tumbling over rocks and boulders. Trees line the stream banks, and one fallen tree spans the stream like a bridge.",

The rocks across the road are volcanic, but there are no volcanoes in the Olympics. Eons ago, underwater eruptions occurred in the Pacific Ocean forming pillow basalts. The rocks across the valley formed from sediments shed onto the ocean floor. Both kinds of rock were rafted towards North America by ocean floor movement, then uplifted and tilted by powerful forces. Below the text is a horizontal diagram showing a geological cross section of the Pacific Ocean on the left and the Olympic Mountains on the right. Two-thirds of the diagram is the Pacific Ocean, its blue water atop a layer of wavy black horizonal lines labeled Sediments, then a layer of black dots labeled New Ocean Floor. Below these layers is a white unlabeled area. At far left, a section of the New Ocean Floor layer is split by a fault line, each side pushed up through the sediment layer. In the center of the diagram, in the sediments layer, is a brown triangle-shaped underwater volcano, its pointed peak rising into the ocean. On the bottom of the volcano, a long, thin magma tube extends downward, deep into the earth. The last one-third of the diagram on the right shows the Olympic Mountains. Where the mountains begin, the ocean and sediment layers end while the New Ocean Floor layer dips under the mountains. On the face of the mountains are several brown areas of Basalts, dense vertical columns of stacked pillow-shaped rocks. The largest area spans from the tallest peaks to the base of the mountains where a text label reads, North America. To the right of the basalts on the mountain’s down slope is an area of horizontal wavy lines labeled Ocean Sediments.",

The arrowhead is brown with etched words and images. On the right side are the words, National Park Service, in white letters. To the left, in green, a tall tree towers above smaller trees and the ground below and a section of lake in white. Behind the tree, a white outline of snowcapped mountains.

            "bodyText": "<p>Another historic improvement to the 1871 trail was the construction of the Alahaka Ramp, the massive stone ramp that connects the trail to Kiʻilae Village. Historical accounts collected over the years indicate that access to Kiʻilae, prior to the construction of the ramp, was via a ladder or rope. So, it was pretty dangerous!<br /> <br /> There is no clear indication as to when the original ramp was built, but it most likely occurred sometime in the mid-1800s when a series of large-scale government programs were initiated to improve to public resources, such as roadways. However, the first version of the ramp would definitely not have held up to our modern-day safety standards. Local <em>paniolo</em> (Hawaiian cowboys) described the original ramp as the “one-foot-out trail,” as they would ride up and down the ramp with one foot out of the stirrup just in case they had to make a hasty escape due to the poor condition of the ramp.<br /> <br /> Due to this dangerous part of the commute to Kiʻilae village, improvements were made in 1868 to widen and stabilize the ramp. In a letter to the Hawaiian Kingdom Minister of the Interior dated Feb. 4, 1868 George Hardy, the road supervisor at the time, said: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"<i>In South Kona, I have repaired [a very] bad place known by the name of Alahaka in the village of Ki'ilae, a place of great danger where several horses had been kill'd: and where people were [sic] in danger of going up and down. I have made it wide and a substantial road</i>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately later that year, in 1868 there was a particularly destructive eruption event from Mauna Loa that caused multiple massive earthquakes (7-7.9) which in turn caused tsunamis and landslides across the island. During this event, the ramp may have been damaged and by the late 1890’s the Alahaka Ramp had fallen into a state of disrepair. In a letter dated December 31, 1897 road supervisor T. H. Wright wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"<i>Napo’opo’o to Ho’okena beach road in a fearful condition, it needs repair of the worst kind. The Walahaka [Alahaka] pali (cliff) is very dangerous. This road is used every day for the convenience of the public, going and back to these places</i>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the years, repairs were made, but in 1951, a large earthquake caused an upper section of the ramp to slough off and that continued to deteriorate. So, when the National Park Service came in, about twelve years later, the ramp was once again in a state of disrepair. This prompted a major stabilization project to restore and strengthen the Alahaka Ramp. Stabilization efforts consisted of removing the earthquake-damaged sections, clearing away boulders, and rebuilding the entire <em>makai</em> (ocean-facing) side.<br /> <br /> Given its proximity to the ocean and the cliffside, even today the Alahaka Ramp requires periodic maintenance and stabilization as a result of high surf, storm, and earthquakes. During the most recent effort, which occurred in 2010, NPS crews repaired a damaged portion of the outer face and stabilized the ramp buttress and trail trea This, of course, was no easy feat, as the work was located right along the steep ocean cliffside.<br /> <br /> As the years go on, and climate change causes increased storm intensity and sea level rise, these coastal trails will require a sustained joint effort to continue to preserve these pieces of history and the stories they contain. <i>What is something or someplace that means a lot to you that is threatened by climate change?</i> <i>What efforts do you hope are taken to preserve it?</i></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>One of the more unique features at Thomas Stone’s plantation of Haberdeventure is the curved five-part house. While parts of the house are original to Thomas Stone’s lifetime, fire damage, renovation, and modernization have changed the structure.</p> <p>Thomas Stone purchased the 442-acre property from his uncle, Daniel Jenifer, on December 13, 1770. Construction of the house's brick Central Block began in the spring of 1771. The following year, Thomas and his family likely took up residence even though the work was incomplete.</p> <p>The Central Block’s first floor comprises the Center Passage along with the East and West Rooms. The second floor had two large rooms that would have served as bed chambers.</p> <h4>Center Passage</h4> <p>Upon entering the Center Passage, guests could see a large and attractive stairway, expensive portraits, and decorative rooms to the left and right, which provided clues to the wealth and status of the Stones. With doors at each end, this breezeway may have been one of the house's most comfortable rooms during the spring, summer, and fall.</p> <h4>West Room</h4> <p>The West Room is believed to be the Master Bedchamber. Ornate first floor bedchambers in colonial era homes often served the dual purposes of being daytime or informal parlors. In the case of Margaret Stone, who developed a debilitating case of arthritis that often turned her into an invalid, she likely did not receive many guests but could converse with her family on her better days.</p> <p>While there is no supporting evidence, the lifestyles of slave owning gentry of the time suggests that an enslaved African American may have slept either on the floor of the West Room or in the adjacent Center Passage, to be readily available to care for the family's needs both night and day.</p> <h4>East Room</h4> <p>It is evident this room was used for entertaining. Contrary to modern and romanticized visions of colonial era homes, most were not elegant and pristine. Few colonial homes had rooms as beautiful as Thomas Stone's East Room. The expensive furnishing and window coverings and the well crafted woodwork were designed to impress guests, and even though this woodwork is a reconstruction of the original it still shows the detail that was put into the work.</p> <p>Aside from its beauty, the East Room may have served a more important function. With only one doorway, the room could provide privacy for Thomas Stone as he performed his legal and political duties along with directing county defense activities during the American Revolution. In Maryland’s heavily class-based society, the elegance of the East Room emphasized the importance, power, and success of Thomas Stone and justified his role as a leading figure in the community.</p> <h4>Second Floor</h4> <p>The purpose of the second floor was to serve as bed chambers, not just for Thomas and Margaret Stone’s three children. Upon Thomas's father's and eldest brother's deaths in 1773, Thomas permitted some of his younger brothers and sisters to live in the home. Also, as a host to law clients, political allies, several siblings and their families, distant relations, and countless friends, Stone was expected to provide places for everyone to sleep. </p> <p>Crowded homes were quite common in the colonial era. Rooms were hot and stuffy in the summer and drafty and cold in the winter. Privacy by modern standards barely existed. Even George Washington referred to his mansion of Mount Vernon as a “well-restored tavern.”</p> <h4>West Hyphen</h4> <p>The adjoining West Hyphen was built during Thomas Stone’s ownership to connect to the West Wing, which served as a kitchen for the Stones. This Hyphen may have served as a multi-use space with easily moved furnishings to allow dining, indoor chores and crafts, entertaining, and possibly to serve as a guest chamber.</p> <h4>West Wing</h4> <p>The original West Wing kitchen space is believed to have been a small and relatively unadorned structure designed for the function of cooking, cleaning, and other household chores by enslaved workers. The current West Wing, which partially rests upon the original foundations, dates from the mid-1840s. There are two rooms on the first floor and a steep stairway that leads to two more rooms above. In 1846, William Briscoe Stone remarked in a letter to his daughter Mary that the West Wing was, “…much enlarged improved & amended. I am certain you will be surprised and pleased with the change.\"<br /> <br /> During the 20th-century, the residents redesigned the West Hyphen to create a connective hallway between the second floor of the Central Block and the West Wing. This modernization was removed by the National Park Service to help return the mansion to a more historical design.</p> <h4>East Hyphen</h4> <p>The East Hyphen was a unique space. Its primary function was to serve as a protective cover for the full cellar that existed beneath the Central Block. It is not connected in the same way as the West Hyphen is connected. In order to gain access to the space, one would have to go outside the house and enter from the outside. </p> <h4>East Wing</h4> <p>Architectural historians believe that the East Wing is the oldest part of the house. It was likely a wholly separate and independent structure moved from some other location on the plantation to serve as the East Wing. Like the East Hyphen, there was no internal connection from the Central Block to the East Wing. One had to exit the mansion, walk across the lawn, and then enter the East Wing. </p>",

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "At the base of a towering cliff, and just above and alongside the trail, several steps lead up to a rustic stone resthouse. The building is about 20 feet long and 10 feet wide and all four sides are open to the air. The roof is supported by stone masonry pillars in each corner. Inside, and shaded from the sun, are several stone benches. Just below the building, and slightly down trail, a water bottle filling station is in operation during spring, summer and fall. Continuing down trail a path ascends stone steps up a hill to a composting toilet. From 1 1/2 Mile Resthouse the view of Grand Canyon is dominated by steep slopes and shear cliffs. The canyon walls of alternating red, white, and yellow rise a thousand feet about you, while the stair stepped cliffs and slopes of red rock drop away below you to a distant green plateau of rock and plants some 2,000 feet below you. In the center of the plateau a small pocket of dark green trees marks Indian Garden, a campground and day use area within the canyon. A distance white trail cuts across the plateau from the trees to point above a steep walled canyon of black rock at the very bottom of Grand Canyon. Across the inner gorge peaks and valleys of carved layered rock rise up to North Rim of Grand Canyon.",

After the cattle were removed, this ordinarily tame non-native garden plant spread wildly throughout Kīpukapuaulu, creating dense, plant-choking mats. These mats prevented native plant seedlings from becoming established—a problem that persists even today if left unattended. In the 1980s, a summer youth group, working alongside park staff, laboriously hand-pulled every nasturtium plant at this site. Once these overlying mats were uprooted, the dormant seeds of the endemic (found only in Hawaiʻi) koa (<em>Acacia koa</em>) trees germinated and grew rapidly in the deep soil of Kīpukapuaulu. Now that the nasturtium is being controlled, the koa, along with many other native species are prospering. In 100 years, many of these young koa trees will become the new forest elders, growing up to 75–100 feet (23–30 m) tall and 3–5 feet (1–1.5 m) in diameter—ready to nurture the forest life below them.",

To encourage restoration, today’s resource specialists, like those that preceded them, continue to remove the invasive blackberry and grasses that litter the forest. This has allowed the native plants to recover naturally. Where native trees didn’t recover, even after repeated weed-removal efforts, fast-growing native trees and shrubs were planted. Once these faster growing plants matured and created shade, other shadetolerant native understory species were planted below them.

This large-leaved, relatively small tree has long, curved flowers that suggest pollination by a curve-billed Hawaiian honeycreeper. In 1911, Joseph Rock was shown a single, cattle-ravaged hau kuahiwi plant on the edge of Kīpukapuaulu. He described it as a new species and commented that “it is unique among all Hawaiian plants, and the author is sorry to relate that nothing has been done to protect it.” Sadly, that lone tree died in the summer of 1930, but not before seeds were collected and propagated by volcano resident W.M. Giffard (for which this plant was named). Early records revealed that Giffard’s efforts successfully yielded at least one surviving tree, whose offspring were later replanted here between 1951–1964. By 2001, after continued propogation efforts, researchers were able to reintroduce more than 200 trees to both Kīpukapuaulu and Kīpuka Kī. These reintroduction projects continue today as part of an effort to stablilize many of the park’s rare plant species. Through combined efforts, many of these trees have survived and some have even set fruit—a recent recovery to be celebrated. In the last 10 years, over 1,000 individuals of 10 other rare plant species have been planted in Kīpukapuaulu. Although some of these species haven’t yet produced seedlings, many are thriving.<br /> <br /> Some species continue to struggle for survival—challenges that resource specialists hope to solve by continuing to care for this– kuʻu ʻāina waokele pūlama–treasured island of forest. From the time of the ancient native Hawaiian practitioner, who believed this to be the home of their akua and ‘aumakua, to nearly a century of botanists and foresters, Kīpukapuaulu has captivated its visitors with its biological wonders, beauty, and tranquility. As Charles Kraebel, Assistant Superintendent of Forestry for the Territory of Hawai‘i, said in 1922, “There is always some otherwhere whose charms seem not to have been sufficiently heralded. Such a spot is the Kipuka Puaulu. . . .”<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<h4>This revered kīpuka was nearly destroyed by grazing animals.</h4> Much of Kīpukapuaulu has been spared from the continual eruptions of Mauna Loa and Kīlauea volcanoes, allowing native plants, birds, and insects to flourish. But in the late 1700s, well before the establishment of the park in 1916, this paradise was nearly lost, when cattle and feral goats were set loose in Hawaiʻi. Having evolved without grazers and lacking the defenses to repel them, many native Hawaiian plants were consumed like ice cream. In Kīpukapuaulu, and much of the surrounding forest, cattle and goats ate everything within their reach, and diversity severely declined. Only tall trees survived their grazing, and alien pasture grasses thrived. Joseph Rock, a self-taught botany professor, was the first plant explorer to reveal the fragile biodiversity of Kīpukapuaulu in his 1913 book, The Indigenous Trees of the Hawaiian Islands. He documented many rare native trees, like the indigenous mānele, or soapberry (<em>Sapindus saponaria</em>), struggling to survive in a sterile, citypark-like landscape. In addition to his work, he also undertook the first replanting of rare species, such as the hau kuahiwi, Hibiscadelphus giffardianus, and saved it from extinction.<br /> <br /> At that time, Kīpukapuaulu was a forest without a future. This “hot spot” of biodiversity was slowly dying. Its once thriving grandparent trees were struggling for survival, with no grandchildren— seedlings or saplings—to succeed them. To protect this precious kīpuka and what was left of its native plants, cattle were removed in 1928. Goats and pigs were later fenced out in 1968. Since then, Kīpukapuaulu has lost its artificially groomed garden-like appearance but has regained its future as a thriving, self-sustaining, species-rich forest. The tall, old mānele trees nearby and throughout the rest of this kīpuka now tower above the forest’s rich understory plants. Compare today’s understory to that in the 1913 photo above. What a tremendous difference! Today’s understory is densely packed with not only mānele trees, but also pāpala kēpau (<em>Pisonia brunoniana</em>), ʻolopua (<em>Nestegis sandwicensis</em>), and other native trees.<br /> <br />  ",

This exhibit features a photograph of the brown trunk, a very large trunk of a mature giant sequoia tree. Other mature firs trees are seen in the background, and a cluster of small fir seedlings are in the photo’s foreground. The photo’s caption reads, “White fir seedlings grow thickly around the base of this mature sequoia.” The exhibit text reads, “Where sequoias grow, white firs can usually be found nearby. These two tree species compete for space and sunlight on the forest floor. Both trees begin as seeds that are dropped on the forest floor from cones high above. Once the seeds sprout, their roots must reach bare soil to get nourishment to survive. White firs have larger seeds that provide energy to grow longer roots. Tiny sequoia seeds sprout shorter roots that often die before reaching nutrients and water. Without the frequent fires that are natural to sequoia groves, white firs would take over. When fire moves through the forest, sequoias gain the advantage. Fire clears away dead leaves and exposes bare mineral soil. Heat triggers sequoia cones to release their seeds, resulting in masses of seedlings when conditions are right for them to survive. Thick bark protects older sequoias from fire. To the right of the giant sequoia photograph is a smaller photo of a small, brown-tinged sequoia seedling and a sequoia cone, found atop incense cedar twigs and plant material on the forest floor. The photo’s caption reads, “A Warming Forest“, “In this sequoia grove, winter’s storms build a deep snowpack that melts continuously through spring. If the forest becomes warmer, more precipitation will fall as rain, not snow. The snowy season would shorten, resulting in drier summers. Sequoias may struggle to reproduce in these conditions. If temperatures climb, the youngest trees may disappear, threatening the future of the grove.”",

Think about how your family’s story has helped make you who you are today. <br /> <br /> <em>A story about Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa unfolds along the Pānau coast of Kīlauea volcano. Oral tradition says that a pregnant woman went into the ocean and had a miscarriage while she was in the water. When she later returned to the ocean, a shark came up under her, and turned out to be her miscarried child transformed; it had become a manō (shark). The child is named Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa (the little-brown shark of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/historyculture/puuloa.htm\">Puʻuloa</a>), also referred to as Kaʻehuiki. The child’s mother, Hōlei, and father, Kapukapu, named their son after the great shark deity Kaʻahupāhau (cloak that is well cared for) from Keawalauopuʻuloa; currently known as Pearl Harbor in Oʻahu. Their child resembled Kaʻahupāhau because he was ʻehu, or reddish-tinged, like her hair.<br /> <br /> Kaʻehuiki was nourished on ʻawa by his father and diluted with the milk of his mother for 10 days when he was put in a sea cave. When his parents decided to go to the uplands, Kaʻehuiki had to care for himself and became a shark ʻaumakua (deified family guardian).<br /> <br /> One night, Kaʻehuiki appeared in his father’s dream and asked his permission to travel around the coast of Hawaiʻi to pay homage to all the district sharks. His intent was to meet the oldest brother of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/pele.htm\">Pele</a>, Kamohoaliʻi - the king of all sharks. He hoped Kamohoaliʻi would adopt him into the family. His father picked ʻawa roots, coconut, red-fish, and fowl and continued to chant as he went to the sea cave. A little brown shark, Kaʻehuiki, swam in the cave as his father began to consecrate the shark in chant for a long and successful journey.<br /> <br /> In the fourth month, Kaʻehuiki first traveled to Hilo and met the great shark, Kepanila. Later he met Kaneilehia of Kaʻū. He continued to befriend the other district sharks of the island of Hawaiʻi and asked them to become his traveling companions on his journey: Kua of Kona, Manokini of Kohala, and Kapulena of Hāmākua<br /> <br /> The shark of Kohala, Manokini, described to Kaʻehuiki the difficulty of traveling across the rough ʻAlenuihāhā channel to the island of Maui, and the ferocious shark, Kauhuhu of Maui, that governed it. Upon their arrival to Maui, Kauhuhu called out to them for being in his cave. He extended and opened his large jaws to bite Kaʻehuiki. Kaʻehuiki swiftly entered his wide mouth and devoured his vitals from the inside; leaving Kauhuhu lifeless as he floated in the tides.<br /> <br /> Finally, the voyage led to the island of Kahoʻolawe, where they could pay homage to Kamohoaliʻi-- the “king of all sharks”. He was overgrown with sea moss and barnacles - his mana emanated from him. Kamohoaliʻi consented to adopt the little-brown shark and an elaborate ceremony took place. He gave Kaʻehuiki the ability to take a hundred diﬀerent forms, immeasurable mana, and a long life.<br /> <br /> The journey of Kaʻehuiki continued all the way to the distant lands of Kahiki, however, today he lives within the sea caves of Pānau. Oral history tells us that Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa is an ʻaumakua (who is part of the Pele family), a form of the great Kamohoaliʻi, and a shark who invokes the power of Kaʻahupāhau. Puʻuloa, now within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, is seen as the place of the birth of Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa. It is where many Hawaiians connect the piko (umbilical stump) of their child to his birthing place. It is a way to obtain a long life, and life-prolonging protection from an ʻaumakua of this land.</em></p>",

Families came here to place the piko (umbilical stump) of their child in a pecked depression they made. The hope is that the mana (spiritual guiding energy) of Puʻuloa blesses the child with a long and prosperous life. It is a connection to their ancestral lands.   <br /> <br /> Piko is also another word for the navel in Hawaiian- it is where life begins. There are conceptually three piko: piko po’o, piko waena, and piko na’au. Piko po'o is at the top of a person's head. It is the opening that connects the individual's spirit with their 'aumakua (departed, but ever-present deified ancestors). Piko waena, or the navel, represents the person’s connection to his/her parents. This piko covers the na'au (gut) and holds an individual’s knowledge, wisdom, and emotions. Piko ma'i is the genitalia, which links the person to his/her descendants.   <br /> <br /> Each poho (cupule) houses a single child’s piko. Over 16,000 are piko-related carvings – a testament to the importance of both Puʻuloa and ʻohana (family).

The text accompanying the map reads, “Hazelwood Nature Loop”, “From this trail junction, you can follow the Hazelwood Nature Loop. You can also take the Alta Trail to the Big Trees Trail and Giant Forest Museum.” “The loop portion of the Hazelwood Nature Trail is 0.5 miles (0.8 km) and is relatively flat. The path is firmly packed and has benches and pullouts. The trail is designated as accessible for people in wheelchairs and is also suitable for families with small children.” “The path toward the Big Trees Trail is slightly steeper. Once you reach the highway, the crosswalk leads to the trailhead. This 0.8 mile (1.3 km) loop circles a large meadow among mature sequoias. It is also accessible to people in wheelchairs. A small parking area at the trailhead is available to people with accessibility placards.” The following text related to accessibility in also included on the sign: “Length of loop: 0.7 miles (1.1 km) from this point. Elevation gain: 50 feet (15 m). Trail surface: Firm-packed. Trail grade: Average 6.5%, Maximum 10%. Maximum cross slope: Less than 2%. Clear tread width: 6 feet” Below the map, additional text reads as follows: “Protect Yourself All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Carry a map and know how to use it. Watch for uneven or slippery footing. Be cautious around steep drop-offs and wet or icy areas. Don't walk on cones or other forest litter that may roll or slide underfoot. Be aware of what’s around you and overhead. Trees and limbs can fall without warning. Be careful when crossing roads.

Do you see a snow-covered clearing? A wet and soggy brown field? Or a meadow knee-deep in flowers and tall grasses? In winter, deep snow blankets this landscape. As spring nears, snowmelt nourishes newly-emerging plants. By summer, grasses and flowers overtake the meadow, towering over the boggy ground. As the plants die back in fall, they decompose and provide nutrients for the next generation of vegetation. Meadows provide critical habitat for amphibians and birds. They offer a cool, shady resting place for mammals, including deer and black bears. Their flowers sustain native bee species and other insects.”",

            "bodyText": "The forested hill to the left of Maunaulu is Pu‘uhuluhulu (shaggy hill), a volcanic cone that predates the new lava shield by over 500 years. Pu‘uhuluhulu is a pile of cinder, spatter, and ash that rained down from high, gascharged fountains. With no flows to carry away the ejecta, each fountain added to its height. Pu‘uhuluhulu stood nearly 300 feet (91 m) above the surrounding land when the eruption first began. By the time the eruption ended, this cone was dwarfed by its new neighbor, Maunaulu. If Maunaulu lava shield continued to erupt and grow, it may have completely surrounded and buried the older Pu‘uhuluhulu cone.<br /> <br /> The crater inside this old cone protects rare native plants. Feral pigs ravage the nearby forests but can’t get into this crater, due to its steep inner walls. Treasures like ʻōhā—rare outside the crater—find sanctuary within its protective walls. Since the Maunaulu eruption, Puʻuhuluhulu has become an important source of life for new plants to become established on the fresh lava.<br /> <br /> Pelehonuamea, a Hawaiian volcanic diety, is a force of both destruction and creation of the land. However it is the great Lono (god of vitality) and her sister Hiʻiakaikapoliopele (Hiʻiaka in the bosom of Pele) who bring new life to the barren flows.<br />  ",

After that, fur traders traveled both ways to trap, trade and attend rendezvous. <br /> <br /> Once wagons traversed the trail, the reasons to travel along it multiplied with vast numbers of people moving west looking for land, riches and religious freedom. The number of people who turned around is unknown. <br /> <br /> Motives for returning to their starting points varied with the people. Some \"saw the elephant\" and quit in the midst of their westbound journey. Hardships, deaths and the realization that this was not what they wanted were all reasons to become a \"go-backer\" or turnaround. Other people made it to their destination and found it was not for them. Some returned for good and others came back only long enough to bring other family members to the west.<br /> <br /> Traders drove massive freight wagons both ways on the trail. Army units also rode the trail east and west as they watched for problems along the route. The short-lived Pony Express galloped each direction as they carried mail between St. Joseph, Missouri and San Francisco, California.<br /> <br /> With traffic running two ways through such a narrow pass, how do you think they avoided having traffic jams?<br /> <br /> <strong>Image: </strong>A watercolor painting of a large group of men on horses.

            "bodyText": "<strong>Puʻuʻōʻō</strong><br /> <br /> In the distance, you may be able to spot Pu‘uʻō‘ō, a cone that formed in the early years of the current eruption. It has experienced several collapses and has slowly buried itself beneath a lava shield of its own making. In 1983, the Puʻuʻōʻō eruption began seven miles farther out on the East Rift Zone and soon surpassed Maunaulu in many ways. Yet Maunaulu still holds a special place in the memories of those who witnessed the spectacular events.<br /> <br /> <strong>Kāne nui o Hamo</strong><br /> <br /> The tree-covered summit of Kāne nui o Hamo lava shield can be seen infront of Puʻuʻōʻō. Kāne nui o Hamo is pitted by a forested crater - Makaopuhi, the largest pit crater on Kīlauea. Lava erupted within—or cascaded into—Makaopuhi crater several times but filled only the deeper half of the giant pit. It was named “eye of the eel” for a lens of bluish lava that appeared on the lower crater wall.<br /> <br /> <strong>ʻAlae </strong><br /> <br /> Prior to this eruption, ʻAlae crater was 0.25 mile (0.5 km) wide and over 425 feet (130 m) deep. During the night of August 4, 1969, lava filled it nearly to its rim. Four hours later, hundreds of earthquakes shook violently, a fissure opened across the crater floor, and most of the liquid lava in the crater drained away. In 30 extraordinary minutes, the lake level dropped as 13 million yards (10 million m3) of lava drained underground to emerge three miles (4.8 km) downrift in Nāpau crater. A day later, one of the most memorable spectacles of the eruption occurred when a huge lava falls cascaded into ʻAlae crater. These falls were wider and higher than the American Falls at Niagara. They soon refilled the crater. By 1974 the eruption had built its third great lava shield, rising 295 feet (90 m) above the rim of the entombed crater. Today it sits just left of where Maunaulu rises today. <p> </p>",

The upper right hand side of the panel features a map of the Oregon/California Trail routes near Scotts Bluff. The lower right hand side features an image of a gentle pass in the prairie known as Robidoux Pass.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: Choices<br /> <br /> <strong>Text</strong>: What route would you take? Wagon trains that arrived at Scotts Bluff had a choice to make. Although they wanted to stay close to the North Platte River, the bluffs were in the way. Traveling through the badlands next to the river was impossible for wagons. Before 1851 the ravines on the west side of the bluffs prevented wagons from going though the notch ahead of you. They could cross the river to the north side. That meant braving the water current and quicksand. Or they could take Robidoux Pass to the south and make a long detour.<br /> <br /> Robidoux Pass received its name from two brothers who built a trading post on the trail. A nearby spring of good water; a blacksmith available for repairs and the chance to buy or trade for needed items helped make this a decent route to travel. <br /> <br /> In 1850 soldiers from Fort Laramie or traders in competition with Robidoux created a one-wagon wide trail through the ravines. The new route brought them back to the river eight miles before the old one. Emigrants started to take advantage of the shorter route back to the river in the 1851 travel season. <br /> <br /> Visit Robidoux Pass and see if you think it would be a better route. <br /> <br /> <strong>Quote:</strong> From the 1851 diary of William C. Lobenstine<br /> \"We approached Scotch Bluffs ...The rock itself is separated nearly at its middle, having a pass here about fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three hundred to four hundred feet. The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all the emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\" <br /> <br /> <strong>Image: </strong>Trade goods pictured include five metal rings, two rowels (the circular spikes that are part of a boot spur), beaded necklaces, and four metal dangles. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> The covered wagon trade lasted for only one and a half months each year.

            "audioDescription": "This outdoor exhibit panel is titled, \"When Sequoias Fall\" and features two photos and an illustration, and includes a caption and text about giant sequoias and thimbleberries. The main photo features an uprooted and overturned sequoia, which rests on its side. The butt end of the log is full of crevices that harbor mosses. In the background are immature fir trees. The text reads, “Giant sequoias have an exceptionally long life but will eventually fall. Wet soil of mountain meadows provides little support for tree roots. The logs of sequoias and other trees are a common sight around the edges of meadows. Sequoias are especially vulnerable because of their shallow root system. When a tree falls, it creates a new opening that spans the tree canopy to the forest floor. Sunlight fills this space, enriching surrounding trees with extra sunlight. A clear and sunny location offers space for understory plants to grow. Eventually, new trees will reach upward here, filling in the opening.” To the right of the main photo is a photo of a green thimbleberry plant with white blossoms. Next to it is a close-up illustration of thimbleberry leaves and a red fruit that resembles a raspberry. The photo caption reads, “Thimbleberries” , “When space opens up in a sequoia grove, thimbleberries are ready to grow. Their durable seeds last for years underground. When a tree falls, the new patch of sunlight stimulates sprouting. Under the upturned tree roots, exposed bare soil creates an ideal seedbed.”",

Formed within the body of pāhoehoe lava flows are lava tubes—volcanic caves that were once filled with molten lava. This lava tube is at least 8,600 years old. While active, it once transported lava over great distances, from its eruptive source to its most distal reaches. Skylights are holes in a lava tubes roof where the ceiling has collapsed, leaving an opening like the one we see here. This lava tube was formed during one of Mauna Loa’s many eruptions. Unlike the Nāhuku lava tube, which can be found along the Crater Rim Drive, entry into this lava tube is discouraged, as it is a safe haven for unique plant and animal species and very delicate geological features. It was in this lava tube, in 1971, that the first cave-adapted animal species in Hawai‘i, was discovered. One such species unique to these dark and often damp lava tubes includes the smalleyed, big-eyed hunting spider (<em>Lycosa howarthi</em>). This endemic spider, along with other insects like the millipedes (<em>Nannolene</em>) and the lava tree crickets (<em>Thaumathgryllus cavicola</em>), continue to call this fragile lava tube home.",

They are found on the main Hawaiian islands, from shoreline to alpine treeline. During their lifetimes, ʻōhiʻa lehua trees provide food to animal species, like the nectarfeeding native birds. They also become nurse logs after dying and nurture new plant growth. After succumbing to natural dieback, these ancient trees fall to the ground, crushing many of the smaller trees and understory plants beneath them. This process, however, allows additional light to enter all the layers of the forest. The influx of light creates an opportunity for young ʻōhiʻa lehua seedlings, which have taken root on nurse logs, to flourish. These young seedlings can grow, fill the gap in the canopy, and become the next forest giants. Fortunately, for these slow-growing trees, their resilient seedlings can persist for many years on nurse logs, ready to take advantage of a new light gap in the forest’s canopy.<br /> <br /> What do you think are the chances that these slow-growing, light-hungry ʻōhiʻa seedlings will thrive in this small forest gap? Notice that there are other, faster-growing plants, like the endemic pilo (<em>Coprosma rhynchocarpa</em>) and māmaki (<em>Pipturus albidus</em>), and the indigenous purple-flowered koaliʻawa (<em>Ipomoea indica</em>) vine rapidly closing the gap? Once the shadetolerant mānele or pāpala kepau trees replace the pilo, māmaki, and koaliʻawa, the chances for ʻōhiʻa lehua to thrive are grim—at least, until there is a kīpuka-wide disturbance, such as a hurricane or eruption?",

            "audioDescription": "This outdoor exhibit panel is titled, \"Winter Wildlife\" and features a photo and two illustrations with captions, and text about wildlife. A photograph features a brown-phased pine marten standing atop a heavily trafficked path on the snow. The photograph’s caption reads, “Pine martens travel easily through snow and stay active through winter. They walk lightly on the surface without sinking, or use tunnels to move below the snowpack.” The main text reads, “In summer, if you walk carefully and quietly, you’ll find a huge variety of animals here. They range from large mammals like black bears and deer to the tiniest insects. When weather is warm, food is abundant and animals fatten up to prepare for cold weather. As you walk, listen for bird calls, buzzing insects, and other signs of this active community. Frigid temperatures and a deep snowpack quiet this forest in winter, but wildlife is still plentiful. Each species has a strategy to survive the cold months when food is scarce. Some are active beneath the snow’s surface, where temperatures are more stable. Others rest quietly through winter, using food reserves they gathered in warmer months. A few move to warmer locations and return when conditions are less demanding.” To the right of the main photo are two color illustrations. The first is a drawing of a yellow-colored pale swallowtail butterfly with its wings expanded and a green pale swallowtail chrysalis attached to a piece of wood. The illustration caption reads, “Pale swallowtail butterflies spend winter inside their chrysalis and then emerge as adults in spring. Like many insects, the adults die off in fall after reproducing. Their young live through winter as pupae, making the transformation from caterpillars to butterflies.” The second illustration is of a brown water boatmen in an underwater scene. The caption below it reads, “Other insects live through winter as adults. Some hibernate, and some simply slow down. Water boatmen live under the ice in streams and ponds. They slowly “row” through the frigid water, searching for air bubbles, and then rest on the bottom until they need more air.”",

Since there were few forts in the early years, aid often came from the feared \"savages.\" Instead of attacking wagon trains as the eastern newspapers predicted, tribes often provided directions, offered ferry service, carried mail and traded for a variety of items among other aid. <br /> <br /> By the 1860's, though, the tribes became frustrated with the loss of their way of life and the breaking of treaties. The result was more frequent conflict.<br /> <br /> The army established Fort Mitchell, among others, in 1864 to help protect wagon trains from the growing unrest among the Native Americans. The 11th Ohio's Company F manned the adobe fort, located west of Mitchell Pass. Soldiers endured poor living conditions during the summers they occupied the fort. Their orders were to protect the pioneers. The fort was abandoned by mid-1866.<br /> <br /> Consider the challenges you face during a long journey. Where do you look for assistance?<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting showing Native Amercans gathered near a teepee while emigrants pass their encampment in wagon trains. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> During the 1840s and 1850s most encounters with the plains tribes were peaceful.

Although he had no prior experience, Jackson quickly learned to yoke and drive the multiple yokes (pairs) of oxen that pulled each wagon. Seventy years later he returned to dedicate the new Park Service museum on the east side of the pass. By this time he was a well-known photographer, artist, and supporter of emigrant trail history. Jackson guided the park rangers to this spot where he and his fellow bullwhackers bedded down for the night.<br /> <br /> Using memories of his own experiences, sketches he made during his travels and revisiting the sites, Jackson depicted scenes of trail life from the Missouri River to the west coast. His watercolor paintings grace many books about the trails and most of his collection was donated to Scotts Bluff National Monument in 1949. <br /> <br /> How do you memorialize your travels?<br /> <br /> <strong>Quote</strong>: \"Thursday, August 2nd. At noon we corralled ... 10 miles from Scotts Bluffs, which loom up before us in all their variety of outline. In the P.M. we drove up into the pass that leads through them. We had one of the steepest and worst gulches to drive through yet ... our camp is right in one of the narrowest parts of the pass and the walls rise up perpendicularly on either hand ... \" -William Henry Jackson, 1866 diary<br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of a freight wagon train being driven past a distinctive looking sandstone bluff. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> One of the rare views of the trail looking east, this shows how narrow the route around the bluff was.

To protect the monument, it was surrounded by an iron ornamental fence and a gate.<br /> <br /> The monument became a destination visit for many travelers. Thousands of visitors, from America, Europe, and Asia paid their respects to George Washington by visiting the monument. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt came down from Washington, D.C. on a day visit. Roosevelt noted:<br />   \"...I spent about four hours ashore, taking [my] lunch and walking up to the monument which marks where the house stood in which Washington was born. It was a simple shaft.\"<br /> <br /> In the late-1920s, the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed to commemorate the landscape at George Washington's birthplace. The group decided to build a house as a memorial to Washington on the same spot where the monument stood. Many complained that moving the monument would be too costly, since the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, and that moving the monument from the original birthhouse location would lessen its importance.<br /> <br /> Despite the objections, in 1931, the monument was removed from its original base. It was transported in pieces by carts and reinstalled at the park entrance on a new base which added five feet to the overall height of the monument. The original design was also changed with the words \"Washington's Birthplace\" and the years of its installation removed from the monument.<br /> <br /> The monument is now the first landmark that visitors to the park see. ",

The logo itself is shaped like an arrowhead with a scalloped edge, pointed at the bottom, with sides that widen out toward the top, before curving slightly inward, then flaring out to create a rounded top. The arrowhead is brown with etched words and images. On the right side are the words, National Park Service, in white letters. To the left, in green, a tall tree towers above smaller trees and the ground below and a section of lake in white. Behind the tree, a white outline of snowcapped mountains. Below the trees, text in white reads, Department of the Interior, and below this, is a green outline of a bison in profile facing left with a large head and shoulders and smaller hind area. The sign’s log support structure sits atop a stone platform, with stones stacked about six layers high on the right then one layer under the sign.

Looking around, you probably can’t see any sources of water for these mighty hunters, so where do they get water?

Behind you is a flat, grass covered basin surrounded by the low dunes. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a Burrowing Owl perched on a gnarled tree branch. Its back is brown with tan spots. Its head and breast are also tan with a brown cap and a brown mask around its big yellow eyes. Text at the top reads, “Do you have a trick for getting your favorite food? Burrowing owls line their dens with poop from other animals to attract their favorite food—beetles. When bugs show up, they grab them. These owls like to take over foxholes or tunnels of badger or prairie dogs —places rattlesnakes also live.

Ancient examples of geologic processes that have shaped our planet over eons are visible here and help us understand similar, modern processes still occurring today. The fossils contained within these rocks add another layer to the story and often provide the clues needed to understand the environments that shaped the landscape so long ago, but finding these tiny, ellusive fossils can be difficult in the face of the immensity of Grand Canyon. Thankfully the Bright Angel Fault Fossil beds provide an easy solution. Located on the rim of the canyon, a short walk west of the first shuttle stop on the Hermit Road, access to the site is open to the public. <br /> <br /> This site tells the tale of a world far different than the one we see here today. With careful eyes, exposed fossilized remains of creatures from an ancient marine environment 270 million years ago, can unlock secrets and mysteries preserved within Grand Canyon's layers. What will your eyes discover at this one-of-a-kind place along the south rim?<br /> <br /> Remember that the fossils we see and enjoy here today are the ones left to us by the visitors of yesterday and it's up to us to leave what we find for tomorrow's visitors and all those that come after. Feel free to explore and handle the rocks and fossils on your own or with a park ranger, but leave them for the next visitor. Please do not mark, mar, or otherwise damage the site during your visit. Take only pictures and leave only footprints.<br /> <b>All fossils within Grand Canyon National Park are protected by federal law and should remain at the site no matter how small or numerous they may seem.<br /> <br /> Watch your step and your head</b> when exploring the site. The area is uneven with sudden drops and the branches from the scattered trees in the area are better seen than felt.  <br /> <br /> *<em>For a bonus challenge try to find where the Bright Angel Fault meets the rim when you are walking to or back from the fossil site along the rim trail.</em> (<em>Hint: It's betwen the fossil site and Village Route Shuttle Stop)</em></p> <h3>Ranger Programs</h3> <p>A Ranger Program called \"Fossil Walk\", which visits this site, is normally offered in the spring, summer, and fall.<br /> <br /> Check at visitor centers within the park or on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/sr-programs.htm\">website</a> for availability.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "This site is located at the western end of Grand Canyon Village, 300 feet (90 m) west of Hermits Rest Route Transfer along the paved Rim Trail. Twenty feet (6 m) to the canyon side of the trail, a three-foot (1 m) tall by six-foot (2 m) wide square stone altar stands roughly six feet (2 m) from the rim of Grand Canyon, near the end of a flat, 30-foot (9 m) wide by 60-foot (18 m) long open, pebble-strewn landing. Be mindful stepping over a line of rocks bordering the edge of the asphalt trail onto the loose footing of the landing. Touch the stones that form the altar. Facing north down into the canyon, numerous switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail run up to and past 3-Mile Resthouse, and continue into the distance toward a stand of trees at Indian Garden far below. To the right across the chasm, perched on the edge of the canyon cliffs, is the multi-level dark brown Kolb Studio surrounded by evergreen trees below and behind the building. To the right of the studio, hikers enter and leave the canyon at the Bright Angel Trailhead. Above the trailhead, a few parking lots in the Village sit behind Bright Angel Lodge. The turreted top of El Tovar Hotel rises in the background, high above the rim. Located opposite the Rim Trail Worship Site on the other side of the asphalt path, away from the canyon, is a several-hundred-square-foot (90 meters square) gently-sloping rocky area filled with fossils. Note that once off the Rim Trail, the terrain quickly becomes rough, uneven and rocky, interspersed throughout with prickly pear cactus, juniper, and fir trees. Rocky escarpments stand exposed across the field, some three- to four-feet (1 to 1.2 m) high and tens of feet (10 m) long. On this west side of the Bright Angel Fault line, sedimentary rock layers have been uplifted, exposing an amazing diversity of rock formations with an abundance of fossils and trace fossils hidden within the youngest layer of Grand Canyon, the Kaibab Limestone. Common marine fossils include crinoids, animals that had a column-shaped body, created by a series of discs stacked together, topped by a cup-like head feeding structure radiating out like feathery arms. Shelled marine animals known as brachiopods had two asymmetrical shells, or valves. Several different species of brachiopods can easily be found here.Colonial animals called bryozoans produced lacy structures on hard surfaces or stick structures that stood up in ancient seas. Some solitary coral embedded the pointed end of its horn in the soft sediment for stability with a wider upright cup-like end. Sponge fossils are abundant as well. When they hardened into rock, they are more resistant to erosion and often stick out as large knobs or nodules from the surrounding limestone. Animals burrowed through the soft sediment at the bottom of ancient seas. Look for all manner of preserved burrows that were filled in with sediment. These could be long, short, wide, or thin tubular-looking structures. Many plant fossils also remain, such as small pines and ginkgoes. Most of the plant fossils are impressions called trace fossils, left behind in the mud of an ancient river system. Note that it is illegal to dig up, relocate, and/or remove fossils from Grand Canyon National Park. If you find a fossil, please leave it for others to discover and scientists to study. You are welcome to take a picture or make a drawing of the fossil, then go to one of the visitor centers to see if a park ranger can help you identify it.",

            "bodyText": "<p>A short walk down the Bright Angel Trail gives an excellent introduction to the rich human history that is visible from this path. Right after passing through the first, or upper tunnel, pause and look above the sloping cliff on your left. Far above, you can see pictographs painted in red onto a band of rock beneath an overhanging ledge. <br /> <br /> These deer pictographs were left by ancestral canyon occupants to mark their path down into this side canyon. A variety of additional symbols and images can be seen through a pair of binoculars. The site, known as Mallery's Grotto, dates between 4000 years ago (2000 BCE) and 1950.<br /> <br /> It contains Archaic period elements and Cohonina culture elements. Historic charcoal inscriptions are attributed to the Havasupai. This route into the canyon was used by the Havasupai people who lived and farmed at Indian Garden, down in the relatively flat riparian area, you can see 3000 feet (914 m) below the canyon rim. <br /> <br /> The location was given the name, Mallery Grotto, after Garrick Mallery (1831-1894), an authority on the pictographs of the North American Indians. Mallery worked for the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology.<br /> <br /> <b>Please help us protect this site by staying on the trail and enjoying it from afar. </b></p>",
            "audioDescription": "As you move down the top of the Bright Angel Trail, a wide path with gentle switchbacks, almost immediately you'll come to a tunnel. As you pass through, a collection of red pictographs up at the left comes into view. Ranging in size from a few inches (7 cm) to over 2 feet (60 cm) tall, they depict hunts with both animal and human figures, images of zig-zaggy snakes with arrowheads, a series of dots drawn in a counterclockwise, ever-widening circle, cross-hatch directional markings, and a soaring bird. These were painted by members of various native civilizations over several centuries.",

Dr. Brown’s interest in botany and garden design is well documented. According to a friend, in 1784, Brown constructed “...the most extensive and artistic garden in Maryland.” Since Brown’s garden design also included three levels of terraces which resembles the Terraces at Haberdeventure, it is possible that the construction of one influenced the other.<br /> <br /> It is possible that the upper level Terrace, if not all three levels, were used for ornamental gardens. An inventory made at the death of Thomas Stone in 1787 lists a “Wooden Garden Roller, Iron Frame” at his second house in Annapolis. Rollers were used to maintain “bowling greens,” which were large areas of exceptionally well-trimmed grass. When Stone moved to Annapolis in 1783, he downsized his possessions at Haberdeventure. Stone may have taken the roller to Annapolis after it was previously used to maintain an ornamental garden on the Terraces.<br /> <br /> It is unclear if the Terraces were enclosed by either a fence or boxwoods. Archeologists have found evidence of post holes on the perimeter of the Terraces, but these holes might be from after Thomas Stone’s residency.<br /> <br />  ",

            "audioDescription": "This sign, about two feet wide and one and one-half feet high, is mounted at an angle on a single metal post. It is mounted just down the slope from a small clump of scrubby cottonwood trees. The trees are short, almost bush-like in appearance with white bark and broad leaves that are almost heart-shaped. Past the sign as you face it, the trail continues downslope as the small ridge you are on drops down to a brush-covered flat basin. To the right the sand is broad and smooth. To the left, the side of the dune ridge falls off very steeply just past a group of yucca plants with their sword-like leaves. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a brown bat, lying on the ground with wings folded, a large black insect in its mouth. Labels identify the animals as the Pallid Bat and the Darkling Beetle. Text at the top reads, “Most bats eat while they fly. But my pallid bat friends are not most bats. They like to crunch down on big bugs that almost never fly—crickets, cicadas, stinkbugs, and scorpions. Since their food is rarely up in the air, it is not strange to see pallid bats having their dinner on the ground. Darkling beetles (stinkbugs) are chock-full of protein and fat, BUT there is that AWFUL smell.” End of description.",

            "bodyText": "This chicken house and adjacent brooder coop were built in 1935 by Conrad Warren during a time when he was upgrading and remodeling several buildings and facilities around the ranch. Being able to raise and grow a variety of renewable and reliable food sources not only improved the bottom line, but helped make the ranch self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> The house provides shelter, warmth, and shade for laying hens. The interior of the building features a chicken roost for sleeping and nesting boxes for laying eggs. The smaller brooding coop is used to incubate young birds until they are large enough to be placed with the adults. The high fence keeps the chickens from wandering around the ranch and prevents predators such as coyotes from entering the yard.  However, the chickens must be “cooped up” each evening by park staff because some predators like foxes and bobcats can easily climb over the fence! <br /> <br /> Over the years a variety of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese have been raised on site for both their eggs and meat. On special occasions such as Christmas dinner or a family celebration, the Kohrs family would serve roasted poultry with special cranberry or lingonberry sauces.<br /> <br /> Today, visitors will typically see Plymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds running around the yard, loudly clucking to each other, soaking up the warm sun, and digging lots of holes. ",
            "audioDescription": "The chicken house is a one-story, rectangular, wood-frame building with a concrete foundation. The building is painted white and covered with horizontal dropped siding on the exterior walls. The peak of the saltbox roof is offset to the south with a gable orientation that runs east to west. The roof is covered with red, hexagonal shaped asphalt shingles. The south east side of the building has a six-panel wooden door. A single concrete step provides entry into the building. An attached ramp, made of plywood and battens, provides easy access for the chickens to enter the building. The door is surrounded by a red border. On the south side of the building are a group of six nine-light, fixed-sash, wood-framed windows. The windows have a red border. Above the windows and near the roof are a series of wooden louvered vents that run the entire length of the south elevation. Directly on the middle of the south wall, below the windows and near the ground is a small, wood-framed chicken hatch door and a small wooden ramp is centered below the windows. The interior of the one-room chicken house features plywood floors, which were installed in cover the original 4” tongue-and-grove flooring. Along the entire interior northern wall is a chicken roost. Along the west wall is a chicken nesting area featuring seven wooden boxes full of hay for chickens to lay eggs in. built-in chicken nest is on the west wall. The floor is covered in sawdust and there is a small feeding trough and two metal water containers. Tongue-and-groove siding covers the walls and ceiling. A pair of large, round, metal heat lamps hang from the ceiling. Directly to the east across the lawn is the much smaller brooder coop that was historically used to electrically incubate eggs for hatching. The brooding coop is a one-story, rectangular, wood-frame building with a gable roof that is oriented east to west with exposed rafters. It is much smaller than the chicken house. It is built on a concrete foundation, and the exterior walls are covered with 5\" horizontal dropped-cove siding. It is painted white in the same style as the adjacent chicken house. The roof is also covered in red hexagonal shaped asphalt shingles. The west side of the building has a two-panel, red-stained wooded door that allows for entry in the building. There is a small concrete and wooded one-step stoop in front of the door. Along the southern side of the building are two, nine-light wood-framed hopper windows that have a red-stained border. Centered along the east side of the building is single, red-stained nine-light wood-frame hopper window. Centered below this window is small chicken hatch that is located near the ground level. There is a small wooden ramp that leads from the hatch to the ground for chickens. The building’s interior is divided into two rooms. The first room contains various supplies and food storage containers. There is another door that leaves this room and enters the main brooding area where young chickens are kept until they become large enough to be placed with the adult birds. There is a large heating lamp near the floor and the wooden floor is covered in soft sawdust. The chicken house and brooder coop are both located within a large fenced in grassy area that allows for the chickens to be outside during the day. The fence also keeps predators out f the enclosure. The fence on the south side is roughly 5 feet tall and made of hexagonal shaped chicken wire. There is a swinging gate that allows for park staff to enter the yard. The fence on the west, east, and north are made of large 10-foot timbers. These also serve as a border along several adjoining horse pastures.",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2019, the Church of the Epiphany was constructed in 1888. The church is the site of an important local movement center in the Chicano Civil Rights Movement. The church was the site of organization for the Latinx community of East Los Angeles during a time when Latinx mobilized to demand full civic and political inclusion. Under the guidance of Reverend John B. Luce, the church became a center for cultural heritage preservation, reflecting the intersection of religion and activism associated with the use of religion and non-violence to promote Chicano civil rights during the 1960s and 1970s. Architecturally the church is an excellent and intact example of the ecclesiastical architecture of Ernest A. Coxhead and Arthur B. Benton for the Episcopal Archdiocese of Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> The first period of significance for the church is from 1888 to 1920, and encompasses construction, significant additions, and the installation of the organ and all parishioner-donated stained-glass windows. The second period of significance spans from 1965 to 1972, representing the tenure of Father John Luce as rector and the major milestones of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement. The church is also recognized as the Los Angeles base for Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers; the location of organizational efforts for the Blowouts, the Chicano Moratorium, the Brown Berets, and Latinx support for the election of Robert F. Kennedy; and the location of the founding of the community newspaper La Raza. Overall, the Church of the Epiphany has exceptional social history in the work and lives of the California Hispanic community. The Church of the Epiphany is a rare, extant example of a building associated with the support of Latino activism and civil rights during the mid to late twentieth century.",

There is water in the bottom of the lock and in the canal at either end. Lily pads are prevalent at the right end of the lock. Behind you on the other side of the path are wetlands. Trees line either side of the path. To the left of the panel is a backless bench. Along the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile with braille labels of the lock system. The edges of the profile can be sharp. Lake Erie at 573 feet is at the right end. Forty-four locks form stair steps up to the 968-foot-high Portage Summit at the left end. In between are Boston near Lock 32, Peninsula near Lock 29, and Mustill Store at Lock 15. Your current position at Lock 26 is near the middle of the profile. Text on the panel reads, “Life in Cheesedom. Canal, farm, railroad – all played a part in the lives of Charles and Susan Carter. They lived in a house next to Lock 26 and made a living in various ways. Charles served as a canal boat captain and locktender. The family also raised corn and hay on their 56-acre farm to feed their dairy cows. Though the community did not have any stores, taverns, or churches, Ira was a distribution point for dairy products. The Carters and other local farmers brought milk to the Hawkins Cheese Factory for processing. It was one of many in the region, which became known as ‘Cheesedom.’ From the nearby railroad depot, farmers shipped their cheese and fresh milk to urban areas.” In the middle of the panel is a black and white photograph of a small, two-story house next to a dirt path. The caption reads, “Charles and Susan Carters house bordered the canal towpath at Lock 26. Their son Darwin lived next door and helped run the family dairy farm.” At upper right is an image of a receipt from Hawkins Cheese Factory dated July 1901. “Farmers were paid every month for the milk they sold to the cheese factory.” Below that is a photograph of a man wearing a vest and hat. He stands on a depot platform, holding a bicycle next to him. Stacks of round boxes sit at the left side of the depot. The caption reads, “In this self-portrait, photographer Edwin Bell Howe stands at the railroad depot with stacks of cheese wheels. The depot was across from the cheese factory at the intersection of Ira and Riverview roads. The depot was named for Ira Hawkins, whose land was crossed by the tracks.” End of description.",

            "bodyText": "During the early 1930’s many ranchers struggled to survive as beef prices dropped, brucellosis infections rose, and an extreme drought devastated most crops. In 1931, the United States Department of Agriculture declared the period as one of the worst ever for stock growers. During this time, Conrad Warren reported that his potato and wheat crops were a “complete failure,” however, he was able to grow just enough hay on the ranch to support his cattle herd through the winters.<br /> <br /> There were several factors that contributed to either the success or failure of a ranch during this devastating period of widespread depression, drought, disease, and forecloses. Those that survived carefully bought and sold livestock, improved their vegetation and water systems, selectively bred cattle, and found unique ways to supplement their income.<br /> <br /> In 1932, Conrad Warren wisely developed a small herd of Jersey dairy cattle and constructed this barn as a processing center to sell milk. A handwritten entry from his “cash journal” shows that on February 28, 1932, he sold “642 gallons of milk at 10 cents a gallon, to the Deer Lodge Creamery for a profit of $642.00.” Eventually the cattle market slowly improved by the late 1930’s, but by developing this facility, Warren was able to guarantee a monthly income for the ranch during this tough period. As a bonus, the rich milk was also used to supplement Warren’s prized registered Hereford bull calves.<br /> <br /> To meet sanitation requirements of the time for processing food, a 6-foot deep, concrete lined manure pit was built to the northwest of the dairy barn. Manure was hauled from the building across the road to the pit, where it was flushed out with running water and allowed to flow downhill to fertilize the pastures below. Even though most of this pit has been filled in over time, it is still used to clean out manure from the nearby draft horse barn. <br /> <br /> The outside of the dairy barn hasn’t changed much since it was constructed, but the inside has seen many changes over the years. The interior was modified in 1975 and served as a maintenance building when the National Park Service took over management of the site. Today, the dairy barn is used as an indoor classroom, a meeting space for special events, and is a good example of how to balance historic preservation with modern needs.<br /> <br /> In August of 2019, the dairy barn hosted a Senate field hearing of the Subcommittee on National Parks to discuss the economic benefits of national parks and how to expand visitation at “lesser known” parks across the country. During this meeting the chair of the subcommittee joked that “this might be the first time in modern history that a Senate hearing has taken place inside of a barn.”<br /> <br /> Although the interior of the building has changed since 1932, visitors can still walk inside the barn today and see the original concrete trough running down the center of the building that once held the stanchions for Warren’s dairy cattle.",
            "audioDescription": "The dairy barn is a one and one-half-story, rectangular, white painted,wood-frame building with a north-south oriented gable roof featuring red hexagonal shingles. The building is about 47 feet wide and 56 feet deep. On the south side of the building there are two doors, one constructed with vertical boards and stained red, and the other a white sliding door. The building sits on a concrete foundation, with an interior concrete pad A four-light, wood-sash hopper window is centered in the gable end and another slightly smaller, four-light hopper is located slightly off-center to the east, between the door openings of the first-story level. The east elevation has eight evenly spaced four-light wood-sash hopper-frame windows. On the north there is a wood double-leaf door stained red and three four-light wood sash hopper framed windows. The west features a wood double-leaf door stained red and two four-light wood-sash hopper frame windows. On the interior, one-by-nine-inch wood boards cover the walls, one-by-seven inch boards cover the floor of the west side of the building and a concrete s forms the east side floor. A concrete trough that held stanchions for dairy cattle runs down the center of the building. A wood-burning stove is in the center of the interior. The west interior wall features a display showcasing the Montana Draft Teamster Hall of Fame. Picnic tables are sometimes located in the interior. On the south side there are two doors, one constructed with vertical boards and exterior x-bracing, and the other a sliding door constructed with vertical board-and-batten and mounted on an overhead metal track.

            "bodyText": "During the Open Range Era, a cattle drive could take anywhere from three to six months depending on the destination. Large groups of cattle were herded by cowboys and trailed directly from a range to a nearby market; from a range to a distant railhead; or between ranges to find better grazing opportunities.<br /> <br /> On the earlier, shorter drives cowboys would eat what they could carry in their saddle bag, which typically consisted of dried meats, salt, and biscuits. As the distances increased it became harder for a cowboy to carry his own food. Texas cattleman Charles Goodnight solved this problem in 1866 by converting a surplus Army wagon into a mobile kitchen. Goodnight added a large pantry box to the rear with shelves, drawers, and a hinged door that laid flat to create a table. Heavier items like pots, cast iron skillets, and a Dutch oven were carried in a box mounted below the pantry called a “boot.” The chuckwagon also carried tools, sewing supplies, first aid essentials, bedrolls, firewood, and water.<br /> <br /> Life on the trail was exhausting work and the chuckwagon and the resourcefulness of the cook boosted the crews moral and played a vital role in the success or failure of the entire journey. Most cooks were ex-cowboys themselves that were often too old or injured to comfortably ride a horse. The cook lived a life of physical labor and maintained an exhausting daily schedule. He not only prepared three hot meals a day, but also drove the chuckwagon, pitched camp, and served as the banker, barber, doctor, dentist, or any other job that needed to be filled on the trail. His final task of the day was to locate the north star and point the tongue of the wagon facing north, which allowed the crew to know which direction to move the herd the next morning.<br /> <br /> The food carried on the chuckwagon was both easy to cook and preserve. Some common items included “whistle berries” (beans), rice, dried meat, onions, potatoes, flour, lard, canned fruits and vegetables, and various spices and condiments. Sourdough was a main component of most meals and the cook took great care of the keg and starter. Fresh beef was never in short supply and was supplemented with wild game and fish. If time permitted and the cook was in a good mood, he might bake the crew a desert like peach cobbler, fruit pie, or spotted pup in a Dutch oven.<br /> <br /> Most cowboys were devoted to coffee and demanded it a every meal. They preferred it hot, strong, black, and thick enough to float a horseshoe in! During the early years of driving cattle, coffee was not easily available on the trail because it was time consuming to roast the beans and they didn’t preserve well. In 1865, the Arbuckles Coffee patented a method to roast and preserve beans that sealed in the flavor, aroma and came packaged in easy to store one-pound bags. Arbuckles became so popular with chuckwagon cooks that most cowboys weren’t aware there was any other kind!<br /> <br /> The chuckwagon not only carried food, equipment, and vital supplies, but it also became the only home and familiar sight that a cowboy knew in the vastness of the open range. It was a special place where you could socialize, receive care, enjoy a comforting meal, and lay your head down to rest after a grueling day on the trail.<br /> <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "This replica chuckwagon that is on display at Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic is constructed of both wood and iron. The wagon is roughly 12 feet long and 4 feet wide. The chuckwagon has 4-wheels made of wood and covered by iron. The two back wheels are 54 inches round and are larger than the front wheels. This allows more play when turning. The wheels are designed to negotiate bad roads and not sink into the axle. Iron reinforces the parts that take the greatest beating such as the undercarriage, axel, reach, hounds, wheels, and bolsters. All the smaller metal works such as bolts, nuts, brackets, hooks etc., were hand forged over a coal fired forge. The chuck wagon is cover by canvass top that shields the wagon from dust and weather. The cover is roughly 11 feet long and is supported by a frame of hickory bows and secured with hemp rope. On one side of the wagon is an oak water barrel, a metal pan for washing hands and utensils, and a rectangular coffee grinder. On the other side of the wagon is a wooden toolbox. The back end of the chuckwagon features a wooden pantry box with seven shelves, four cabinets, and a hinged door that lays down flat to create a table. Inside of the cabinets and shelves are replica items used during interpretive programs and items that would be used to cook food on the trail. On top of the wagon is a replica wooden crate that is labeled Arbuckles Roasted Coffees with an agnel graphic in the middle. The front of the wagon features an elevated wooden seat where the driver would sit. To the right of the seat is a larger metal brake handle. Underneath this seat is a wooden jockey box. A large metal bar known as the tongue points directly north from the front of the wagon. The replica chuckwagon can be found on display in two separate locations depending on what time of year you are visiting. From the late spring through late fall the replica chuckwagon is displayed outdoors to the north of a grove of cotton wood trees. There is a small fire pit on the ground behind the chuckwagon and a large pile of wood underneath. During the bus summer months, a ranger wearing authentic period clothing can be found at the chuckwagon performing living history interpretation. During the winter months the replica chuckwagon is stored inside the thoroughbred barn.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Wilbur and Orville constructed their workshop at this location in 1901. They consistently made improvements to it each season they returned. In 1902, they added 10 feet of space to the workshop to use as living quarters, as the past visits to Kitty Hawk had proven tent living as unsustainable.<br /> <br /> The workshop and living quarters were abandoned by the brothers after 1911, allowing nature to destroy the structures.</p> <h3>Living on the Outer Banks</h3> <p>When the Wright brothers arrived here in September 1900, the Outer Banks were very different from today. There were no bridges connecting the Outer Banks to the mainland and Kitty Hawk was a remote, self-sustaining fishing village with few residents and even fewer structures.<br /> <br /> The Kitty Hawk Life-Saving Station and the US Weather Bureau station were four miles apart, with nothing but desolate sand dunes between them. Despite this isolation, the few friends that the brothers did make here proved invaluable, as the members of the life-saving service often assisted the Wrights in their flying experiments.<br /> <br /> As Wibur wrote in November, 1900:</p> <blockquote> <p>In October my brother and myself spent a vacation of several weeks at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, experimenting with a soaring machine. We located on the bar which separates Albemarle Sound from the ocean. South of Kitty Hawk the bar is absolutely bare of vegetation and flat as a floor, from sound to ocean, for a distance of nearly five miles, except a sand hill one hundred and five ft. high which rises almost in its center. The main slope of the hill is to the northeast, which is facing the prevailing winds...To the north, northeast, east, and southeast there is nothing but flat plain and ocean for a thousand miles nearly. It is an ideal place for gliding experiments except for its inaccessibility. The person who goes there must take everything he will possibly need, for he cannot depend on getting any needed article from the outside world in less than three weeks.</p> </blockquote> <h3>Camp Life</h3> <blockquote> <p>Trying to camp down here reminds me of those poor arctic explorers. We are living nearly the whole time on reduced rations. Once in a while we get a mess of fish, and if our stuff comes about the same time from Elizabeth City - which stuff consists of canned tomatoes, peaches, condensed milk, flour, bacon & butter- we have a big blowout...But it only lasts a day...</p> <p>   - Orville Wright, October 18, 1900</p> </blockquote> <p>When the brothers first arrived at Kitty Hawk in 1900, they lived in rudimentary tents that often blew over in the nearly constant winds. In addition, they were plagued by mosquitos and a lack of supplies. Nonetheless, creature comforts were outweighed by their desire to perfect flight.<br /> <br /> In 1901, the brothers improved their camp conditions. They constructed a more permanent wood-frame workshop and storage facility. In 1902, with the help of local residents, they upgraded their camp buildings further by adding more space to the workshop for use as living quarters. When they returned to the Outer Banks yet again in 1903, they repaired the storage facility/workshop, which had been blown off its foundation by storms, and they also constructed a hangar to assemble their powered aircraft.</p> <h3>Reconstruction</h3> <p>The camp buildings were first reconstructed in 1953 in commmoration of the 50th anniversary of the first flight. Due to storm and termite damage, these structures were removed in 1963 and rebuilt between 1963 and 1965.<br /> <br /> In 1976, the hangar was replaced due to deteriorating conditions and the living quarters recieved much needed repairs the same year.<br /> <br /> In 1984, the hangar was rebuilt for a third time, to more exact specifications, after being damaged by a storm.<br /> <br /> In 1993, the parks preservation team rebuilt both the living quarters and the hangar building.

            "bodyText": "On the morning of June 15, 1859, Lyman Cutlar woke up to find his potato patch under attack….by a pig.  25 year-old Cutlar was a recent arrival to San Juan Island, where he settled on land already claimed by the Hudson’s Bay Company, a British corporation with globe spanning operations who had been using much of San Juan Island as the Belle Vue Sheep Farm since 1853. While Cutlar’s only known crop was potatoes and his cultivated land may have only amounted to 1/3 of an acre (according to Charles Griffin, the farm’s manager). By contrast, the Belle Vue sheep farm was a massive livestock operation with approximately 5000 head of sheep who were pastured at sheep stations across the entire length of San Juan Island as well as numerous free ranging cattle and pigs. Today, the site of Lyman Cutlar's farm is still a working small farm, owned by the San Juan County Land Bank which preserves open land in our community and who keeps it open to the public as the <a href=\"https://sjclandbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020_Frazer_map.pdf\">Frazer Homestead Preserve</a>.<br /> <br /> In the past year, approximately 16 United States’ citizens, predominately gold miners who had failed to find riches during the Fraser River Gold Rush, had landed on San Juan Island and began constructing “a log cabin and a potato patch on the most valuable prairies” the Hudson’s Bay Company possessed. Though most American farmsteads were humble establishments similar to Cutlar’s, some American settlers were more ambitious, such as the settler who had landed 20 head of cattle. From the British perspective, these American settlers were squatters, illegally occupying company land located inside the British Empire.<br /> <br /> From the American perspective, San Juan Island was part of the United States of America and the Hudson’s Bay Company was an imperious enterprise whose illegitimate claims threatened their livelihood. In fact, from a certain perspective, San Juan Island was located in both the British Empire and the USA. The Oregon Treaty, signed 13 years earlier in 1846, said that the local boundary between the two nations shall be “the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island.” In fact, there were two channels, the Haro Strait (which if it was selected would make San Juan Island part of the USA) and the Rosario Strait (which would make San Juan Island part of the British Empire). Thus, the potato patch which the pig invaded was contested ground.<br /> <br /> This was not the first time that one of the Belle Vue Sheep Farm’s pigs had invaded Cutlar’s farmstead. But when Cutlar woke up to find a Hawaiian herdsman named Jacob laughing that the pig “was up to his old game” he picked up his gun and in “a moment of irritation” killed the pig. When Cutlar, who felt regret for killing the company pig instead of merely scaring it away, went to see Hudson’s Bay Company manager Charles Griffin, the longstanding local and global tensions collided. When Cutlar offered to pay for the pig, Griffin told him, “you Americans are a nuisance on the island and have no business here…and I shall…have you removed.” Cutlar retorted, “I came here to settle for shooting your hog not to argue the right of Americans on the island for I consider it American soil.”<br /> <br /> Within a day’s time of Cutlar and Griffin’s dispute a group of 4 British officials showed up at Cutlar’s farm, threatening to arrest him if he did not pay the high sum of $100 (more than 6 times the hog’s value) for its death. Word of these threats spread to American officials on the mainland and 42 days later, on July 26, 1859, US forces under Captain Pickett landed at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s dock to protect American citizens on San Juan Island. The Pig War had begun!",

            "bodyText": "This small but elegant home with its gracious porch was one of several cottages built for officers stationed at American Camp during its existence from 1859-1874. Captain George Pickett constructed this building at the beginning of the occupation (in either 1859 or 1860) out of disassembled buildings from Fort Whatcom. At the beginning of the Pig War, Pickett was ordered to abandon Fort Bellingham and he and his troops carefully salvaged the buildings in that facility and used lumber from that frontier outpost to construct American Camp. This act significantly increased the speed at which American Camp was built up because no sawmill existed on San Juan Island, which meant that standard sized boards and other lumber had to be imported from the mainland of Washington State.<br /> <br /> George Pickett was the first man to serve as commanding officer over the 15 years that American Camp was in existence. Pickett’s rash actions during the Pig War crisis, such as his threats to the British and his poor initial choices for American Camp’s location led him to be relieved of duty on San Juan Island by Winfield Scott, the highest ranking general in the United States military. Restored to his post by General Harney after Scott left the Pacific Northwest, Pickett learned from his earlier mistakes and established cordial relations with British forces at English Camp, a pattern of friendship and cooperation that remained in place for all 12 years of the Joint Occupation.<br /> <br /> While English Camp only had two commanding officers in 12 years, American Camp had 15 commanders over the course of 15 years. This high turnover rate reflected the undesirability of the San Juan Islands as a posting. During the Civil War (1861-1865) the US military regarded San Juan Island as a low priority and the soldiers and officers stationed here received few supplies and money leading them to have a lower standard of living than most members of the US military. For professional soldiers, orders to report to San Juan Island kept them far away from the front lines of the largest war the US had ever fought in, preventing them from serving their country and gaining the experience that could advance their career. These very real factors were a major reason that so many commanding officers served for such a short time on San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> This double frame house is made of cedar and features weatherboarding and a shingled roof. The bedrooms were located at the front of the building and the kitchen and the dining room were located in the rear. Originally intended as a duplex that would house two officers, by 1867 it was occupied by a single officer. Porches were originally located on all four sides of this structure but three out of four of the porches were removed and were later restored. Significant alterations, including the installation of plumbing, electricity, and telephone lines were performed by the farming families who later lived here.<br /> <br /> Robert Firth, the last manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's Belle Vue Sheep Farm homesteaded in American Camp, claiming the land and buildings as his property after American Camp closed in 1874. He used this building as his farmhouse, a tradition continued by the McRae family who purchased the farm from him. In that time, the history of this building and the other surviving structures at American Camp were enshrouded in local myth and only through a combination of archaeology, archival research, oral history, and painstaking research has this building’s history been recovered.<br /> <br /> The Officers’ Quarters are currently closed to the public, but we plan to furnish it with historically accurate furniture and possessions to recreate what it looked like during the Pig War period. This building was originally intended as a temporary structure, but it has now stood for over 160 years. This remarkable feat is a testament to its excellent construction and the preservation work that farm families and park service staff have done to keep this piece of history alive!",

            "bodyText": "The West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind is located on Barron Drive in Institute, Kanawha County, West Virginia. Institute is approximately seven miles west of Charleston, the capitol of West Virginia. <br /> <br /> Prior to 1926, West Virginia did not have a school for Black children who were deaf or blind.  The 1872 State Constitution addressed the education of free Black children but included a provision that stated “white and colored persons shall not be taught in the same school.” In 1919, three Black state legislature delegates sponsored legislation for a colored school for the deaf and blind. They included a provision that required the superintendent and entire staff be African American. The West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind opened on September 14, 1926 with 28 students. Over the years, the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind campus expanded to five buildings. The Main Building was completed in 1926, In 1928, the one-story West Building was constructed behind the Main Building and provided space for classrooms and a braille library for the blind as well as a playroom. A matching East Building housing classrooms for deaf students soon followed in 1930. Another building constructed in 1931 housed a garage and space for a mop and broom making shop. The final building added to this campus was an auditorium/gymnasium designed by Charleston Black architect John C. Norman in 1950.<br /> <br /> The purpose of the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind was to train the students to be self-sustaining and to function in society with as little handicap as possible. Its educational curriculum consisted of learning sign language and other communication methods, subject instruction, and vocational training. Young deaf students were taught to communicate by an oral method and a manual method. The oral method consisted of making sounds, speaking, and reading lips while the manual method involved using sign language to communicate. Teachers taught blind students the braille system of reading and how to use devices such as the talking-book machine, braille writers, and radios. In addition to learning how to communicate, students were taught subjects including reading, math, history, geography, language, government, physiology, and physics. Between 1927 and 1934, vocational programs were introduced to teach students skills such as barbering, beauty culture, shoe repairing, tailoring, cleaning and pressing, chair caning, mop and broom making, rug weaving, leather craft, and home economics. Between 1926 and 1951, 102 deaf and 68 blind students were admitted to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind.<br /> <br /> In 1954, the United States Supreme Court heard the case Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. The justices ruled that separating students based on race was unconstitutional. As a result, West Virginia began the process of integrating schools and the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind was one of the institutions that closed. Black deaf and blind students were transferred to the West Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in Romney, Hampshire County, West Virginia. In 1955, the West Virginia Legislature repealed legislation for the Schools for the Colored Blind and Deaf and the school’s final commencement ceremony was held on May 26, 1955.<br /> <br /> In 1955, the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind property became a rehabilitation center for the blind and severely disabled. The West Virginia Board of Education opened the Rehabilitation Center on August 1, 1955 to prepare individuals for employment. Clients received training in auto mechanic repair, business administration, computer science, radio and TV repair, upholstery, sewing, and small appliance repair as well as rehabilitation services.<br /> <br /> The West Virginia Rehabilitation Center continued to operate until 2007 when it ceased offering vocational and rehabilitation services; however, the Division of Rehabilitation Services continued to use the site for administrative offices until 2011. In June 2013, West Virginia State University acquired the entire West Virginia Rehabilitation property which contained 15 buildings and nearly 20 acres.",

After two tenths of a mile the lock will appear on the left. The lock is about two feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock walls are made of stone blocks. The two walls create the lock chamber that is about ten feet deep. The upstream and downstream entrance gates are missing. Near the Northeastern end of the lock, a wooden bridge spans the lock and gives pedestrians access to the lockhouse. On the opposite side of the towpath is the Potomac River.",

The base, strategically located on a quiet peninsula in by the north Atlantic Ocean, focused on radio communications with Europe. Like much of the base, Rockefeller Hall was funded by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The building was designed by Grosvenor Atterbury in a French Eclectic style and intended to be the centerpiece of the base. For several years, it served as an operation center and military housing.<br /> <br /> Today, Rockefeller Hall is one of four original base buildings at the Schoodic Education and Research Center. The research center partners with Acadia National Park to further scientific research and education. Every year, the center introduces thousands of students and park visitors to environmental science and conservation.<br /> <br /> In 2010s, Rockefeller Hall underwent restoration and safety rennovations and now operates as the Rockefeller Welcome Center.",

For a shorter hike, consider taking the trail roughly one mile in to Mill Creek and then return. When a remnant population of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grba/learn/nature/reintroducing-bonneville-cutthroat-trout.htm\">native Bonneville Cutthroat Trout</a> was found in Mill Creek, the stream became a catalyst for reintroducing the parks only native trout to other streams of the snake range.</p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{34}\" paraid=\"1763592989\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grba/learn/historyculture/the-osceola-ditch.htm\">Gold was discovered</a> 3 miles west of Great Basin National Park in 1877. Water is a critical element in gold mining, and in 1889 construction began on a ditch to bring water from Lehman Creek on the east side of the Snake Range to the gold mines on the west. Limited gold returns, hampered by a water flume that did not deliver enough water, led gold mining to largely stop in 1905. Remnants of the original flume can be found along the trail, with century old pieces of wood baking in the sun.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{40}\" paraid=\"1244952951\">Now that you’re above 8,000 feet, the montane life zone surrounds you. This stop also shows that general life zones are not perfectly delineated and can blend in their transitions. The area surrounding the road is studded with piñon and juniper trees, along with some larger coniferous species, such as white fir, ponderosa pine, and douglas fir. Listen for melodic Cassin’s finches and the repetitive red-breasted nuthatch. </p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{54}\" paraid=\"1512354708\">Enjoy the crisper air as you rise in elevation and keep an eye out as the Montane zone becomes more evident, soaking in the magnificent views of the Snake Valley.  </p>",

The image shows the wide dark opening in a tan tree trunk from which about a dozen birds are exiting. The birds have a cigar shaped body that is mostly brown but with a paler belly. They have round dark eyes, a short pointed black beak, and short squared off pale tail feathers. Their arched wings are long, each about twice the length of the bird’s body.",

Such openings are brief interludes in the life of the forest. Along the meadow’s edge, young Douglass-fir trees have already begun to reclaim this site. The image shows a green field in the foreground with rows of plants, bordered on the left by a dirt road that curves up, then to the right, ending in front of a horizontal row of buildings at the top of the panel. Near the buildings on the left, a brown automobile is parked facing left. Its rectangular body has a tall, square drivers’ compartment in the center and large arched bumpers above black wheels with white sidewall. Behind the auto, is a house with white wooden siding and a large front door flanked by windows. Its A-frame roof is topped with dormers on either side of the peak and a chimney. A small white shed with a peaked roof sits beside the house near two brown barn structures with wooden fencing. A green lawn, shrubs and trees grow around the buildings. Tall pine trees stand behind the homestead, and in the distance, are tree covered hills.",

Alder groves, wet meadows and small forest openings provide the cover and open feeding areas preferred by many species of wildlife. On the right side of the image, a reddish-brown squirrel, facing right, stands on all four legs atop a tree branch draped with strands of light green moss. The squirrel has a round head, two fur tipped ears, a dark oval eye encircled by tan fur, and a small dark nose flanked by long black whiskers above its mouth. Its bushy tail is brown with black streaks and curves up and away from its body. The squirrel’s feet each have four toes ending with a claw.

On the panel, a color image shows the inside of tree on fire. Bright red and orange flames flare up from the base through the core of the trunk. The reddish-brown outer bark is not on fire. On the ground around the tree and in the forest beyond, are burning trees and branches that have fallen. Whitish grey smoke fills the forest. Text on the left reads: Still Standing. Natural forests evolved in the presence of fire. The heart of this western redcedar was consumed by fire. Why is the crown still green? Live tissue still survives under the bark, transporting food down from the needles and water and nutrients up from the roots.",

The arrowhead is brown with etched words and images. On the right side are the words, National Park Service, in white letters. To the left, in green, a tall tree towers above smaller trees and the ground below and a section of lake in white. Behind the tree, a white outline of snowcapped mountains.

Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with a slot for dropping one of two registration payment receipts into an individual square. Attached to the left post of the kiosk is a brown box with a lid holding campground registration envelopes. Standing on the ground in front of the board on the left is a 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing the envelope with payment. On the face of the cannister, at the top, is a slot for slipping in the envelope. Posted on the right side of the bulletin board are campground and pet regulations, a campground map, and steps to take in an emergency. Contact a ranger or dial 911.

This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits.

            "audioDescription": "The Compton Gap Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken of columnar jointing. The text reads, \"Prismatic Features - Millions of years ago plates on the earth's surface in this area began pulling apart, and lava-at first it was black-colored basalt, but eventually it metamorphosed into the greenstone you see today- oozed up out of the earth and through the cracks between the plates. As the lava cooled, it shrank into intriguing six-sided shapes down through its depths, forming columns. Geologists call this columnar jointing. Take the Compton East hike (detailed below) to see an example of columnar jointing, one of the finest in the park.\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is of rocks and lichens in various shades of brown, rust, blue, green, and gray. The test reads, \"Ancient Colors - Fort Windham Rocks and all the greenstone in this area are part of the Catoctin Formation, a series of related lava flows in Virginia, Maryland, and southern Pennsylvania. These rocks are being broken apart, little by little, by the power of ice and frost. Because the rocks at Fort Windham are covered with lichen and weathering rapidly, they feature some fascinating colors.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Compton Peak The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Compton Peak, West and East - 2.4-mile T-hike, moderate, 1.75 hours hiking time, 835-foot elevation gain. Cross Skyline Drive and begin at the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) post. Take the A.T. south to the trail post at the T-intersection. Go right at the post. Continue on the trail to the west viewpoint. Return to the intersection, and continue straight to the east viewpoint. The columnar jointing is underneath the east viewpoint; to see it, follow the blue blazes. This part of the trail is rough and rocky, but very short. When you reach the base of the cliff, look up to see the columnar jointing. Return the way you came, crossing Skyline Drive to reach the parking area.\" \"Hike #2: Fort Windham Rocks - (This hike is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 0.8-mile round trip hike, easiest, Â½ hour hiking time, 130-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north to its intersection with the Dickey Ridge Trail. Turn left. In about 300 yards, explore Fort Windham Rocks on the right. Return the way you came.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. - Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitor centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks.

Hike to a remote camping site, and fall asleep to the sounds of the nighttime forest. Look for squirrels and salamanders, and listen for owls, songbirds, and wood frogs. Capture the beauty of the forest on your camera: wildflowers, mushrooms, and the waterfalls and cascades of Doyles River and Jones Run. The deep pools are perfect for wading, and the tumbling water is great for fishing. Generations of people have escaped hectic lifestyles for the relaxation and rejuvenation that comes from the natural therapy of playing in Shenandoah National Park.\" \"The tree shaded streams of the Park provide perfect habitat for native brook trout. Trout need cool, clean water that is well oxygenated from running over rocks and riffles. All of Shenandoah's streams are open to catch-and-release fishing, some are open for harvest. Check current Park regulations. A valid state fishing license is required.\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is two campers setting-up a blue and gray dome tent in a small clearing in the forest. The text reads, \"Get away from the paved world by camping in Shenandoah's backcountry. Backcountry camping immerses you in nature, challenges your body, and refreshes your mind. If you have the right equipment and a free backcountry camping permit, you can camp almost anywhere in the Park. Talk to a Ranger to learn more about backcountry camping.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Doyles River Falls.

Follow Doyles River Trail. Pass the access trails for Doyles River Cabin and Browns Gap Road. Trail posts mark the location of Upper and Lower Doyles River Falls. Retrace your steps to return to the parking lot.\" \"Hike #2: Doyles River Falls and Jones Run Falls - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 7.7-mile circuit, strenuous, 6.5 hours hiking time, 2,233-foot elevation gain, several stream crossings. Follow Doyles River Trail. Pass the access trails for Doyles River Cabin and Browns Gap Road. Trail posts mark the location of Upper and Lower Doyles River Falls. Another trail post marks the end of Doyles River Trail and the beginning of Jones Run Trail; follow Jones Run Trail. A trail post marks the location of Jones Run Falls. Continue uphill and turn right on the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north. The A.T. crosses Skyline Drive twice before it brings you back to Doyles River parking.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks.

They cleared the forest to provide pastureland for cattle and planted fruit trees-especially apples-for food. They brought plants with them from their home continent and planted them. When the National Park Service took possession of this land and these people had to move out, they left these plants behind.

The text reads, \"A Forest Growing Up - Since the Park's establishment, the forest has been allowed to grow back. Most of what you see here are pioneer species - the kinds of plants and trees that spring up in the early stages of forest succession: coralberry, blackberry, Virginia creeper, hawthorn, and black locust. Eventually, as years pass, taller trees will start to shade out the shrubs and smaller plants that are typical of a young forest.

The text reads, \"Keep It Clean - Jones Run is a source stream for the James River watershed, one of three major watersheds in Shenandoah National Park. Here is how the watershed works: Jones Run flows into the Doyles River, which flows into the Moormans River, which flows into the Rivanna River, which flows into the James River, which flows into the the Chesapeake Bay, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. This means that what happens in Shenandoah's streams does not stay in Shenandoah's streams. Effects accumulate, good or bad, as the water travels to its final destination.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a handsome brook trout in its natural habitat. The text reads, \"Full of Life - Pick up a rock and take a look. You'll see small creatures underneath it, like crayfish and caddisfly cases, evidence that Jones Run, like all of Shenandoah's streams, is teeming with activity. You might also see stoneflies and mayflies, indicators of good water quality and evidence that Shenandoah is sending clean water downstream. This tiny, aquatic life is also food for brook trout.\" \"Brook trout thrive here in the mountains because they are cold water fish. Shenandoah's high elevation and shady forests keep the water cool. Brook trout are indicator species, so the fact that they're living in the Park means the streams are healthy and clean.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Jones Run Falls.

Another trail post marks the end of Doyles River Trail and the beginning of Jones Run Trail. Follow Jones Run Trail. A trail post marks the location of Jones Run Falls. Continue uphill to return to the parking lot.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Leave what you find. Artifacts are protected by law. It's dangerous and potentially deadly to climb on the rocks near waterfalls.

It is being constructed by a group of at least 5 men who are on the top of the platform and have accessed it via a wooden ladder. The text reads, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. In the early 1930s, fire suppression was an important duty of the Civilian Conservation Corps crews stationed here. They built fire towers and manned them around the clock, scanning the horizon for any hint of smoke. Fire crews attacked whenever fire was detected, in an attempt to stop the destruction.\" \"Meanwhile, local residents continued to annually burn their blackberry patches and meadows. They knew that fire regenerates many plants and keeps unwanted plants from choking out others.\" \"Today, we know that both the CCC and the residents were doing the right thing. Unwanted fires caused by lightning or careless people can be destructive. But under the right conditions, fire can encourage healthy, diverse ecosystems. As you explore this area, you are likely to see evidence of past fires, both prescribed and wild.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike on the Wildcat Ridge Trail and Riprap Loop past Chimney Rock and Calvary Rocks. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.

            "audioDescription": "The Dark Hollow Falls Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph of the water cascading over the rocks of Dark Hollow. The text reads, \"Water on the Rocks - The splashing stream that you follow to Dark Hollow Falls is a life saver. Starting from springs less than a mile away, the water nourishes plants, animals and humans. Park biologists keep an eye on changes in streams such as this one, to reduce negative impacts from humans and weather. Temperature changes of just a few degrees or high acid levels can make streams unlivable for many species. Once the water tumbles through Dark Hollow and leaves the Park, it joins other streams and rivers and passes through farmland, housing developments, towns, and industrial areas along its journey to Chesapeake Bay. Will it still be able to sustain life when it gets there?\" There are four smaller pictures on the bottom left of the panel: a crayfish, purple-flowering raspberry, an ovenbird, and jewelweed. The text reads, \"Who lives here? Take time to see and hear what's around you as you hike. In the stream, look for crayfish, brook trout, salamanders, and frogs. Listen for redstarts and ovenbirds. Bursts of color herald the seasons: trillium in spring, purple-flowering raspberry in summer, and jewelweed from summer into fall.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Dark Hollow Falls. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: Dark Hollow Falls - 1.4-mile, round trip, moderate, 1 hours hiking time, 440-foot elevation gain. Follow the trail 0.75-mile to the base of the falls and return by the same route. If you plan to continue hiking beyond the falls, obtain a map from the visitor center for trail information. This trail is short, but very steep and rocky. The return climb is challenging! Sturdy shoes with gripping soles such as hiking boots and sneakers are best suited for the rocky terrain found on this hike. Stay on the trail and do not venture out onto the rocks near the waterfall. These rocks are very slippery and dangerous. The pathway that crosses Skyline Drive joins the Story of the Forest Trail which leads to Byrd Visitor Center (0.4-mile) and to Big Meadows Campground (0.66-mile). Pets are not allowed on this trail.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at Entrance Stations, Visitor Centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. Pets are not allowed on Dark Hollow Falls Trail. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.",

On the left panel, an old black-and-white photograph shows a couple men and women standing in front of a nearly completed structure. Text at the top left reads: \"Hopi House. Hopi House opened to the public in 1905. In an era when most architects were men, it was Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter's first building. The 36-year-old Colter enlisted the help of local Hopi craftsmen to build Hopi House, using locally quarried stone and wood harvested from the nearby forest. Hopi House was not just a curio store, it was also a place from where American Indian artisans lived and worked. Under the watchful eyes of visitors, these artisans would create beautiful jewelry, pottery, blankets, and other items that would then be sold at Hopi House, forging a personal connection to the items visitors purchased there.\" A quote at the top from Virginia Grattan's 1992 book, \"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth,\" reads: \"For Mary Colter, Hopi House was an opportunity to re-create the distinctive dwelling of an ancient culture and to acquaint the public with the richness and beauty of Native American art.\" The first of two inset black-and-white photographs at the bottom right shows a Hopi village filled with similar stone buildings and terraces with the caption: \"Colter modeled Hopi House after centuries-old villages on the Hopi Reservation.\" At the bottom right, a second photograph shows a half-dozen men and women with their wares seated on an elaborate rug in front of Hopi House with the caption: \"Hopi artisans and their families, in exchange for their artwork and demonstrations, received wages and lodging at Hopi House. Today, various tribes demonstrate traditional dance and art, but they are no longer housed here.\" On the right panel, an old black-and-white photograph shows about 15 well-dressed visitors standing on the El Tovar veranda with a black convertible motorcar parked out front. Text at the top left reads: \"El Tovar Hotel. The El Tovar Hotel was a game changer. Prior to its construction most Grand Canyon visitors slept in tent accommodations on the South Rim. Opening to great fanfare on January 14, 1905, the hotel catered to a wealthy clientele. Imagine guests' delight upon finding a music room, a solarium, a billiard hall, an underground grotto (where men enjoyed a friendly game of cards), a barbershop, two roof gardens, an art room, and gift shop. For $4.50 and upwards per night, guests were treated to finely decorated rooms with both hot and cold running water.\" Text to the right of the photograph reads: \"Keeping with the Santa Fe Railway's affinity for naming their hotels after Spanish explorers, \"El Tovar\" honored Don Pedro de Tovar, who visited the Hopi mesas to the east in 1540.\" A quote from the Coconino Sun from May 24, 1902 at the top right reads: \"The Santa Fe is going to build the most expensive hotel...at the Grand Canyon...the idea of the architect is to bring the building into harmony with the wonderful scenery of the canyon rather than to put a blot upon its beauty by the erection of a conventional structure.\" A second black-and-white photograph inset at the bottom right shows the interior of one of the rooms with two wooden sleigh beds, a couple rocking chairs, a large dresser topped with a mirror, and a smaller vanity. A caption reads: \"Early 20th century visitors enjoyed the comforts and luxuries of the El Tovar.\"",

The interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"Smarter Than Your Average Bear...\" The body text reads, \"... is pretty smart. Black bears are wily omnivores-quick learners who can easily destroy any tent or container to get at your food! Black bears thrive in Shenandoah National Park because the foods they need to eat-acorns, berries, grubs, honey-are plentiful. Human food is bad news for bears, and all Park wildlife. Bears that get human food lose their fear of humans. They are at a much greater risk for being illegally hunted and hit by vehicles. A \"good bear gone bad\" is dangerous to people and may have to be trapped and relocated or even killed by Park staff. Bears have an astounding sense of smell. They also have claws and strong teeth, which means they can make quick work of even a metal cooler. When you're picnicking in bear country, store your food properly and don't leave it unattended, even for a few moments. Remember to put all food and packaging inside your vehicle and dispose of garbage in bear-proof trashcans.\" The text is on top of a bright green background. To the left of the text is an image of a bear surrounded by green ferns, looking straight forward at the viewer. The caption for the image reads, \"Black bear.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\" The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch posters in glass enclosures. Panel 1: Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2: Shenandoah Map This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \" ...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty.

            "audioDescription": "A brown wooden sign that reads \"Story of the Forest Trail\" with an arrow pointing right, leading to a path through the forest. Along the trail there is an interpretive sign near the location of an air quality monitoring station. The Air quality station is located through the woods in a locked enclosure. Within the enclosure are many scientific instruments for collecting rain and air samples. The sign is a 24 by 36 inch color graphic on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The graphic has the title \"Getting to know the air you breathe.\" Above the title is the quote, \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\" -The Lorax, Dr. Seuss. Below the title is the text, \"Every living thing is affected by what's in the air. To protect and improve air quality, it's vital to know what's in the air, how it got there, and how it affects plants, animals, and humans. The Big Meadows air quality station does exactly that. This equipment collects data on weather, visibility, ozone levels, and pollutants in the air. Scientists across the nation use the data to advise protection agencies and lawmakers about regulations that will help reduce pollution and protect the air we breathe. This monitoring station has been providing data for 30 years, giving scientists some of the most valuable information available about trends in air quality over time. The data shows that when strong regulations are in place, the quality of air improves. Cleaner air means cleaner water, healthier lives for plants, animals, and humans, and more beautiful views from the peaks and overlooks of Shenandoah. Learn more about air quality monitoring and what you can do at Byrd Visitor Center, or visit out website: www.nps.gov/shen.\" To the right of the text is a large color photograph with three color photographs below it. The large image shows a view over mountains and out to a valley in three different days with decreasing visibility and haze over the valley. The text below this image reads, \"Spectacular views in Shenandoah's overlooks and mountains draw visitors from around the world. Protecting the views is part of the responsibility of being a national park. Scientists estimate that without pollution you could see 115 miles. But these days, increased haze limits your view to just 23 miles on average. Clear days are a rare treat, with moderate days being the norm. A string of hot, humid days can produce poor visibility that obscures even the closest range. Below, the first image is a photograph of a single green leaf with small spots on it. A caption reads, \"Among national parks, Shenandoah experiences some of the highest ground-level ozone. One of the first signs of damage appears as brown spots on milkweed leaves.\" The second image is a photograph of a waterfall cascading over rocks and into the stream below with the caption, \"Acid rain pollutes our streams and endangers fragile aquatic life. What appear to be clear mountain streams can be lethal to the acid-sensitive fish that live here.\" The third image is a close up photograph of one of the scientific instruments at the air quality station. The caption reads, \"Each piece of equipment collects information that helps scientists understand and fight for what's needed to protect Shenandoah's vital resources. You can help!\" At the bottom of the poster is the note, \"Funded in part by the Shenandoah National Park Trust.\"",

The text reads, \"Camp Red Bird - The Piney River area was home to NP-12, \"Camp Red Bird,\" of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a work-relief program during the Great Depression. From 1935 to 1942, the camp housed hundreds of young men who learned skills, earned much-needed money, and helped build Shenandoah National Park. The building to your right is one of the few remaining original CCC buildings.\" The photograph on the bottom left is a black and white historic picture of Range View Cabin with a man sitting on a stump just beyond the overhang of the shelter. The text reads, \"Range View Cabin - Just down the trail is Range View Cabin, one of six cabins operated by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC). With the exception of the stonework, PATC volunteers built the cabin in 1932. The club hired local stonemason, Charlie Sisk, whose skills were also frequently used at Skyland.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20-inch topographic map of the hikes at Piney River. The trail to Range View Cabin is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Range View Cabin - 1.8-mile round trip, easiest, 1-¼ hours hiking time, 150-foot elevation gain. Follow the Piney Branch Trail to your left.

            "audioDescription": "The Whiteoak Canyon Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white historic photograph of a group of more than 30 early Skyland Resort visitors taken near the head of the falls. The text reads, \"A Popular Playground - The waterfalls of Whiteoak Canyon may well be the reason that Shenandoah National Park even exists. Long before this area was a national park, it was a popular playground for the early visitors to Skyland Lodge. There was even a lodge in the area near the first falls complete with a bridge, a dam, a swimming pool, and bath houses! Fortunately, White Oak Canyon has returned at least partially to its natural state, but remnants of the lodge can still be seen in the stone staircase between the first and second waterfalls.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel shows a hiker on a large boulder overlooking the cascading stream. The text reads, \"A Walk on the Wild Side - White Oak Canyon is home to impressive waterfalls and cascades that range in height from 35 to 86 feet. As you make your way toward the falls, be sure to take in the rugged and wild scene unfolding before you. The canyon's steep gorge and sheer rock walls soar upward from the water while the falls start as a trickle and build into a rush of water that tumbles into the pools below.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Whiteoak Canyon. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Upper White Oak Falls - 4.6-mile round trip, moderate, 3Â½ hour hiking time, 1,040 foot elevation gain. Follow the White Oak Canyon Trail and stay on this trail as you pass the junctions for the Old Rag Fire Road and the Limberlost Trail. About 2.3 miles from the start you will come to a rocky ledge that offers an excellent view of the upper falls. Retrace your steps to return to the parking lot. Remember that the return trip will be very steep.\" \"Hike #2: White Oak Canyon - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 7.3-mile round trip, strenuous, 6 hours hiking time, 2,150 foot elevation gain. Please consider your physical condition and available time before embarking on this hike. Follow the White Oak Canyon Trail past the upper falls for another 1.3 miles down the canyon to the lower falls. Return via the same route. The trail on this section is narrow, rocky, and steep.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. It's dangerous and potentially deadly to climb on the rocks near waterfalls. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitor centers, and www.nps.gov/shen - When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\" A Hiking Difficulty Scale reads: \"Easiest - A hike that is generally suitable for anyone who enjoys walking. Mostly level or with a slight incline. Generally less than 3 miles. Moderate - A moderate hike generally suitable for novice hikers seeking a bit of a challenge. The terrain will involve a moderate incline and may have some steeper sections. Generally 3 to 5 miles. Moderately Strenuous - Generally challenging for an unconditioned person. The terrain will involve a steady and often steep incline. Generally 5 to 8 miles. Strenuous - Will challenge most hikers. The hike will generally be longer and steeper, but may be deemed strenuous because of the elevation gain. Generally 7 to 10 miles. Very Strenuous. Only well-conditioned and well-prepared hikers should attempt. Generally long and steep, and may include rock scrambling, stream crossings, and other challenging terrain. Generally 8 miles and over.\"",

The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch posters in glass enclosures. Panel 1. Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2. Park Map. This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote ‘...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911. At the top and bottom of the graphic are black bars. The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right. The lower black bar has the Leave No Trace logo on the left with the text \"Leave No Trace Principe #6, Respect Wildlife,\" and on the right the text \"www.nps.gov/shen.\" Panel 3. Spring/Summer. The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers labeled \"Wild Columbine,\" and a bird with a white chest and tan head and wings.",

Built in 1832, the Catoctin Aqueduct is the fourth of eleven such “works of art” on the canal.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Catoctin Creek Aqueduct was known as the \"Crooked Aqueduct\" because canal boats had to make a sharp turn to cross it. From its original creation, the Catoctin Creek Aqueduct's structural integrity was questionable. The elliptical arch in the center was not as structurally sound as the semicircle arches on either side. The aqueduct began sagging in the early 1900s. It leaked and was prone to flooding. In 1973, two years after Congress established the C&O Canal National Historical Park, it collapsed, leaving only a small piece standing.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Park Service gathered up the aqueduct’s stones and buried them with the hopes that someday the aqueduct would be restored. Nearly 35 years later, a restoration project gained enough funding to rebuild. The four hundred and fifty-nine stones where uncovered and the engineering crew began to fit the blocks together like a giant 3-demensional puzzle. Each stone was measured, and the crew used those measurements to create foam stones. Historic photos were then used to identify where individual stones were positioned. Missing stones or those in poor condition were replaced. In a little over a year, construction was complete. Today, new viewing areas and waysides allow visitors to learn about the structure and the efforts to rebuild it.",
            "audioDescription": "(268 words) Catoctin Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Jefferson, Maryland. It is 92 feet long with a three-arch construction. This aqueduct has an elliptical center arch with two semicircle arches on either side of the center arch. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 15 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. To get to the aqueduct start from the Lock 29 (Lander) parking lot. Head Northwest from the parking lot to reach the road you drove in on. On the road, head Southwest, about 80 feet, or until you reach the wooden bridge. The pedestrian bridge crosses the middle of lock 29 and has two wooden railings. Continue past the lock to where the towpath intersects with the road, about 10 feet past the lock. Turn right onto the towpath and continue six tenths of a mile until the path forks. To the right is access to the aqueduct waterway. To the left is access to the aqueduct towpath. The waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. Select a path and walk another 350 feet to the aqueduct. On the waterway path you can see stone blocks forming walls on either side of you that are about 6 feet tall. On the towpath you can look down into the waterway on your right or look to the left at the river. The towpath has a fence on the river side and two-foot bumpers on the waterway side.",

On the upper left of the panel is a photograph of a single purple periwinkle blossom amid glossy green leaves. The text reads, \"Home: Before this part of Virginia was called Shenandoah National Park, people lived here and called it home. This land is where they got their sustenance, made their living, raised their families, and buried their dead. You can still see evidence of former human habitation throughout the Park, including here in Fox Hollow. The daffodils and periwinkle you see are gone-wild descendants of plants nurtured by them; the cemetery, too, reminds us that they were here.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel shows 3 tombstones from the Fox family cemetery. The stone in the center of the picture reads, \"Gertrude Fox, Died June 22, 1904, Aged 21 Years\". That stone has been broken near its base and is lying on an angle among the green ground cover. The text reads, \"They Still Speak - There are more than 100 family cemeteries in Shenandoah. Some are still maintained by the descendants of those buried there and some are not. The cemeteries that are not as well maintained might surprise hikers who come across the weathered tombstones in the Park's backcountry. Whether or not they are kept up and taken care of, these cemeteries speak gently to us of the people who made their lives in the hollows and on the ridges of what is now Shenandoah National Park.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Fox Hollow Trail and Snead Farm Loop. The Fox Hollow Trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Fox Hollow Trail, 1.2 mile circuit, easiest, .75 hours hiking time, 310-foot elevation gain. Turn left onto Dickey Ridge Trail, then right onto Fox Hollow Trail. Stay on Fox Hollow Trail - past rock piles and the Fox family cemetery - back to the starting point.\" \"Hike #2: Snead Farm Loop, (This hike is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 3.7 mile circuit, moderate, 2.5 hours hiking time, 580-foot elevation gain. Go right onto the Dickey Ridge Trail. Go left on the Snead Farm Road, which will take you to Snead Barn. Continue on the Snead Farm Loop Trail to its intersection with the Dickey Ridge Trail.

The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets are not allowed on Fox Hollow Trail. Where allowed, pets must be on a leash at all times.

On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken from the forest floor up toward the high, green, canopy with the light of the sky peeking through occasionally. The text reads, \"Safe Harbor: It's different in this hollow. As you descend from the ridge top to South River Falls, you'll notice how things change. Little by little you'll find yourself surrounded by tall, wide trees - tulip trees, sugar maples, and white ashes. If it's spring, you'll smell oink azalea. You might hear the clear whistle and metallic chip of the Louisiana waterthrush, and the \"tsee-tsee-tsee-tsway\" of the American redstart. You're hiking through a specific type of ecosystem: Appalachian Rich Cove Forest. Wet conditions and rich soils provide perfect habitat for the animals and plants that live here. The east-facing slopes get plenty of rain and protection from harsh winds. You can find this environment elsewhere in Shenandoah National Park, but you won't see it outside the Appalachian Mountains.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a handsome Louisiana waterthrush showing the brown stripes on its white breast. The text reads, \"What Thrives Here: Migratory birds favor the wet forest and closed canopy of South River Falls. They travel from as far as Central and South America to live here in the summer. The Louisiana waterthrush, pictured here, is the only bird in the Park that always chooses a streamside habitat like that at South River Falls. The American redstart - a type of warbler - and scarlet tanager also live in these woods. Black cohosh, wild geraniums, and maidenhair fern enjoy the cool, wet forest around South River Falls.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to South River Falls. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1 - South River Falls Observation Point (This trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.) 2.6-mile round trip, moderate, 1.75 hours hiking time, 850-foot elevation gain, one stream crossing.

            "audioDescription": "The South River Falls Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken from the forest floor up toward the high, green, canopy with the light of the sky peeking through occasionally. The text reads, \"Safe Harbor: It's different in this hollow. As you descend from the ridge top to South River Falls, you'll notice how things change. Little by little you'll find yourself surrounded by tall, wide trees - tulip trees, sugar maples, and white ashes. If it's spring, you'll smell oink azalea. You might hear the clear whistle and metallic chip of the Louisiana waterthrush, and the \"tsee-tsee-tsee-tsway\" of the American redstart. You're hiking through a specific type of ecosystem: Appalachian Rich Cove Forest. Wet conditions and rich soils provide perfect habitat for the animals and plants that live here. The east-facing slopes get plenty of rain and protection from harsh winds. You can find this environment elsewhere in Shenandoah National Park, but you won't see it outside the Appalachian Mountains.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a handsome Louisiana waterthrush showing the brown stripes on its white breast. The text reads, \"What Thrives Here: Migratory birds favor the wet forest and closed canopy of South River Falls. They travel from as far as Central and South America to live here in the summer. The Louisiana waterthrush, pictured here, is the only bird in the Park that always chooses a streamside habitat like that at South River Falls. The American redstart - a type of warbler - and scarlet tanager also live in these woods. Black cohosh, wild geraniums, and maidenhair fern enjoy the cool, wet forest around South River Falls.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to South River Falls. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1 - South River Falls Observation Point (This trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.) 2.6-mile round trip, moderate, 1.75 hours hiking time, 850-foot elevation gain, one stream crossing. Take blue-blazed South River Falls Trail. Cross the Appalachian Trail, but stay on the South River Falls Trail to the stone-walled observation point. Retrace your steps to return.\" \"Hike #2: South River Falls Loop (This trail is marked in purple with a brown dashed line.) 3.3 mile circuit , moderate, 2.25 hours hiking time, 910-foot elevation gain, one stream crossing. Take blue-blazed South River Falls Trail. Cross the Appalachian Trail (A.T.), but stay on the South River Falls Trail to the stone-walled falls observation point. Continue on South River Falls Trail to the trail post. Go left at the trail post; the trail is now blazed yellow. At the next trail post, go left. Ascend to the next intersection and trail post, where you will go left onto the white-blazed A.T. Continue south on the A.T. to the next intersection; go right on South River Falls Trail back to the starting point. A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. It's dangerous and potentially deadly to climb on the rocks near waterfalls. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking.\"",

As the lava cooled, it shrank into intriguing six-sided shapes down through its depths, forming columns. Geologists call this columnar jointing. Take the Compton East hike (detailed below) to see an example of columnar jointing, one of the finest in the park.\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is of rocks and lichens in various shades of brown, rust, blue, green, and gray. The test reads, \"Ancient Colors - Fort Windham Rocks and all the greenstone in this area are part of the Catoctin Formation, a series of related lava flows in Virginia, Maryland, and southern Pennsylvania. These rocks are being broken apart, little by little, by the power of ice and frost. Because the rocks at Fort Windham are covered with lichen and weathering rapidly, they feature some fascinating colors.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Compton Peak The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.

Return to the intersection, and continue straight to the east viewpoint. The columnar jointing is underneath the east viewpoint; to see it, follow the blue blazes. This part of the trail is rough and rocky, but very short. When you reach the base of the cliff, look up to see the columnar jointing.

            "bodyText": "<br /> <p>Leetown was one of the earliest settlements in Northwest Arkansas. The town sat in the middle of a broad, wooded plateau bordered by Pea Vine Ridge to the north and the Little Sugar Creek to the south.</p> <p>Leetown was founded in the 1840s by John W. Lee, a farmer from Kentucky. Surgeon D.S. McGugin, of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry, described the hamlet in his after-battle report. McGugin stated that Leetown consisted of \"some fifteen or twenty houses, frame and log, and but one story in height.\" He described a \"small store\", believed to have been owned by Lee, as \"one story and a half high, about thirty feet long, and twenty feet wide.\" Surgeon McGugin noted that, \"In all, the windows were few and very small, admitting little light and an insufficiency of air, even when the sash frames were entirely removed.....They contained but few of the ordinary domestic appliances, and were wholly wanting in the usual necessaries found in more settled regions.\"</p> <p>Directly north of Leetown lay two large farms, owned by George Sturdy and Wiley Foster. To the east of Leetown, on the south side of the Telegraph Road, sat Lewis Pratt's general store, one of three known to be in the region. During the battle, General Samuel Curtis, the Federal Army's commander, used Pratt's Store as his headquarters.</p> <br />   <p>On March 7, 1862, the Federal battleline was only a half-mile north of the village. According to Dr. McGugin, \"all the houses within three miles of the field were taken for hospitals.\"</p> <p>Leetown was devestated by the battle. The fields and woods were filled with the debris of battle and the stench of death filled the air. Many of the families moved to the nearby community of Pea Ridge and rebuilt their lives there.</p> <p>Some families remained and tried to return to life as before the war came. In 1881, the Saint Louis & San Francisco Railroad (the \"Frisco Line\") built a branch line through northwest Arkansas, passing through the town of Rogers about 12 miles to the south. Those who had not left due to the war, now moved to Rogers for the opportunities that the railroad offered. Leetown soon existed only in people's memories.</p>",

Prior to its construction, this site served as the front yard for the house attached to the old commercial building that was just north of here. That building was occupied by a clothing store for many years. Ulseth’s own company occupied the ground floor of this building for many years. The second floor was occupied by the law office of Galbraith & McCormack, as well as the Calumet Township Clerk’s office. Ulseth lived on 8th Street in Red Jacket. He and his family are remembered for their support of the Norwegian Lutheran Church on 7th Street. Ulseth also served as the vice-president of the First National Bank of Calumet for a time. Ulseth owned and probably also built the building to the south of here, which was very similar to this building, and he also owned the buildings to the north of here. In later years, this building was home to a Greyhound bus depot, and a real estate office.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Rising from the Sonoran Desert floor near the Gila River is one of the largest prehistoric structures ever built in North America. Its purpose remains a mystery, though many have tried to understand and explain its existence. What is clear is that the three-story structure was built around 1350 C.E. by the Ancestral Sonoran Desert people and included a vast and complex network of irrigation channels to deliver the Gila River waters to the parched agricultural plots surrounding the \"Great House\". <br /> <br /> In late October of 1775, Commander Anza and Father Font of the overland Anza expedition took a detour from their route to visit Casa Grande with the intention of taking measurements. They were guided by the 'governor of Uturitúc', a nearby O'odham village (Font refers to the people as the Gila Pima). The O'odham are the ancestors of the Casa Grande builders, and the governor of Uturitúc \"narrated ... a story and tradition preserved by the Gila Pimas\". <br /> <br /> Font diligently recorded the story. This interaction with the governor of Uturitúc produced the oldest known historical account of Gila River O'odham cosmology and Casa Grande. <br /> <br /> Font's interpretation of the governor Uturitúc’s story includes subjective comments influenced by his cultural perspective and ethnocentric bias. For instance, Font dismisses the story as \"fables mingled and tangled up with a few Catholic truths\". Even with its embedded biases and unabashed mockery, Font’s description of the story is valuable to the O’odham and to historians and anthropologists of today because it provides a glimpse into the oral history of the O'odham in 1775.<br /> <br /> The journey to Casa Grande on October 30, 1775 was a short day trip by members of the Anza expedition, but the measurements made by Font and the stories that he documented are valuable pieces of the past that can help us interpret the history of this intriguing structure and the people who built it.<br /> <br /> Take your own journey to Casa Grande Ruins National Monument and stand in awe in front of this monumental earthen structure.

The original owners were Zachary and Jenny Fletcher. The two bed room hotel was also used as the first post office, schoolhouse, general store and stage coach station. Later the hotel was used by the Switzer family as a family residence.<br /> <br /> The great plains and grasslands of Kansas lacks an easily accessible source of wood for building which lead to the hotel being made of limestone bricks. These lime stone bricks can viewed on the west side of the structure where the stucco has fallen away. Former Green Bay Packers player Veryl Switizer was raised in the residence in 1930s and 40s. Veryl later became community leader in preserving Nicodemus' historic buildings like the one he grew up in. ",
            "audioDescription": "The Saint Francis Hotel is a two-story building with a front porch and several small windows. The size is approximately 50 feet (15 meters) and 30 feet (9 meters long) The second floor has a slanted roof with a boarded window. The western side of the building has exposed limestone bricks that are bowing outward. Next to the Saint Francis hotel is an interpretive wayside. Written on the wayside: Eager for the word from loved ones back home people gathered at the Saint Francis Hotel when the mail wagon arrived. The right upright section of the buildings was the original limestone ST. Francis Hotel, Nicodemus’ first stone building along the main street. Civil War calvary veteran Zachary T. Fletcher and his wife Jenny came from Kentucky with the first Nicodemus settlers. Initially they were homesteading a few miles west of town. Then in 1881 hopeful that a railroad would promote business Fletcher and his brother Thomas built this hotel. The St. Francis was often full. Lodging for the homesteaders and travelers was hard to find. Jenny Fletcher prepared hot meals for hotel guests. She also ran a millinery (hat) shop and later served as postmaster.",

The text reads, \"Allow Me to (Re)Introduce Myself - The Park's resource protection mission makes it a superb place to reintroduce wildlife. In 1989 Shenandoah first tried to bring endangered peregrine falcons-once permanent residents-back to this part of the Appalachians. Young birds were released from several spots, in hopes that some would return to the Park to live. So you might find this once-endangered bird of prey soaring over Stony Man!\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is a view of the Passamaquoddy Trail showing a large rock outcropping, the lush mountain foliage, and a portion of the Valley to the west. The text reads, \"Abounding in Pollock' - Passamaquoddy Trail meanders under Stony Man Cliffs, past alluring geology and, in winter, amazing drapery-like ice formations. George Pollock had the trail built in 1932 and so named it because, he said, Passamaquoddy' is a Maine Indian word for abounding in Pollock' (a kind of fish)-and more or less after himself, since it's not likely there were any fish on this streamless trail!\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Stony Man. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Stony Man Trail - 1.6-mile lariat, easiest, 1 hour hiking time, 340-foot elevation gain. Pets are not allowed on this trail. Take the blue- and white-blazed Stony Man Trail/Appalachian Trail (A.T.). At the trail post continue onto the blue-blazed Stony Man Trail to the viewpoint. To continue the loop, take the blue-blazed Stony Man Trail back to the junction with the A.T., and follow the A.T. back to the starting point. At the viewpoint, you'll overlook the Shenandoah Valley, the town of Luray, and the Massanutten and Allegheny Mountains beyond.\" \"Hike #2: Passamaquoddy Loop - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 3.5-mile circuit, moderate, 2-½ hours hiking time, 770-foot elevation gain. Walk to the other end of Stony Man parking. Look for the trail post; go straight on the yellow-blazed Furnace Spring Horse Trail. At the next trail post, go right onto the blue-blazed Passamaquoddy Trail. At the next trail post, go right onto the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south to your starting point at Stony Man parking.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! - Pets are not allowed on Stony Man Trail. Where allowed, pets must be on a leash at all times. - Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. - Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. - Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitor centers, and www.nps.gov/shen - When you return from your hike, check for ticks. - Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. - Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.",

In the parking lot, head to the South West corner of the lot where a small access trail will lead you to the towpath. Walk about 30 feet on the access path and turn right (West) onto the towpath. Walk about 80 feet on the towpath to reach the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct, you will be walking in the canal waterway. On your left, the wall that makes the side of the waterway sits about 4 feet tall. On top of this wall is the original towpath. A metal fence sits on the far side of this original towpath, between the towpath and the drop to the creek. On the right, the canal wall no longer exists, giving an unobstructed view of Town Creek. There is no barrier between the path and the drop.",

Built on this site in 1895 by William Owen \"Buckey\" O'Neill, the 2-room office and bunkhouse—complete with v-notched logs, rough mortar chinking, and a native stone chimney—was the rustic home of Buckey and his wife while they operated a small hotel on the South Rim. The consummate entrepreneur, Buckey improved the Bright Angel Trail and camp at Indian Garden and promoted the Grand Canyon Railroad to benefit both his tourism and mining interests.<br /> <br /> Buckey O'Neill died in Cuba in 1898 during the Battle of San Juan Hill, fighting with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. After his death, the cabin was bought by entrepreneur James Thurber, who owned and operated the nearby Bright Angel Hotel. Thurber incorporated the cabin as part of his hotel, connecting the two structures first with a large circus tent and later with an actual wooden frame building. The hotel, including Buckey's cabin, was sold to Martin Buggeln in 1901, and was later acquired by the Santa Fe Railroad after the completion of the El Tovar Hotel in 1905. The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today. The architect of the Bright Angel Lodge and its associated cabins, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, decided to renovate Buckey O'Neill's cabin as a guest lodge. It remains operating as one of Bright Angel Lodge's active guest cabins to this day.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Facing the edge of Grand Canyon, this 1-story cabin built of v-notched wood logs sits on a low stone foundation. The shallow-pitched roof is covered with wood shingles, and there is a native stone chimney at the right. The 2-room cabin features 2 lime-sherbet-green painted wood screen doors on either side of a central vertical row of interleaved logs, with a matching 5-foot (1.5 m) tall double sash window at the far left and right. Touch the sides of the cabin to feel the smooth brown logs. Touch the interweaved logs at the center of the structure and at the corners of the building to feel how the cabin was constructed. A black-and-white photograph of Buckey O'Neill's cabin fills the center of a 3-foot (1 m) tall angled-metal wayside panel. In front of the cabin, a 4-foot (1.2 m) tall 3-rail wooden fence sits perched at edge of the canyon rim. Text at the top left of the panel reads: \"Buckey's Cabin This cabin is the only remaining building from the early pioneer settlement era of Grand Canyon Village. Built on this site in 1895 by William Owen \"Buckey\" O'Neill, the two-room office and bunkhouse - complete with v-notched logs, rough mortar chinking, and a native stone chimney - was the rustic home of Buckey and his wife while they operated a small hotel here on the South Rim. The consummate entrepreneur, Buckey improved the Bright Angel Trail and camp at Indian Garden and promoted the Grand Canyon railroad to benefit both his tourism and mining interests.\" At the lower left, a quote by Theodore Roosevelt, praising fellow \"Rough Rider\" Buckey O'Neill reads: \"A born soldier, a born leader of men. He was a wild, reckless fellow, soft-spoken, and of dauntless courage and boundless ambition...” A black-and-white photograph inset at the right shows a man in a military uniform with a wide-brimmed hat sitting astride a black horse. Text above and below the picture reads: \"At age 19, Buckey O'Neill's restless spirit drove him from Washington, DC, to the western territories in 1879. There he worked as a lawyer, newspaperman, sheriff, mayor, superintendent of public schools, gambler, miner, congressional candidate, adventurer, and soldier. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Buckey signed up and served as one of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Rough Riders.\" He was killed in action on July 1, 1898.\"",

            "audioDescription": "Along the Rim Trail near the El Tovar Hotel, a 12- by 14-inch (30- by 35-cm) bronze plaque set in a stone masonry pedestal sits attached to the limestone wall along the edge of the canyon. An inscription reads: \"Trans Canyon Telephone Line built in 1935 by CCC workers, maintained by Mountain Bell, has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, by the United States Department of the Interior.\" Peering over the edge of the wall, a two-foot (60 cm) tall galvanized pole can be seen sticking out of the ground with a metal crossbar. A copper wire runs across the top of the crossbar. An old black-and-white picture in the center of a nearby three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel shows a man perched atop a similar, taller steel pole steadied by a second man on the ground. Text at the left reads: \"CCC Legacy. The nearby plaque commemorates an amazing feat achieved by members of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) in the 1930s - construction of a telephone line spanning the entire width of Grand Canyon. One of the poles still stands behind this wall. Beginning in 1934, CCC enrollees worked through winter snow and summer heat to survey and clear a right-of-way roughly following the Bright Angel and North Kaibab trails. Supplied by pack mules, they set 592 galvanized pipe telephone poles and completed stringing the 18 miles (29 km) of copper-weld wire in 1935.\" A quote from Robert L. Robeson, a CCC Enrollee, at the top right of the panel reads: \"Maybe those mountains are hard to climb. Those trees so hard to cut. But the air is pure, the water fine. And we're climbing right out of the rut...For besides helping ourselves, you see. We are helping Mother and Dad.\" Two additional black-and-white pictures inset at the right of the panel show workers building the stone wall before you, and a line of flat-bed trucks filled with young men. A caption reads: \"At Grand Canyon, today's visitors still benefit from the labor and skills of seven CCC companies. During the Great Depression, these young men constructed trails, roads, walls, fences, reservoirs, fire towers, buildings, power lines, telephone lines, and more.\"",

            "bodyText": "<p>Geologically speaking, Grand Canyon is considered to be a \"young\" feature, much of it having been eroded in just the last 5-6 million years. But the ages of Grand Canyon's rocks are a different matter entirely, spanning over 1.5 billion years of Earth's history. The oldest known rock in Grand Canyon, known as the Elves Chasm Gneiss, is located deep in the canyon's depths as part of the Vishnu Basement Rocks and clocks in at an ancient 1.84 billion years old. The youngest of Grand Canyon's rock layers, the Kaibab Formation, forms the rims of the canyon and is a mere 270 million years old. But that's still even older than the dinosaurs!<br /> <br /> This interpretive exhibit along the Trail of Time discusses some of the methods geologists use to determine the ages of rocks, tools which are part of a field within the science of geology known as geochronology. This stop also offers an opportunity to actually see and touch a piece of the Elves Chasm Gneiss, the oldest known rock in Grand Canyon.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Moving east along the Trail of Time from the Village, a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel sits to the left of a roughly one-foot square chunk of black and gray striated igneous rock mounted on a 15-inch (38 cm) square concrete pedestal on the ground. Text at the top of the panel reads: \"Grand Canyon's rocks are incredibly old. Grand Canyon's oldest known rock is called the Elves Chasm Gneiss (pronounced \"NICE\") and it is 1,840 million years old.\" On the left of the panel, a caption under a color photograph looking out towards Maricopa Point from your present location reads: \"Imagine how old? The 1,840 million-year-old Elves Chasm Gneiss is almost unimaginably old, yet it is only two-fifths the age of the Earth. To reach the 4,560 million-year age of the Earth along the Trail of Time, walk west 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles), to Maricopa Point.\" A graphic in the center of the panel shows a central cluster of blue and red circles being orbited by five black circles along separate elliptical lines. A caption reads: \"How do we know? Geologists can tell how old a rock is by counting the atoms produced by natural radioactive decay.\" Referring to the rock sample at your right, text on the right side of the panel continues: \"Touch a rock that is 1,840 million years old. This rock sample came from the bottom of the canyon 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of here.\" Next to a color photograph showing a layer of similar rock beside the Colorado riverbed, a caption reads: \"This rock was first formed as granite when magma cooled 1,840 million years ago. Pressure and heat then changed it into gneiss (pronounced NICE) about 1,700 million years ago.\" A map of the Trail of Time runs along the bottom of the panel. Text below the map reads: \"You are on a timeline. 1 long step = 1 million years.\" A graphic of the V-shaped Trail of Time portal rock column at the bottom right asks, \"Where in the rock record?\" An arrow points just above the bottom of the column with the label, \"1,840 million years ago.\"",

            "bodyText": "The Filipino Christian Church in Los Angeles was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Constructed in 1909 for the Union Avenue M.E. Church, the building was acquired by the Filipino Christian Church in 1950 and has been in continuous use by the Filipino community since that time. <br /> <br /> The history of the Filipino Christian Church and its predecessor organization, the Filipino Christian Fellowship, dates back to the first wave of Filipino immigration to Los Angeles, and its story largely parallels that of Filipino Americans in the greater Los Angeles region more broadly. Founded in 1928, the Filipino Christian Fellowship was formed by a group of young Filipino men enrolled at California Christian College. The Filipino Christian Fellowship was the first organization in Los Angeles established to serve the spiritual needs of the city’s earliest Filipino immigrants, who found themselves socially isolated by discriminatory practices that restricted where they could live, work, and worship. In 1933, the Fellowship was re-organized as a formal church. Over two decades, the Filipino Christian Church was forced to move from place to place, from Little Manila to Bunker Hill to Temple-Figueroa, often due to City redevelopment projects that demolished various neighborhoods in and around downtown Los Angeles. Finally, in 1950, the Filipino Christian Church acquired the former Union Avenue M.E. Church in the Temple-Beverly corridor as their permanent home. The Filipino Christian Church’s move to the Temple-Beverly corridor ultimately led to other Filipino organizations and institutions relocating to the area, which became known as Historic Filipinotown.<br /> <br /> As more Filipino immigrants began arriving in Los Angeles after the World War II, the Filipino Christian Church became a receiving ground of sorts, a place of welcome where new arrivals could congregate and socialize, regardless of faith, bonded by their common ancestry. For those with no place to stay, the parsonage might become a temporary home for a few days until more permanent housing arrangements could be made. During this time, it was an aging church building, so maintenance and repair became an ongoing challenge. Dedicated members of the congregation devoted countless volunteer hours to the building’s upkeep. The men and women of the Filipino Christian Church voluntarily and unselfishly made sure that these needs were taken care of on a weekly basis. They understood the importance of keeping their place of worship and fellowship in good condition and ready before any special occasion and before the next Sunday came. <br /> <br /> Since its inception, the Filipino Christian Church has played a vital role in the civic and cultural advancement of the Filipino American community, drawing its membership from various Christian denominations throughout the Greater Los Angeles region. In its early years, the Filipino Christian Church served as a central meeting place for Filipinos seeking to socialize with their fellow countrymen and promoting ethnic pride among new immigrants and American-born Filipinos. Some of the most active Church members also founded or served as officers in other Filipino-serving community groups, from social service organizations to groups dedicated to promoting cultural and ethnic pride. The acquisition of the church building on Union Avenue allowed the Filipino Christian Church to take on an even larger role in the community. With its basement-level social hall and various ancillary spaces, the Filipino Christian Church became a community center, donating space to various local groups and hosting countless events. The Filipino Christian Church was the birthplace of some of the most important organizations serving the Filipino American community. Members of the Filipino Christian Church served as early presidents of the Filipino Community of Los Angeles (later the Filipino American Community of Los Angeles, or FACLA), one of the earliest Filipino American organizations in the country. The formation of FACLA marks the beginning of a long-standing and continuing trend of Filipino Christian Fellowship and Church members serving as prominent community leaders, pioneering and actively participating in numerous Filipino organizations. Filipino Christian Church members founded the local chapter of the Filipino American National Historical Society (FANHS), which held its meetings at the church. The Filipino Cultural School, a volunteer dance and cultural troupe, used the Church’s social hall as its rehearsal space during its early years.<br /> The Filipino Christian Church became one of the most prominent social, religious and cultural centers for the local Filipino community, serving as an important catalyst for the development and expansion of the surrounding Filipinotown ethnic community during the second half of the twentieth century.",

Curtis selected the Lewis Pratt’s general store as his headquarters and erected his command tents nearby. Beside the store, it is believed that there were several other buildings on the site, possibly including a house, barn and a shed.On the morning of March 7, Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis was conferring with his leaders when he was interrupted by a messenger stating that the Confederates were in force to the north of Leetown along the Ford Road. Curtis directed Colonel Peter Osterhaus to take his division to investigate the activity along the Ford Road. As Osterhaus left the tent, another messenger entered reporting that another force was marching south along the Telegraph Road directly towards Curtis's vulnerable supply trains at the Elkhorn Tavern. Curtis looked out of his tent and saw Colonel Grenville Dodge's brigade standing outside. Curtis directed Dodge's commander, Colonel Eugene Carr, to take the brigade north and intercept the second Confederate force.Carr confidently stated that he would clear the Confederates out in an hour.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "The Milam Gap Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white photograph of a man in bib overalls standing by a roadside fruit stand selling apples and apple cider. The text reads, \"Apple of Their Eye - Apples were a cash crop for the people who lived in what is now Shenandoah National Park. Former residents raised different types of apples - some of which were actually created here - including the Milam, for which this gap is named. The Milam apple was probably developed in an orchard very near where you stand right now.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a black and white photograph of President Herbert Hoover fly-fishing in one of the mountain streams that ran through his property. The text reads, \"Fit for a President. The Park's clear mountain streams host a variety of fish species, including native eastern brook trout. Fly-fisherman and U.S. President Herbert Hoover chose a site two miles east of here, at the headwaters of the Rapidan River, for his weekend retreat because of its proximity to these streams and their trout. Rapidan Camp was built in 1929 and gave the 31st President the perfect place to practice his favorite pastime.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Rapidan Camp. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Mill Prong - Rapidan Camp. 4-mile round trip, moderate, 2.75 hours hiking time, 870-foot elevation gain, 3 stream crossings. Go left on the Appalachian Trail south, and cross Skyline Drive. Go left on the blue-blazed Mill Prong Trail. Turn right on Mill Prong Horse Trail. Explore the camp, and then retrace your steps to Milam Gap parking.\" \"Hike #2: Appalachian Trail - Tanners Ridge. The trail is marked in purple with a dashed line. 2.1-mile round trip, easiest, 1.5 hours hiking time, 175-foot elevation gain. Go right on the Appalachian Trail north to Tanners Ridge Road. Return by the same route to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams in icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Leave what you find. Artifacts are protected by law. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking. Please respect family cemeteries.\"",

            "bodyText": "<p>Louis D. Boucher, the \"hermit\" of Hermit Creek basin, lived in this area for 20 years. Boucher built the Boucher Trail (west of the Hermit Trail) and seasonal residences at Dripping Springs and near Boucher Creek. Though socially active in the South Rim community, residents labeled Boucher a hermit because he lived alone.<br /> <br /> The modern trailhead is located just west of Hermits Rest. Follow the dirt road from the restrooms to make your way to the trailhead. <strong>There is no parking for day hikers at this trailhead when the Hermit (Red) Route shuttle is active; day hikers must ride the free shuttle bus to reach the trailhead.</strong><br /> <br /> <b>For experienced desert hikers only.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Water from springs must be purified.</b><br /> <br /> Allow extra hiking time; <b>conditions are more difficult than on the Bright Angel and South Kaibab Trails</b>.</p> <h3>Trail Desciption</h3>   <p>The upper section of the Hermit Trail is quite steep, dropping almost 2,000 vertical feet (610 m) in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). Passage through the Kaibab Formation and Coconino Sandstone is via well-defined switchbacks. Most of the Hermit Trail was originally surfaced with large hand-fitted rock slabs that created a smooth walking surface. Ongoing erosion has claimed much of this remarkably labor-intensive paving, but a few isolated fragments survive, especially in the Coconino Sandstone. Fossilized animal tracks have been noted in many locations throughout the canyon, but they were first studied in detail along the Hermit Trail. Observant hikers can see a few of these fossilized lizard-like tracks in the lower half of the Coconino Sandstone.<br /> <br /> The trail enters Waldron Basin, a quiet, isolated pocket within the Hermit side canyon, at 1.2 miles (1.9 km). The Waldron Trail junction is encountered soon after at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), followed by the Dripping Springs Trail junction at 1.75 miles (2.8 km). To continue on the Hermit Trail, stay right at both junctions. Dripping Springs, however, does make an excellent day hike destination. After the Dripping Springs trail junction, the Hermit Trail drops down along the east side of Hermit Creek gorge. Santa Maria Spring is reached at 2.5 miles (4 km) along the trail, offering a trickle of water and a historic masonry rest house which provides welcome shade during the summer.<br /> <br /> Continuing on the Hermit Trail past this point is generally not recommended for a day hike during the summer. During cooler months, Lookout Point, an additional 1.5 miles (2.4 km) down the trail from Santa Maria Spring, is also a reasonable single-day option for those seeking a longer hike. Between Santa Maria Spring and the top of the Redwall Limestone at Cathedral Stairs, the Hermit Trail is characterized by long traverses through the Supai Formation. This section of the trail is tucked up against the west facing walls of the south rim and offers hikers a period of extended shade during the hotter months.<br /> <br /> At Cathedral Stairs, the descent becomes unrelenting. An endless series of rocky switchbacks eventually leads hikers through the Redwall cliff and down the west-facing talus below Cope Butte to the intersection with the Tonto Trail. The Tonto Trail is an important Inner Canyon route that allows access in both directions along the Tonto Platform, east to Monument Creek, west to Hermit Creek. Turn left (west) and follow the Tonto Trail about a mile to the Hermit Creek campsite. Be sure to walk downstream a short distance during your stay at Hermit Creek, or even descend all the way to the Colorado River at Hermit Rapid.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Waldron Basin</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,240 feet (378 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring Trail Junction</strong><br /> 3.6 miles (5.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3-4 hours / 1370 feet (418 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Maria Spring</strong><br /> 5 miles (8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 1,680 feet (512 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring</strong> (via the Dripping Spring Trail)<br /> 7 miles (11.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 5-7 hours / 1040 feet (317 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Breezy Point</strong><br /> 11 miles (17.7 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,220 feet (677 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Tonto Trail Junction</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Tonto Trail Junction and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 14 miles (22.5 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,430 feet (1,045 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hermit Creek</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Hermit Creek and back in a day. </em><em>Water requires purification.</em></strong><br /> 16.4 miles (26.4 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,740 feet (1,140 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Colorado River / Hermit Rapids</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to the Colorado River and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 19.4 miles (31.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4.340 feet (1,323 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>A spring-fed water station is available near the vault toilets along the gravel road that leads to the Hermit Trail parking area. Santa Maria Spring, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) down the trail, offers year-round spring water. Dripping Springs, 7 miles (11.3 km) down the trail (via the Dripping Springs side trail), also offers year-round spring water. Hermit Creek is a perennial water source for those descending down the trail for a stay at the backcountry campsites there. Water from any natural sources in Grand Canyon, including springs, creeks, and the Colorado River, must be purified before drinking.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>From March 1st to November 30th, access to the Hermit Road is restricted to shuttle buses only. However, backpackers with a valid backcountry permit for the Hermit or Boucher Trails are allowed access by personal vehicle during this time. To gain access to the Hermit Road, please enter the numerical code provided by the Backcountry Information Center. Drive eight miles (12.9 km) west along Hermit Road to Hermits Rest then continue on the dirt road 0.25 miles (0.4 km) to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> From December 1st through the end of February, the Hermit Road is open to all traffic. The park shuttle buses do not operate along the Hermit Road during this time.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>any</strong> camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> The only legal places to camp in the Hermit Creek drainage are the designated campsites at Hermit Creek (BM7, toilet on site) and Hermit Rapids (BM8, no toilet). A sign with a prominent \"L\" marks the large group site near the toilet at BM7. Large groups of 7-11 people must use this site. At-large camping is not permitted along the Hermit Trail.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Grand Canyon Quad (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day. From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately. In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting - sip fluids only when thirsty. Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>- a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Much of the pioneer history in northern Arizona revolves around various schemes of development to promote and capitalize on the beauty and intrigue of Grand Canyon. The Hermit Creek basin was the scene of one of the most aggressive of these improvement efforts. Initiated by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911, this program involved development of the rim and also included the construction of what was, at the time, a state-of-the-art rim-to-river trail.<br /> <br /> The Hermit Trail was built to serve a luxury campsite near Hermit Creek. Hermit Camp predated Phantom Ranch by 10 years and in its heyday was complete with a tramway from the rim, a functional automobile for transportation within the facility, and a Fred Harvey Company chef. Operations ceased in 1930, but for two decades Hermit Camp was the last word in gracious tourism below the rim. As is always the case at Grand Canyon, time and erosion have taken a heavy toll. The old Hermit Trail is today a mere shadow of its former self, but for experienced and knowledgeable canyon backpackers, the walk offers a direct link to the excitement and romance of the early days at Grand Canyon.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A rock and pebble-strewn path leads a quarter-mile (400 m) from Hermits Rest west along the rim of Grand Canyon to the Hermit Trail Trailhead. There are a few picnic tables in an open area along the way. Near the trailhead is a small parking lot for vehicles with government-issued handicap placards and backpackers with valid permits for overnight camping. A vertical wayside panel at the trailhead reads: \"Welcome to Hermit Trail. The Hermit trail was originally built by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911 and provided access to the developed Hermit Camp and Waldron Basin tourist areas. This unmaintained trail is difficult, steep, and secluded. It is not recommended to hike to the river and back in one day. Please visit the Backcountry Information Center for overnight camping and permitting information.\" Continuing down the left-hand side of the panel is a Hermit Trail Day Hiking Guide listing several destinations, their distances, elevation change, approximate hours, and associated facilities. A list of standard trail courtesy appears below that. At the top right of the panel, a black and red circle surrounds a black-and-white image of Grand Canyon with large white letters urging you to \"Hike Smart\". Text on the right side of the panel asks: \"Do You Have a Realistic Plan? Grand Canyon National Park assists more than 600 hikers during the hot summer months and helicopter rescues an additional 150 people... You are responsible for your safety and the safety of your friends and family. Rescue is not a guarantee. Have You Checked the Weather? Summer temperatures in the shade reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) at Indian Garden and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius) at Phantom Ranch. In winter, temperatures drop below freezing with steep, icy trails requiring shoe traction devices. How Much Food and Water Should You Bring? Your body needs energy - balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success...\" At the bottom right, the panel states: \"Pets are not allowed on the trails. If you wish to take a service animal with you, please check in at the Backcountry Information Center. Never approach, touch, or feed any animal. It is dangerous...and illegal to do so.\"",

The text below reads, Hike #1: Old Rag Summit, 9.2-mile circuit, very strenuous, 7-½ hours hiking time, 2,380-foot elevation gain. From the parking area, make a left onto Route 600. Pass the Nicholson Hollow Trailhead and continue to the Ridge Trail. Make a left and continue on the Ridge Trail, crossing the rock scramble to the summit. Be very careful as the footing along the Ridge Trail is challenging, especially in the rock scramble area. Descend from the summit on the Saddle Trail. Continue to follow this path as you pass Old Rag Shelter and the trail becomes a fire road. At the trail intersection, make a right and immediately turn right again to follow Weakley Hollow Fire Road. Continue on this fire road and stay straight on the intersection with Route 600 back to this location. Hike #2: Robertson Mountain, 7.8 mile circuit, strenuous, 6 -½ hours hiking time, 2,130-foot elevation gain. From the parking area, make a left onto Route 600. Pass the Nicholson Hollow Trailhead and continue straight on to the Weakley Hollow Fire Road. Take Weakley Hollow Fire Road to Robertson Mountain Trail. Follow the Robertson Mountain Trail to the summit and descend to the Old Rag Fire Road. Turn left onto Old Rag Fire Road and then another left onto Weakley Hollow Fire Road. Continue on this fire road and stay straight on the intersection with Route 600 back to this location. This hike includes one of the steepest sections of trails in the park, but it is a good alternative for hikers in good physical condition who want a pet-friendly hike with excellent views.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets are not allowed on the Ridge and Saddle Trails.

The top of the aqueduct has two parts, a water way for canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 20 feet wide and has two parallel walls. The canal part is about five-feet-deep. Atop the Eastern wall is the towpath. To get to Aqueduct, start at the Fifteenmile Creek Aqueduct parking lot. Once at the parking lot, head to the Southernmost point of the lot, toward the entrance road. Once there, turn right onto the entrance road. Walk about 100 feet toward the towpath, which intersects the entrance road. Turn left onto the towpath. Walk about 450 feet along the towpath to reach the aqueduct. You will walk over the aqueduct in the canal waterway. Stone block walls that are about 5 feet tall line the sides of the path. On top of the left most wall is the original mule towpath. There is a metal fence on the outside edge of the historic towpath.",

            "bodyText": "The C&O Canal aqueducts are “water bridges” that carried canal boats over the creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built between 1836 and 1838, the Licking Creek Aqueduct is the seventh of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. It was the first single arch aqueduct to be built on the canal. The Canal company described the 90-foot aqueduct as “one of the longest, if not the longest aqueduct arch” in the United States. It was later surpassed by the 297-foot arch of the Cabin John aqueduct at mile 7.6.",
            "audioDescription": "(211) The Licking Creek Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Big Pool, Maryland. It has a single, 90-foot arch. The top of the aqueduct has two parts, a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 11 feet wide and its bottom is about four feet lower than the towpath. To get to Licking Creek Aqueduct, start at the Handcock Visitor Center parking lot (about 6.5 miles from the aqueduct). From the parking lot, walk about 80 feet to the east and turn left (South) onto the towpath access road. Follow the road about 300 feet, until the path meets the towpath. Turn left (east) onto the towpath. The lock is 6.5 miles down the towpath. Once on the aqueduct, you will be walking in the canal waterway. On your right, the wall that makes the side of the waterway sits about 4 feet tall. On top of the wall is the original towpath. A metal fence sits on the far side of the towpath, between the path and the drop to the creek. On the left, the canal wall no longer exists, giving an unobstructed view of Licking Creek. There is no barrier between the path and the drop.",

Built in 1834, the Antietam Aqueduct is the fifth of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. The 140-foot long structure has three elliptical arches and was made with limestone from a nearby quarry. It’s located near Antietam Battlefield and was damaged by the Confederates during General Jubal Early’s invasion of Maryland in 1864.",
            "audioDescription": "(193 words) Antietam Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Sharpsburg, Maryland. It is 140 feet long with a three-arch construction. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 15 feet wide and its bottom is about four feet lower than the towpath. To get to the aqueduct start from the Antietam Creek Parking Lot. From the parking lot head towards the wooden pedestrian bridge that passes over a small creek to the towpath. The bridge is at the midway point of the western edge of the lot. The bridge has wooden railings on both sides. Walk across the bridge and turn left onto the towpath. Follow the towpath for three tenths of a mile to reach the aqueduct. Here the towpath narrows to about three feet. On your left is a drop of about five feet to the bottom of the canal waterway. There is no barrier between the towpath and the drop. On your right you can see the Antietam creek flowing into the Potomac River. There is a metal rail between the towpath and the river.",

The Sideling Hill Creek Aqueduct, built between 1837 and 1840, is the ninth of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. The 70-foot long structure spans the Sideling Hill Creek, which marks the boundary between Washington and Allegany County.",
            "audioDescription": "(230 words) The Sideling Hill Creek Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Hancock, Maryland. It has a single, 75-foot-long arch. The top of the aqueduct has two parts, a water way that once canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 20 feet wide and had two walls, which created a six-foot-deep canal. Atop the southern wall is the towpath mules use to travel on. To get to the aqueduct start from the Lock 56 parking lot. Head to the Southwest corner of the lot to reach an access trail to the towpath. Walk about 80 feet on the access trail and then turn right (west) onto the towpath. Walk 6 tenths of a mile to the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct, you will be walking in the canal waterway. On your left, the wall that makes the side of the waterway sits about six feet tall. On top of this wall is the original towpath. A metal fence sits on top of the wall, on the far side towpath, between the towpath and the drop to the creek. On the right, the canal wall no longer exists, giving an unobstructed view of Sideling Creek. In the distance a metal bridge crosses the creek. You can also see concrete and metal bracers stabilizing the aqueduct. There is no barrier between the path and the drop.",

I walked along Berrien Street till I came to the only house in the United States where I could open a door without knocking and walk in for a kiss from the woman of the house. They gave me a sitdown and as they had had only two or three letters from me, they asked me where I had been and I told them the half of it. When I showed my father fifteen dollars and a few nickels, he said the money would come in handy and I should watch it. What had the trip done to me? I couldn’t say. It had changed me. I was easier about looking people in the eye. When questions came I was quicker at answering them or turning them off. I had been a young stranger meeting many odd strangers and I had practiced at having answers... Away deep in my heart now I had hope as never before. Struggles lay ahead, I was sure, but whatever they were I would not be afraid of them.",

Prior to  his Hobo adventure Sandburg had only traveled as far as  Chicago. He was drawn to head west to Kansas, in time for the wheat harvest, where there would surely be work. Along the way, he would stop to find odd jobs to fund his travels and to keep food in his belly. Sandburg left his friends and family in Galesburg Ill on the last week of June in 1897, he returned to his hometown on October 15th of that same year.  In reference to his hobo travels, Sandburg wrote, I was meeting fellow traveler's and fellow Americans and  what they were doing to my heart and mind, my personality; I could not say then nor later and be certain. I was getting a deeper self-respect than I had in Galesburg, so much I knew. I was getting to be a better storyteller! Quotes used in this tour are Sandburg's own from \"Always the Young Stranger\".

            "audioDescription": "A boardwalk leads away from the parking area through patchy dune grasses. The beach is not visible from this location, but a low dune about 100 yards distant suggests its presence. A number of safety signs flank the entrance to the boardwalk.One sign announces no lifeguard on duty.A sign beneath it instructs swimmers to avoid rip currents. If a swimmer is caught in a rip current, the sign advises the swimmer to swim crossways to the current, parallel to the shore.Two larger interpretive and orientation panels provide in-depth narrative.Interpretive panel: Life on a Barrier Island.Text at the top of this slanted graphic panel reads, \"As you cross this barrier island, notice differences in elevation and how the vegetation and wildlife change. Between the gulf and sound, the island consists of four major habitats: beach, dunes, woodlands, and salt marshes. Some animals, like raccoons and foxes, may be seen in more than one habitat. Stay on Path. Constantly reshaped by waves, currents, winds, and sands, these barrier island habitats are extremely fragile.\"Across the middle of the panel is a row of four photographs showing the different habitats. Beginning at the left, the first shows a white sandy beach, one small tuft of sea oats in the foreground and dark blue water visible in the back ground. The caption reads, \"Waves and prevailing winds build the beach, providing nesting sites for sea turtles and shorebirds, which feed on crabs and clams.\"The next picture shows low rolling sand dunes with scattered grasses and a few shrubs. The caption reads, \"Sea oats take root, helping to form and stabilize primary dunes. Rainwater collects in swales, providing moisture for wildflowers. Here you may see beach mice, red-winged blackbirds, and butterflies.\"The third picture shows higher dunes with lots of vegetation and some small trees. The caption reads, \"Shrubs and trees colonize old, secondary dunes, creating woodlands. Look for hawks, woodpeckers, buntings, snakes, and salamanders.\"The last picture shows a view across flat ground covered with thick grasses and with scattered tall tree trunks. The caption reads, \"Salt marshes form in the brackish waters on the island's north side, attracting herons, kingfishers, and clapper rails.\"Across the bottom of the panel are six photographs showing various animals to be found on the island. Beginning at the left the first shows two ghost crabs with pale bodies and back eyes. The next shows a green darner insect clinging to a reed. It has long narrow transparent wings and a very long thin tail colored turquoise-blue with black specks. The next picture shows a beach mouse, a small rodent nestled in a shallow hole in the sand. It is brown with a white face and throat.The fourth picture shows a green tree frog perched on a leaf. It is bright green with white and black stripes down its side. Next is a belted kingfisher. The long-billed bird sits on a small branch. Its head with its crest is gray as is its back. It has a white band around its throat and brown and rust-colored marking on its breast. The last picture shows a racoon with its gray body and black mask around its eyes. It stands half submerged amid grasses at water's edge.Orientation panel: Beach Safety.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall and has text in both English and Spanish. Text at the top reads, \"In just a few minutes a wonderful day at the beach can turn into a disaster. Stay alert for sudden storms and marine life that could sting or bite. Watch your children. In emergencies, dial 911.\"At the bottom is a photograph with labels showing the smooth water of a rip current as it flows away from shore between two sandbars covered by white frothy waves. On the far side arrows point sideways in both directions with a label reading \"Swim to the side.\" Text below the picture reads, \"Rip Currents Kill. Rip currents commonly form after storms. If you are caught in a rip current, stay calm. Do not try to swim against the current. Swim right or left to escape the flow.\"Down the left side of the panel are specific warnings, each with a small photograph as illustration. Text reads, \"Avoid overexposure to the sun, especially between 10 am and 2 pm. Use sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, and long sleeves to protect skin. Drink plenty of water to help prevent dehydration.\" (Picture of the sun.)\"Thunderstorms develop quickly. If swimming or fishing, get out of the water immediately and seek shelter.\" (Picture of lightning.)\"Jellyfish and sea nettles can inflict painful stings. To reduce pain apply vinegar and do not touch.\" (Picture of a jellyfish.)\"Sharks are present in park waters. Do not swim at dawn, dusk, or night. Avoid schools of fish.\" (Picture of a shark.)\"Be aware of stingrays. Shuffle your feet while wading. Avoid grass beds and murky water. Soak puncture wounds in hot water.\" (Picture of a stingray.)",

Built from 1829 to 1833, the Monocacy Aqueduct is the third of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. With just one glace, visitors are struck with the magnitude of this marvelous seven arched structure. The glistening white and pink quartz sandstone structure is the longest aqueduct along the C&O Canal measuring in at 516 feet. At the time of the Civil War, during the Maryland Campaign of 1862, the Monocacy Aqueduct was nearly destroyed by Confederate General D.H. Hill. However, concerned Lockkeeper Thomas Walter persuaded the Confederate troops that destroying Lock 27 would be far more impactful in their pursuit. Today, the Monocacy Aqueduct still stands thanks to restoration work that was completed in 2004 and continual preservation of this structural gem.  ",
            "audioDescription": "(337 words) The Monocacy Aqueduct is located along the C&O Canal Towpath in Dickerson, Maryland. This granite stone bridge is 516 feet long and spans the Monocacy River. It has seven arches and each arch spans a distance of approximately 54 feet. The base of the arches, called piers, are six feet wide. There are six piers. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 20 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. The walls on either side of the aqueduct are about 8 feet wide. To get to the aqueduct start from the Monocacy Aqueduct Parking Lot. From the parking lot head back toward the road you drove in on, near the northern edge of the lot. Once back on the road, head northwest about 100 feet toward the gravel access path. The path forks about 60 feet down the access path. To the right is a path that leads to picnic tables and a scenic view of the aqueduct. To the left the access path continues to the towpath. Continue down the access path on the left another 220 feet. The access path will dead end into the towpath. Once on the towpath turn right toward the aqueduct. About 200 feet down the towpath is a fork in the path. To the right is access to the aqueduct waterway. To the left is access to the aqueduct towpath. The waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. Select a path and walk another 200 feet to the aqueduct. On the waterway path you can see stone blocks forming walls on either side of you that are about 6 feet tall. On the towpath you can look down into the waterway on your right or look to the left were the Monocacy River meets the Potomac River. The towpath has a fence on the river side and two-foot bumpers on the waterway side.",

It never went as low as a dollar and twenty-five cents a week nor a high as a dollar and seventy-five cents a week... The hotel was leased and run by a fancily dressed tall man who slid and slunk rather than walked around the place. He was known as Wink Taylor... At the end of the first week I didn't get my standard pay of a dollar and fifty cents nor likewise at the end of the second week. Then came the word that the Hotel Mercer was closed, gone, up the spout, foreclosed, and Wink Taylor vanished.</em></p> <p>In his writings about Omaha, Carl Sandburg reflected that during his travels he had considered joining the Army multiple times. He remembered walking past the recruiting offices in Kansas City, Denver, and Omaha, but each time he neglected to go inside. Sandburg would eventually go on to join and serve during the Spanish-American War.</p>",

            "bodyText": "The East 100-block of Leigh Street was known as “Quality Row,” not only for the residences but for the outstanding achievements of its former residents.<br /> <br /> 107 East Leigh was the former home of Dr. David A. Ferguson, an 1899 graduate of Howard University’s dental school. He would go on to found the National Dental Association and become the first non-physician president of the National Medical Association. <br /> <br /> 110 East Leigh was the former home of Dr. Leon Reid and his family. Dr. Reid, a leading African American dentist, served as president of the National Dental Association and served on the Board of Directors of the Consolidated Bank and Trust. Dr. and Mrs. Reid’s son, Dr. William Ferguson Reid, would become a surgeon and become the first African American elected to the Virginia General Assembly in the 20th century.<br /> <br /> The corner residence is 118 East Leigh Street. Although it is now a part of the Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site, it once housed the law firm of noted civil rights attorney Oliver W. Hill and his associates. Oliver Hill and colleagues, Martin A. Martin and Spotswood Robinson, argued many desegregation cases. However, their most celebrated case was Dorothy Davis et al. vs. the county School Board of Prince Edward County. This case became one of the five cases heard before the United States Supreme Court as a part of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision of 1954. This pivotal case overturned the separate-but-equal doctrine.",

Each has a front porch of wood and an overhang for shade. The corner building has a wooden fence surrounding the front yard area and each has a small grassy area inside the fence.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Just as the barracks were designed with four companies in mind, the company officers' quarters were also designed to house four companies' worth of officers. A typical company's officers included two lieutenants and one captain. As such, each of the one-story buildings housed two captains and four lieutenants.<br /> <br /> The captain’s quarters were at the ends of the buildings and had two rooms, a kitchen, and servant’s room. Lieutenants had one room each with no kitchen until 1870. At that time, wooden lean-to structures were added at the back of each building to give the lieutenants kitchens and servant space.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "South Officers' Quarters 834 words The South Officers' Quarters is a one-story sandstone block building 84 feet long, facing the Parade Ground. It has eight windows and two doors in the front. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a single entry doorway, four windows, a single entry doorway, and two windows. The windows are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the single doorways are eight and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The doors are seven and a half feet tall by three feet wide. The window frames and doors are painted white. The doors are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. At the top of each door is a row of four window panes, one foot tall by eight inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The windows have 17 inch wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame the windows on each side. The windows and doors are spaced five feet apart, with the first and last windows three feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are three brick chimneys spaced 38 feet apart with the first and last chimney about two feet from their respective ends of the their buildings. The building has a 10 foot deep wood porch running its entire length. The porch has a low, sloped hip roof, separate from the building roof and extending out from just beneath the building's roof line. The roof is covered with wood shingles and is supported by 13 white square wood columns, just over seven feet apart. The porch is two feet above the ground and accessible by two eight foot wide sets of three steps without railings, one set on each side of the porch in front of the two doorways. There is a three foot high wooden railing around the porch with spindles three inches apart between the top and bottom rails. The railing and spindles are both painted white. A four foot wide, seven foot long wood walkway leads from the boardwalk in front of the house to the steps on both sides of the porch through a four foot wide opening in the railing. Inside are the restored officers' quarters with housing for one captain and two lieutenants on each side of the building. Each side has a six foot wide central hallway with two doorways on each side of the hall, and a door at the end of the hallway opposite the front door. All the interior doors are seven and half feet tall by three feet wide. The back door has a row of two glass panes, nine inches high and one foot wide, above the door. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The doors and doorframes are painted brown. Each door is two feet wide with an eight inch frame around it. The doors are recessed 6 inches from the front of the interior wall. The doors are 11 feet apart and each door is five feet from their respective ends of the hallway. None of the interior rooms are open to the public and are blocked by plexiglass barriers. On both ends of the building a third room extends out 21 feet past the back door of the hallway with a seven and a half foot wide wooden porch extending out to the end of the extension. The porch is approximately six inches above the ground. The porch roof is an extension of the building roof and is supported by four square wooden columns nine and a half feet apart. There is a brick chimney on the ridge line in the center of the extension’s roof. This extension has two windows and a door. From left to right as you face the porch are a window, the door, and another window. The windows are five feet high by three feet wide and the doorway is seven and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is six and a half feet high by three feet wide and is recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. There is a row of three glass panes above the window, eight inches high and ten inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the door. The door and window frames are painted white. The windows have 17 inch wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame both sides of the windows. The door and windows are spaced approximately four and a half feet apart with the first window four and a half feet from the end of the extension and the second window four and a half feet from the back wall of the main building. There is no wheelchair ramp so the building is not wheelchair accessible. End of description.",

Father Thomás Eixarch of the expedition baptized baby José Antonio Capistrano Féliz whose mother had died in during childbirth the previous day. <br /> <br /> Before the expedition arrived at the mission in 1775, and before Father Kino established the mission in 1692, the site was an O'odham village of W:ac, which was changed to \"Bac\" by the Spanish. \"W:ac is the O'odham word for \"where it goes\" in or \"to submerge\" (wachkk), referring to the place on the Santa Cruz River where the water submerges into the ground.\"<sup>1</sup> This site has been O'odham land for centuries and the current mission site is located on the San Xavier Reservation, part of the larger Tohono O'odham Nation. Please respect this land and the people when visiting this site. <br /> <br /> The gleaming white facade of the mission church is a striking feature on the desert landscape. Called the \"White Dove of the Desert,\" San Xavier Del Bac is one of the most beautiful mission church complexes in the Southwest. The original mission was founded in 1692 by a Jesuit missionary, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, at the Wa:c village of the O'odham. The present church was built by the Franciscans between 1783-1797. Of Baroque design, the large stuccoed church has two bell towers, one of, which is incomplete. The church's beautiful front portal is decorated with scrolled ornaments and sculptures and virtually the entire interior is covered with elaborately painted and sculpted surfaces.<sup>2</sup><br /> <br /> Tours of the mission grounds and church are occasionally offered through <a href=\"https://patronatosanxavier.org/\">Patronato San Xavier</a>, a non-profit conservation group. Self-guided tours of the church are available and an open air craft market can be found on select weekends. Contact the site to learn about regulations, site closures, and admission. The mission church, an active parish, also has a museum and small gift store.<br /> <br /> 1.

The federal troopers feel back close to Brices Cross Roads and formed a skirmish line to stop the confederate attack.<br /> <br /> The inscription on the historical markers reads as follows:<br /> \"FIRST SHOTS OF<br /> THE BATTLE OF<br /> BRICE'S CROSSROADS<br /> WERE FIRED HERE<br /> AT 9:30<br /> MORNING OF<br /> JUNE 10, 1864<br /> <br /> SCOUTS FROM GENERAL<br /> NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST'S<br /> 7TH TENNESSEE (CONFEDERATE)<br /> MET SCOUTS FROM GENERAL SAMUEL D. STURGIS' 4TH<br /> MISSOURI (FEDERAL)<br /> <br /> ERECTED BY ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE OF<br /> THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI<br /> <br /> J.P. COLEMAN GOVERNOR<br /> 1957\"<br /> <br /> The Brice's Crossroads Battlefield main battlefield site is managed by the Mississippi Final Stands Visitor and Interpretative Center in Baldwyn, Mississippi.",

            "bodyText": "Sixth Mount Zion was home to one of the most celebrated African American preachers of the 19th century, the Reverend John Jasper. Reverend Jasper and several other organizers founded Sixth Mount Zion in an abandoned Confederate horse stable on Brown’s Island in 1867. They moved to their present location at 14 Duval Street around 1869 and built the current sanctuary in the late 1880s. The contractor who oversaw the construction of the church was George W. Boyd, an African American contractor who was considered to be the leading African American contractor in Richmond during the late 1800s. Sixth Mount Zion’s celebrated pastor became nationally known for his sermon “De Sun Do Move,” initially delivered in 1878. Jasper would deliver the sermon over 250 additional times in several states and even once before the state legislature of Virginia. Reverend Jasper died in 1901. The Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church is listed on both the state and national historic registries.",

The 2nd New Jersey Cavalry were equipped with Spencer repeating rifles and were able to inflict heavy casualties on the Confederate forces. The Confederate cavalry were equipped with infantry muskets and the Federal Cavalry though they had infantry in front of them instead of Confederate Cavalry. This confusion led the Federal Cavalry to break off the skirmish and fall back up the hill to form their first battle line. <br /> <br /> A Civil War army on the march protected itself with lines of skirmishers, troops deployed in loose formation in advance and/or on the flanks of the main body. These troops drew the enemy's fires, developed his position, and warned comrades of imminent clash. Infantry manual in use during the war devoted much coverage to skirmisher tactics, made popular by Napoleon's heavy reliance on them during the Continental warfare of the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> The Historical Marker inscription is as follows:<br /> \"ADVANCE FORCES OF<br /> GENERAL FORREST<br /> AND<br /> GENERAL STURGIS'<br /> CAVALRY MET IN<br /> SKIRMISH HERE.<br /> <br /> THE 3RD, 7TH, 8TH AND 12TH<br /> KENTUCKY (CONFEDERATE)<br /> MET THE 4TH MISSOURI, 3RD<br /> 9TH ILLINOIS AND 2ND NEW<br /> JERSEY SHORTLY BEFORE<br /> FORMING FIRST BATTLE<br /> LINE.<br /> <br /> ERECTED BY ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE OF<br /> THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.<br /> <br /> J.P.

The trail, which is part of the Continental Divide Trail, ascends the hillsides overlooking the Upper Geyser Basin and the Firehole River. Both Summit Lake and the Smoke Jumper Hot Springs Thermal Area are about midway along the trail.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps downs several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color and Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Trail has a wheelchair-accessible overlook at Wall Pool.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

            "audioDescription": "Biscuit Basin and Sapphire Pool 816 words There are 3 sections in this description. Section 1 (177 words) Biscuit Basin is part of Upper Geyser Basin and is located 3 miles north of Old Faithful. Here you will find several gem-colored hydrothermal features including Jewel Geyser, named for the shiny deep-blue sinter beads surrounding its vent; Rusty Geyser, named for the orange-red basin surrounding its funnel-shaped vent; Shell Spring, with its the pale gold crater; and the deep yellow Mustard Spring. Sapphire Pool, so named for its luminous deep blue water, is also located here. There is a 1/4-mile boardwalk trail that loops around Biscuit Basin. To get to the start of the loop, you must first cross a wood footbridge spanning the Firehole River. The bridge has railings on both sides; portions of the boardwalk itself have either no railings or a railing on one side only. There is also a bench on the side opposite the railing. Small signs remind us that it is “unlawful to throw objects into pools” and that the walkway--with a total distance of ½ miles--is open to foot traffic only. Bicycles and pets are not allowed. Section 2 (438 words) There are two wayside exhibits beside the paved trail leading from the main road to the bridge. The first wayside’s title--“Biscuit Basin”--is located below a large map filling the panel’s top third. Text below the title reads: “This thermal basin is particularly volatile, unpredictable. On August 17, 1959, an earthquake recorded at 7.5 on the Richter scale had its epicenter just a few miles to the northwest. “Four days later, Sapphire Pool began to erupt violently, blowing away the large rock biscuits around the crater. Biscuit Basin was named for those biscuit-shaped mineral formations.” To the right of this text is a color photo showing several thin, branchless trees dotting the barren landscape that surrounds a meandering stream of blue water. The trunks of the mostly gray trees are white at their base, as is the ground around them. A caption to the left of the photo tells us: “Other transformations occur here in slow motion. As you walk the 1/4 mile loop, notice how the shifting runoff pattern kills forests, creating \"bobbysox\" trunks saturated with silica.” The map above this text shows several winding trails, which are represented by dashed black lines. A white arrow labeled “You are Here” on the map’s far right side indicates your location at the entrance to the foot bridge crossing the Firehole River, which is represented by a blue line running north to south. Also on the map’s right side is a black line representing the road leading to Madison Junction to the north and Old Faithful to the south; this road crosses the Firehole River south of Biscuit Basin. Biscuit Basin trail loop is located west of the river and is part of the dashed line marked “Summit Lake Trail.” This trail continues west then veers southwest before ending on the panel’s left edge. Just above the map’s center, the Summit Lake Trail joins another trail loop--significantly larger and wider than the small Biscuit Basin loop--which winds to the north and west before looping back south and east. The top leg of this loop is labeled “Fairy Creek Trail.” Toward the top of the map, there is a scenic overlook located on Fairy Creek Trail. A thinner blue line labeled “Little Firehole River” runs from west to east across the map before ending at Firehole River. “Mystic Falls” is located on Little Firehole River toward the bottom of the larger trail loop. A notation at the bottom of the map reads: “From the boardwalk loop, longer trails climb out of Biscuit Basin and explore other features: Mystic Falls, Observation Point, Summit Lake, and Fairy Creek Trail.” Section 3 (179 words) The second wayside exhibit is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the exhibit warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” The wayside exhibit text also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

            "audioDescription": "A large, 200-foot (60 m) wide by 100-foot (30 m) deep courtyard surrounds the Bright Angel Trailhead along the rim. Two sets of accessible bathrooms at the back of the courtyard face north toward a wide-open concrete plaza, with a water bottle filling station at the right. Limestone boulders ring a couple garden areas in the center of the plaza, each with a stone bench under tall shade awnings. 30 feet (9 m) west down a slight incline from the water station, 18 stone pylons, each 3 feet (1m) square by four feet (1.2 m) tall with metal pipe suspended between them, ring a low stone wall surrounding a 100-foot (30 m) diameter oval-shaped mule corral. 50 feet (15 m) east of the corral up a slight incline along the rim, an 18-inch (46 cm) circular bronze plaque embedded in a roughly 4 foot (1.2 m) tall triangular-shaped limestone boulder commemorates the 2013 dedication of the Bright Angel Trailhead renovation. Text reads: \"The Bright Angel Trailhead was renovated with gifts from Grand Canyon Association donors in partnership with the National Park Service.\" A list of major supporters follows. Text at the bottom of the plaque reads: \"Additional support was provided through your park entrance fees.\" A water filling station is located just to the west of the public restroom building in the Bright Angel Trail courtyard area. Mounted on a 6foot (2 m) wide by 4 foot (1.2 m) deep limestone brick base, 3 metal spigots stick out from the center of a 4 foot (1.2 m) square panel, housed in a metal frame topped with a short, sloped metal roof. Across a full-panel color photograph of the canyon, text at the top of the panel reads: \"Grand Canyon Spring Water. Fill Your Bottles Here for Free. The Grand Canyon is a place of pristine, almost unimaginable beauty. The park is dedicated to protecting the canyon and its resources for all to enjoy. Today and into the future, there is a way you can help. Before purchasing a disposable plastic bottle of water, consider this: these bottles clog landfills and litter the park. Wind carries them over the rim and into the canyon. Water filling stations, providing free, pure Grand Canyon spring water straight from Roaring Springs below the North Rim are located throughout the park. Fill up, drink up and enjoy!\" Note the spigot at the lower left of the panel is for winter use only. It is operated with a push button, located just to the right of the spigot on the face of the panel. A picture at the top right shows a small stream cascading over limestone rocks into a swirling pool of water. Text continues: \"Refill your bottles here and enjoy pure, clean Grand Canyon spring water.\" At the bottom right, the words, \"Junior Ranger\" appear in a green circle surrounding a park ranger hat. Text continues: \"Kids, did you know... The average American uses 167 water bottles a year; A bottle of water costs about $2 (that's $334 per year); Refillable water bottles look cool and are great souvenirs. Take them home and use them again and again!\" Note these filling stations are located throughout the park at hotels, visitor centers, markets, and major trailheads, and provide free Grand Canyon spring water for all visitors.",

            "audioDescription": "Post Commander's Quarters 589 words The Post Commander's Quarters is a one-and-a-half-story sandstone block house 51 feet wide, facing the Parade Ground. It has four windows and one door in the front. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a single entry doorway, and two windows. The windows are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the single doorway is ten and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is seven and a half feet tall by three feet wide. The door is recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. There are four narrow window panes, six inches tall by two inches wide, on each side of the door and a row of five window panes, two feet tall by five inches wide above the door. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The windows have 17 inch wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame the windows on each side. The window frames, window panes, and door are all painted white. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are two square brick chimneys on the ridge line at the top of the roof on either end of the building. Both chimneys are two feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has an 18 by 10 foot porch centered in the front of the building. The porch has a low, sloped hip roof, separate from the building roof and extending out from just beneath the building's roof line. The roof is covered with wood shingles and is supported by six white square wood columns, seven feet apart. The porch is two feet above the ground and accessible by an eight foot wide set of three steps without railings in the center of the porch. There is a three foot high wooden railing around the porch with spindles three inches apart between the top and bottom rail. The top and bottom rails are painted white, the spindles are painted green to match the shutters. A four foot wide, seven foot long walkway leads from the boardwalk in front of the house to the steps from a four foot wide opening in the white railing in the front. The half story is on the left side of the building, which is 54 feet long, with four windows on the ground level and two windows on an upper half-story level. The ground level windows are six feet tall by three and a half feet wide; the upper story windows are four and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The window frames and window panes are painted white; none of these windows have shutters. Facing the left side of the building, from right to left, the first lower story window is 21 feet from front of the building, the other three windows are approximately 5 feet apart with the last window four feet from the back of the building. The two upper story windows are four and a half feet directly above the last two lower story windows. There is a third chimney at the back of the house, two feet from the back edge of the roof on the left side of the building. This building is not open to the public because the interior has not been restored to its historic appearance. The opening through the railing is roped off. End of description.",

The bodies of the dead soldiers were hastily buried. The bodies of Union soldiers were exhumed in 1867 and re-interred in the national cemetery at Corinth, Mississippi. The graves of many soldiers, especially those strewn along the Federal Army retreat route, had no markers and are now unknown to history.<br /> <br /> Confederate burials were given more care. Some like Jourdan, were buried on private property. Some of those bodies--such as that of John Rice, who was buried on the Agnew property--were later removed and taken home by friends and relatives. Still other soldiers were laid to rest in a section of the cemetery at nearby Bethany Church. While some soldiers have memorial gravestones at the Bethany cemetery, the actual locations of their remains are unknown.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Brices Cross Roads there were 12,000 men engaged on June 10, 1864 with 3,105 killed or wounded.

            "bodyText": "Come on in, the water’s fine! Swimming off the beach of Assateague Island is a great way to experience the beauty of the Atlantic Ocean. The conditions at the beach and in the ocean vary daily and it is important to be aware of any potential safety precautions before going for a swim.<br /> The lifeguard supervised beach is designated by two red over yellow flags: one indicating the south boundary and one indicating the north boundary. No floats are permitted in the lifeguarded beach except for Coast Guard approved life jackets. Fifty yards beyond each of the lifeguard flags are yellow flags with a black circle in the middle. These flags designate a protected beach area. This area is designated as swimming only. No fishing, surfing, rigid crafts or contained fires are permitted within this boundary.<br /> In the Virginia district of Assateague Island, the beach in front of parking lot #2 is seasonally lifeguarded. Check our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/asis/planyourvisit/surf-and-beach-safety.htm\">Beach and Surf Safety page</a> for this season’s lifeguard schedule, beach flag definitions and other safety tips.<br /> <br /> <b>Don’t let your dip turn into a drift:</b><br /> Often swimmers have entered the water in front of their beach towel and when they exit find themselves yards down the beach from their belongings of family. How does this happen?<br /> Barrier islands and oceans are in a constant state of change. One contributing variable to daily conditions at the beach is current. A “littoral” or “longshore” current is one that is traveling either north to south, or south to north along the beach front. The direction and speed of this current can be influenced by wind direction and speed. When we enter the water and float, tread water or ride the waves in, we are unknowingly being pulled north or south due to this longshore current. Lifeguards post the direction and speed of this current daily on their operations board by the lifeguard stand.<br /> To avoid being swept down the beach, use a distinct marker on the beach you can see from the water. Frequently look back for your marker and relocate yourself accordingly.",
            "audioDescription": "The recreational lifeguarded beach is directly in front (to the east) of parking lot #2. A flat mobility mat is available to walk from the parking lot to the beach. The boardwalk is wide enough to allow wheelchair access. Beach wheelchairs with inflatable tires are available for transport only from the parking lot to the beach. Please see a lifeguard for more information. Other beach wheelchairs are available for extended use and may be signed out at the Toms Cove Visitor Center. There is no hardpacked surface leading into the ocean. Visitors must walk over uneven sand to reach the water’s edge. The lifeguarded beach area is free of fishing, floatation devices and contained fires to provide extra protection for swimmers. The Lifeguard stands are white, raised square shacks with the medical first aid red cross displayed on them. One is positioned near the north and south boundary of the lifeguarded beach.",

During the Federal army retreat near the creek is when Oscar Kelton was killed in action while the rest of the federal army retreated back to Memphis. On June 15th, five days after the battle, the Kelton family received a telegram that no family wanted to receive. It was sent by one of Oscar’s comrades and read “Oscar D Kelton was killed in battle near Corinth last friday his body is in the hands of the enemy...”<br /> <br /> Two years later in 1866 Fernando Kelton, Oscar’s father traveled to the Brices Cross Roads battlefield to find his son’s remains and transport him home to Columbus, OH. Fernando was able to find Oscar’s remains with the help of a local woman and Oscar was returned to his family in Ohio on May 7, 1866 and was buried in the family plot at the Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, OH.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brcr/learn/historyculture/oscar-kelton.htm\"> 1st LT Oscar Kelton</a> for additional information..<br /> <br /> A critical factor in the Union defeat at Brices Cross Roads was the decision, by an unknown officer, to bring most if not all of the Union supply train across the Tishomingo Creek Bridge and in the area you now stand. When the time came to retreat, the slow moving wagons clogged the narrow bridge, creating a panic among the exhausted soldiers. <br /> <br /> The supply train consisted of 250 wagons, each pulled by a team of four to six horses or mules. The wagons carried ammunition, food, forage and equipment and also served as ambulances.<br /> <br /> The Brice's Crossroads Battlefield main battlefield site is managed by the Mississippi Final Stands Visitor and Interpretative Center in Baldwyn, Mississippi.</p>",

Bouton's men--the 55th and 59th United States Colored Troops--were ordered to charge Morton's guns and Forrest's dismounted cavalry with their bayonets. Colonel Edward Bouton described the charge as \"The right and center of our line, embracing most of the Fifty-ninth Regiment, here rallied and charged, driving the enemy back with bayonets and clubbed muskets nearly 400 yards, leaving great numbers of his dead on the ground.\"<br /> <br /> The African American troops, many of them formerly enslaved, wanted to punish the Confederate soldiers responsible for the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow in Tennessee two months earlier. Some USCT soldiers even wore badges on their uniforms saying \"Remember Fort Pillow.\" According to Captain Morton the USCT soldiers advanced within \"hand shaking distance\" of the Confederate cannons.

            "bodyText": "The Kamekichi and Mika Kotake Store Property, located on a street lined with commercial buildings in Honokaʻa, Hawaiʻi, contributes to the retail-office character of the town’s downtown core. The streetfront store building appears to be a one-story structure; however, the building actually has two levels, as the down sloping terrain of the lot allowed the builders to create storage space below the street level retail area.  <br /> <br /> The store represents economic advancement for generations of Big Island residents, in this case Japanese. Kamekichi Kotake began his employment in Hawaiʻi as a plantation ditch digger. After his plantation service, he became a carpenter, and his wife Mika Kotake a retailer. They were financially successful enough in their retail operations to buy the building and raise their large family. The children were instrumental in this retail operation, and they went on to successful careers in the fields of education, health, travel, manufacturing, accounting, construction and the military. The Kotake store property is historically important as a represents the development of small businesses outside the plantation hegemony. Here, small “Mom and Pop” businesses and specialty services were developed and operated. Customers benefited from the increased range of goods available. While ethnic customs were honored, the policy of “all comers welcomed” facilitated social integration. Proprietors were able to improve their own standard of living and support the education (and upward mobility) of their children.  <br /> <br /> The impetus for the development of Honokaʻa town rested with the influx of early immigrant workers (1860-1900) brought in as laborers on the sugar plantations. When their plantation contracts expired, successive waves of immigrants from China, Portugal (Madeira and the Azores), Japan, Korea, Philippines, and other countries began to set up businesses and restaurants in town. As buildings did not have formal addresses, locations were and still are commonly known by each historic building owner’s name or historic business owners’ names.  The people who established small, independent, businesses in Honokaʻa, often referred to as “mom and pops,” were very familiar with the harshness of plantation life and saw their stores as vehicles toward financial independence from the plantations and a means to improve the future lives of their children. Offspring were required to work in the family business, learning discipline, business and language skills while furthering their education. The result of this “litmus test” of success in such struggles was the gainful employment of many in the second and third generations securing government and professional work. <br /> <br /> On May 9, 1930, Kamekichi and Mika Kotake bought the present Kotake Store property for $1,000. The building itself dates from at least 1914. After immigrating to Hawaiʻi in 1907, Mika would likely have been working at a confectionary or a drugstore. In the 1920 US Census, Mika is listed as “baker, cakes and candy.” She may have been working with Mrs. Yoshikama of Honokaʻa Bakery (located across the street from the future Kotake Store.) After the Kotakes purchased the building in 1930, Mika was the primary proprietor, while Kamekichi continued to work as a carpenter. Kamekichi Kotake was born on August 30, 1875 in Hiroshima Ken, Takata Gun, Japan. He immigrated to Hawaiʻi in 1900 at the age of twenty-five. By 1910, the 35-year-old Kamekichi was employed as a ditch laborer for the Honokaʻa Sugar Company plantation, and had married wife Mika, 12 years his junior. He retired from full-time carpentry because of medical issues and he helped Mika run the store. He built small furniture, tables, chairs, stools, shelves, and chests of drawers during his retirement to sell in the shop. <br /> <br /> The Kotake Store was truly a general retail operation. Janet Kotake Murakami recalled that the shop was open from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm seven days a week. Canned goods, candies, and ice cream were offered. Mika sold pastries from Fuji Bakery that were delivered via Victorine’s Bus Service from Hilo, and also obtained baked goods from the Yoshikami Bakery in Honokaʻa. Perishables were originally stored in an “ice box” in which ice was placed to keep things cold before refrigerators became available. The kids would wait for the ice man so that they could pick up and enjoy the ice chips. The store also carried pharmaceuticals and dry goods, including ready-made clothing (shirts and underwear) and Japanese wares (primarily kimono and fabric prints).  As was the custom, the Kotakes offered free delivery of goods to their customers’ homes. As was the custom in town, patrons charged goods and then once a month the Kotake Store would send bills. <br /> <br /> In 1953, Mika Kotake conveyed the property to sons Mamoru and Jitsuo for $1 as tenants in common; Mika retained a half interest. The Kotake store closed in 1958, and Douglas and Janet Matsuda bought the Kotake property in 1962 and operated an electronics business until 1970s.",

This FAQ provides information on the Seashore’s ORV regulations and how you can obtain a permit to drive on the beach within the Seashore.</p> <h3><strong>Basics</strong></h3> <p><strong>What is an ORV?</strong><br /> An ORV is any motor vehicle used off of paved park roads; such vehicles must comply with the vehicle and equipment requirements established by the park’s ORV management plan and special regulation, and use designated ORV routes. Any vehicle that does not comply is not authorized for use off of park roads. ATVs, UTVs, and motorcycles are not allowed on park beaches.</p> <h3><strong>Permits</strong></h3> <p><strong>Do I need a permit to use a vehicle off-road at the seashore?</strong><br /> Yes. An ORV permit is required.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are my options for obtaining an ORV permit? </strong>There are two types of permits: 10-day/$50 permits (valid from the date issued) and annual/$120 permits (valid for one year from the date issued).<br /> <br /> You may obtain a permit at any time via the web by visiting <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/\">www.recreation.gov</a>. Search for “Cape Hatteras ORV” from the home page or call 1-877-444-6777 to be connected to a recreation.gov representative. Proof-of-permit must be displayed on your vehicle during off-road driving.<br /> <br /> After you purchase the permit online, you will receive a digital copy of your permit registration, the rules and regulations, and a proof of permit windshield tag.</p> <ul> <li>Page one of the printed permit is the registration form and should be secured in the glove box of the permitted vehicle while driving on Seashore beaches. The signature block on the permit form must be signed in order for the permit to be valid.</li> <li>Page two of the printed permit contains all the beach driving rules and regulations.</li> <li>Page three of the printed permit is the visible proof of permit that must be affixed (taped) to the inside bottom corner of the driver’s side windshield. The visible proof of permit must be affixed and displayed properly, in order for the permit to be valid.</li> </ul> <p>Annual permittees may print at the time of purchase a temporary proof of permit. The permanent annual decal will be mailed to the permittee within 7-10 business days. The temporary proof of permit must be affixed, using tape, to the inside of the driver’s side windshield and must be displayed at all times that the permittee wishes to access the beach with an ORV. The temporary proof of permit can be used for no longer than 30 days and should be immediately substituted with the permanent decal once it is received via U.S. mail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do I have to print the permit, or can I keep it digitally on my smart phone?</strong> You must print all three pages of the permit. The permit must be signed and the proof of permit must be properly displayed to be valid. If you cannot print the proof-of-permit, read how to get a self-certification card above.<br /> <br /> <strong>I need assistance with a problem I have with an online permit order. Who do I contact? </strong>If you need assistance with ordering an ORV permit, please contact Recreation.gov directly. You may contact the customer service department by phone, email, and chat. Here is the information that you will need:</p> <ul> <li>Email or chat, go to <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/contact-us\">https://www.recreation.gov/contact-us</a>. They will respond to your email inquiry within 24 hours.</li> <li>Reservation Line and Customer Service: 1-877-444-6777.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>What if I don’t have access to a printer? </strong>If you cannot print the proof-of-permit, you can pick up a self-certification card from outside the visitor centers or at many local tackle shops. On the self-certification card, simply write in the information from your permit, sign the card, and place on your dashboard.<br /> <br /> <strong>If I misplace my permit, or lose it, can I print another copy?</strong> Yes, here are the instructions:</p> <ul> <li>Login to your Recreation.gov account.</li> <li>Click on your name in the upper right corner.</li> <li>Click on the <strong>“My Reservations\" </strong>from the list.</li> <li>Find the correct permit and click <strong>\"Reservation Details.\"</strong></li> <li>Click on <strong>\"Print Permit.\"</strong></li> <li>Watch the 3.5 minute ORV Safety Video on the Cape Hatteras ORV Permit page at recreation.gov.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Are there any specific permit requirements for my vehicle?</strong><br /> Yes. To get an ORV permit your vehicle must:</p> <ul> <li>Be registered, licensed, and insured for highway use and comply with inspection requirements for the state, country, or province where the vehicle is registered;</li> <li>Have no more than two axles and have tires that are listed or approved by the <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Tires+Rating\">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>; and</li> <li>Have a low-pressure tire gauge, shovel, jack, and jack support board.</li> <li>Other equipment that is recommended, but not required, is a full-sized spare tire, first-aid kit, fire extinguisher, trash bag or container, flashlight (if night driving), and tow strap.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Is there a limit to the number of ORV permits available?</strong><br /> No. There is no limit to the number of permits available.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Does the ORV permit guarantee that all ORV routes will be open for me to use?</strong><br /> No. There are several reasons that parts of ORV routes may be closed to ORV use:</p> <ul> <li>There are seasonal closures along certain routes from April 15 to October 15. These are shown on the ORV route map;</li> <li>Routes may be temporarily closed if the carrying capacity is reached;</li> <li>Routes may be temporarily closed if there is a specific need for resource protection; and</li> <li>Routes may be temporarily closed for safety reasons.</li> </ul> <p>All closures are clearly signed. For the most up-to-date route status, please visit <a href=\"https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess\">https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess</a>.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Several of my family members have ORVs. Do we need to get a permit for each vehicle?</strong><br /> Yes. You must get a permit for each vehicle.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can family members or friends use my vehicle on the beach if I have </strong><strong>an ORV permit for it?</strong><br /> Yes. The person driving the ORV permitted-vehicle must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license. The ORV permit must be in the vehicle and the proof-of-permit properly displayed. You should carefully review the regulations printed on the ORV permit with any person you let operate the vehicle. Your ORV permit can be revoked if they violate these regulations.</p> <p><br /> <strong>I plan to rent or lease an ORV during my vacation. How does the permit work with that?</strong><br /> In general, the person renting or leasing the vehicle should be the one applying for the ORV permit. Businesses that rent vehicles specifically for beach driving may obtain annual ORV permits for their fleet of rental vehicles and allow renters to use the permitted vehicles. The operator of the vehicle, whoever that may be, must obey the ORV regulations. The business-owned permit can be revoked if a customer violates the regulations.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I use my Interagency Amer</strong><strong>ica the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Senior or Access pass to get my ORV permit?</strong><br /> No. The ORV permit falls under the NPS Special Use Permit Program, so Federal Recreational Lands passes do not provide discounts for your ORV permit.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Is a separate permit required for night driving, when night-driving is allowed?</strong><br /> No. You only need your ORV permit.</p> <h3><strong>Routes</strong></h3> <p><strong>Where can I get a map of the designated ORV routes?</strong><br /> You can pick up an ORV route map from any park visitor center or any Outer Banks Visitors Bureau welcome center.<br /> <br /> <b>How do I find out which ramps and routes are open?</b><br /> Visit the Seashore's <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/beachaccess\">beach access table web page</a> to view the current status of beach ramps and routes.<br /> <br /> <b>What are the priority ocean beach routes? </b>Routes that are accessible from Ramps 2, 4, 25, 27, 43, 44, 48, 49, 70, and 72.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why do I sometimes see ORVs in areas closed to ORVs?</strong><br /> In addition to NPS vehicles being used by NPS employees to conduct approved management activities and emergency response vehicles, the NPS allows ORV use in certain areas closed to ORVs only for very specific purposes, this includes:</p> <ul> <li>Participants in regularly scheduled fishing tournaments if such tournament use was allowed in that area for that tournament before January 1, 2009.</li> <li>The use of special-permitted ORVs to transport mobility-impaired individuals to a predetermined location in a beach area in front of a village that is not otherwise open to ORV use. Stop by your local permit office for more information about this mobility-impaired transport permit.</li> <li>Commercial fishermen with a NPS commercial fishing permit when actively commercial fishing—as long as a beach is not a resource closure or a lifeguarded beach. Also, commercial fishermen can drive on the beach at 5 am on days when night-driving restrictions are in effect for the general public if they are actively engaged in authorized commercial fishing activity and able to present a fish-house receipt from the previous 30 days.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Driving on the Beach</strong></h3> <p><strong>How does the carrying capacity work?</strong><br /> The maximum number of vehicles allowed on any ORV route at one time is, basically, the length of the route that is open divided by 20 feet (6 meters). This, in essence, allows vehicles to park side-by-side, one row deep, as long as there is still room on the beach for two-way ORV traffic to pass behind parked vehicles safely. The carrying capacity prevents over-crowding and best provides for safety and visitor experience. In past years, such closures have only occurred on the Bodie Island spit for several hours, once or twice a year—and there were still many miles of beach open for ORV use elsewhere on the seashore.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I drive my two-wheel-drive vehicle on ORV routes?</strong><br /> Yes. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are recommended however, two-wheel-drive vehicles are allowed if, in your judgment, the vehicle is capable of off-road use in deep, soft sand.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What about tire pressure? What if my vehicle gets stuck on the beach?</strong><br /> When driving on ORV routes, tire pressure must be lowered in order to keep adequate traction within the posted speed limit. Tire pressure of less than 20 psi is recommended for most vehicles. The softer the sand, the lower the pressure needed. Re-inflate tires to normal pressure as soon as possible after you return to paved roads. If you get stuck and cannot get your vehicle out, your best bet is to call a commercial towing service. NPS rangers are not allowed to pull or tow your vehicle.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I tow a boat or utility trailer with my vehicle on ORV routes?</strong><br /> Yes. Towed boat and utility trailers with one or two axles are allowed. Trailers with more than two axles are prohibited.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I tow a travel or camping trailer (a trailer with sleeping and/or restroom facilities) on ORV routes?</strong><br /> No. Travel or camping trailers are prohibited on ORV routes. If you camp in the park, you must use one of the park’s designated campgrounds.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What is the speed limit on ORV routes?</strong><br /> The speed limit is 15 mph unless otherwise posted.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What are right-of-way rules I need to know?</strong><br /> Pedestrians always have the right-of-way. Vehicles must yield to pedestrians and move to the landward side of the beach when approaching or passing a pedestrian. When traveling within 100 feet of pedestrians, ORVs must slow to 5 mph.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I drive on ORV routes at night?</strong><br /> Yes, but there are some seasonal restrictions:</p> <ul> <li>November 16-April 30, all designated ORV ramps are open to night driving (24 hrs a day);</li> <li>May 1–July 31, to help protect nesting sea turtles, priority ORV ramps open at 6:00 am and close at 9:00 pm. All other designated ORV ramps open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm;</li> <li>August 1-September 30, to help protect nesting sea turtles, priority ORV ramps open at 6:30 am and close at 9:00 pm. All other designated ORV ramps open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm; and</li> <li>October 1 - November 15, All designated ORV ramps, including priority ramps, open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm.</li> <li>September 15-November 15, all designated ORV ramps, including priority ORV ramps, open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm. Transition to night driving could occur if there are no sea turtle nests remaining along a route.</li> </ul> <p>Priority ocean beach routes are routes that are accessible from Ramps 2, 4, 25, 27, 43, 44, 48, 49, 70, and 72.<br /> <br /> For the most up-to-date route status, please visit <a href=\"https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess\">https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess</a>.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I leave my ORV parked on the beach if I don’t drive it between 9 pm and 7 am during the seasons that night-driving restrictions are in effect?</strong><br /> No. During the restricted seasons, all vehicles are prohibited on ocean beaches.</p> <h3><strong>Wildlife Closures</strong></h3> <p><strong>Can I walk in the water around a wildlife closure?</strong><br /> Walking in the water adjacent to the park boundary can pose several issues for anglers. First and foremost, safety is a huge concern. The NPS does not recommend anglers walk in the ocean outside of the NPS boundary to avoid a temporary wildlife closure because they would be violating federal regulations if they became tired and needed to walk onto the beach (into the closure). Even if anglers stayed outside the NPS boundary the entire time, disturbance that they caused to the wildlife within the temporary closure area would be a violation of federal regulations. Temporary wildlife closures and buffers are in place to protect federally listed species, species of concern, and other wildlife at Cape Hatteras National Seashore.</p> <p>The best way to avoid a potentially unsafe condition that may result in a fine is to avoid walking in the water adjacent to temporary wildlife closures.</p>",

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. FOR HIS MORAL COURAGE AND NOBILITY OF SPIRIT\"</p> <p>It is my hope that every viewer will see and appreciate the inspirational and meaningful symbolism in the pose and placement of the <em>Behold</em> Monument at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Historical Park.</p> <p>The heroic-sized, bronze figure of the father raises his infant child to the heavens and looks toward Ebenezer Baptist Church--the source of his spiritual strength and a site significant to the civil rights movement as the church in which both Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his father, \"Daddy\" King, gave many powerful and inspirational sermons.</p> <p>In walking to or from the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Center young children will pass the <em>Behold</em> Monument. Their parents and grandparents will be able to instill pride in them each day as they explain how the <em>Behold</em> tribute to Dr. King glorifies the importance of children and the love of every mother and father for their children.</p> <p>As one views the monument from the back one sees the <em>Behold</em> infant silhouetted against a broad expanse of sky and raised above the towering skyscrapers of downtown Atlanta's commercial district. This juxtaposition of the infant and the Atlanta skyline symbolizes Dr. King's hope that one day all Americans would share, significantly, in the cultural and materials as well as the spiritual, riches of our great nation.</p> <p>Finally, as one stands on a sightline drawn from the front of Dr. King's tomb to the <em>Behold</em> Monument one sees the strong, uplifted profile of the father and the face of his sleeping infant, unaware of the sacrifices and suffering endured by the father, tranquil and serenely oblivious to all the ioy and sorrow the future holds. The father holds his hope for the future, his infant, facing the tomb of Dr. King and its inscription, \"Free at last, Free at last, Thank God, Almighty, Free at last\". This symbolic pose is a tribute to Dr. King's love of children and to his courageous efforts to create a world in which there would be happiness, freedom, and dignity for all God's children.</p> <p>Patrick Morelli<br /> <em>Behold</em> Sculptor</p> <p>*It should be noted that this statement was written before the National Park Service Visitor Center and Peace Plaza were built.</p>",

Did you know there is a lot of biological activity in dirt? Have you noticed the bumpy, knobby, and sometimes dark soil along the trails? That’s biological soil crust! Just like a coral reef is formed over time by lots of small organisms living together, soil crust is formed the same way. Moss, lichen, green algae, cyanobacteria (sigh-AN-oh bacteria), and microfungi all work together to hold sand grains in place and create an environment where seeds can grow. We as people are a bit like the earth’s crust. We have a lot going on inside ourselves that help us be strong: we give our bodies rest, we give our bodies nutrition, some of us get exercise by playing with friends or playing sports. One of our “crust layers” we want to keep intact are our friendships. We want people in our lives who won’t BUST OUR CRUSTS. We want to keep ourselves, our friends, and each other intact. Think about being bullied – that can really bust our crust! Now think about spending time with someone you really like – doesn’t that feel good? Like the biological crust – a single footprint off the trail can erase decades of growth. Bullying, teasing, and intimidating break us down just like crust. Build others up – positivity is contagious!<br /> <br /> Take a few moments to reflect on some things that “bust our crusts”. Not too long – we don’t want to spend too much time focusing on the things that bother us. Now, take a moment to think about the people in your life who help build up your crust. Maybe it’s your best friend who always makes you laugh or shares the best memes. Or perhaps it is someone online you play video games with. Maybe it’s a grandparent or someone you play sports with. These positive people, the ones who “build up our crust” are the people we want to surround ourselves with. Not people who break us down – and bust our crusts! When we form friendships and bonds with positive people, we let them in to see who we truly are. It can be scary to open up and be vulnerable with another person, but it’s worth it! These are the people who you can lean on when the times get hard – and I bet you can return that favor to them when they need a positive influence in their lives. We help build each other’s layers – just like the geology in the rocks all around you here at Colorado National Monument.</p> <h4 paraeid=\"{3488a1b9-e393-4f16-ac7e-96f237afb0ca}{24}\" paraid=\"1657202048\">Third Code Clue</h4> <p paraeid=\"{3488a1b9-e393-4f16-ac7e-96f237afb0ca}{24}\" paraid=\"1657202048\">Clue: being this eight-letter word builds us up, and builds our crust, being negative break us down.<br /> <br /> Write down your answer and save it for later.

As a group or as an individual, it is time to embrace silence and reflect on your experience today. Take a walk or choose a location to stand or sit comfortably. If you are in a group, try not to go in the same direction, but stay within sight of adults in the group. Set the timer for five or more minutes. While on the walk or in your comfortable position reflect on the following thoughts: What unique strength helped you complete the activities today? How did you shine during these activities? (these strengths could be something like good listener, good storyteller, empathetic, sensitive, good at making other smile or laugh, good at problem solving etc.)<br /> <br /> Once the timer goes off, it is time to write down your strength. With a pen/pencil or paper write down the unique strength you thought of while walking in nature. If you do not have something to write with, just make a mental note of your strength. You do not need to share your strength out loud. Save this paper in a special place.

That is a lot of weight on top of the buried petrified logs. All that weight crushed and broke the logs.<br /> <br /> Why the regularity in sections? A normal log does not break that way. But a petrified log does! Petrified wood is mostly silica-quartz minerals. The inner surfaces where they have broken are flat because quartz doesn’t break neatly across its crystal faces, so instead it snaps across the log’s shortest area—sort of like when you snap a piece of chalk.",

Clues like this help us imagine what the tree looked like.<br /> <br /> Lots of knots means this tree had lots of branches, which fell away as it decayed. Tree bark also falls off dead trees. So, though the surface may look like bark, it is just the outer surface of the wood.<br /> <br /> The log’s length tells us this tree was tall. Two trees along the Long Logs Trail measure 137 and 141 feet long. This indicates that some of the trees may have approached at least 200 feet (61 m) tall when alive.<br /> <br /> Paleontologists search for clues eroding out of the Chinle Formation badlands to capture what the Late Triassic environment once looked like. Some of the earliest remains of dinosaurs are found alongside invertebrates, freshwater fish, amphibians, synapsids, and the dominant group at the time, known as archosaurs. These creatures are on display in the Rainbow Forest Museum.",

In the late 1920s, the park superintendent’s wife said the log was to Petrified Forest what the Old Faithful geyser is to Yellowstone National Park. From this the name “Old Faithful” stuck.<br /> <br /> Notice that fragments at the base are mortared together? In 1962, lightning struck and fractured the log. At that time, the National Park Service repaired the damage and built a retaining wall to slow erosion. Attitudes about resource management in our national parks have changed over the years; a log would not be glued back together today.<br /> <br /> YOUR OWN REPHOTOGRAPHY SHOOT<br /> Petrified Forest has hosted many great scientific minds. Perhaps you recognize the face of this visitor? Just like your trip, Dr. and Mrs. Albert Einstein’s March 1, 1931 visit would not be complete without seeing Old Faithful.

Her style is unique in that she teaches from example and rarely announces an exam. As a student of nature, you will need to do lots of field work - closely observe and expect the unexpected. <br /> <br /> Because fire can be beneficial or destructive, it is a hard lesson to learn. But destruction is often greater when we interfere with its natural cycle. Since the first Euro-American settlements in the 1880s until the early 1970s, fire was immediately suppressed. As a result, many of the forests have become crowded and stagnant with large amounts of forest debris. Increases in dead material has meant more fuel is available to produce hotter, more destructive fires.<br /> <br /> At Wind Cave National Park, managers are attempting to catch up with the fire cycle, yet reduce the odds of fire spreading to buildings or neighboring lands. To reduce fuels, managers remove part of the forest's understory. The tree stumps in front of you serve as an example. However, beyond the fence no fuels were removed. In 1991, a wildfire burned this area. Comparing the forest beyond the fence with the one here, you can see how fuel removal reduced the severity of the fire in the campground. Removal of fuels may become less common as prescribed burns allow us to catch up with fire's natural cycle.",

As you've seen the prairie, forest and riparian ecosystems blend to create a truly spectacular landscape. However, when viewing the park over a distance it is easy to conclude that the land, with its gentle rolling hills, lacks complexity. This deception in itself is amazing. In a way the terrain is somewhat like the sea. From the shore it appears to be little more than rolling waves. Who would suspect, without close examination, that below the surface lies a complex web of life that may never be fully understood? That complexity and the forces that make it possible are important to a balanced ecology. <br /> <br /> Wind Cave National Park is working to protect this balance by allowing natural processes to continue to shape the land. This is a difficult task. There are many challenges to be met, such as the encroachment of non-native plants onto the prairie and misunderstandings of the importance of fire.<br /> <br /> As you travel across the prairie, along the riparian habitat or through the forest, think of the broad spectrum of life that each supports. Also, remember that the park's staff is eager to disucss natural resources and the challenges that lie ahead.",

For instance, you might find yourself asking, \"why am I suddenly walking in a ponderosa pine forest? Why is it here?\" For an answer, you need to consider two things, moisture and soil. <br /> <br /> Moisture is necessary in every community. The movement of water through the soil and the amount of water available to vegetation is influenced by soil texture. Because ponderosa pine trees grow best on well-drained, silty soils they are usually found on the park's hilltops where this type of soil exists. These pines seldom grow in the middle of the prairie due to unfavorable soil conditions and a lack of moisture.<br /> <br /> Moisture is also important for the germination of pine seeds. Once germinated, the nourishment contained in the seed enables it to send down a fast-growing tap root. Because this root grows deeply, the seedling can better survive wind and drought. Look for seedlings as you walk. Do they grow close together or far apart? Why would this happen?",

While Smokey has done a great job of reminding us to be careful with fire, we must be aware that fire can also be a friend. <br /> <br /> Consider these ponderosa pines. They are prolific and under the right conditions, like the ones found here, many seedlings will survive. This creates very dense stands of small trees like you see beyond the fence. Because of competition for nutrients, moisture, and sunlight, few seedlings grow into mature trees. Historically, fire has prevented the trees from becoming overcrowded by killing many of the smaller ones. This thinning also allows more sunlight to reach the ground encouraging grasses to grow on the forest floor. As you walk the path, notice how fire has thinned out the forest yet left many trees standing. <br /> <br /> Although fire is beneficial to the forest, human structures and lives must be protected. Today, the National Park Service is using prescribed fire, one started under carefully calculated conditions, to keep the soil and vegetation healthy and in a more natural state. ",

Fossilized cones tell us the trees were conifers, reproducing through seed-bearing cones, like a modern pine tree. The taproot itself is also like some modern pines. Its purpose is to stabilize and nourish the tree during severe storms and drought.<br /> <br /> Nearly a dozen types of petrified wood have been formally described.

By 1884, the building was occupied by a confectionery as well as a dry goods store. In 1888, the south storefront was still occupied by a dry goods store, but the north storefront was occupied by a coffin showroom, probably owned by the Argall brothers, John and William. They operated a furniture and undertaking business here until at least 1900. The combination of furniture and undertaking was common in those years. Cabinet-making skills used for making fine furniture were equally applicable to the production of caskets. Soon after they opened their business here, the Argalls moved to the south storefront, and the north storefront was occupied by a fruit and confectionery store again for several years. By 1908, William Kehl had a saloon in the south storefront, and Athens Anegone had the fruit and confectionery store next door. Anegone also ran a cigar factory upstairs. In the 1950s and 60s this building was home to the very popular Franklin Fountain, and later the Town House Restaurant. It became home to Copper World when Tony and Joyce Bausano purchased the building in 1977.",

Now it servers as a giftshop named Copper World which sells all kinds of local goods. The building is two stories tall with a flat roof which is lower in the back of the building than the front.

The south storefront was occupied by various businesses over the years including a jewelry store, sample rooms, and a store that sold musical instruments. A tailor also had a shop in the building for a while. Sometime around 1920, Tom Dwyer opened a shoe store in the south storefront. In 1928, August and Lempi Sutinen moved from Hancock to 216 North Florida Street in Laurium and bought the shoe store from Dwyers. They renamed it the Family Shoe Store. August and Lempi’s son Rudy and his wife June eventually took over the business, which remained open until sometime around 2000. In 1930, Anton Sterk sold clothing for men and boys in the north storefront. Sterk lived at 317 Scott Street. In the 1920s, the second-floor windows of this building were boarded up, and asphalt siding was installed. The present owners have recently restored the window openings and returned the façade to a more historically appropriate appearance.",

The first floor of both buildings has large store-front windows and a single door entrance in the center of each building. The second floor has a false front with three windows centered on the southern building. This false front slopes down from the second to first floor on the north.

            "bodyText": "Peter Ruppe Jr. opened the Calumet branch of Ruppe & Sons in 1869. The existing building was first constructed after the Red Jacket fire of 1870. It was originally only two stories tall. In 1899 a third story and a new store front were constructed to keep up with growing demand and competition from other stores, such as Vertin's Department Store on Oak Street. The Ruppe's success in the mercantile business allowed them to invest in banks and mining companies, and they were active in local government. In 1923 the Ruppe family sold the building to the JC Penny Company, which moved from a smaller location in Calumet. In 1980 JC Penny's moved to the new Copper Country Mall in Houghton, and closed both the store in Calumet, and a store in downtown Houghton. Though briefly occupied by a fitness center, the Ruppe building has been mostly vacant since.",
            "audioDescription": "The Ruppe block is located at 211 Fifth street in downtown Calumet. It stood for most of its history as the P. Ruppe & Son general merchandise store. The first floor facing Fifth street has some remaining tall store-front windows, while most are boarded over with white painted boards. A double-door entrance is in the center of the building with a single door on the south end. The ornate facade on the second and third stories is made from brick and red terracotta. Three tall arch-topped windows sit at the center of the building with tall rectangular windows. Tall Romanesque columns sit between the arch-toped windows. Four circular windows sit even spaced above the five windows on that span between the second and third floors. An ornate cornice sits atop the building which has faded to a dark gray color.",

That building started out as a two story commercial building, but later a third story was added. 212 5th Street was divided into two separate storefronts for many years as well. It was home to many businesses including C. J. Sorsen’s Suomalainen Apteeki (Finnish pharmacy), the Bee Hive Shoe Store, and the Calumet post office. The building to the north was occupied by a tailor and Victor Herman’s photography studio, for a time. Sometime around 1940, the J. J. Newberry 5 and 10 cent store moved into the building. They remodeled the main floor and removed the front staircase to the second floor. 214 5th Street was demolished, and the addition was built, further expanding the sales floor. Newberry’s was a classic dime store and included a lunch counter and soda fountain.",

            "bodyText": "Joseph Hermann learned the jeweler’s and watchmaker’s trade in Germany before he immigrated to Eagle River in 1863. He established his own business there in 1865 and moved it to Calumet Location (just east of here) in 1868. In 1870, he moved the business to this location, in a two-story wood-frame building, with a stone vault attached to the north side. Around 1890, it was replaced with a two-story brick building, which forms the oldest part of the building existing today. In about 1894, the second storefront with a second story was added to the building on the north side; a third story was added around 1905.<br /> From about 1894 until about 1910, the north storefront was occupied by Louis Sibilsky’s dry goods store, also an old Eagle River business. By 1916, Joseph Hermann had died, and the business was run by the Hermann Brothers Company, consisting of John and Lucas Hermann, and Paul Tritschler. In 1942, the jewelry business still occupied the south storefront, and The Calumet Hardware Company occupied the north. By 1957, the jewelry business had moved to 316 6th Street, and the hardware store had taken over both storefronts here.",
            "audioDescription": "The Hermann Block is located at 109-111 fifth street in downtown Calumet. This building was constructed by Joseph Hermann between 1890 and 1905. The block is made from red brick and stands three stories tall. The first story has tall display windows with two single entrances, one for each side of the building which is split in the middle. The second and third stories have large rectangular windows, 8 on each story, facing the road. Ornate semicircular copper decorations are located above the third story windows: two large ones in the center of each building half, and smaller ones flanking the large ones. The roof of the building is flat and a brick chimney can be seen protruding above it on the southern face of the building.",

By 1912 the Orensteins purchased the building and had their own shop in the north storefront selling furs. By 1930 Carpenters Closet occupied the north storefront selling women’s clothing and furnishings (accessories). Carpenters remained in business here until ca. 1990, eventually taking over the south storefront as well. In the intervening years, the south storefront was occupied by Millers Market, a Sears store, and other businesses. For a while in the early 20th-century photographer William Nara’s studio was located in a commercial space at the back of the first floor with an entrance on Portland Street and there was a bowling alley in the basement.",

Over the years storefronts here were occupied by a saloon and pool hall. John Schenk, the proprietor, also lived upstairs. A merchant tailor John Rastello advertised that he had the finest domestic and imported woolens in stock. A nurse, Rebecca Douglass, also lived upstairs. Other businesses located here over the years include a plumber and pipe fitter, Battista Picchiottino, and the Houghton County Electric Light Company – as the local electric utility company was known. The Coppo Block was a given a new lease on life when it was acquired and rehabilitated by its current owners Jim and Stacey Flood, after a fire in the third floor in 1998.",

            "bodyText": "Known as the 'big store' in the Copper Country, the Vertin Brother's Department Store sold many necessities and novelties to satisfy a variety of customers from the sophisticated socialite to the common miner. This corner was previously occupied by the Provincial House, a small wood-frame hotel and saloon. In 1891 Slovenian immigrants John and Joseph Vertin built the lower two floors of the existing building. Business boomed, and in 1899, two additional stories were added to the building according to designs by architect Charles Maas. Later, another one-story addition was made to the south side of the building, on a site formerly occupied by a barbershop and three dwellings. The heating plant in the Vertin building at one time supplied steam heat to handful of other nearby buildings. The store eventually expanded across the alley into the Caesar Block next door, which housed the menswear department. However, in 1985, with mines closed and thousands of families gone, the store shut its doors after nearly 100 years of serving the community.",
            "audioDescription": "The building located at 216-220 Sixth street was built for the Vertin Brother’s Department Store. The original building was built around 1885 and had two stories made of red sandstone and had an orate cornice. Between 1899 and 1900 two additional stories made of red brick were added on top to expand the building and the ornate cornice moved to the new roofline. The first floor has large display windows and a set of three pairs of entrance doors on its north side. The second floor has rectangular windows with arched tops. Evidence of the original cornice can still be seen between the second and third floors. The third floor has large rectangular windows, and the fourth floor has arch topped windows like the second floor. The roof cornice covers the north and western faces of the building.",

By 1898, and perhaps before, it was known as the Eagle Drug Store, J. W. Clemo, proprietor. The Eagle Drug Store sold many postcards and copper souvenirs in the late 19th and early 20th century which are still popular among collectors today.<br /> Advertisements from the store include “Physicians Prescriptions and Family Recipes,” “Choice Candies Constantly in Stock,” “The Latest Drinks at Soda Fountain,” and “Pure Drugs & Fair Charges. If you figure close, give us a trial.” By 1917 the building was occupied by a jewelry store, the Warren Jewelry Company. In 1930 Frank Marzene’s photo studio resided there. Marzene moved down the street by 1940, and by about 1950 the old building was replaced by the existing building which was home to a barbershop.",

George Jacka worked at the Cliff Mine before coming to Red Jacket in 1868 and working as a timber contractor for C&H. In 1875, he established a grocery business and built the first commercial building on this site shortly thereafter. Between 1884 and 1888, that structure was remodeled into a two-story brick-veneered double-storefront building. Around 1890 Jacka added a livery stable to his business enterprises, located at the back of the lot. In 1904 the first Jacka Block burned in a fire thought to have been started to cover up a burglary. At that time the south storefront was occupied by jeweler J. J. Ellis, and the north storefront by druggist Charles Fichtel. Upstairs were offices of the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, W. W. Ellis insurance agent, and Drs. Labarge and Watson. Jacka quickly rebuilt after the fire. The entire main floor of the new building was designed for and occupied by the Merchants and Miners Bank. Merchants and Miners and its successor institutions occupied this building until 2007.",

Between 1884 and 1888 it had its first remodel to a two-story brick-veneered double storefront building. Between 1900 and 1908 the building changed from general retail space to a bank and was again remodeled between 1908 and 1917 to have a stone veneer on the north and west sides of the first floor. The Jacka Block stands today as a two-story building with stone façade on the first floor and red brick on the second floor. The west side of the first floor has large display windows and two entrances: one on the north end and one in the south corner. The second floor has rectangular two pane windows that are slightly recessed into the building with brick separations between sets of two. There is also a metal-clad turret above the door on the second stories southwest corner.",

The meat market and the Bastian building on the corner both survived the great fire of 1870. The market eventually took over the Bastian building, gaining frontage on 5th Street. Around that time, the existing building was constructed. John Dymock also served as president of the First National Bank of Calumet, and vice-president of the Calumet & Pittsburgh Mining Company. He died in 1904, but the market continued in business here as Baer Brothers until sometime after 1948. Sometime between 1908 and 1917, a second storefront was added to the building. Over the years, the second storefront was occupied by a telegraph office, the Dawes Hat Shop, and the Calumet office of The Daily Mining Gazette. In 2009 Pete and Shelly Hahn’s business, Hahn Hammered Copper, opened here.",

The Baer Brothers building stands today as a one-and-one-half story building with gabled roof and has red-painted wooden siding. Two entrances can bet seen on the first floor on the Fifth street side of the building along with large windows that span most of the height of the first floor.

They carried Hart, Schaffner, and Marks Clothes, and advertised as “the home of good clothes.” In 1930 this building was home to Ward’s Electric Company, which sold electric lamps and appliances.

Between 1900 and 1908 a three-story brick building replaced it which housed the Calumet State Bank. The former Calumet State Bank and the Coppo Block appear as one building but they are separate and share a common wall. Similar architectural features like the large first floor display windows and arch-topped windows on the third-floor help blend the two together. The buildings also share an ornate cornice at their roofline.",
            "audioDescription": "The building at 219 Sixth street in downtown Calumet was built between 1900 and 1908 for the Calumet State Bank. The building stands three stories tall and is made of red sandstone on the first story, yellow brick on the second and third stories, and has an ornate roof cornice on its east and north face. The first floor has large display windows and lanterns on the red sandstone pillars which divide the windows. There is a single door entrance on the northeast and southeast corner of the building. The second floor has rectangular three-pane windows with red sandstone blocks on the top of the window. The third story had arch-topped windows that have been covered over with dark grey painted wood.",

In 1930 it was known as the Metropolitan Pharmacy, a Rexall store. At that time offices upstairs were occupied by conservation officer Joseph J. Werschay, chiropractor Thomas M. Uksila, the Calumet Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and veterinary surgeon James O’Neil. 220 5th Street was then occupied by Herman Jewelers which was one of the oldest businesses in Calumet.",

They also account for much of the trail damage. Though it may be dry today, all those little channels carry water and remove rock and soils. As the ground is shifted by erosion, the trail on top moves as well.",

In the 1940s, the Tambellinis sold the bar to Lajeunesse & Lajeunesse, a father and son from Laurium. Though it has changed hands a few times since then, it's still known as the L&L. The service station was later known as Al's Mobil, but sat vacant and derelict for years before it was purchased by the village and stabilized.

The company maintained a stable in the rear of the building.<br /> This building was later used for the same purposes by the Peninsula Wholesale Grocery Company, and the Cahodas-Paoli Company. Cahodas-Paoli was a local firm which was at one time the third largest fruit producer in the country. In the early 1960s, the Baroni family purchased the building. They produced Italian foods here until 2008, when the company was purchased by Vollwerths. After production was moved to Hancock, the building was sold to the current owner, and the Old School Baking Company later moved in.",

He also invested in real estate, including this property. This building was probably built after his death in 1901, by his estate. In 1884, this site was occupied by a wood-frame building with two storefronts. It was occupied by a variety of businesses, including a barber, a printshop, a dry goods and clothing store, a grocery store, a fruit store, a saloon, and a jewelry store. The existing building was built sometime between 1900 and 1908. In 1917, J C Penny opened a store here, before they moved to the Ruppe Department Store building in 1923. Then the McLogan & Pearce Music Company was here until it was purchased by the Weidelmann family in 1930, and moved to the Murphy Block. In the ‘30s and ‘40s, Harter Brothers Pool Room was located here. It is said that the mob boss of the Copper Country ran operations from a booth here, during the hey-day of the mafia in this area. By 1948 the bar here was known as The 315 Club. It became the UP Pub in 1978.",

Today it stands as a two-story concrete block building with brick façade on the front. The first floor has been painted blue and also has wood in the façade. Two large windows flank a single entrance door in the center. A small eve hangs the length of the building’s front and a sign above the door reads “BAR.” The second story has a red painted brick façade and a flat roof.",

The Fashion sold wine, liquor, and cigars – “everything after the latest fashion.” By 1903 William Jones was the proprietor of the saloon and had renamed it. The Ivy Saloon operated until at least 1916. By 1930 Albert Ford had purchased the business, changing the menu to soft drinks during the prohibition era. By 1948, prohibition was long over, and the name of the business had changed once again to Wheeler’s Tavern, as bars were known at the time. Wheeler’s was in business here until at least 1957.",

            "bodyText": "A two-story house occupied this site in 1884. In 1895, the house was moved back on the lot and the front portion of the existing building was built by Marco Curto, attached to the front of the house. The saloon here was first known as Curto’s Place. Sometime between 1897 and 1900, the house was demolished, and the back part of the existing building was built in its place. The Shute family took over the business from the Curto family between 1916 and 1926. During prohibition, the bar officially sold “near-beer” and other soft-drinks, but according to family stories, also clandestinely sold alcoholic beverages in the basement. Workers in the soft drink parlor would tap on the radiator pipes to alert patrons in the basement when enforcement officials came in for an inspection. In 1989, the Shute family sold the building and the business; it is currently owned by John Vertin and Brad Wagner. The village of Calumet owns the elaborate backbar and stained-glass canopy.",
            "audioDescription": "The building located at 322 Sixth street in downtown Calumet has been a saloon since it was built in 1890. It stands two stories tall and is made from red brick with a flat roof that sits at multiple different heights. The front has an ornate yellow cornice that extends above the roofline. The first floor has large display windows with detailed yellow and red trim. Two doors are located on the front: one in the center of the building and one on the far south end. The second story has two rectangular two-pane windows evenly spaced apart. Numerous windows sit on both the first and second floors of the south face of the building. There is also a faded sign for Pillsbury Best flour on the south face. A sign above the main entrance with red background and yellow lettering reads “Shutes 1890 Saloon.” The image of a woman holding a tray with a beer mug can be seen on the bottom half of the sign.",

It stood as the St Joseph church until 1966 when, due to decreasing population in the area, it was chosen to house the combination of four congregations and renamed the St. Paul the Apostle Church.

Sometime between 1893 and 1897, the existing two-story building was built. It was owned by Edward Ryan and used as a warehouse and heating plant for the Ryan store across the alley from this building on 5th Street. Steam was also sold to neighboring buildings for heat, and supplied through steam tunnels. In 1898, the house on this site was occupied by Eliza Bastian, the widow of Richard Bastian. She rented the blacksmith shop to various blacksmiths over the years. On May 17, 1917, the Ryan store was destroyed in a catastrophic fire. By July of that year, the two-story part of this building served as the Obenhoff Ice Cream Company’s factory. Sometime in the 1940s, the Bastian buildings were removed, and the one-tory wing was added to this building, with a remodeled front. Sometime between 1948 and 1957, Jilbert’s Dairy bought this building, and their operations were based here until they moved to Marquette in the 1970s.",

By 1898, it was occupied by Hosking and Company’s dry goods, clothing, and men’s furnishings (accessories) store. Mrs. Annie M. Hosking was the proprietor of the store. Her husband, William, managed the store. He was also postmaster of the Calumet post office in 1898. The Hoskings lived at 714 Pine Street. Sometime around 1906 the Hoskings sold the store, and it continued in business as the Red Front Store. By 1916, Ed Haas & Company had taken over the business as the Calumet branch of their Houghton store, which had previously been located up the street. They were also men’s clothiers and furnishers. Vertin Brothers Department Store later bought out the Haas store and built a connecting addition across the alley between their building and this building, making this their men’s department. Many local residents recall appointments with physician Andrew Roche in his office upstairs. When Vertin’s closed in 1985 nearly a hundred years of clothing sales in this building came to an end.",

Shortly thereafter, Ryan established a branch store here, in Red Jacket. Ryan, who lived in Hancock, soon became one of the wealthiest people in the Copper Country. His nephew, John D. Ryan, was head of the Anaconda Copper Company in Butte, Montana, and was one of the wealthiest people in the United States in the early 20th century. The original wood-frame store building here was destroyed in the great fire of 1870, but Ryan soon rebuilt. In 1887, he erected a large brick store building here on the same site. Edward Ryan died in 1900, but while the store was managed by his estate, a third story was added to the building, sometime around 1905. In 1917, the store was destroyed in another catastrophic fire. It was never rebuilt. These lots sat vacant for many years, until the Michigan American Water Company was established in 1959, and the existing office building was erected here.",

The original structure was built prior to 1888 as a two-story warehouse which stood until somewhere between 1908 and 1917 when it was burned in a fire. The space remained open for many years and now holds a single-story structure built from concrete block painted red. The front face has a set of high windows running from the south edge to the center where the entrance is located. The building has a flat roof and a sign above the entrance reads “Michigan American Water.”",

Prior to that, he had worked as a miner at the Central Mine. When he came to Red Jacket, Dunstan sold sewing machines, books, picture frames, notions, and organs. By 1893, the earlier Dunstan building was occupied by a saloon. When the existing building was first built, the main floor was occupied by a store known as a bazaar, selling picture frames and other items. The second floor was occupied by one or two apartments. The third floor was occupied by a lodge hall used by the Cornish fraternal group, the Sons of St. George. By 1917, the main floor here was occupied by a dress factory, and apartments occupied both upper floors of the building. In the 1920s, Gorshe Brothers bicycle and motorcycle shop was located here. From sometime before 1930 until about 2001, the Dunstan Block was home to Mullen’s Dry Cleaners. Artis Books and Antiques moved here just a couple years later, around 2003.",

Originally made completely of red Jacobsville sandstone and a red brick front face, by 1907 the front was changed to be made of red brick only. This building has housed multiple businesses including a novelty store, dress factory, picture frames, bazaar, and hosted a fraternal lodge. It stands three stories tall with a red brick front and flat roof. The first floor has large display windows and two entrances: one recessed into the center of the building and the other on the far south side of the front face.",

Initially it was a cobbler or shoemaker’s shop owned by Lars Olson. In 1898, Olson and his family lived at 516 6th Street. Olson must have done well in business, for by 1900, the family was living at 519 Pine Street, a home they owned without a mortgage, and they had a domestic servant living with them. Sometime between 1901 and 1903, 423 5th Street became a Singer sewing machine shop. In an era when many people still made their own clothes, a sewing machine was an important appliance in the home and required a significant financial investment. Then sometime between 1917 and 1930 it became a barber shop, managed by Percy Penberthy, who resided at 209 Tamarack Street in Laurium.",

The front of the building facing the road has tall display windows next to the single entrance door located on the northern end of this face. The second story has two rectangular windows evenly spaced apart. There is a decorative red and yellow cornice set just below the flat roofline.

            "audioDescription": "(654 words)<br />The C&O Canal Inlet Lock is located on the west side of Canal Road, NW Washington, DC about eight-tens of a mile north of Chain Bridge Road.<br />A gravel parking lot, about sixty-feet wide and one hundred-feet long is set immediately off Canal Road and is bordered by gravel at its east entry side.<br />Two portable bathrooms sit at the northeast end of the lot, on the right as you enter from Canal Road, about twenty feet from the roadside.<br />At the west end of the parking lot a twenty-foot long, six-foot wide wood bridge with railings on both sides carries over Canal Lock 5. Along the west side of Lock 5, a cement-paved area, fifty feet to the north and south, runs eighty feet to the west where it connects to the Inlet Canal that runs parallel to Lock 5. The area rises about four feet along its northern end.<br />From the Lock 5 bridge west side, a second wood bridge about eighty feet across the gravel path, with railings on both sides, carries about forty feet over the Inlet Canal and connects to the south end of the C&O Canal towpath. Water from the inlet canal flows underneath the bridge and connects to water from Lock 5.<br />At the west end of the bridge, to the right, sits a two by three-foot wayside. The faded sign is titled across a block border in white lettering to read:<br />Inlet Locks<br />Text along a yellow border below reads:<br />Eight dams and one steam pump were built along the river to funnel water into the canal in times of drought of low water, usually during the height of summer; river levels dropped dramatically. The canal could not get enough water from the river and the boat traffic would stop. This caused a loss of revenue for the canal company and the loss of a living for boat captains.<br />To the right is a faded and scratched color image of a man in a tan jacket and hat facing to the right. Text to his left reads:<br />As a young man, George Washington surveyed the Potomac River and discovered its riches. Part of the Patowmack Canal, which he championed, ran from here to the Abner Cloud House at mile 3.1.<br />Dam 1, a Little Falls, diverted water to this inlet lock, watering the canal from Lock 5 to Georgetown.<br />A faded image further right appears to be a map of a canal. A sign reading \"You Are Here\" indicates your location to the left.<br />Three-fourths of the sign below are a color image of a river flowing over a wide dam, a strip of land and towpath to the right, and further right a canal with water flowing top to bottom. An inlet lock is identified just north of the dam along the strip of land. Below is a mule crossover bridge with bridge wall lining the river's edge. Mules walk up the towpath from the south.<br />Text in the top left corner reads:<br />Inlet Lock<br />Dams and inlet locks were the engineering devices used to provide water for the canal.<br />A trail to the left of the sign runs north about one hundred fifty feet to the Inlet Lock. A small brown sign set to the right of the trail reads \"Inlet Lock.\" Two wood doors, angled inward slightly, block the lock's lower south end. Cement walls about six feet long are on either side. A wood railing sits atop the gate.<br />Along the west side of the lock, six four-foot wide cement steps lead up to the top of the lock and an eight-foot high cement wall lines the left side of the steps. A metal fence runs along the lock's east side. The trail continues around to the backside of the lock, where canal water flows in from the north. The lock doors are angled out slightly toward the north at this end.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Today, visitors can still travel the towpath, tracing the same route as mules and canal boats more than 100 years ago.<br /> <br /> From the shore of Rock Creek, you can get a view up through Lift Lock 1 and see the staircase of the four lift locks in Georgetown.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "(262 words)<br />C&O Canal Lock 1 is the southernmost and easternmost lock in the Chesapeake and Ohio canal system. It is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown area, east of 29th street, NW, south of M street and Pennsylvania avenue, and north of K street. <br />From the intersection of M and 29th streets, travel south on 29th street four hundred feet. Turn left onto the brick walkway and proceed about two hundred feet.<br />A one foot long brown sign with white lettering is set in the grass lawn about four feet off the brick walkway to the right that reads: \"Lock 1\"<br />Twenty feet to the south is the C&O Canal. Water passes through the twenty-five-foot-wide canal from west to east and empties into Rock Creek about two hundred yards to the west.<br />The wood remains of the lock are set along the canal edge, including a twenty-five-foot-long wood beam that runs parallel to the canal. A wood gate resembling a ladder sits on the face of the brick canal on its opposite side. The canal is about fifteen feet deep and shallow water flows slowly at the bottom. Ivy has overtaken much of the lock on the opposite side and hangs over the canal edge.<br />The grass lawn is about twenty-five feet wide and slopes down about five feet from the brick walkway above. A one-foot border of stone blocks lines the grass lawn edge as it meets the canal. The lawn spans about one hundred yards, from Rock Creek Parkway on the west end to 29th street to the east.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The island is about 2 miles from north to south, and 1 mile from east to west. Santa Barbara island is shaped a bit like a dog's head. Two pointy landforms stick up on the north side, almost like two upright ears. The tip of the left ear is Webster Point. Between the ears is Elephant Cove, and, just offshore, Shag Rock. The tip of the right ear, the northernmost point, is Arch Point. Below that, on the east side of the island, is the Landing Cove, with a dot titled, \"You Are Here\". Near the \"nose,\" or southern tip of the island, is Cat Canyon. A portion of the ocean is colored red, extending from the shoreline that runs between Cat Canyon and the middle of the eastern shore.

Thin, stiff wires stick up from the top edge of the panel. Please note: There are sometimes bird droppings on this panel.The View: Looking out over this wayside exhibit, is a steep rocky drop off. Below is a shoreline with blue green waters. Often, seals and sea lions are seen laying along the coast and a sea rock just off shore. They are furry, tan, and torpedo-shaped sea mammals, with flippers and dog-like heads. The males have a loud, bellowing bark, that sounds like \"Aarh!.\" The dock is seen at the base of the hillside below.The text on the panel reads,Sea lions lead a double life. Basking on the haul-out rocks, they appear lazy, immobile. But when they slip beneath the waves they become swift, proficient hunters.These nutrient-rich waters and nearby kelp forests attract great numbers of fish and squid, providing sea lions with an endless feast. Protected from human disturbance, thousands of seals and California sea lions use the islands' secluded coves as breeding grounds, nurseries, and resting areas. In many ways the Channel Islands are a paradise for pinnipeds (seals and sea lions).A photo shows of a group of sea lions lounging togethe",

The former 1st Presbyterian Church is a single-story wood-frame building which is 24 feet to the eaves and has a 65-foot tower on the eastern face near the front entrance. The roof is a cross gabled style with green asphalt shingles. Large arched windows can be found around the building. A brick chimney can also be seen coming out of the roof near the eastern face. The former Christ Episcopal Church is a wooden single-story structure which is 16 feet to its eves and has a steeply sloped gabled roof. Tall rectangular windows with curved arch tops can be seen encircling the building. A large cross is present on the crest of the roof near the eastern face of the building. The former Carmel Evangelical Lutheran Church was built in 1894. It is a single story red Jacobsville sandstone building which was 20 feet to the eves and a 100-foot tower in the center of the western face. Tall rectangular windows with round arch tops circle the building with rectangular windows set below them looking into the basement level. The former YMCA building is a single-story building with an elevated foundation and hipped roof. Tall rectangular windows encircle the main floor with round arch tops on the western face. Smaller square windows can be seen near the ground on the basement level. Two single-story wooden additions were originally constructed the northern face of the building. They are now connected into one addition which serves as the main entrance. A brick chimney is found on the western end of the north face of the roof.",

A six-foot long wood bench is set on the north side of the space. Just beyond the sign, to the south six-foot wide gravel and wood steps that leads down to the Crescent Trail pedestrian path below. A few feet north beyond the bench about six black granite blocks lay partially buried alongside the towpath.<br />The yellow sign is titled across a black border on the top that reads: \"Georgetown Incline Plane.\" Text below describes the creation of the Georgetown incline plane:<br />Here, in 1876, an engineering marvel was built. The largest incline plane in the world and the first built in the United States, carried canal boats to and from the Potomac River. The incline plane was used to help clear heavy boat traffic in Georgetown; canal boats often log-jammed while waiting to unload. Boats left the canal through a lock and entered the incline plane's large water filled car; the water from the car was drained as two stone-filled, counter-balancing cars, moving in the opposite direction, lowered the boat 480 feet to the river, and on to its Georgetown port.<br />To the right is a black and white image showing canal boats lined up along the right, A border to the left divides a road on the left. Text below reads:<br />The incline plane helped move boats to Georgetown docks faster.<br />The bottom two thirds of the sign show a color drawing of a ramp with a canal boat to the left and an arrow indicating its movement to the right. At the right side, two rows of four boxes are moving up the ramp to the left. A canal runs across the top of the image from left to right. A point indicates that you are standing at the intersection of the ramp and the canal. In the top left, a second canal boat waits to enter the ramp. At the bottom right, the ramp leads back down into a river.<br />A faded black and white photograph to the right shows a view looking up from the lower end of a ramp. Two boxes are lined up in a row on the ramp. Text to the left reads:<br />The incline plane was one of the structures selected to represent American engineering achievements at the Paris Exposition of 1878.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

In 1884, it was home to a boarding house called the Anglo American Hotel. By 1893, there was a saloon here. In 1898, the saloon was managed by Jacob Petersen. By 1903, it was known as the Michigan House.<br /> In 1905, the Bosch brewing company purchased the property, demolished the old wood-frame building, and erected the existing building as an outlet for its lagers and other brews. This building was designed by architect Charles Maas. The Bosch Brewing Company eventually became one of the largest employers in the Copper Country, second only to the Calumet & Hecla Mining Company. They operated many saloons throughout the area in addition to their brewery in Lake Linden, and a number of distribution facilities known as beer depots. The Michigan House is now home to another local brewery, the Red Jacket Brewing Company.",

If you face the kiosk with your back to the parking lot, the Brecksville Station is to the left on the far side of the train tracks and, in front of you, a path leads to a historic bridge over the river and connects to the Towpath Trail along the canal. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location at the northern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Station Road Bridge Trailhead.

Loop back via the trail along the river.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines.

The park was established to protect, preserve, and enhance our understanding of the islands' unique past and remarkable resources.<b><strong> </strong> </b><br /> <br /> <b>Get Acquainted</b><br /> Santa Cruz Island has rugged mountain ranges, deep canyons with year round springs and streams, and a rocky coastline with pristine tidepools and expansive beaches. The island supports more than 600 plant species, 220 bird species, 13 mammal, three amphibian and five reptile species, and large colonies of breeding seals and sea lions and other marine life. Many distinctive plant and animal species have adapted to the island's unique environment, including the island scrub-jay, the island fox, and eight plants that are found nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> <b>In the Sea </b><br /> For thousands of years, Chumash people inhabited Santa Cruz Island, which was known to them as \"Limuw\", meaning \"in the sea.\" The first European settlers, fishermen, and sheep ranchers arrived in the 1800s. In 1980, the island was designated part of Channel Islands National Park. Together, the National Park Service, which manages the eastern 24 percent of the island, and The Nature Conservancy, which manages the western 76 percent, work together to preserve and protect the island's resources. The island waters are protected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the State of California.<br /> <br /> <b>You Have a Role to Play </b><br /> Everyone who visits this national park plays an important role in safeguarding the island plants, animals, cultural sites, and artifacts.

Three smaller inset photos line the top of the panel with accompanying captions: Get Acquainted, In the Sea, and You have a Role to Play. First Get Acquainted -A photograph of a large, crow sized bright blue bird the island scrub jay. The jay with its long tail, broad head and thick black bill, is perched on top of a green leafy bush. Its white underbelly is in sharp contrast to the brilliant blue sheen of its back. A distinctive rusty-gray patch marks the upper part of the wings.Text reads:Santa Cruz Island has rugged mountain ranges, deep canyons with year roundsprings and streams, and a rocky coastline with pristine tidepoolsand expansive beaches. The island supports more than 600 plant species,220 bird species, 13 mammal, three amphibian and five reptile species, andlarge colonies of breeding seals and sea lions and other marine life. Manydistinctive plant and animal species have adapted to the island's uniqueenvironment, including the island scrub-jay, the island fox, and eight plantsthat are found nowhere else in the worldNext In the Sea An Aerial photograph of Santa Cruz Island illustrates the jagged shoreline and rugged deep cut valleys in a mountainous topography.Text readsFor thousands of years, Chumash people inhabited Santa Cruz Island, whichwas known to them as \"Limuw\", meaning \"in the sea.\" The first Europeansettlers, fishermen, and sheep ranchers arrived in the 1800s. In 1980, theisland was designated part of Channel Islands National Park. Together, theNational Park Service, which manages the eastern 24 percent of the island,and The Nature Conservancy, which manages the western 76 percent, worktogether to preserve and protect the island's resources. The island waters areprotected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National MarineSanctuary, and the State of California.Then You Have a Role to Play The last photograph illustrates a vast expanse of rocky beach where the water meets the shore. A park ranger kneels down next to a young child. Together they explore the rocks and kelp along the beach.Text reads:Everyone who visits this national park plays an important role insafeguarding the island plants, animals, cultural sites, and artifacts.

It also contains safety information.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island Campground<br /> Camping is available on all five islands in Channel Islands National Park. Here on San Miguel Island, camping is allowed only in this designated campground.<br /> <br /> Welcome to San Miguel Island, one of five islands in the Channel Islands National Park. As a visitor, you can help preserve and protect San Miguel Island by taking a moment to read this bulletin board and taking action to care for the island during your visit.<br /> <br /> Located twenty-five nautical miles off the coast of California, San Miguel Island is not only the farthest west of the Channel Islands, but also the most primitive and wild. Nowhere do you get a truer island experience than here. San Miguel is one of the greatest refuges on the coast with over 80,000 seals and sea lions and 13 different seabird species gathering to rest and breed.<br /> <br /> The island also hosts pristine tidepools, rare plants, and the strange caliche forest.<br /> <br /> For 12,000 years San Miguel was home to the seagoing Chumash people and their ancestors. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo set foot here as the first European to explore the California coast. For 100 years the island was a sheep ranch and in the 70 years it has been used by the military. Although San Miguel Island is still owned by the Navy, it was designated part of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980.<br /> <br /> Of all the campgrounds in the National Parks, this one on San Miguel is unique. You are among a very small group of people that have experienced this place. Only 100 to 200 people camp here each year. The effort it took to get here and the harsh weather you must sometimes endure are rewarded by a solitude and wildness seldom experienced anymore.<br /> <br /> Balancing the needs of visitors and wildlife is the highest mission of your National Park Service. Whether walking the trails, or paddling the shoreline, stay safe and join us in preserving a little piece of wild California.<br /> <br /> Campground Regulations <br /> <br /> Everything is protected.<br /> As in all national parks it is illegal to feed, collect, disturb, or harm park wildlife, plant life, or other natural, historical, and archeological features.<br /> <br /> Proper food storage is required.<br /> Store all food, trash, and scented items in a secure, animal-proof container at all times. Do not store in tents. Failure to store these items properly may result in a fine. Protect island wildlife, especially the island fox, by keeping your camp clean.<br /> <br /> Remove your garbage.<br /> Visitors are required to pack out what they pack in, including garbage.<br /> No campfires or charcoal fires.<br /> Due to extreme fire danger, no campfires or charcoal fires are permitted on the island. Use only enclosed gas campstoves for cooking.<br /> <br /> Smoking allowed only on beaches.<br /> Please take cigarette butts off the islands with your other trash.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with deer mice.<br /> Hantavirus has been found in island deer mice. Contact your physician if you experience flu-like symptoms after contact with deer mice or infected materials. This is a life-threatening illness.<br /> <br /> Observe quiet time in the campground after 10:00 pm.<br /> To ensure a pleasurable camping experience for all, please respect your fellow campers and observe quiet time after 10:00 pm.<br /> <br /> Be aware of boat departure times.<br /> When departing the island, visitors are responsible for meeting the boat on time. Ask the ranger or concessioner for departure times.<br /> <br /> Emergency Procedures<br /> In an emergency, contact a ranger or concession employee. If a phone is available, contact the National Park Dispatch Center at 559-565-4221. This dispatch center handles all emergencies, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for Channel Islands National Park. On the water, use a marine radio to contact the US Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16.<br /> <br /> Watersports<br /> <br /> All watersports including, kayaking, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA, are at your own risk. There are no lifeguards on duty.<br /> <br /> Be alert to wind, waves, and currents at all times – strong winds and rough seas are not uncommon and conditions change rapidly.<br /> <br /> Water temperatures generally range from 50 to 60 degrees, and wetsuits should be worn if planning to stay in the water for any length of time.<br /> <br /> For your own safety, use a buddy system for all watersports and wear a helmet when kayaking near rocky outcroppings, overheads environments and caves.<br /> <br /> The entire shoreline of San Miguel is closed to landing except at Cuyler Harbor beach.<br /> <br /> Do not land on offshore rocks; these are protected places for seabirds, seals, and sea lions. Remain 100 yards from marine mammals that are hauled out on the rocks and beaches.<br /> <br /> Kayak equipment checklist – experienced sea kayakers recommend the following items: personal flotation device (PFD), helmet, broad-brimmed hat, sunscreen, adequate spray skirt, dry storage bags, food and fresh water with extra provisions, first aid, repair kit, and heavy diameter haul lines with carabiners.<br /> <br /> No fishing within marine reserves. There are three marine protected areas in the waters surrounding San Miguel Island, including the immediate area outside of Cuyler Harbor. Within these areas, the take of living, geological, or cultural resources is prohibited. All intertidal plants and most intertidal animals around the entire island are also protected. See Fish and Wildlife regulations for more information. Possession of a valid California state fishing license and an Ocean Enhancement stamp are required to fish outside the marine protected areas. Please see the island ranger for more details.<br />   <br /> Hiking<br /> <br /> Visitors must stay on trails at all times. No off-trail travel is allowed. This ensures the protection of wildlife, fragile plants, and geologic features. It also ensures your safety as the island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> A map of San Miguel Island with key locations and marine reserves identified. Trails, ranger station, campground, and restrooms are also shown.<br /> <br /> The text reads,<br /> <br /> Visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond the ranger station. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch Site (the trails marked in bold on the map)<br /> <br /> Depending on the length of your stay, up to three different ranger guided hikes can be offered:<br /> <br /> Point Bennett: An all day, 14 mile roundtrip hike to the pinniped rookery on the west end of the island. This trip includes a visit to the caliche forest which is about two miles from the campground.<br /> <br /> Cardwell Point: A six mile roundtrip hike to the pinniped rookery on the east end of the island.<br /> <br /> Lester Point: A scenic six mile roundtrip hike to the northern end of the island.<br /> <br /> For all hiking bring along: 1) a lunch and trail snacks; 2) at least 1 quart of water per person; 3) binoculars – viewing distance to the animals is dependent on weather and phase of pupping/breeding for the animals; and 4) hat, sunscreen, sturdy walking shoes, and at least a wind-proof layer.<br /> <br /> A photo shows a jumbled pile of varied pinnipeds, laying on top of one another. They include massive tan, brown, and gray elephant seals, shaped like enormous slugs, with heads like a dog’s except without visible ears. These elephant seals have stubby trunks or snouts. Mixed in among these huge seals are several, much smaller, sea lions. They are tan, with heads shaped like a dogs, but with tiny ears and long whiskers. <br /> <br /> A map shows San Miguel, an island with uneven shoreline and several tips or points. It is about 22 miles wide from west to east and 12 miles from north to south. At the northernmost point is a boot-shaped peninsula, ending in the tip of the boot—Harris Point. At about where the boots laces would be is Lester Point, which overlooks Simonton Cove and Otter Harbor to the west, and Castle Rock, offshore, further west. To the east of Harris Point, just past the “heel” of the boot, Cuyler Harbor cuts a c-shape out of the north shore of the island. Prince Island is just offshore. Features on the harbor shore, from west to east, include Palm trees, and offshore, Judge Rock and Gull Rock. Dotted lines represent a trail along the Cuyler Harbor beach. The trail branches inland near Gull Rock, heading south and then branching further to reach Cabrillo Monument, Lester Ranch site, a campground with restrooms, and a ranger station with restrooms. Farther along the northeast shore is Bay Point. At the eastern tip of the island is Cardwell Point. The ocean north of the coastline between Simonton Cove and Cardwell Point is colored red and titled Harris Point Marine Reserve, No Commercial or Recreational Fishing Allowed.<br /> <br /> At the southernmost side is Crook Point. On the southwest shore, a curve in the coastline marks Tyler Bight. The western tip of that curve ends at Judith Rock. Another curve to the west of Judith Rock is called Adams Cove. The ocean south of the coastline including Adams Cove and Judith Rock is also red and titled Judith Rock Marine Reserve, with the same rules.<br /> <br /> The western tip is called Point Bennett. Stretching out westward from the Point are several skinny islands, like sand spits. Amid these tiny islands is an icon of a half-sunken ship, titled “Cuba Wreck.”<br /> <br /> A black line wraps around the western tip of San Miguel, marking the coastline from near Castle Rock, all the way to Judith Rock.

            "audioDescription": "This bulletin board, located at the campground restroom, provides information about San Miguel Island, campground regulations, watersports, hiking, and a map. It also contains safety information.The text reads,San Miguel Island CampgroundCamping is available on all five islands in Channel Islands National Park. Here on San Miguel Island, camping is allowed only in this designated campground.Welcome to San Miguel Island, one of five islands in the Channel Islands National Park. As a visitor, you can help preserve and protect San Miguel Island by taking a moment to read this bulletin board and taking action to care for the island during your visit.Located twenty-five nautical miles off the coast of California, San Miguel Island is not only the farthest west of the Channel Islands, but also the most primitive and wild. Nowhere do you get a truer island experience than here. San Miguel is one of the greatest refuges on the coast with over 80,000 seals and sea lions and 13 different seabird species gathering to rest and breed.The island also hosts pristine tidepools, rare plants, and the strange caliche forest.For 12,000 years San Miguel was home to the seagoing Chumash people and their ancestors. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo set foot here as the first European to explore the California coast. For 100 years the island was a sheep ranch and in the 70 years it has been used by the military. Although San Miguel Island is still owned by the Navy, it was designated part of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980.Of all the campgrounds in the National Parks, this one on San Miguel is unique. You are among a very small group of people that have experienced this place. Only 100 to 200 people camp here each year. The effort it took to get here and the harsh weather you must sometimes endure are rewarded by a solitude and wildness seldom experienced anymore.Balancing the needs of visitors and wildlife is the highest mission of your National Park Service. Whether walking the trails, or paddling the shoreline, stay safe and join us in preserving a little piece of wild California.Campground Regulations Everything is protected.As in all national parks it is illegal to feed, collect, disturb, or harm park wildlife, plant life, or other natural, historical, and archeological features.Proper food storage is required.Store all food, trash, and scented items in a secure, animal-proof container at all times. Do not store in tents. Failure to store these items properly may result in a fine. Protect island wildlife, especially the island fox, by keeping your camp clean.Remove your garbage.Visitors are required to pack out what they pack in, including garbage.No campfires or charcoal fires.Due to extreme fire danger, no campfires or charcoal fires are permitted on the island. Use only enclosed gas campstoves for cooking.Smoking allowed only on beaches.Please take cigarette butts off the islands with your other trash.Avoid contact with deer mice.Hantavirus has been found in island deer mice. Contact your physician if you experience flu-like symptoms after contact with deer mice or infected materials. This is a life-threatening illness.Observe quiet time in the campground after 10:00 pm.To ensure a pleasurable camping experience for all, please respect your fellow campers and observe quiet time after 10:00 pm.Be aware of boat departure times.When departing the island, visitors are responsible for meeting the boat on time. Ask the ranger or concessioner for departure times.Emergency ProceduresIn an emergency, contact a ranger or concession employee. If a phone is available, contact the National Park Dispatch Center at 559-565-4221. This dispatch center handles all emergencies, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for Channel Islands National Park.

To your left is a hillside covered with dried grasses and depending on the season, coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers. In late summer, fall or winter, the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead. Behind you is the patio of the Santa Barbara Island Visitor Center. The text reads, Sea Bird Habitat To cormorants, brown pelicans, and western gulls, this island offers ideal habitat. The basalt cliffs have ledges for nesting and roosting isolated from mainland predators and most human interference. There would be virtually no sea birds in Southern California if it were not for the islands. Sea birds often bathe in the cove to wash off parasites. In a constant shuttle between cliff and ocean, the birds carry anchovies and other fish back to nestlings. A photo shows six shiny black birds, perched on white rocks. Their necks are gracefully curved like a duck’s, but a bit longer. They have long pointed pale beaks, and black eyes. Their black tails are like a small feathered fan. This photo is provided by National Park Service The text reads, Cormorants are awkward flyers but prodigious divers, overtaking fish at depths of more than 100 feet. On land they hold their unoiled wings out to dry. Observe the birds closely to see their special adaptations to both land and sea. A photo shows a brown pelican sitting on a nest made of interwoven dried grasses. Its long white beak, with a pink tip, is tucked downward, snug against its long neck. Its wings are light brown, with a black stripe along the back of the neck and tuft of spikey feathers behind a tan and white head. The caption reads, California brown pelicans nest on the ground on Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands. They often fly single file, riding the updrafts along the cliffs. A photo shows a seagull, with a gray back and a white chest and head with a curved orange beak, nesting on sticks of dried grass in the dirt. The text reads, Western gulls’ nests are visible on the cliff ledges. But gulls also nest on the flat terraces above. Look for the different nesting patterns as you hike around the island. On the top right corner of the wayside panel, the text reads, Channel Island National Park Santa Barbara Island National Park Service U. S. Department of the Interior",

Please note: There are sometimes bird droppings on this panel. The View: Looking out over this wayside exhibit, is a steep rocky drop off. Below is a shoreline with blue green waters. Often, seals and sea lions are seen laying along the coast and a sea rock just off shore. They are furry, tan, and torpedo-shaped sea mammals, with flippers and dog-like heads. The males have a loud, bellowing bark, that sounds like “Aarh!.” The dock is seen at the base of the hillside below. The text on the panel reads, Sea lions lead a double life.

            "audioDescription": "This park orientation panel, near the Ranger Station and Visitor Center, shows a map and information about Santa Barbara Island. It also contains safety information. The text on the panel reads, Santa Barbara Island Welcome to Santa Barbara Island, one of the five islands in Channel Islands National Park. The park was established to protect, preserve, and enhance our understanding of the islands’ unique past and remarkable resources. A photo shows a bird floating on the top of the water. It is colored black on its back and head and white on its neck and chest, like a tuxedo. The text reads, Get Acquainted Thirty-eight miles from the mainland Santa Barbara Island is the smallest of the Channel Islands at just one-square mile in size. Waves have eroded the island, creating twin-peaked mesas, towering sea cliffs, sea caves, and natural bridges. The island provides critically important habitat for endemic plants and animals, pinnipeds, and seabirds, including one of the world’s largest colonies of Scripps’s murrelets. A photo from a hillside, looking out along the shoreline, and the ocean beyond. The foreground is covered with mounds of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that rise on tall green stalks. At the farthest point of land, an arch cuts through a tall rock outcrop, at the water line, creating a tunnel through the rock, and a peek at the water on the other side. The text reads, Island Crossroad For thousands of years, the Gabrieliño /Tongva and Chumash visited Santa Barbara Island. Explorers, seal and abalone hunters, ranchers, and the military would eventually follow. Protection for the island began in 1938 when Santa Barbara Island (along with Anacapa Island) was designated a national monument. In 1980 it was designated as part of the Channel Islands National Park. The island waters are protected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the State of California. A photo shows three people hiking through tall dry grass on a fairly flat field, near a cliff’s edge. Beyond and below them is a deep cove. Ocean waves crash up against rocks and dark cliffs near the shore, turning into white water. At the far side of the cove, an arch cuts through a rock shelf, at the water line, creating a tunnel through the rock, and a view of the water on the other side. In the distance, a tall point of land extends out into the ocean. The top is a flat plateau, with steep, almost vertical, cliffs dropping down to the water’s edge. A deep canyon cuts through a section of the plateau. The text reads, You Have a Role to Play Everyone who visits this national park plays an important role in safeguarding the island plants, animals, cultural sites, and artifacts. Help protect your park by taking a moment to read the information provided here and follow up with actions that preserve the islands’ fragile resources. For additional information on park regulations, safety, and things to do please refer to the park newspaper, brochure, and bulletins located in the box below or visit www.nps.gov/chis. Protect Yourself and Your Park Emergency Procedures Things to Do Santa Barbara Island is the perfect place for a variety of activities including hiking, camping, swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, and wildlife and wildflower viewing. Please refer to the park newspaper and brochure located in the box below for detailed information. For self-guided interpretive information on Santa Barbara Island, please refer to the Santa Barbara Island Trail Guide located in the adjacent box. A photo shows a grassy slope that ends in a steep cliff at the shoreline. The land extends to a tall point in the distance. Below the cliffs is a cove with calm waters. Several hundred yards off shore, a small island rises from the ocean. In the foreground, a thin peninsula of land extends out into the ocean. An arch cuts all the way through it at the water line, creating a tunnel through the rock, and a glimpse of the water on the other side. A metal box, with a hinged lid, is located below the sign. Brochures and pamphlets can be found inside. The label on the box has an icon, a question mark in a circle. The lettering next to it reads, Information. A hollow post to the left of the sign also has a hinged lid. Please note that there are often bird dropping on both hinged lids. Below the hinge is a sign that reads.

It also contains safety information.The text reads,San Miguel IslandWelcome to Cuyler Harbor on San Miguel Island, one of the Channel Islands National Park. The park was established to protect, preserve, and enhance our understanding of the islands' unique past and remarkable resources.A photo shows an adult island fox standing in tall green grass, facing us, with closed eyes. Its tall, fluffy ears point upward. Its fur is grey, with flecks of white and brown. Its chest and ears are orange. The text reads,Get AcquaintedLocated twenty-five nautical miles off the coast of California, San Miguel Island is not only the farthest west of the Channel Islands, but also the most primitive and wild. Nowhere do you get a truer island experience than here. San Miguel Island is one of the greatest refuges on the coast with over 80,000 seals and sea lions and 13 different seabird species gathering to rest and breed. The island also hosts pristine tidepools, rare and endemic plants and animals (including the island fox), and the strange caliche forest.A photo shows a wide, sandy shoreline, with pale turquoise water. The beach is filled with hundreds of tan and dark brown seals and sea lions both of which are shaped like torpedoes. The seals and sea lions have front flippers and tail-like back flippers. The beach extends to two large sea rocks in the distance. The text reads,TuqanFor thousands of years, Chumash people inhabited San Miguel Island, which was known to them as \"Tuqan.\" Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo set foot here in 1542 as the first European to explore the California coast. For 100 years the island was a sheep ranch and after that it was used by the military. San Miguel Island is still owned by the Navy, but it is managed under agreement by the National Park Service. In 1980 it was designated part of Channel Islands National Park. The island waters are protected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the State of California.A photo shows a person standing beside a low box on a bluff covered with low shrubs. A large island is seen in the distance, across ocean waters.The text reads,You Have a Role to PlayEveryone who visits this national park plays an important role safeguarding the island plants, animals, cultural sites, and artifacts.

Where ecosystems meet is called an edge. This edge is exciting becasue it has characteristics of the forest, prairie and riparian areas, making it very diverse. Forest animals, such as deer and elk, feed along the edges during dawn and dusk then return to the shelter of the forest during the day. Edges provide both food and shelter, which is why you will often see more wildlife in these areas.<br /> <br /> Edges are constantly changing. As the trees drop pine cones onto the prairie, seedlings begin to grow. When fire sweeps across the land it burns the young seedlings, reclaiming land for the prairie. In years between fires, seedlings again flourish. This cycle has occurred throughout history under natural conditions. As you hike look for signs of the fire cycle. Also, think about why many animals prefer to live \"life on the edge.\"",

            "bodyText": "<p>The land always remembers. At the Santa Fe Trail Tracks we catch a glimpse of the memory of traders crossing the Trail in search of opportunity. For 60 years, this prairie sod was torn by the hooves of mules, oxen, and horses, and compacted by the weight of the large freight wagons they pulled. <br /> <br /> Plains Indians crossed this path as well, the land their home. Cheyenne, Apache, Kiowa-Apaches, and Arapahoe Indians roamed here. As more and more Santa Fe Trail travelers passed through the lands of the Plains Indians, an uneasy tension developed. Friendly trade, wary suspicion, plunder, or bloodshed could result from any encounter.<br /> <br /> Soldiers and temporary fortifications protected trading caravans as early as 1847, but isolation and lack of supplies led to their abandonment by 1854. Fort Dodge, established in 1865, was the area’s first permanent fort. You can still visit the Fort today. With its construction came a series of changes that eventually made it impossible for Plains Indians to live their traditional way of life.<br /> <br /> The site of the Santa Fe Trail Tracks also contains the remains of the Eureka Irrigation Canal (Stoule Canal). Built in the 1880s by Asa T. Soule, a prominent Dodge resident, the canal is seen as an engineering marvel of the 19th century. The canal was intended to irrigate farmlands north of Dodge City, but failed when a prolonged drought and similar projects lowered the Arkansas River’s water level.  </p> <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1620406313684\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1620406313684\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1620406313684\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1620406313684\">Nearby Sites</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1620406313684\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1620406313684\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\"> <ul> <li>To the East there is Mulberry Creek Crossing, the 100th Meridian Marker, Fort Larned National Historic Site, and the Junction of the Wet and Dry Trail Routes.  </li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\"> <ul> <li>If you are up for a longer trip, to the West you can visit Charlie’s Ruts, Boggsville Historic Site, Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site, Point of Rocks, and McNees Crossing. </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <p> </p> <h4>Site Information</h4>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/dodge-city-ruts-exhibits.htm\">More Site Information (Exhibits)</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Sometime during 1858, a trading post was established at the Stone Corral. In February of 1859, the Kansas Territorial Legislature passed an act to authorize William T. Williamson and others to build a bridge at the Little Arkansas crossing. The legislature set the toll rates as follows: wagon or vehicle, 50 cents; each large animal, 10 cents, each small animal and person, 5 cents; man and horse, 10 cents. The earliest known somewhat permanent operator of a ranch at the Little Arkansas crossing was William D. Wheeler.<br /> <br /> Wheeler, with the help of others, may have built the Stone Corral that existed on the site of his ranch. The original Buffalo Bill, William Mathewson, had a trading post here for a short time. Some believe that the soldiers who occupied the site in 1865 and in 1867 did the work, but there are references to the corral prior to 1865, when troops were first stationed there. The stone used for the construction of the Stone Corral was quarried from an outcropping of rock about one mile west of the Stone Corral location. The corral was described as an excellent example of dry masonry, the walls being so perfectly laid and the sandstone slabs so carefully placed together that little or no light could be seen through any place. There was a small stone room built into one corner of the corral. The walls were about eight feet high and perhaps thirty inches thick. The corral was 300 to 400 feet long east and west, or perhaps northeast to southwest, and about 200 feet wide. The north wall had one or two openings about 10 inches up and down, and two feet long on the inside, tapering to about 10 inches square on the outside. A gateway at the southeast corner of the corral allowed wagons and livestock to enter.<br /> <br /> William Wheeler disappeared after May 1864. Prior to 1872, American Indians burned the bridge over the Little Arkansas in an unsuccessful attempt to stop travel on the Santa Fe Trail. Nathan A. C. Bean was the first to officially settle on the Stone Corral site in the 1870's, living in the corral for several months. According to Bean, eight to as many as thirty wagons regularly camped within the walls of the Stone Corral enclosure. Early in the 1870's Mr. Bean began selling stone from the walls of the corral. Some of this was used to build a school house a mile south and three quarters of a mile west of the Stone Corral location. Known as Stone Corral School, the building is still standing though it hasn’t been used in many years. Some of the stone was hauled to Nickerson for the construction of a railway roundhouse. Early settlers in the area used some of the stone to line water wells and build foundations for the homes and farm buildings that were being constructed in the area. Within a few years nearly all the stone was gone and the land was cleared for cultivation.</p> <h4>Site Information </h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Little-Arkansas-Crossing-Brochure-August-2014.pdf\">Santa Fe Trail Association Little Arkansas Crossing Brochure</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

He was a plainsman and former mountain man. The 1879 biographical sketch of his life says the year was 1862 and his own statement in 1864, confirms that he \"built the ranche and corral, dug and walled the well, and owned the trading post himself...\"<br /> <br /> In 1863, after operating it only one year, Mathewson sold his ranche at the Great Bend to Theodore R. (Dick) Curtis and H. F. (Frank) Cole. These partners had obtained a license from Indian agent Samuel G. Colley to trade with the Cheyennes, Kiowas, Comanches, Arapahoes, and Plains Apaches. Curtis, however, was employed as an interpreter at Fort Larned (some 35 miles west) and it was Frank Cole who stayed at the ranche.<br /> <br /> The ranche at the Great Bend of the Arkansas existed less than two and a half years.</p> <h4>Site Information </h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Big-Bend-of-the-Arkansas-Brochure-Nov-2012.pdf\">Read more: <em>The Great/Big Bend of the Arksansas</em> brochure from the Santa Fe Trail Association</a></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3> <br />  ",

He had 3 road ranches on the trail and was one of the last owners of the ranch at the Cimarron Crossing from 1866 - 68. He was also the owner of the sutler store at Fort Dodge.<br /> <br /> He became a major business man in Dodge City and the Rath and Wright store was the main business in Dodge City supplying first the buffalo hunters and then the cattle men and their drovers. Wright served as mayor and as a state representative from 1875 - 1883. In 1883, Wright purchased 19 plus acres of treeless swampland north of the Arkansas River from the town company. Wright intended to give the city the land as a park. He and Peter Mootz, a nurseryman, planted cottonwood trees and filled in the channels. In 1900, the city took ownership and the park was named in Wright's honor. The park has expanded to 61 acres and is the main park in Dodge City.</p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p>At Wright Park today, not only can you find peace under the shade of tall trees and at the Liberty Garden, but you can also find excitement visiting Wright Park Zoo, the playground, and skatepark.

            "audioDescription": "The Upper Blackrock Summit Trailhead exhibit is a 36 by 54 inch color panel. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken skyward up the talus slope toward the sky. The text reads, \"An Ocean Preserved - The exposed rocks of Blackrock formed the seabed of the Iapetus Ocean, an ancient body of water that predates the Appalachian Mountains. The geological forces that created the mountains changed the seabed into solid quartzite rock. You can see the layers of sand and quartzite on the rocks. Blackrock is still changing. Weathering has caused what was once a cliff to crumble into a talus slope, a river of moving rocks. Water, ice, and roots break the rocks into even smaller pieces that slide downhill. Eventually the rocks will have settled enough that plants can grow and Blackrock will look like other forested mountainsides. The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is a close-up of a table mountain pine cone lying on the forest floor. The text reads, \"A Forest Renewed - Around Blackrock you might notice burn scars here and there. You might also see new oak and table mountain pine seedlings reaching for the sun. It's hard to see the relationship between the two - fire and these seedlings - but actually we wouldn't have one without the other! The Blackrock area was the site of a prescribed burn in 2008. Shenandoah fire managers were concerned that, because the area had not burned for many years, the thick mountain laurel was choking out native oaks and pines. A carefully planned fire helped clear the brush, open the forest canopy, and regenerate important species. You Can Help - The popularity of the cliffs makes your care even more important. Constant trampling can endanger the fragile vegetation. Please stay on the trail and avoid stepping on sensitive plants and lichen-covered rocks. The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Blackrock Summit. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: #1 Blackrock Summit (This trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.) 1-mile circuit, easiest, 0.75 hours hiking time, 175-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south. After a short distance, the trees open up and the A.T. goes around a rocky talus slope. Stay on the A.T. and continue south around the slope. At the intersection, turn left onto the Blackrock Hut Road - Trayfoot Mountain Trail, and follow the trail back to the parking lot. Hike #2: Blackrock Spur Trail & Trayfoot Mountain Trail - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 1.6-mile circuit, easiest, 1-hour hiking time, 445-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south. After a short distance, the trees open up and the A.T. goes around a rocky talus slope. At the trail post, turn right to follow the Blackrock Spur Trail through a boulder field. Continue downhill to the intersection, and turn left onto Trayfoot Mountain Trail. When the trail meets the A.T., it becomes Blackrock Hut Road - Trayfoot Mountain Trail, which will take you back to the starting point. A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. When you return from your hike, check for ticks.

Ferry Hill is best known as the home of Henry Kyd Douglas, Confederate Officer and author of his Civil War personal account, \"I Rode With Stonewall.\"<br /> <br /> In the 18th and early 19th century German settlers migrated from Pennsylvania south into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, where they then farmed the rich soil. These settlers crossed the Potomac using Packhorse Ford and later Blackford's Ferry below Ferry Hill. Come the 1830s the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal crossed this north/south route, tapping the river waters to provide a controlled water transportation route into western Maryland.<br /> <br /> John Blackford who built and resided at Ferry Hill benefited from this crossroads of commerce. Unlike southern plantations, Ferry Hill profited from not just one cash crop, such as tobacco or cotton, but from a variety of crops, including grains, wheat, corn, an orchard, and even lumbering.<br /> <br /> \"I was with the company that set fire to [the bridge], and when . . . I saw the glowing windows in my home on the hill beyond the river . . . I realized that the war had begun.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, 1861<br /> <br /> By 1860, Ferry Hill shifted through marriage into the Douglas family as Reverend Robert Douglas. As the Civil War began in 1861, Reverend Douglas' son Henry Kyd enlisted in the Confederate army where he served under Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Both young Douglas and Ferry Hill became fully engaged in the war. Douglas and his unit burned the bridge crossing the Potomac to limit Union forces from entering into Virginia, and Union forces burned the Ferry Hill barn.<br /> <br /> Throughout the war, Boteler's Ford, also known as Packhorse Ford, a mile downstream from Ferry Hill, provided a frequently used crossing for soldiers from both North and South. Due to its strategic location on the border, Ferry Hill was occupied at various times by both armies. During the 1862 Antietam campaign Ferry Hill served as a headquarters, hospital and artillery base for Confederate forces. During the Battle of Antietam residents of Sharpsburg, fled west along the C&O Canal towpath and sought shelter at Killiansburg Cave, waiting for the fighting to pass. One resident noted that the cave \"... was crowded with a variety of people of all classes.\" Following Antietam, the Battle of Shepherdstown played out along the river below the Ferry Hill. As troops moved on to fight elsewhere, Ferry Hill was scarred with it fences burned, livestock gone, and fields trampled.<br /> <br /> \"We encamped near Shepherdstown and I visited my home across the Potomac and saw the desolation of war. My beautiful home was a barren waste and a common, and the blackened walls of the burnt barn stood up against the sky as a monument of useless and barbarous destruction. I felt that it would be hard for me, going into Pennsylvania, to set aside all ideas of retaliation.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, \"I Rode With Stonewall\"<br /> <br /> Then during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, and the Monocacy Campaign in 1864, Boteler's Ford provided a crossing for both Union and Confederate troops. And, Ferry Hill again suffered the impact of the war.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, Ferry Hill lost its previous grandeur. Henry Kyd Douglas moved to Hagerstown to pursue his career as a lawyer as the site then went into the hands of Henry Kyd's sister, Nancy. In the 20th century, Ferry Hill operated as a pig farm, and by mid-century, as a restaurant. In 1979, the C&O Canal National Historical Park headquarters moved into Ferry Hill and operated here until 2002. For the past ten years, Ferry Hill shifted into a slower period as the house was opened for tours during summer weekends.</p>",

Maybe even uplifting!<br /> <br /> As a matter of fact, it took an uplifting event to create these beautiful hills. Geologists estimate that about 60 to 65 million years ago two large land masses to the west began to collide. This collision created the Rocky Mountains, but also produced a rippling effect in the earth's crust producing the dome mountains that we now call the Black Hills.<br /> <br /> The Rockies and the Black Hills greatly influence weather by creating a barrier for storms. Clouds, coming from the north ro west, are forced upward and cooled causing moisture to be released in the northern hills, or to be diverted around the hills. This accounts for the dry climate here.<br /> <br /> Take a moment to enjoy this magnificent landscape. The open spaces and colors combined with the gentle hills make it truly memorable.",

On the opposite side of the dock, a tall staircase leads up to the top of the cliff. A channel about 12 miles wide separates you from the mainland of the California, to the north. The vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean lies to the south.East Anacapa is the easternmost of three barely connected islands\" that make up Anacapa Island. These islands are connected above water during low tide, but not during high tide. The other two islets lie to the west. Titled, \" Anacapa Island,\" this panel shows a sea gull standing in a field of yellow flowers with a lighthouse in the distance, and a range of mountains at the far horizon. The gull is white with grey wings and a yellow beak. The field around the bird is dotted white with other gulls, standing in the field. They are evenly spaced, about 20 feet apart.Introductory words read, \"Welcome to Anacapa Island, one of five islands in Channel Islands National Park. The park was established to protect, preserve, and enhance our understanding of the islands' unique past and remarkable resources. \"A subtitle on the upper left reads, \"Get Acquainted,\" and shows two California brown pelicans. They are sitting side by side, on nests made of interwoven dried grasses. They are brown, with white heads that stretch high above, on their long necks. Their long yellow beaks are tucked downward, snug against their necks, which are black on top, and white on the bottom. Their large flexible orange gullets are also neatly tucked away, sandwiched between their necks and beaks. On the crown of their heads, a stiff strip of orange feathers sticks up stiffly, in a \"Mohawk\" style.Words read, \"Twelve miles from the mainland, Anacapa Island emerges from the ocean as a five-mile-long volcanic rock divided into three islets-East, Middle, and West.

From its surface fronds, the giant seaweed extends below, attached to rocks of the nearshore reef. This vertical ecosystem becomes a passageway between air, sea and island worlds. Human divers can join pinnipeds, algae, fishes and marine invertebrates in the green shadowed thickets.<br /> <br /> <b>More Information on Kelp Forests and the Marine Environment</b><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. Santa Cruz Island lies in the middle of this transition zone. The western half of the island harbors numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on this eastern end of the island.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island also serves as the meeting ground for seabirds and shore birds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, have nested at Fraser Point on the island's west end. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and<br /> pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California mainland coast, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commercial harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing at the tip of a rounded plateau, near the edge of a steep drop off, at the end of the extension trail to Arch Point. The ocean lies far below. A large sea rock rising out of the ocean just off the shore. Near us, deep canyons cut into the hillside, widening as they approach the sea. In the distance is a taller rounded hill. Beyond it, a low curve of land stretches out into the sea. That is Arch Point, although the rock arch for which it is named is not visible from here. At your feet, the soil has small dark pebbles and broken shells. Dried low grasses and crystalline ice plant cover the hill. The ice plant is a low succulent, with small red rosettes and tiny white flowers—a starburst of white thin petals with pale yellow centers. Nearby is a white metal structure, about 6 feet high, with a triangular frame on three spayed legs. Attached to it are a white metal box and a solar panel—a flat dark glass panel with a grid of light-colored lines. Sticking up from the frame on short rods are two white objects that look like a stack of upside down bowls. On another short rod is what looks like a single upside down aluminum bowl with a knob on top. An antenna sticks upward from the top of the frame. At the very top is a rotating torpedo-shaped object with a propeller at the tip. It swivels to face into the wind. Nearby, mounted in a cement base, is an 18-foot-high section of a dark wooden telephone pole, about one foot in diameter. A small disk sits on top of the pole, with a black cable running down the side of the pole and to a rounded white box near a solar panel, both sitting on the concrete base. Sticking out of the pole, on alternating sides, every two feet, are 8-inch wide metal rods. A few feet away are four cement piers under a twisted, bent, rusted metal frame. Nearby, three large black plastic cylinders, with spigots on top, sit side by side. Behind them is a pile of black hoses.",

The kelp forests are an underwater gathering ground, attracting a crowd of creatures normally scattered throughout the surrounding waters.<br /> <br /> From its surface fronds, the giant seaweed extends below, attached to rocks of the nearshore reef. This vertical ecosystem becomes a passageway between air, sea and island worlds. Human divers can join pinnipeds, algae, fishes and marine invertebrates in the green shadowed thickets.<br /> <br /> <b>More Information on Kelp Forests and the Marine Environment</b><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. The western islands harbor numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on the eastern islands.<br /> <br /> One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted around Anacapa's coast, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Anacapa Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California mainland coast, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Anacapa Island Marine Reserve in the waters below you and stretching from Arch Point to Frenchys Cove), recreational fishing and commercial harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in the Anacapa Island Marine Conservation Area around the north side of West Anacapa. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p>",

Title reads: Kelp Forest: kelp forests support nearly a thousand species of animals, from tiny snails to muscular sea lions.<br /><br />16 animal species are labeled within the illustration; lush green macrosystis kelp reach like underwater trees to the water's surface. The bumpy, orange ocher star, bat star, warty sea cucumber, acorn barnacles, spiny purple urchin, pink abalone sea snail, California mussel and solitary green anemone all adhere themselves along portions of the ocean floor and underwater cliffs of the island. A California sea lion glides through the water while a scuba diver watches kelp bass, sheephead, opaleye and bright orange garibaldi fish swim in the water column. A solitary horn shark waits at the bottom, camouflaged with small dark spots on brownish skin while the spiny lobster peeks out from a crevice in the rock.<br /><br />Yellow green mats of kelp float at the water's surface. At the horizon, a pod of dolphins leap and dive and seabirds roost along the cliff face. <br /><br />Text continues: In contrast to the seemingly barren cliffs above, there is a teeming forest beneath the surface of the cove.

The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> In addition, visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond the ranger station. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "If you are at the edge of Cuyler Harbor Beach, facing the water, you will be facing north. It is a relatively flat sandy beach, about two miles long. Its soft pale sand is the consistency of white sugar. To the left, is a cluster of palm trees at the distant end of Cuyler Harbor Beach, where the sand ends against a rocky coastline. To the right, the sandy beach extends to an unnamed rocky point. Just offshore is the small rocky island, Gull Island. In the distance, is the larger Prince Island. Behind the beach are large dunes, covered with low succulent plants. Behind you, Nidever canyon cuts up through the rocky cliff to the plateau on top of the island.",

            "audioDescription": "This wayside sits beside the corral, just beyond the pier and picnic area. A timeline demonstrates how Prisoners Harbor has welcomed a diversity of visitors to its calm and protected shores. Six images cross the middle of the panel to illustrate different periods of occupation here at Prisoners Harbor from 5,000 years of Chumash occupation to present day. The images overlay an aerial photograph of Prisoners beach to include the pier, picnic area and landscape in our immediate vicinity. Lines are drawn from the smaller timeline images to points in the landscape to mark the approximate location of each element. <br />Text reads:<br />- A Busy Port of Call<br />Prisoners Harbor has bustled with activity for thousands of years<br />Chumash swiftly plying the waters in tomols; curious European explorers setting foot on the island for the first time; abandoned Mexican prisoners searching for a way to escape; bleating sheep and rolling wine barrels racing down the pier; Navy landing crafts unloading cargo on the beach; and hopeful birders seeking a glimpse of the island scrub-jay near the largest coastal wetland on the islands. For thousands of years Prisoners Harbor has welcomed a diversity of visitors to its calm and protected shores. <br />The first image in the timeline series is an illustration of three Chumash paddling along the shores of Santa Cruz in a type of canoe called a tomol. <br />Caption reads: <br />In 1542 at least 1,200 Chumash lived in 10 villages along Santa Cruz Island's coast. Xaxas, one of the largest villages, was located here for over 5,000 years and served as a major port of trade and a departure point for cross channel travel.<br />The next image in the timeline marks the location of the pier. This black and white photograph taken from high on a ridge looks down at the ranch house complex, pier and shoreline. <br />Caption reads: <br />Recognized as the island's best harbor, ranchers began developing this area they called \"La Playa\" in the 1860s by constructing the first large wharf in Santa Barbara County. Although repaired, modified, and rebuilt many times, the pier has always been the island's main artery.<br />The third image in the timeline marks our current location at the corral. This black and white photograph illustrates the use of fencing to corral livestock. A few men on horseback are in and around a corral built near the pier. <br />Caption reads:<br />The area before you was the location of the harbor's earliest corrals.

In 2011, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy began restoring the Prisoners Harbor wetland, the largest coastal wetland on the Channel Islands. Reduced by more than 50 percent in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this wetland once again provides a variety of habitats (open water, marsh, riparian, and woodland) for a large diversity of native plants and wildlife. Five smaller photographs with captions of plants, animals and the former ranch complex are stacked along the right side of the panel. First an image of brant. This small goose with white underbelly and a black head, chest and back rests on the surface of the water. Caption reads: Situated on one of the great migratory corridors of the continent (the Pacific Flyway), coastal wetlands provide waterfowl and shorebirds habitat to rest, feed, and overwinter. Next a photograph of the island scrub jay. This large crow sized bright blue bird has a long tail, broad head and thick black bill. Its white underbelly is in sharp contrast to the brilliant blue sheen of its back. A distinctive rusty-gray patch marks the upper part of the wings. Caption Reads: Landbirds, such as the endemic island scrub-jay, use wetland habitats for breeding and foraging. Then a photograph of the small cat-sized reddish brown island fox The diverse habitats of the wetland are frequented by bald eagles, island spotted skunks, Santa Cruz Island deer mice, Santa Cruz Island harvest mice, and Santa Cruz Island foxes. A close up photograph of the Santa Cruz Island bush mallow flower. Fuchsia pink in color, this delicate paper like flower has five simple petals around a white center. The wetland and stream channel provide habitat for a variety of native plants, including the endemic and endangered Santa Cruz Island silver lotus and Santa Cruz Island bush mallow. The last photograph in black and white taken in 1903, illustrates the Prisoners Harbor ranch house called La Playa. Tucked into the rugged landscape sits this elegant two story white adobe home with island made wrought iron railings along a second story balcony. An ornamental wrought iron rail fence surrounds a lush front yard garden. A smaller kitchen building is separated from the house. Near the kitchen building is a tall windmill that stands on top of a stone well. The stone well is all that remains today. Caption Reads: What’s a Well Doing in a Wetland?

From this location, visitors can head down towards Webster Point or climb up to 634-foot Signal Peak, the highest point on the island.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 4: Signal Peak Tour-Return of the Natives</b><br /> <br /> As you walk the island, you may notice the fields of grains and grasses that dominate the landscape. This was not always the case. What was once an island covered with coastal sage and bluff scrub, maritime cactus scrub, and native grasslands, has given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including iceplants, oats, bromes, foxtails, thistles, and mustard. Today, about a third of the plant species found on Santa Barbara Island are nonnative.<br /> <br /> During the early 1900s, native vegetation was cut, burned, and plowed for farming. In addition, sheep, goats, and rabbits severely overgrazed the island, eliminating most of the native vegetation and creating open, disturbed, and eroded soils that allowed nonnative plants to flourish. Once established, these hardier nonnatives outcompeted the natives for limited soil and moisture, due to their longer germination and growth cycles and ability to withstand grazing and browsing by livestock.<br /> <br /> The NPS is working to restore the island's native vegetation, and special focus is being placed on the 14 plants endemic to the islands-those found nowhere else in the world. Four of these occur only on Santa Barbara Island: the Santa Barbara Island live-forever, buckwheat, cream cups, and island chicory. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, all non-native animals have been removed and the effort to plant native species and control nonnative weeds is underway.<br /> <br /> The recovery of native plants has so far been remarkable. Many are now spreading beyond the buried seed banks and steep canyon walls and cliffs, where they remained protected from grazing, and are reestablishing themselves slowly throughout the island.<br /> <br /> This reestablishment of native plants has also aided in the recovery of endemic deer mice, night lizards, and nesting land birds by providing important habitat. Today, there are 14 land birds that nest annually on the island. Three of these-the horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, and house finch-are endemic subspecies found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the island's recovery did not come soon enough for the endemic Santa Barbara Island song sparrow, one of the smallest forms of song sparrow and differentiated from its mainland relative by its very gray back. The destruction of this sparrow's sagebrush and coreopsis nesting habitat and the presence of feral cats led to the extinction of this species in the 1960s. It is now lost forever.<br /> <br /> However, ecological restoration has helped populations of the endemic island night lizard recover to the point that it was removed from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in 2014. This species only occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, and San Clemente Islands.<br /> <br /> You can help with this recovery of island natives by cleaning your boots and other possessions, such as backpacks, before you visit. This ensures that you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species to the island. Together we can guarantee the return of native plants and animals throughout Santa Barbara Island.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a gently sloping ridge, in a saddle, or low point, between two rounded hills-North Peak, and, to the south, a slightly higher hill, Signal Peak. In clear weather, there are views of the ocean to the east and west. There is an 8-foot long wooden bench, on two posts, oriented to face the ocean views. Be careful if you decide to sit, as it is covered with white bird droppings. <br />Adjacent to the bench, on the ground are three railroad ties-thick wooden beams about 8 inches by 10 inches by 6 feet in length. At your feet, the gritty soil has tiny fragments of broken shells and white rocks. Along this ridge are low grasses, salt bush, and crystalline iceplant. In spring, the iceplant has red leaves and buds, that open into white feathery starburst blooms in spring. The terraces below the ridge have the same plants, plus occasional patches of coastal sagebrush and coreopsis. The sagebrush is a grey-green plant with a thin stalk with feathery leaves, like dill, and a tall spike at the tip, covered with tiny flowers, in season. Coreopsis has thick branches topped with tufts of green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy brittle, brown mop of dead leaves and blooms in late summer and early fall. <br />From here, you can take loop trails in four directions. The loop trail to the west circles north towards Webster Point. The trails to the north and northeast are part of the same loop trail-Arch Point Loop. It just happens to make a very sharp turn here. Heading north on this loop trail is, appropriately, the quickest way to get to North Peak. Heading northeast is the quickest way to Arch Point, with a branch trail, at about the halfway point, that leads to the Visitor Center and the Landing Cove. The loop trail to the south heads to Signal Peak, before looping around the southern end of the island, and merging back into the Arch Point Trail a little northeast of here. <br />",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing at the end of an extension trail that branches off from the Elephant Seal Cove Trail. This branch trail has led you down to a low, rocky bluff just about 40 feet above the shoreline, with an intimate peak into a secluded corner of elephant seal cove. Steep cliffs curve around the cove, leaving just shallow pockets of narrow sandy beaches at the shoreline. One such beach is only one or two hundred feet away. Here, a variety of pinnipeds, which are torpedo-shaped sea mammals with flippers, and heads shaped like a dog’s, but with tiny or invisible ears, can often be found, crowded together. Depending on the time of year, the beach is filled with hundreds of pinnipeds. In the water, dark oblong shapes of pinnipeds are visible under the surface, swimming, bodysurfing, and hunting. Occasionally, they pop their heads above the water to breathe, look ashore, and sometimes, to bark a bellowing call. The whole scene is accompanied by a loud chorus of their varied calls—from bellows and bleats to snorts, barks, and creaks Here, at Elephant Seal Cove, the pinnipeds generally include California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and northern fur seals. They are all here to breed, give birth, raise their young, and sometimes to molt, or shed, their fur. With so many competing groups of mammals on the crowded beach, this breeding colony, or rookery, is often a chaotic mix of fighting, sex, sleep, terror, play, and death; sometimes happening all at once. Adult male elephant seals are the largest animals on the beach. These brown animals have short, bulbous snouts, are about 12 feet long, and can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. They often rest, almost motionless, on the beach, but during the breeding season the males battle one another for females. Known as “bulls”, the male elephant seals make snorting sounds while slamming their massive bodies together and gouging each other with their short, carrot-shaped tusks, until their necks are red with blood. The females, which are about 10 feet long, and weigh up to 1,800 pounds, form harems around the winners of the battles. Each harem numbers between 10 and 50 females. When born, the babies, called pups, are 3 to 4 feet long, and weigh only about 70 pounds, or 1.5 % the size of the bull elephant seals. As the adult males continue to defend their group against other male competition, pups are sometimes accidentally injured or killed. So, scattered around the beach a dead pup or two may be seen, in various states of decay; some being eaten by sea gulls. The California sea lions have large front and back flippers, and are more agile on land than other pinnipeds. The mature males are dark brown, about 7 feet long, and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Females are golden brown, about 6 feet long, and weigh about 200 pounds. Pups are dark brown and about 16 pounds at birth, but their coats become golden brown after about 5 months. After about 5 years, the male’s fur changes to a dark brown color once again. Males have a bellowing bark, that sounds like “Aarh!.” They fight other males to defend their territories. Females will fight other females to defend their pups. In order for females and their pups to find one another, the pups call out in a bleating, “Baah” sound, like that of a baby lamb. Their mothers call back in a creaking, “Ahh” sound. The older pups wander farther away from their mothers. Aggressive sea lion males will occasionally chase and crush pups that venture too far from another male’s harem, leaving another carcass, and its attending seagulls, on the beach. Northern fur seals have very large front and back flippers and tiny ears. Males are grey to black, and between 300 – 600 pounds. They declare their territories with a bellowing sound, almost like a cow’s “moo”, and vigorously defend their turf by chasing away intruders. Females are light brown on the back with a reddish brown chest, with a light patch. They weigh about 100 pounds. These mothers and pups also find one another through distinctive calls. Whitewater surges around rock outcrops between the beaches. Large, dark patches of kelp forests are visible offshore, their tangled brown blades creating a floating mat at the water’s surface. Farther offshore, in the distance to the northwest, is Shag Rock. Beyond that, at the end of the island, there is a glimpse of Arch Point, the northernmost side of the island.",

            "audioDescription": "If you standing at the end of the Point Bennett trail, you are on a tall sand dune, covered with scattered low succulent plants, overlooking the western tip of the island. Below you is a white sandy beach that stretches out a mile or so into the distance toward two large sea rocks just beyond the shoreline. The beach is deep, at least a football field in width. Depending on the time of year, the beach is filled with hundreds, and often thousands, of pinnipeds, which are torpedo-shaped sea mammals with flippers, and heads shaped like a dog’s, but with tiny or invisible ears. More pinnipeds swim just off shore—some hunting; some “body-surfing” the waves. The whole scene is accompanied by a vast, almost deafening chorus of their varied calls—from bellows and bleats to snorts, barks, and creaks. You can hear the rumbling cacophony of the pinnipeds from five miles away, if the wind is right. Here, at Point Bennett, the pinnipeds generally include California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and northern fur seals. They are all here to breed, give birth, raise their young, and sometimes to molt, or shed, their fur. With so many competing groups of mammals on the crowded beach, this breeding colony, or rookery, is often a chaotic mix of fighting, sex, sleep, terror, play, and death; sometimes happening all at once. Adult male elephant seals are the largest animals on the beach. These brown animals have short, bulbous snouts, are about 12 feet long, and can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. They often rest, almost motionless, on the beach, but during the breeding season the males battle one another for females. Known as “bulls”, the male elephant seals make snorting sounds while slamming their massive bodies together and gouging each other with their short, carrot-shaped tusks, until their necks are red with blood. The females, which are about 10 feet long, and weigh up to 1,800 pounds, form harems around the winners of the battles. Each harem numbers between 10 and 50 females. When born, the babies, called pups, are 3 to 4 feet long, and weigh only about 70 pounds, or 1.5 % the size of the bull elephant seals. As the adult males continue to defend their group against other male competition, pups are sometimes accidentally injured or killed. So, scattered around the beach a few dead pups may be seen, in various states of decay; some being eaten by sea gulls. The California sea lions have large front and back flippers, and are more agile on land than other pinnipeds; roaming up to a mile inland. The mature males are dark brown, about 7 feet long, and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Females are golden brown, about 6 feet long, and weigh about 200 pounds. Pups are dark brown and about 16 pounds at birth, but their coats become golden brown after about 5 months. After about 5 years, the male’s fur changes to a dark brown color once again. Males have a bellowing bark, that sounds like “Aarh!.” They fight other males to defend their territories. Females will fight other females to defend their pups. In order for females and their pups to find one another, the pups call out in a bleating, “Baah” sound, like that of a baby lamb. Their mothers call back in a creaking, “Ahh” sound. The older pups wander farther from their mothers, with many cavorting together in groups in a sandy lagoon a hundred yards back from the shoreline. Aggressive sea lion males will occasionally chase and crush pups that wander too far from another male’s harem, leaving a few more carcasses, and their attending seagulls, on the beach. Northern fur seals have very large front and back flippers and tiny ears. Males are grey to black, and between 300 – 600 pounds. They declare their territories with a bellowing sound, almost like a cow’s “moo”, and vigorously defend their turf by chasing away intruders. Females are light brown on the back with a reddish brown chest, with a light patch. They weigh about 100 pounds. These mothers and pups also find one another through distinctive calls. Further inland, the sand dunes become covered with low plants. White seagulls dot the green landscape, spaced about 20 feet apart from one another.",

            "audioDescription": "Cardwell Point offers a magnificent view of two stretches of beach. If you are standing on Cardwell Point facing right to the southeast side, there is a sandy cove, several hundred yards away. The beach is dotted with clusters of pinnipeds—slug-shaped sea mammals. On the northeast side, to your left, is the second stretch of beach with a rocky reef. Santa Rosa Island is offshore, in the distance. Cardwell Point is covered with green grass and patches of a low red succulent with light pink flowers. To the northwest, from your bird’s eye view you can see lobster traps out in the water, and a large reef just beyond the shore. Along the northwest shore and about a half mile away to the southwest are beaches that often bustle with activity. Depending on the time of year, the beaches may be filled with dozens and sometimes hundreds of pinnipeds, including California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and northern fur seals. These torpedo-shaped sea mammals have flippers, and heads shaped like a dog’s, but with tiny or invisible ears. More pinnipeds swim just off shore—hunting or “body-surfing” the waves. The whole scene is accompanied by a chorus of their varied calls—from bellows and bleats to snorts, barks, and creaks. Adult male elephant seals are the largest animals on the beach.

            "audioDescription": "If you stand on the hillside of Crook Point, the ocean is about half a mile away, to the south. To your left, is Cardwell Point and, in the distance, Santa Rosa Island. Behind you is San Miguel Hill. Crook Point is at the edge of a long stretch of a gently rounded hill covered with scrub brush and a few sandy patches of earth at the tops of the hill. The brush includes sagebrush, which is a grey-green plant with a thin stalk with feathery leaves, like dill, and a tall spike at the tip, covered with tiny flowers, in season. Also, yellow coreopsis, with thick branches topped with tufts of feathery green leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dead leaves in the drier seasons. At the base of the hill, the slope changes to an almost flat terrace, sloping very gradually toward the ocean. The terraces are blanketed in grasses, with a few patches of scrub brush. Long coves, with white, sandy beaches curve into the shoreline at the ocean’s edge.",

            "bodyText": "<p>n 1895 a two-story frame Queen Anne style house was built for a white family at 501 Auburn Avenue. The home was purchased in 1909 by Rev. Adam Daniel Williams, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, for $3,500. Rev. Williams moved into the house with his wife Jennie Celeste and their 6 year old daughter Alberta Christine, their only child of three to survive infancy.</p> <p>On November 25, 1926 Christine married a minister by the name of Michael Luther King at her father's church. Instead of Christine moving in with her new husband he moved in with her and her parents in the family home. Over time the King's would have three children born in the home, Willie Christine, Michael Jr. (later known as Martin Luther King, Jr.), and Alfred Daniel. On March 21, 1931 Rev. Williams dies in the home of a heart attack. After Mrs. Willies dies of a heart attack the King's move to a new home at 193 Boulevard.</p> <p>The home stayed in the family and became rental property for the family. After Dr. King's assassination on April 4, 1968 plans were begun to restore the house as a historic museum. Today visiting the home where Dr. King was born and lived the first twelve years of his life is often the highlight of ones visit to the park. The popular free ranger-led <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/malu/planyourvisit/birth_home_tours.htm\">Birth Home Tours</a> of the interior of the home are limited to 15 people and are filled on a first-come, first-served basis on the day of the tour.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "You are the western side of the island, at the edge of a steep bluff, high above a shallow cove with a rocky shoreline, with a thin line of sand between the rocks and the walls of the bluff. Large, dark patches of kelp forests are visible offshore, their tangled brown blades creating a floating mat at the water’s surface. The ocean stretches out into the distance. On a clear day, you might see Catalina Island or the California coastline in the distance. Behind you is a gently sloping grassy plateau. A 4-foot wide wooden bench, on two posts, is located near the edge of the cliff. Be careful if you decide to sit on it as it is covered with white seagull droppings. Laying between the bench and the cliff’s edge, half buried in the soil, are several railroad ties — thick wooden beams about 8 inches by 10 inches by 6 feet in length. Dry grass and a few plants provide a thin cover for the hillside landscape. Extending into the distance at regular intervals are white dots on the landscape—white western sea gulls standing guard over their nesting territory. To the north, a dark-colored landform drops off into a vertical shoreline cliff that is even concave in some places. Along the narrow shoreline, brown sea lions are seen, looking like tiny torpedo-shaped spots from this distance. The bark-like bellows of the sea lions carries faintly up from far below, sometimes drowned out by the sound of waves crash loudly against the dark and rocky shore. Large, dark patches of kelp forests are visible offshore, their tangled brown blades creating a floating mat at the water’s surface.",

Three rocks are just off shore, in a row, pointing Sutil Island, a much larger sea rock, a couple of hundred yards off shore. At your feet, the soil is gritty, with rocks and bits of broken shells. The landscape is bare dirt with patches of dried low grasses, crystalline ice plant, a low succulent, with small red rosettes and tiny white flowers with yellow centers, and a few coreopsis—with thick branches topped with tufts of green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy brittle, brown mop of dead leaves and blooms in late summer and early fall. White sea gulls, with dark wings and tails, circle in the air above. Their calls are a scratchy, hoarse series of “aow” and “ah-ah-ah” sounds. The gulls, and other seabirds, nests here along the bluff. The trail to the south follows the edge of the bluff downward to the south end of the island near Cat Canyon, which is out of sight.",

Elevation, latitude, soil, terrain and climate are all significant, but the most important factor is water.</p> <p>Water from spring rains and snowmelt is critical to plant growth and survival. Wind Cave National Park receives about 17 inches of precipitation a year so it is extremely important for plants and animals to use it efficiently. Because the needles of conifers, such as pine, juniper, and spruce, have less surface area than leaves of most deciduous trees, they are more efficient water users. Therefore, conifers can survive in areas where aspens or cottonwoods would die of thirst.</p>",

The new pool at Val-Kill measures 50 by 20 feet and holds 9 feet of water at the deep end.</p> <p>Eleanor Roosevelt enjoyed the swimming pool as well. Friends of Eleanor remembered her swimming daily, and \"her effort to go off the diving board head first was a demonstration of sheer grit: she bent over the edge slowly, her fingers reaching toward her toes, at last tilting into the pool with a great splash. She never mastered it; she never gave up trying….Whoever interested her was invited to spend the day at Val-Kill and told to bring his bathing suit.”</p> <p>In addition to grandchildren, family, and friends, distinguished guests who enjoyed the refreshing waters of this pool included Sir Winston Churchill and King George V. The recent restoration of the swimming pool was an official National Park Service Centennial project, with financial support from the park's philanthropic partner, The Eleanor Roosevelt Val-Kill Partnership.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a grassy plateau about 20 feet above the shoreline, at the easternmost point of the island. At the shore, the plateau cuts down steeply, revealing sandstone layers below the soil that continue, as a rough, rocky surface toward the water. This sandstone has flat layers of harder rock that stick out as tall ridges, at an almost upright angle. Near the high tide area, the sandstone is smoother, with just with a few small harder pebbles sticking up. This surface is shaped into gentle curves and rounds shaped, with peaks and valleys, like a wave. Near the mid tide mark, the rocks extend out toward the ocean in a flat horizontal slab, with rounded edges on the wave side, and thin grooves or channels that run toward the sea. When waves break against this rock slab, some water rushes in, then out, through the grooves—carried much farther ashore than water that breaks on the face of the slabs. The slabs of rock are carpeted with slippery, bright green sea grass. Ocean waves often break at the point, wrapping northwestward around the point, toward the cove on that side. On clear days, Santa Cruz Island can be seen from this Point. To the southeast along the shore is Ford Point, and beyond that, South Point. On a hillside above East Point, in a small rocky patch, no bigger than the footprint of a house, one can find the rare munchkin dudleya plant. This is the only place on earth where it grows. Each plant is only one or two inches tall. This succulent has thick, fleshy, grey-green leaves that stick out from a central point, almost like a single rose flower with thick petals. In spring, red stems stick up another couple of inches from each plant, topped by tiny yellow flowers. In drier seasons, when the plant is dormant, the flowers dry up and break off, and the leaves shrivel up and turn so brown and brittle that the plants appear dead. The hillside around this rocky patch is grassy. Below you is East Point, a rocky point that sticks out into the ocean. Across the water, on a clear day, Santa Cruz Island can be seen.",

Its most famous member, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was baptized as a child in the church. After giving a trial sermon to the congregation at Ebenezer at the age of 19 Martin was ordained as a minister. In 1960 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. became a co-pastor of Ebenezer with his father, Rev. Martin Luther King, Sr., know as \"Daddy\" King. He remained in that position until his death in 1968. As a final farewell to his spiritual home Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s funeral was held in the church.</p> <p>In 2000 a study of the church building resulted in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/malu/planyourvisit/upload/malu_eb_hsr.pdf\"><strong>Ebenezer Baptist Church, Historic Structure Report</strong></a> (PFD, 31.5 MB) being issued by the National Park Service. This reports served as a guideline for the restoration of the church.<br /> <br />  </p> <p>Church Restoration</p> <p>In 2001, thanks to a Save America's Treasures Grant and the contributions of many individuals and corporations, the National Park Service began the restoration of historic Ebenezer Baptist Church. The restoration was completed in two phases.</p> <p>Phase I included design and installation of major systems including, electrical, heating, and air conditioning, and fire suppression. Structural repairs were made to the roof system and the historic exterior. The Ebenezer sign hanging over the entrance was repaired and lit for the first time since 1990. A chair lift was installed to provide accessibility to the sanctuary. The funding for Phase I involved a private and public partnership and cost $1,885,000.</p> <p>Phase II of the project restored the appearance of the sanctuary and fellowship hall to the 1960-68 period when Dr. King served as co-pastor with his father. Special work items included preservation of stain glass windows; restoration/replication of furnishings; repair of balcony structural system; rehabilitation of restrooms; abatement of asbestos-containing flooring; treatment of termite infestation/damage; installation of a lightning protection system; improvement of site drainage; and restoration of a sidewalk, baptistery, and pipe organ and its antiphonal.</p>",

Eventually the name changed to Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc., and today commonly referred to as The King Center.

            "audioDescription": "You are standing at the top of highest point on the north eastern end of the island, Black Mountain. It has a magnificent view in all directions in good weather. To the northeast is Bechers Bay. In the east are Skunk Point and Santa Cruz Island. To the south is Soledad Peak. In the west is San Miguel Island. To the northwest is Lobo Canyon, forming a “V” shape in a distant hillside. In the north is Carrington Point. Poking up, near the edge of this summit, just a hundred feet away, one can see the tops of oaks in the cloud forest island oak grove. At your feet, the soil is rocky with small pebbles. Grass with tiny white flowers grows on the top of the mountain, with a few small patches of scrubby shrubs. There are three structures here. A tall metal pole structure, with a triangular base frame about 6 feet high, on three spayed legs. Two cylindrical white cannisters are mounted on the frame. Sticking up on short rod is a white object that looks like a stack of upside down bowls. On one corner of the frame, a tall rod sticks up about four feet. On another corner, a rod sticks out horizontally from the structure, with a small cap at the end. A vertical 20-foot tall pole sticks up from the center of the frame. At the very top is a rotating torpedo-shaped object with a propeller at the tip. It swivels to face into the wind. On one side is a metal box and two solar panels—flat dark glass panels with grids of light-colored lines. Cables run between the top of the structure and several of these boxes, devices, and solar panels. Flanking the tall triangular framed structure are four poles about 6 feet high and four inches in diameter. One pole has a saucer-shaped satellite dish mounted on it. At its center is a rod that sticks out with a circular metal piece at the end. Nearby is a freestanding solar panel array, mounted on an angle on a metal frame that has two poles extending up in back. Two black cables run from the back of the panel to a latched bin, below the panel, with a large rock on the lid. A thicker black cable runs, from that bin, back up to clamps at the tops of each of the poles on the back of the frame. One cable ends with what looks like an old tv antennae, or a two-sided comb—a metal rod with a row of smaller perpendicular rods sticking out on either side. The other cable sticks straight up, with a rounded metal top like a mushroom cap, about 3 inches in diameter. You are standing in the cloud forest island oak grove, on a slope near the top of Black Mountain. You are under the canopies of several island oak trees, their long, dark, twisting branches overlapping, and ending in clusters of small oval green leaves. It is often foggy here near the summit. When skies are clear, the open form of the branches makes a lacey pattern against the blue sky, and the sun casts a mottled pattern of shadows and light on the ground. The trunks and branches of the oaks are thickly covered with lichen and moss in shades ranging from yellow and pale green to dark olive green. Some growths are as tiny as powdered sugar on the branches. Others are taller, looking like spinach or curly kale, feathery dill weed, and soft curly hair or fur. The ground is thickly covered with fallen dry leaves, small twigs and patches of grass. When it is foggy, water condensation on these branches, leaves, mosses, and lichen will drip down on you, even if it isn’t raining outside the oak grove.",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing on steep hillside that slopes down, northeast, to Carrington Point—a thin sandy point, with rocky edges at the shoreline. This sandy point is often covered with seals and sea lions. They are furry, tan, and torpedo-shaped sea mammals, with flippers and dog-like heads. The males have a loud, bellowing bark, that sounds like “Aarh!.” Here one can also often find many sea gulls, and colonies of cormorants, shiny black duck-like birds, with webbed feet, long necks, and an orange spot on their cheeks. The ocean wraps around this point, providing an almost 300 degree ocean view. The hillside is mostly covered with iceplant, which has thick, rubbery, finger shaped leaves and bright purple flowers, shaped like a flat starburst. Patches or drop-off ridges in the hillside reveal a sandy soil, littered with half-buried, broken shells. Some of these are pieces of abalone shells, which are saucer shaped, with a row of small holes along one side, and a pearlescent interior with a rainbow of colors in shiny, pale, pastel shades. Periodically, when a big wave hits the shore, a spout of foamy white water shoots high into the air through a small hole in the rocky shore, a little west of the point. Further west, several hundred yards away, is a sea arch—a tunnel through a rocky outcrop that reveals a glimpse of the ocean on the other side. The soft-leaved island paintbrush plant is coated with woolly, tangled fine hairs that give it a gray-green tint. It has several spreading stems that stick up from the ground to about 14 inches in height. Fleshy green leaves, about an inch long and oval, cover the stems. In season, clusters of pale yellow flowers with stiff yellow stamens grow at the tips of each stem. Budding flowers, in the top center of each stem, have petals that are yellow on the top, but transition to a pinkish hue at the bottom, where they connect to the stem.",
