Come learn the story of the Anza Expedition, when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Bautista de Anza led 240 men, women and children up the California coast in 1775. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/juba\">www.nps.gov/juba</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of acres were owned by individual families under the Spanish and Mexican land grant systems. The original Martinez grant contained over 17,000 acres and reached past the town of Pinole southwest of Alhambra Valley. (Don Vincente Martinez, son of the commandante of the Presidio of San Francisco, built this house of adobe bricks around 1849.)</p> <p>The foundation of the Martinez Adobe is rough stone, while the walls are sun-dried adobe brick ranging in thickness from twenty-four to thirty inches. The roof was covered with shingles of either cedar or redwood.</p> <p>Don Vicente Martinez lived in his adobe only four years before he sold it to Edward Franklin, the first of a series of owners who would change the land again.</p> <p>Dr. John Strentzel, father-in-law of John Muir, purchased the adobe from an Australian, Thomas Redfern, in 1874. Dr. Strentzel, often called the father of California horticulture, soon replaced cattle with fruit trees of many varieties. Dr. Strentzel used the adobe as a store room and as a residence for his foremen.</p> <p>Contrary to legend, John Muir and his wife never lived in the Martinez Adobe, but it was the home of his elder daughter, Wanda, and her husband, Thomas Hanna. John Muir would often eat meals at the adobe and find time to play with his grandchildren.</p> <p>The coming of heavy industry to Martinez in 1914, the year of Muir's death, saw the beginning of the end of orcharding in the lower Alhambra Valley. Population growth meant that the land had greater monetary value for homes than for orchards, and the land changed again. By the 1960s, open farmland was replaced with houses and streets. Concerned citizens organized themselves to preserve a small sample of the past before it vanished, and in 1964, the adobe became part of the John Muir National Historic Site.</p>",

A soil mixture would be mixed with water into a thick paste and then pressed into rectangular wooden forms and left in the sun to dry. This efficient style of earthen technology goes back thousands of years, but requires constant maintenance. Moisture, either from the ground or from precipitation, will erode sun-dried adobe bricks, rendering the structure unstable. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b502ef00-846f-4aac-811f-88c57f6f33ad}{213}\" paraid=\"1339374744\">The Spanish favored limestone plaster as a protective coating on their adobe buildings. Many tons of limestone rocks were gathered and carted to the mission’s lime kilns. A fire was built under a metal grill and high temperatures “cooked” the limestone over several days until it could be hammered into a fine powder. That powder was then made into a paste using water and sand, which was later troweled onto on the exposed adobe brick walls. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b502ef00-846f-4aac-811f-88c57f6f33ad}{219}\" paraid=\"686887388\">Gathering stone, mixing plaster, and coating the large structures required the labor of many workers. For the O’odham, the kiln probably represented a significant change in their lifestyle. Previously, they lived with a changing landscape, in buildings that changed with it. The European worldview prioritized permanence and defiance of natural weathering. This shift would shape the way that people across the region live and think for centuries to come. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The lime kiln is a circular, below-ground well-like structure about 6 feet in diameter. The walls of the lime kiln extend about 1 foot above the ground and are covered on the top and exterior by a brownish-cream colored plaster coating. The rounded flat surface of the wall is about a foot wide. As you look down into the underground interior of the lime kiln, the walls appear to be made of dried, brown, adobe brick with a layer of red colored bricks at the bottom about 5 feet down. The floor of lime kiln is sandy gravel. Back above ground, a hexagonal, brown, metal fence with horizonal rails surrounds the entire circular kiln structure protecting it from climbing or entry.",

A home was originally built here in 1792, and after Van Buren's purchase of the property in 1839 it would be modified to the appearance it retains today. The building is an eccentric mix of Federalist, Italianate, and Gothic Victorian styles as a result of Van Buren's renovations to the house, which included the tower on the south-west corner of the home. The home served as a political headquarters for Van Buren during his attempts to be reelected, and a place of work for the many domestic servants and farm workers that he needed to operate his residence.",

Lindenwald, which is what Van Buren called his home, is a three story tall building that is an eccentric mix of different architectural styles. Looking at the front of the building, the first two floors have large windows with shutters painted the same color as the home looking out at the front lawn. The third floor has small dormer windows peaking out through the eaves of the roof. Over the roofline of the rest of the roof from the rear of the home, rises a four story tower with a roofed platform open to the air at the top.",

Such a place was established on the Old Natchez Trace, near here, in 1849 by John McGlamery. Although the stand did not outlast the Civil War, the name did. The nearby village is still known as McGlamery Stand. This stand was established more than three decades after the height of travel on the Natchez Trace and was in operation for about 12 years before closing at the beginning of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of McGlamery Stand visible at the site.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",

The Snow Cone Trail is wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> <em>Corresponds to #5 on the park brochure map.</em>",
            "audioDescription": "A looped parking area about 200 feet from a string of spatter cones. Two adjacent trails lead to two separate cones. The narrow trail on the left approaches the larger cone, less than 50 feet tall, and winds steeply up the side. The trail ends inside the cone at a fenced-in viewpoint, where visitors can look down into the dark vent. At the second cone, on the paved, more level Snow Cone Trail, a railed platform overlooks another vent. This cone is shorter and more open than the first. A trailhead sign reads: “Spatter Cones. These miniature volcanoes formed when blobs of molten lava were lobbed into the air during the last gasp of an eruption sequence 2,100 years ago. This image shows a close up view of this material, known as spatter, erupting from an active spatter cone in Hawaii. Craters of the Moon is well known for these beautiful volcanic features. Please help protect them by staying on trails.”",

Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place of retreat from urban life. Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Stanford Trailhead. Named for James Stanford who came here in 1805 to farm on Ohio’s frontier, the relatively short Stanford Trail is steep in places and provides a moderate challenge to hiking enthusiasts. Trail connections lead to the scenic Brandywine Falls, the most popular attraction in Cuyahoga Valley National Park.” End of description.",

It was a gift from the people of Belgium in gratitude for Hoover's famine relief efforts on their behalf during the First World War.</p> <h2>Expressions of Gratitude</h2> <p>After the war, Herbert Hoover was sent many gifts expressing the gratitude of the Belgian people for his humanitarian efforts. Some sent him beautifully embroidered flour sacks, like those on display at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. Many Belgian children, refugees, and soldiers contributed to a fund to create this work of art.</p> <h2>Placement at the Historic Site</h2> <p>When the Belgians shipped the finished statue to California's Stanford University in 1922. It remained on campus until the President and Mrs. Hoover brought it to West Branch in 1939. They wanted it to be placed in a position where it was contemplating the house, which is why Isis sits in her throne-like chair facing the Birthplace Cottage.</p> <h2>Dedication to Children's Causes</h2> <p>The Statue of Isis represents just one of Hoover's many efforts regarding children's welfare. As President he increased the budget for children's programs. After his presidency, Hoover was chairman of the Boys' Clubs of America for 25 years. He raised money and helped open 500 new chapters. Hoover's global relief work also inspired the creation of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, a leading advocate for children's welfare and rights around the world.</p> <h2>The Mysterious Goddess</h2> <p>Isis wears a veil, a symbol of the mysteries of life. Her right hand carries the torch of life-its three flames represent the past, present, and future. Her left hand holds the key of life. An ancient Egyptian goddess and an American President are an unlikely pairing. But it provides a powerful visual link between Hoover's childhood and his life's dedication to the welfare of others.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Statue of Isis 348 words Statue of Isis. Two minutes. First of two messages at this location. A bronze statue of a seated Egyptian goddess is located on the south side of the cement sidewalk that runs between the Friends Meetinghouse and the Presidential Library. A level concrete sidewalk about 40 feet long extends from the boardwalk along the west side of Downey Street. Near the intersection of Downey Street and sidewalk an exhibit panel titled \"Helping War Victims\" stands in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. A metal chain draped across four 3-foot metal posts creates a barrier between the sidewalk and the sculpture. The figure is larger than life-size. She faces north, across the creek toward the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Cottage 100 feet away. She sits on a narrow throne; the throne itself rests on a rectangular concrete base, 3 ½ feet high, 5 ½ feet wide, and more than 7 feet deep. Isis sits up perfectly straight—her bare feet together, her left hand clutching an Egyptian ankh symbol, her head held high as she looks straight ahead. She wears a flowing garment that covers her arms, legs, and torso and drapes over the back of her throne. A veil obscures her face, revealing only the outline of her eyes and nose. In her right hand, she holds a three-flamed lamp. A metal plaque on the front of the base measures 2 feet high by 2 ½ feet wide. In raised letters, it reads: “Isis… The Goddess of Life. I am that which was and is and will ever be…and no mortal has yet lifted the veil which covers me. Sculptured by the Belgian artist Puttemans for the Birthplace of Herbert Hoover. Presented by a committee of Belgian school children, Belgian refugees and soldiers of the Belgian Army.” End of text. Half-a-dozen evergreen trees form a small arc behind her. Twenty feet to her west, on the opposite side of the sidewalk is a small sitting area. It includes two wooden benches with a water fountain in between. End of message. Helping War Victims 414 words Panel: \"Helping War Victims.\" 2 ¼ minutes. Second of two messages at this location. This panel explains the presence of the statue of Isis at the historic site. The angled panel titled \"Helping War Victims\" stands across from Friends Meetinghouse, next to the walkway leading to the Statue of Isis. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. Below the title, text reads: \"The Statue of Isis, Egyptian goddess of life, symbolizes Herbert Hoover's humanitarian efforts. Belgians gave Hoover the bronze statue to thank him for his help in staving off famine in their country in World War I. Hoover, a wealthy mining engineer, had given up his career to organize, without pay, a war relief organization. He persuaded German invaders and British blockaders to allow shipments of food that fed millions of people in Belgium and northern France. After the war Hoover directed relief efforts across Europe. He devoted the rest of his life to public service.\" The main image is a black and white photograph of workers unloading a statue from the bed of a truck, which is parked on a ramp in a grassy field. Atop a rectangular pedestal, the seven and a half foot tall statue depicts the veiled Egyptian goddess Isis sitting on a throne. At the bottom of the main image on the right, a caption reads: \"The statue, created by Belgian sculptor Auguste Puttemans, was installed in 1939 as part of President and Mrs. Hoover's memorial landscape plans. They positioned Isis to face the Birthplace Cottage.\" A quote from a book \"Herbert Hoover's Home Town: The Story of West Branch, 1948,\" appears on the bottom left. In the quote, Maud Stratton offers more details about the statue: \"In her right hand she holds the lamp of life, three flames denoting the past, present and future. Her left hand carries, half hidden, the key of life.\" In a black and white photograph in the upper right corner of the panel, Hoover points to several sacks lying next to piles of crates. A sign behind the piles says, \"European Relief Council.\" A caption reads: \"Hoover inspects supplies for European war victims in 1921. A color inset photo shows a cream-colored flour sack, embroidered with flowers and with a lace border design. The words \"Belgian Relief Fund\" are imprinted at the top of the square. A caption reads: \"Relief recipients embroidered flour sacks and sent them as gifts to Hoover.\" End of message.",

By the turn of the 20th century, the western end of Derby Street had become the heart of the Polish Community in Salem.<br /> <br /> The St. Joseph Society was founded in 1897 as a fraternal society that provided aid to its members in the form of assistance in times of illness or financial hardship, as well as funeral benefits. By 1909, the society was strong enough that they were able to build a three-story headquarters.<br /> <br /> The first floor was retail space that could be rented out to provide an income for the support of the building. The large hall on the second floor was the site of hundreds of weddings, dances, plays, and other social events in the Polish community. On the top floor, several apartments were built to house new immigrants until they could get permanently settled.<br /> <br /> As the twentieth century moved on, the St. Joseph Society became more of a social organization, regularly hosting dances and fielding baseball and basketball teams that played other youth teams in the region.<br /> <br /> By the 1980s, the Polish community had spread out all over the region as young men and women left Salem to find jobs. St. Joseph Hall was sold to the National Park Service in 1988, and has been renovated to house administrative and maintenance facilities. The front of the building has been restored to its original appearance, and today there is an exhibit on Salem’s Polish community in the front windows of St. Joseph Hall.",

Though this point along with Sunset Point was named to entice early Lodge visitors to easily accessible points along the rim at both times of day, this view is equally spectacular at daybreak and day's end. At an elevation of 8,100 feet (2,469 m), Sunrise Point is just slightly higher than the Rim Trail and the ponderosa forest to the west. This provides one with a 360 degree view, making it a great choice for stargazers, and those hoping to see the sun's final light along the western horizon. The view of the rock formations (hoodoos) within the Bryce Amphitheater is exceptional as well. Here one can clearly see the full process of hoodoo formation as the plateau rim erodes back exposing walls or fins of layered rock, which are then broken by frost-wedging with windows (arches) that expand to eventually form the isolated columns of stone known as hoodoos. Further east, the eye traces to see these hoodoos' final state: colorful badlands of sediment spotted with vegetation, including bristlecone pines. The popular Queen's Garden trail provides an unforgettable journey down a ridgeline that provides views of every stage of this process.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail connects this view to Sunrise and Fairyland Points further north and Inspiration and Bryce Points further south. The most popular section is the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section between here and Sunrise Point. This section is paved (and therefore permits leashed pets) and has minimal elevation changes. The Queen's Garden Trail also descends from this viewpoint area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Northeast</h4> <p>See the flat-topped feature of Boat Mesa and the angled slope of Sinking Ship set against the stark Pink Cliffs of the Table Cliff Plateau 17.5 miles (28 km) distant. The roughly 30 degree slope of Sinking Ship is evidence of the Paunsaugunt fault line, which travels north-south roughly along the eastern edge of the park. This fault, along with large fields of volcanic rock north of the park, were created as part of the tectonic events that elevated the Colorado Plateau region to its present day elevations and later produced the Basin and Range region to the west. The fault is a normal fault, which means that it was formed by extension--the ground you're standing upon moving down and away from the opposite side of the valley. This movement accounts for the 2,000 foot (610 m) difference in elevation between the Bryce Amphitheater and the Table Cliff plateau, despite these being formed of the same rock layer. Sinking Ship is slightly caught upon this fault, explaining its tilted appearance. Though once a site of intense movement, little activity has been recorded along the fault in the last 9 million years.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The large crown-shaped feature in the middle of the Bryce Amphitheater is known as Bristlecone Point. If you have some binoculars, you may be able to see their scraggly forms upon the white layers of the Claron formation capping Bristlecone Point. You can see that between here and Bristlecone Point is a series of colorful badlands that continue to the north, but steeply drop off into more forested areas to the south. One can see this as a north/south dividing line within the Bryce Amphitheater, where areas south have been eroded more deeply and undercut cliffs to the south (a trend that increases the further south in the park you travel), while erosion has been gentler and less dramatic further north. Beyond Bristlecone Point is the broad Paria Valley, which has been formed over the last 6 million years by the Paria River. The Paria River ultimately joins the Colorado River not too far from Navajo Mountain, visible on the southeastern horizon.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>To the south, one can also see Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce Points along the forested rim of the Paunsagunt Plateau. If you have an especially good eye (and know what you're looking for) you can spot Thor's Hammer along the Two Bridges side of the Navajo Loop below Sunset Point.</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <p>The Limber Pine at Sunrise Point (known as \"Stilts\"), roots exposed by erosion of the rim, serves as a reminder of the resilience and ability of life to adapt to adverse conditions, and also of the rapidity with which the scene before us is disappearing. Geologists have calculated that the rim of the canyon is eroding at a rate of one to four feet every century and that in approximately three million years, Bryce Canyon will be gone forever. The hoodoos of Bryce Canyon's main amphitheater appear as a snapshot in the rapid process of erosion on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. This rapidly eroding land creates a harsh environment for any living thing, and like this limber pine, all creatures which live here, from people to animals to plants, must adapt to the conditions in order to survive.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Ponderosa pine line the rim of the canyon here. To the northeast is Boat Mesa and the Sinking Ship formation set against the stark Pink Cliffs of the Table Cliff Plateau. Below the plateau’s rim, a mass of orange hoodoos and stonewalls are capped with a thick layer of resistant white limestone. At the far edge of the overlook stands one small, lone Limber Pine tree. It clings to the very edge of the eroding cliff; its tangled roots are exposed above ground and curve like legs as if it is standing or walking.",

In the distance the mountains are High Swan, High Knob, and Lane Pinnacle. Behind the overlook, Tanbark Ridge ascends another 700 feet. Swan Mountain is behind Tanbark Ridge. <br /> <br /> The name tanbark comes from a leather tannery that is said to have been located on this ridge. Tanneries by their nature were foul smelling and usually located away from towns. A tannery situated on this ridge had the advantage of nearby resources—tannins from the bark of oak and hemlock trees and mountain breezes to blow away the smell of tannic acid and putrid animal hides.</p>",

This is the room for meetings guests and special gatherings. One such meeting included a number of gentlemen who gathered and voted to accept the <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6326?show=full\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Charter to the American Museum of Natural History</span></a><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">.</span> Theodore Roosevelt recalls a time he was in the room: \"The ornaments of that parlor I remember now, including the gas chandelier decorated with a great quantity of cut-glass prisms. These prisms struck me as possessing peculiar magnificence. One of them fell off one day, and I hastily grabbed it and stowed it away, passing several days of furtive delight in the treasure, a delight always alloyed with fear that I would be found out and convicted of larceny.\" (Autobiography, p. 6)",
            "audioDescription": "This is a fancy, blue and gold colored themed room. Most of the furniture is against the wall, leaving an open feel to the room. Hanging from the ceiling In the center of the room, is a chandelier composed of cut prisms of glass. Along the wall opposite of where visitors enter, is a fireplace. The fireplace is framed by an intricately carved white marble mantlepiece, decorated with roses. Upon the mantlepiece sits 4 decorative pieces: an urn, clock, and candelabras. Above the fireplace mantle is a large, gold framed mirror that measures 4 feet x 8 feet. On either side of the fireplace is satin covered sofas and chairs. On the adjacent wall, which looks out to the street, there are two floor to ceiling windows. In between them is a floor to ceiling, gold framed mirror. The mirror measures approximately 3 feet x 12 feet. Placed in front of the mirror is a marble covered side table, upon which sits a wax fruit basket covered by a glass bell. As the viewer pans to the left, they see more furnishings: An etagere with multiple decorative items on it including a vase and figurines. A piano sits next to the etagere, with a stool and music rack next to it. Hanging on the wall above the piano is an etching of Martha Washington's Ball. As the visitor walks in, immediately to their right is an open passage between the library and front parlor. To separate the space, one can pull together two pocket doors adorned with intricately etched plate glass.",

From these important role models, Warren learned about ranching, care and breeding of livestock, and business leadership.  Following the death of Kohrs and Bielenberg in the early 1920s, the overall size and scale of ranching on the home ranch was drastically reduced. By 1924, the home ranch was approximately 1000 acres in size and most of the livestock was sold off. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17a3d619-cedb-45aa-a878-b285d351a646}{136}\" paraid=\"1274488771\">In 1932, during the Great Depression, Conrad Warren became the manager of the ranch, and in 1935 he invested in repairs to the bunkhouse row. During these repairs, Warren converted this room into his office space.  When Warren was hired as the ranch manager, he focused on making this an active ranch again by buying land to increase the size of the ranch, as well as rebuilding the livestock herds. Warren centered his livestock operations around Hereford cattle and Belgian draft horses.  Warren was widely known for the quality of his livestock. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17a3d619-cedb-45aa-a878-b285d351a646}{186}\" paraid=\"2138769135\">Other ranching operations directed by Warren included adding new buildings to the ranch, repairing fences and buildings, and upgrading the irrigation systems for water on the ranch. Warren also focused on animal care, and though he was not trained as a veterinarian, Warren was an amateur vet and kept syringes and medical supplies in this office, as well as in the thoroughbred horse barn vet office, which he might need to treat the livestock, as well as early work in the field of artificial insemination of the livestock. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17a3d619-cedb-45aa-a878-b285d351a646}{226}\" paraid=\"547148093\">By World War II, Warren started mechanizing the ranch with the purchase of tractors and other motorized farm equipment which took less manpower to operate than the older horse-drawn equipment. This transition to mechanized equipment helped Warren realize it was time to sell the Belgian draft horse herd since there were fewer people with the skills needed to operate draft horse teams, and ranchers and farmers were not using as much animal power in their daily operations. </p>",

            "bodyText": "Conrad Kohrs and his half-brother, Johnny Bielenberg, are credited with bringing the first Thoroughbred horses to Montana. These tall, sleek racehorses were cross bred with smaller horses that had been used by indigenous people for centuries. The result produced fast, durable horses that were perfectly suited for covering long distances, whether for personal transport or working on cattle drives. Horses were not always left outside on the range, however and this barn was constructed around 1883 to house many of the ranch’s prized Thoroughbred horses.<br /> <br /> One of the stalls in the building was used by foaling mares about to give birth. An adjacent bricked-in sleeping room was constructed at the front of the building with an interior window. This provided a view to the foaling area and allowed ranch hands to keep a watchful eye on the mares. Johnny Bielenberg also utilized this small room as a makeshift veterinary office, and he spent many nights sleeping on the bunk so he could keep a watchful eye over the foaling mares.<br /> <br /> For a time, Conrad Warren housed his prized Belgian mares inside the barn. In the 1940’s and early 1950’s, Warren used the building as a show barn for his Hereford cattle. During sales, several tents were set up in the adjacent field and the cattle were brought out one at a time to be purchased.<br /> <br /> Today, the Thoroughbred barn is used to display some of the ranch’s historic equipment that employed true horsepower. The sleighs, buggies, and harvesters that visitors can explore inside the building are as diverse as the horses that pulled them.",
            "audioDescription": "This red barn, is approximately 119 feet long by 36 feet wide, and sits in a north/south configuration with its entrance on the north end. A dirt road runs along the eastern side of the building. To the west, a small, white barn stands close by with a large pasture just beyond. Immediately behind the red barn, passes a small creek that is thick with cattails and tall grass. The entrance to the barn is two large, swinging wood doors that open to the outside. Inside the barn, a wooden floor runs the length of the center of the building. Immediately inside the door is a small caretaker’s office to the left. Beyond the office, there are 7 horse stalls that run the length of the interior of the barn. Along the right side of the interior of the barn there are 9 horse stalls that run the length of the building. In each stall, one or more pieces of horse-drawn equipment sits on display.",

            "bodyText": "<p>An 1836 petition by Eastham residents concerned about loved ones at sea caused the Boston Marine Society to recommend to the United States Congress the construction of the Nauset Lights. Congress granted $10,000, and the contract was awarded to Winslow Lewis, the lowest bidder at $6549.</p> <p>Three 15-foot high masonry towers were built. The lights soon gained the nickname “The Three Sisters” because from sea they looked like women in white dresses with black hats.</p> <p>Cape Cod shores change quickly. The National Lighthouse Board ordered three new moveable wooden towers to be built thirty feet inland from the original masonry ones.</p> <p>The new towers stood twenty-two feet tall; the lantern housing added an additional seven feet. The old towers were allowed to fall into the Atlantic.</p> <p>Advances in technology, the continuing erosion of Nauset cliffs, and the cost of maintaining three lights, prompted a major change at the Nauset Light station.</p> <p>In 1911, the center tower was moved away from the cliff edge and attached to the 1875 keeper’s house. The other two towers were set aside until a decision could be reached about their future.</p> <p>The fourth-order Fresnel lens in the remaining tower was now mounted on a ball bearing revolver, making the light flash three times every ten seconds.</p> <p>The decommissioned two sisters were sold at a public auction to Helen M. Cummings for $3.50! The Cummings family first moved them to a site near the old French Cable station, before making some repairs.</p> <p>In 1920, the towers were moved onto Cable Road, and adjoined with a room. The “Twin Lights Cottage” was subsequently used as a summer cottage and a dance studio, until the towers were sold to the National Park Service in 1965.</p> <p>After many years of service, the center tower fell into disrepair. The Lighthouse Bureau decided to replace it with one of the former Chatham “twin lights” that was no longer in use. This iron and brick tower was moved, repainted and stands today as the latest in a lineage of Nauset Lights.</p> <p>Once decommissioned, the last of the Three Sisters towers was sold to Albert Hall, who turned it into a cottage.</p> <p>The National Park Service purchased the center tower in 1975 with a plan to reunite it with the other two towers. The three are placed in their original orientation on a plot of land on Cable Road.</p> <p>Restoration took place through the 1980s, and the site opened for its first public tour in 1989.</p> <p>Today one can visit the Sisters and marvel at the remarkable journey that brought them their location on Cable Road in Eastham.</p>",

            "bodyText": "The Stallion Barn was originally used as a home for one or two horses. The exact date of its construction is unknown but based on the materials and styles used for construction, it is likely that this structure was built sometime in the 1870s or 1880s.<br /> <br /> In 1928, the building was remodeled and turned into a garage and blacksmith shop.  A small chimney pipe is visible from the outside and it is possible that at one time a portable forge might have been used in the back left-hand corner of the building. An upper hay loft was also removed during this remodel in 1928.<br /> <br /> While the first tractors did not arrive on the ranch until the end of the 1930s, cars and trucks, as well as horse drawn equipment were always needing to be repaired and fixed. The need for a repair shop large enough for mechanical equipment, like tractors, was finally solved in 1935 when Con Warren built a large three bay garage and repair shop near the main ranch house.",
            "audioDescription": "The Stallion Barn is 28 feet wide and 22 feet deep, and one and a half stories high. There is one set of red double barn doors which function as the entrance to the old garage space. Along the left wall there are three windows which contain six rectangular panes of glass in each. The smaller panes of glass are approximately 9 by 12 inches in size. Along the right wall is an interpretive display which discusses the Hard Winter and the end of the Open Range Cattle Era. The building is constructed out of logs and limestone mortar, in the style of frontier cabins or similar to the structures you can build playing with Lincoln Logs. To the right of the main double doors is a single door which accesses the lean-to section of the building, used today for storage by the National Park Service.",

They signal the change from floating in the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge to floating through private lands. <br /> <br /> There are two private canoe, kayak, and tube landing/launches on the Northern bank of the river as well as a public restroom, a section for public parking, and great views of the Berry Falls from all angles.<br /> <br /> We love viewing the falls from the Berry Bridge in every season. The falls flow year-round and under the guise of a gentle snowfall bring a sense of calm and stillness. The sound of the falls feeding into the river with the echoes of laughter from floaters rings in the summer season. <br /> <br /> Floaters on the river take their time passing these waterfalls; it is rare to get so close to waterfalls while floating the Niobrara River. Many of the other waterfalls are tucked up and into canyons or are too high up on the river walls for visitors to feel the spray and splash of the flow. <br /> <br /> Climbing on the Berry Falls is not allowed. The land of that river bank is actually privately owned, and the owners would like to preserve the structure of the Berry Falls for many years and visitors to come. ",
            "audioDescription": "A bridge spans about 40 feet across a river from South to North, the river flows from East to West. About 20 feet off of the bridge, on the river's Southeast Bank, a 8 foot tall, 10 foot wide waterfall can be seen. It is convex in shape and sticks out, water flowing over it in three directions. The stone behind the fall is a mix of dark grey-brown and light tan stone. The sound of the water rushing over the falls is different that that of the river running past.",

            "bodyText": "Big Spring was one of Missouri's first state parks. It was a state park from 1924 until 1969 when the people of Missouri donated it, along with Alley and Round Spring State Parks to the National Park Service to become a part of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. A gift from Missouri to America.<br /> <br /> The Big Spring area contains the Big Spring of course, but also a campground, a picnic area, a dining lodge, trails and housekeeping cabins. The area is known as the CCC historic district as many of the structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps when it was a state park. <br /> <br /> The Big Spring is sometimes called America's biggest spring. In reality there are three contenders for that title: Big Spring, Idaho's Snake River Spring Complex and Florida's Silver Spring. Since the flow from springs varies with local rainfall, any of these three might be biggest on any given day depending on the weather in Missouri, Idaho and Florida! The truth is they are all about the same size.<br /> <br /> In any case, at an average daily flow of 286 million gallons of water, Big Spring is an awesome sight and a geologic wonder. Underground passages carry water from as far as 45 miles away to emerge at the spring. Studies have shown that the water is carrying a load of dissolved limestone equivalent to 70 tons a day! This dissolved rock gives the spring its color and is also carving out a huge conduit underground. Should the spring ever go dry, a huge cave will be the result.<br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "Toward the spring a large volume of blueish water is pouring out of the base of a grey rock bluff. White caps on top of the water exist due to the viscosity. A small cave sits above the spring at the end of the stone walkway. Green manicured grass is on the left and right of a stone trail leading from the parking lot to the right of the spring. Large canopy trees line the spring with green moss on the large boulders that surround the spring. A brown metal bench is to the left overlooking the spring pool.",

The original, sold after Hulda Hoover’s death, was found in a West Branch barn sometime in the 1930s and eventually returned to the Hoover family. It is displayed at the Visitor Center.</p> <h2>Bed & Trundle</h2> <p>At night the Hoovers pulled out the trundle from underneath their parents’ four-poster bed. As a toddler young Herbert shared the trundle with his older brother Tad while his baby sister slept in the cradle. Patchwork quilts and wool bedspreads kept the family warm after the woodstove’s fire died out in the middle of the night.</p> <h2>Dresser</h2> <p>The dresser in the corner is very similar to one Hulda received as a wedding gift from her mother. Made by Herbert Hoover's great uncle, a cabinet-maker in Detroit, the drawers were once filled with household linens.</p> <h2>Sewing Machine</h2> <p>The sewing machine is not original to the Hoover family, but is a reminder of Jesse’s growing success as a businessman, and how he provided for the needs of his wife and family. A sewing basket filled with needles and thread was always within Hulda’s reach.</p> <h2>Carpet</h2> <p>Rag rugs like the one in the cottage covered the floors. The Hoovers kept old clothes and cloth scraps. They cut them into strips and wound them into balls until they accumulated enough for Herbert's grandmother to weave into rugs. Hulda sewed the sections together and tacked them to the floor. By putting layers of old newspapers underneath and fitting the rugs snugly against the walls, the floors would stay warmer in the winter.</p>",

A walk along the Rio Grande leads to the entrance of a magnificent limestone gorge that splits the Sierra del Carmen Mountains. Along the way, look for ancient fossils that existed when this area was under an ocean, and pre-historic grinding holes that indigenous inhabitants used in food production.<br /> <br /> This area is also a great place for scenic photography. The colors on the Sierra del Carmen at sunset are well worth the journey. During summer months, it is best to explore the canyon in the mornings, since daytime temperatures often exceed 110 degrees. Water and good footwear are essential items here, and for any hike in the Chihuahuan Desert. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> From the parking lot, this trail climbs a small rise before descending to the Rio Grande. The trail surface is rock and dirt. Once down at river level, the trail transitions to sand and the remainder of the walk is a flat, pleasant stroll along the river. Eventually the high limestone walls and the river prevent further travel and it's time to turn around and head back to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Bring plenty of water!</span></em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",
            "audioDescription": "The trailhead for the Boquillas Canyon Trail is located near the Rio Grande. The tall escarpment directly ahead is the Sierra del Carmen. The canyon walls are about 1200 feet high and are comprised of gray limestone. The trail climbs a small hill, and near the top of the steps are a number of holes in the rock that ancient people used for grinding food. The trail proceeds down the hill and then parallels the river. The trail is composed of sand and river cobbles. Willows and other riparian plants line the river. Listen for the song of the canyon wren and other birds, as well as the lapping of water on the riverbank .",

From 1400 feet above the river at Main Overlook, visitors are rewarded with one of the most outstanding views in the park. On a clear day you can see directly into the heart of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, including seven miles of the New River and its watershed. From Main Overlook visitors can also get a glimpse of some of the gorge's unique cultural history. From here you see an active railway and the town of Quinnimont, where the first coal was shipped out of the gorge in 1873. Don't miss the views from Turkey Spur Overlook, and be sure to walk the woodland trails.<br /> <br /> Grandview is a great place to see the spectacular displays of Catawba rhododendrons that bloom here every spring. The purple Catawba rhododendrons bloom in mid May, while the white great rhododendrons bloom in July. The exact bloom times are not always consistent year to year, so check with a ranger at one of our visitor centers or check our facebook page for updates.</p> <p>The Grandview section of the park includes overlooks of the New River, a visitor center (open seasonally), five hiking trails, ranger-led walks and talks, summer outdoor dramas, and picnic areas with playgrounds. Information about renting picnic shelters at Grandview can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/permitsandreservations.htm\">Permits and Reservations</a> page of the New River Gorge website. Grandview is home to <a href=\"http://www.theatrewestvirginia.com/\">Theatre West Virginia</a>, which features outdoor drama presentations from June through August.<br /> <br /> Grandview was originally a part of the West Virginia State Park system. In 1939, the state of West Virginia purchased 52 acres of land at Grandview to develop a day use park. The Civilian Conservation Corps built roads, shelters, and a picnic area, all still in use today. Construction began in 1960 on the 1200-seat Cliffside Amphitheater. The children’s playgrounds, recreation area, and additional walkways were built from 1961 to 1964. After more than 50 years as one of West Virginia’s most popular state parks, Grandview was transferred to the National Park Service in 1990.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Directions</strong></p> <p>To reach Grandview from Beckley follow I-64 East five miles to Exit 129 B. From Lewisburg follow I-64 West forty miles to Exit 129. From either exit, turn right and follow Route 9 North six miles to Grandview.</p>",

A decade after his death the largest public fundraising to that point in American history brought in $600,000 for his tomb and a million people attended its dedication in 1897.",

Grant's tenacity and boldness led to victories in the Battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga and Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Scenes of these events are depicted in mosaics in the tomb. In 1866, Congress awarded Grant his fourth star, making him the first full General of the Armies. <br> <br> A grateful nation elected Grant to serve as President of the United States twice, in 1868 and 1872. Grant's accomplishments include signing the act that established the first national park, Yellowstone, on March 1, 1872. After his presidency, Grant settled in New York City. He died of throat cancer on July 23, 1885 in Mount McGregor, New York and was laid to rest in New York City on August 8.<br> <br> Approximately 90,000 people from around the world donated over $600,000 towards the construction of Grant's Tomb. This was the largest public fundraising effort ever at that time. Designed by architect John Duncan, the granite and marble structure was completed in 1897 and remains the largest mausoleum in North America. Over one million people attended the parade and dedication ceremony of Grant's Tomb on April 27, 1897.</p>",

Elias Hasket Derby loved “interesting” plants, and instructed the captains of his ships to bring him plants from their voyages around the world.</p> <p>The 18th century garden at Salem Maritime National Historic Site was designed in 1990 by Suzanne Gentiluomo, a horticultural expert specializing in historic gardens. With fellow volunteer Joel Ohringer, she created a formal garden typical of those favored by wealthy eighteenth century merchants.</p> <p>Formal gardens evolved from medieval European palace gardens. Although they were old-fashioned for the late eighteenth century, formal gardens were still common in New England, especially in towns where space was limited. The formal garden behind the Derby House is divided into beds, or parterres d’ broderie (embroidered plots), edged with germander hedges and separated by crushed gravel walkways. Within each bed, vegetables, flowers and herbs all grow together. A traditional parterre was defined by its hedges, so the arrangement of “filler” plants was less important.</p> <p>The parterres are surrounded by an orchard of fruit trees, leading to a grape arbor at the back of the garden. The entire yard is enclosed by a sturdy fence to keep out wandering livestock. A formal garden symbolized the triumph of Godly order over the diabolical chaos of Nature, which had to be kept at bay with a strong barrier.</p> <p>This Colonial Revival Garden contains more than 150 varieties of heirloom annuals, perennials and bulbs, all documented to 1798 or earlier. Some are native to North America, although many were imported. You may even recognize some roadside weeds! The 18th century merchant who owned this garden would have been an enthusiastic plant collector, rather like Elias Hasket Derby.</p>",

The park links 225 miles of parkland along the Potomac River stretching from Cumberland, Maryland, to Mount Vernon, Virginia. The park is beloved by many due to its notable design elements like the labyrinth, beautiful fountain (seasonal, open \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/rocr/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">Alerts</a>\" at top of page for status), and charming rain gardens. Visitors come to the park to enjoy quiet contemplation or to take advantage of the large accessible pathways to exercise and recreate. Cyclists, skaters, and pedestrians have a designated pathway (free of cars) allowing them to enjoy views of individual boaters, kayakers, and competitive crews, as well as of Theodore Roosevelt Island, Key Bridge, and the Potomac River. The park has many unique design features including:  </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/waterfront-park-labyrinth.htm\">Labyrinth</a></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Looking for peace of mind? You might find it in the labyrinth at the western end of the park. Labyrinths date back to ancient times. Geometric turns are meant to encourage contemplation as you slowly travel from the outer edge into the center. To get the most out of the walk, focus on quieting your mind and disconnecting with the chaos of the outside world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/waterfront-park-and-percy-plaza.htm\">Fountain</a><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </strong>(seasonal, open \"Alerts\" at top of page for status)</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The centerpiece of the park is the fountain found at the waterfront intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, NW, and K Street. People of all ages enjoy splashing and playing in the water on hot summer days.</p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">River Steps and Pergola</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">These steps were originally created with rowing regattas in mind. In addition to providing finish line seating for rowing events, the steps are a popular year-round place to picnic while viewing the river, birds, other wildlife, and boaters. More seating can be found beneath the tall steel and cable pergola, designed as a call back to the waterfront’s more industrial past.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The waterfront was once a dynamic center of commerce and trade, especially for tobacco. But by the 1820s, larger ships could no longer access the river due to the build-up of silt. Factories like the American Ice Company and the Brennan Construction Company transformed the waterfront port into an industrial landscape. The area became a transportation route when the construction was completed for nearby Key Bridge and the Whitehurst Freeway. As a result of this new shift,  the once booming factories began to relocate or close, and much of the waterfront was converted into parking lots.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Today, the Georgetown Waterfront Park preserves public open space and the waterfront’s history.</span></p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Rain Gardens</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The rain gardens are located at the intersection of the paths that cross the park. Rain gardens collect and hold rainwater and storm water runoff, so it can soak into the ground instead of flowing into storm drains or along the surface of the land. Rain gardens help prevent erosion, water pollution, and flooding.</p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Bio-Edge</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Looking at the edge of the waterfront, you will see a living bank where a crumbling concrete retaining wall used to be. Instead of simply repairing the beat-up bulkhead from the industrial era, the National Park Service added soil and native plants. This greener solution was engineered to stabilize the bank, create a habitat for wildlife, and filter rainwater as it flows from the park to the river.</p> <p><strong>Pollinator Gardens</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Can you imagine a world without flowers? Over 75% of the Earth’s flowering plants depend on pollinators for reproduction. Despite their importance, studies show that pollinator populations are declining due to loss of habitat. Pollinator gardens, big or small, help keep pollinators strong by providing a place to eat, rest, and reproduce.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">At this park, you can find pollinator gardens with native plants along the pathways at both Potomac Street and 33rd Street. Funding for these two gardens was provided by the <a href=\"https://georgetownwaterfrontpark.org/\">Friends of Georgetown Waterfront Park</a>.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span> </span></p>",

While a peek into the canyon mouth from the parking area will give visitors a glimpse of the canyon's secrets, hiking into the canyon offers so much more: towering walls, colorful side canyons beckoning for exploration, ripples formed by ancient water, now preserved in stone, the history of a road reclaimed in a flash-flood event, and the skittering of wildlife.  <br /> <br /> This easy/moderate hike is 2 miles (3.2 km) round-trip, and involves one 3 foot (1 m) rock scramble. Although most hikers turn around at the junction to Red Cathedral, those looking for a more adventurous hike can continue an additional 0.5 miles (0.8 km) to the vertically fluted walls of a natural amphitheater- Red Cathedral (this involves scrambling and squeezing/crawling through rock spaces). An even longer trek- 7.8 miles (12.6 km), will take hikers to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/zabriskie-point-scenic-viewpoint.htm\">Zabriskie Point</a>, before looping back to the parking area via Gower Gulch. <br /> <br /> Want to learn more?

The dunes surround you are pure white and stand close to 20 feet high. The only vegetation visible is in a flat basin on the other side of the sign. The background of the panel features a satellite image of the region, with a broad band of white stretching out between the two mountain ranges. The area of the park is outline in green at the lower left of the white. Red arrows point from left to right. Text reads, “Strong winds can blow gypsum dust for hundreds of miles. But without the wind, there would be no dunes to enjoy.” There are three other photographs on the panel, all in black and white, one on the left and two on the right. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “In this land of constant motion, nothing is permanent. Everything here moves—or we can move it. Any strong windstorm can wipe out this road in a matter of hours. Our 20-year-veteran heavy equipment operator once said, “If I spent all my time, 40 hours a week out there, it wasn’t enough time to do the roads…” The photograph on the left shows a road plow, scraping back sand at the base of a white slope. The caption reads, “Roadwork here never ends.” Near the right side of the panel another photograph shows a flat trail marker in the middle of the dunes with only about a foot sticking up out of the sand. The caption reads, “Trails: here today, gone tomorrow.” The picture at the far right shows a picnic table with a slatted awning that rises from one bench to curve up and overhead. The caption reads, “Even our picnic shelters are moveable.”",

Park in the day hiking and climbing parking area. Do not park in a campsite or block any campsites. Parking is limited and can fill early on sunny summer days. Have an alternate destination in mind. There is a restroom and water fountain located near the day parking area. The trail begins in the D loop of the campground. The White River Road to access the campground is open to vehicles during the summer only.<br /> <br /> This route was once an old mining road which was rehabilitated for trail use. Although an effort was made to mine copper ore in this area in the late 1800s, nothing of commercial value was ever extracted and mining efforts were eventually suspended. The trail follows the White River for 3.5 miles. One mile beyond the trailhead is a junction with the <strong>Emmons Moraine Trail</strong>. This one-mile round-trip spur trail leads to a viewpoint which overlooks the Emmons Glacier, the largest glacier in the 48 contiguous United States. At first the ascent is gradual but becomes steeper on the final section before entering <strong>Glacier Basin</strong>. A climber's track continues past Glacier Basin camp, passing through an area of fragile wetland plants to the base of the Inter Glacier. A trail also connects the Glacier Basin Trail to Sunrise via the Burroughs Mountain Trail. From Glacier Basin, look for mountain goats on the surrounding slopes and climbers ascending the Inter Glacier to Steamboat Prow. Please stay on the trail to protect the vegetation. Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wilderness Camping</strong><br /> Campsites at Glacier Basin are popular with climbers who are beginning their ascent of Mount Rainier. The sites are located in the trees as one approaches the open meadows of the basin. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm\">Wilderness permits</a> are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, visitor centers and on our web site. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. Treat water before drinking.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The attraction of Glassmine Falls Overlook is a tall, skinny waterfall that can be seen in the distance across the valley from the overlook. Seeing the waterfall requires a bit of luck, however, as this ephemeral falls only flows after periods of rain. During drier weather it will slow to a trickle or even dry up completely. So plan your visit after a rainy day, if you have that option!<br /> <br /> At the base of the waterfall is an old mica mine. Miners called the flaky, shiny mineral they mined “glass,” hence the name Glassmine Falls. There were many “glass mines” that operated in western North Carolina in the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> Today the waterfall and surrounding land is privately owned as part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/asheville-watershed.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Conservation%20Trust,the%20water%20quality%20and%20forest\">Asheville watershed</a>. There is no public access to the waterfall. But the view from the overlook after a good rain is impressive—even better if you bring a pair of binoculars. And listen closely, you may even hear the distant sounds of this roaring cascade as it plummets over the steep cliff. The sign at the overlook says the falls is over 800 feet high. That seems to be extremely generous—most would estimate around 200 feet—but Glassmine Falls is a magnificent sight, nonetheless. A short path from the overlook leads to another viewing area. The Mountains-to-Sea Trail can be accessed from either end of the overlook.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A large, paved pull-through overlook on the east side of the Blue Ridge Parkway. A narrow grassy median separates the overlook from the Parkway. Rock curbing borders a paved sidewalk that looks out over the valley and the waterfall. Beyond the sidewalk is a small grass area, split rail fence, and then a steep drop off. A paved path at the north end of the overlook leads to a slightly higher viewing area. There are trailheads for the Mountains-to-Sea Trail at both ends of the overlook. High elevation deciduous forest is found throughout this area.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Voyageurs National Park is situated on the southern tip of what is known as the Canadian Shield, a gigantic dome of volcanic bedrock that forms the heart of the North American Continent. This bedrock dates from the birth of North America. Some 2.8 billion years ago, massive volcanoes erupted through this area and deposited layer after layer of ash and lava, building up the island landmasses. These island arc volcanoes collided forming still larger landmasses. Subsequent uplifting, folding, superheating along with tremendous pressure created igneous and metamorphic rock to form the present day granite and schist of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Eons of erosion then wore down these volcanic mountain ranges to the landscape you see today. </p> <h4>Visiting Grassy Bay Cliffs </h4>   <p>The sheer granite cliffs of Grassy Bay rise 125 feet above the surface of Sand Point Lake and reach one of the highest points within Voyageurs. This Lac La Croix biotite granite batholith (a body of magma that cooled underground) is the largest and youngest igneous intrusion in the area, dated at 2.64 to 2.69 billion years old. <br /> <br /> In summer, these cliffs are accessible by boat and in winter by snowmobile. There are currently no amenities at this Visitor Destination. </p>",

            "bodyText": "Situated on the edge of the pali (cliff), the Kalahaku Overlook features a simple structure that overlooks the expansive Haleakalā crater including the 14 puʻu (hills), the famous ʻāhinahina (silversword), and maybe even an ʻuaʻu (Hawaiian petrel) if you are lucky. Reached by a 0.1 mile (0.16 km) walk, this perspective differs from that of the visitor center near the summit, providing a unique experience.<br /> <br /> Long before modern tourism began, people have been visiting the mountain of Haleakalā for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. In ancient Hawaiʻi and today, the mountain is a sacred place. It is part of wao akua, or realm of the gods. The kānaka maoli (native Hawaiians) made the voyage for many purposes including practicing ceremonies, making offerings, chanting oli, and harvesting resources such as a special kind of rock used for making tools like the koʻi, or adze. These practices are still alive and well today.<br /> <br /> The Kalahaku Overlook structure that is currently on the pali (cliff) is not the only building to have ever existed in this location. The original structure was a rest house built in 1894 by architect Charles W. Dickey that they called Craigielea. A new shelter was constructed by the Maui Chamber of Commerce in 1914 to accommodate more visitors and remedy vandalism that had happened over the years. The only way to access the mountain at this time was by foot or horseback, so the rest house allowed for tired travelers to get much needed rest and protection from the elements. In 1957, the building was yet again rebuilt due to wear and tear from the high volume of use. The overlook shelter that you see today was designed in the “Mission 66” style. The Mission 66 program created the Park Service Modern style, which is what you see in many national park visitor centers and structures throughout the country today. The glass and steel materials allowed the park service to create low-cost structures that they could use for shelter and educational programs to help the increasing number of visitors make meaningful connections with the cultural and natural resources of our national parks.<br /> <br /> This area is also nesting ground for a native seabird of Haleakalā, the ʻuaʻu (Hawaiian dark-rumped petrel). They only lay one egg per year, so they are especially vulnerable to disturbances. While this alpine desert landscape may look like just rocks, it provides habitat and a home for native animals, plants, and insects. Please stay only in the designated walking areas to avoid stepping on someone’s home. On the makai (towards the ocean) side of the parking lot, there is an area marked as “Silversword Area”. Historically there used to be numerous ʻāhinahina (silversword), but in recent years many have died due to an overall decrease in rainfall which could be attributed to changing climatic conditions.",
            "audioDescription": "A rock stairwell leads from the parking lot up to a rocky overlook area. A simple, open structure with a paved floor and rock wall on two sides overlooks the Haleakalā crater. A spectacular view of the cinder cones and valley floor thousands of feet below spreads out before you. One can also see the magnificent array of colors of the rocks including green, red, orange, yellow, tan, and black. The structure is surrounded by a rocky landscape, dotted with clumps of mostly dry grass and small green ferns. The plaques inside the structure describe the pu'u (cinder cones) in the crater. A metal railing stands between the structure and the cliff. Signs are placed along the walkway to encourage visitors to do their part to protect the native ʻuaʻu bird by staying on the trail.",

            "bodyText": "<p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many people came to Florida. Some, like Zephaniah Kingsley, sought to make their fortunes by obtaining land and establishing plantations. Others were forced to come to Florida to work on those plantations, their labor providing wealth to the people who owned them. Some of the enslaved would later become free landowners, struggling to keep their footing in a dangerous time of shifting alliances and politics. All of these people played a part in the history of Kingsley Plantation.<br /> <br /> The Planters Home in the midst of Kingsley Plantation was once the home of Zephaniah Kingsley, a wealthy slave trader and merchant. He purchased the property in 1817 in what was then Spanish Florida. Kingsley owned several plantations around the lower St. Johns River. Two of them may have been managed part-time by his wife, a former slave named Anna Madgigine Jai. Kingsley married Anna in 1806 when she was 13 years old, after she arrived in Cuba from West Africa. He freed her in 1811 and charged her with running his Laurel Grove plantation at Doctors Lake in modern-day Orange Park.<br /> <br /> Marriages between white plantation owners and African women were common in East Florida at that time. The Spanish government provided for a separate class of free people of color, and encouraged enslaved people to purchase their freedom. Slavery under Spain in Florida was not considered a lifelong condition, and free blacks were involved in the economic development of the region, some of them owning their own enslaved people.<br /> <br /> After the United States acquired Florida in 1821, the Florida Territorial Council passed laws forbidding interracial marriage and the right of free blacks or mixed race descendants to inherit property. To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its \"spirit of intolerant prejudice,\" Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few formerly enslaved people to Haiti, by that time a free black republic. His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the enslaved people to his plantation in San Jose.<br /> <br /> Kingsley then established a new farm in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants. Slavery was illegal in Haiti. They were to earn their freedom in nine years.<br /> <br /> The Kingsley family's experience in 19th century Florida underscores the arbitrary nature of slavery. While American slaveholders believed that color should be the basis of condition, and that that condition was fixed and eternal, men like Kingsley believed otherwise. As Kingsley himself put it, \"Few, I think will deny that color and condition, if properly considered, are two very separate qualities ... our [American] legislators ... have mistaken the shadow for the substance, and confounded together two very different things; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy, which can have no better foundation than prejudice.\"</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Along Rocky Creek is a small turbine mill built by Walter Klepzig in 1928 --hence its name, Klepzig Mill. Walter, son of a Prussian German immigrant, was a progressive thinker. He was the first in the neighborhood to introduce both barbed and woven fence wire and a refined breed of milk cow. He sawed logs into boards for his house and out-buildings, and routinely saved \"good boards\" for use in building coffins for his neighbors. He frequently ground corn free for neighbors \"on starvation,\" i.e. those who could ill afford to leave him the customary toll of grain.</p> <p>Klepzig Mill is a type of building referred to in the vernacular as a \"sawmill house.\" It was a building type that tended to replace log construction after the arrival of sawmills in a locale. A sawmill house could be erected quickly and by only one or two people. Instead of stud-wall framing, vertical planks were nailed to a hand-hewn sill at the bottom and a sawn two-by-four plate at the top. The resulting wall panels, fabricated flat on the ground, were then raised into place. Battens might then be added to cover the seams. Foundations were often piers of uncut and un-monitored native stone.</p> <p>Klepzig Mill is not much to look at with its various accouterments and modifications-- cement spillway, scrap metal hinge from the hood of a Model \"A\" Ford truck, old corrugated iron roof. Still, it is in a spectacular setting, surrounded by the rhyolite rock of the \"shut in\" canyon made by Rocky Creek. It is a lasting testament to the hardships of every day life in the Ozarks in a time not so long ago.</p> <p>To reach Klepzig Mill take Highway H (east of Eminence and Winona) to Highway NN. You'll pass the sign for Rocky Falls, this is a pleasant stop also. Turn left on County Road #522. This can be muddy during the rainy season and is narrow, not recommended for large motorhomes or trailers. Klepzig Mill is less than a mile on the right. There is no sign or defined parking area, and it's easy to miss in summer vegetation, so watch carefully. It is also possible to hike to Klepzig Mill from Rocky Falls along the Ozark Trail, or park at the end of the pavement on NN and walk up the dirt road. (Don't block traffic!)</p>",

Cedar County Deed Records show that in 1875, Laban Miles purchased the home at 113 S. Downey Street for $2,250.00. In 1870, Miles had married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/hulda-minthorn-hoover.htm\">Hulda Hoover’s</a> younger sister, Agnes Minthorn, just five days after Hulda and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jesse-clark-hoover.htm\">Jesse Hoover</a> were wed. Now they were settling down with a family of their own.</p> <h2>Hoover & Miles Family Ties</h2> <p>There was much visiting back and forth between the Miles and Hoover homes, and the two families became close friends. The short walk on Downey Street often brought the Hoover children, Tad, Bertie, and Mary, together with their cousins for playtime or a shared pot of soup that had spent the day simmering on a wood stove. But their time together was short-lived.</p> <h2>Service as an Indian Agent</h2> <p>In the spring of 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Miles to serve as an agent responsible for the care and education of the Osage and Kaw tribes in the Oklahoma territory. When Laban, Agnes and their children left that summer, they rented their home first to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/methodist-church-site.htm\">Methodist Church</a> for a parsonage, and then to Dr. L.J. Leech, a well-known and respected physician in West Branch.</p> <h2>Adventures in Indian Country</h2> <p>But the ties between the Miles and Hoover families remained strong. Following Jesse Hoover’s death, Laban Miles asked Hulda if his nephew could come to live with them on the Osage reservation. In 1882, eight-year-old Herbert spent eight months there with his aunt, uncle and cousins. For the future President, they were memories that lasted a lifetime.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Laban Miles House 312 words Laban Miles House. 2 ¼ minutes. The Laban Miles House is located at the southeast corner of Downey and Wetherell Streets. Although Downey Street is only for pedestrians within the historic site, Wetherell Street is open to vehicular traffic, so please be alert. If you are heading north on Downey Street, a log blocks the way just before you reach Wetherell. For safety, use the boardwalk, which ramps down gently to Wetherell Street just north of the Laban Miles House. The wooden, two-story Laban Miles House faces west onto Downey Street. It’s 20 feet wide and 35 feet deep, with a single-story extension in the back. The building is painted pale gold and accented with thin brown trim around its many windows. The pitched roofline creates a wide gable above the second-floor windows. A narrow porch frames the front door and is supported by two carved wooden posts. The Laban Miles House is not open to the public. A white picket fence separates the house from the boardwalk that runs along the east side of Downey Street. The fence is about 3 ½ feet tall. A sign five inches wide by 12 inches tall hangs on the gatepost. Beneath the title “Laban Miles House “, a black and white photograph shows a two-story house with shutters and two brick chimneys rising from the peaked roof. Outside, two men and four women pose for the photo. A caption reads: \"After the Mileses moved, Dr. L. J. Leech's family (shown) lived here for 36 years.\" Text beneath the photograph states: \"This was the home of Herbert Hoover's aunt and uncle, Agnes and Laban Miles, before they moved in 1878 to Oklahoma Territory. Laban served as agent on the Osage and Kaw Indian Reservation. Hoover, age eight, stayed with them for several months after his father died.\" End of message.",

Constructed by timber cruiser Ed Rose and reputedly financed by Madame Nellie Bly, the Kettle Falls Hotel has accommodated and entertained travelers since 1913. Robert Williams bought the hotel in 1918 for $1,000 and four barrels of whiskey. From its somewhat scandalous past, grew a long tradition of hearty home cooking and hospitality served by the Williams family. This historic hotel was renovated by the National Park Service in 1987 so you, too, can enjoy a hearty meal, relax on the veranda or spend the night.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.kettlefallshotel.com/\">Kettle Falls Hotel</a> is the only lodging within Voyageurs National Park. Remotely located on the far eastern side of the Kabetogama Peninsula, it is approximately 15 miles from the nearest road and is only accessible by water.<br /> <br /> If you do not have a watercraft of your own, you can arrange a shuttle service with your hotel reservation through <a href=\"http://www.kettlefallshotel.com/\">Kettle Falls Hotel</a>.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>In 1860, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/the_thomas_family.htm\">Christian Keefer Thomas</a>, a retired Baltimore dry goods merchant, purchased a 261-acre farm called <i>Araby</i>. An 1856 advertisement for the property declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>“<i>THAT BEAUTIFUL AND PRODUCTIVE FARM called 'Araby,' CONTAINING 261 acres of Land, more or less. ... The improvements are of the best order, consisting of a large TWO-STORY BRICK MANSION HOUSE, with Back Building, suitable for a large family.” </i></p> </blockquote> <p>C. K. Thomas relocated his family to Frederick County to avoid Baltimore's pre-war strife; however, Arby’s location near important transportation routes and Monocacy Junction subjected it to both Union and Confederate troops throughout the war.<br /> <br /> The Union Army established a permanent presence at Monocacy Junction after Confederate troops damaged the B&O Railroad bridge on their way to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/index.htm\">Antietam</a> in September 1862. The Thomas family spent the winter of 1862-63 getting to know members of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/14th_nj.htm\"><b>14th New Jersey Regiment</b></a>, the first regiment assigned to guard the nearby Monocacy Junction. In June of 1863, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/winfield-scott-hancock.htm\">Major General Winfield Scott Hancock</a> established his headquarters at the Thomas home for three days while the Union army marched north toward Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Monocacy, on July 9, 1864, the Thomas Farm was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the day. Caught between Union and Confederate lines, the house and outbuildings were captured and recaptured by both armies several times. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/confederate-cannon-at-worthington.htm\">Confederate artillery</a> posted at the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/worthington-farm.htm\">Worthington Farm</a> caused severe damage to the house while attempting to dislodge Union sharpshooters. C. K. Thomas and his family took refuge in the cellar of the house during the battle. Among those hiding in the cellar was Alice Thomas' friend Mamie Tyler Gatchell, who recalled:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>Pieces of shell were flying too near to be pleasant ... Minié balls slashed the shubbery, while the larger missiles of War's fearful instruments twisted huge limbs from the trees, leveled down chimneys, & tore out an angle of the house.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>In August of 1864, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant</a> stayed with the Thomas family and used their home to hold a \"council of war.\" During that meeting, Grant confirmed with General Phil Sheridan a plan to secure and destroy Confederate resistance in the Shenandoah; a plan that Sheridan carried out in the fall of 1864.<br /> <br /> After the Civil War, the Thomas Farm returned to its previous prosperity. By 1868 the farm had sufficiently recovered to serve as the setting for 21-year-old Alice Thomas's wedding. C. K. Thomas died in 1889; his obituary described him as a \"gentleman of pleasant manners\" and remarked that \"his beautiful home was noted for its hospitality and delightful social entertainments.\" The farm remained in the Thomas family until 1910. It was acquired by the National Park Service in 2001, and today the Thomas House is home to the park headquarters.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "There are 270 words in this description. The Thomas Farm is a 237-acre farm. It is bounded on the north by the Monocacy River, on the east by Urbana Pike and Araby Church Road, to the south by Baker Valley Road, and Interstate 270 on the west. There are two entrances to the property: a driveway from Araby Church Road that leads to the park headquarters in the Thomas House and an entrance from Baker Valley Road that leads to the public parking area. The farm is an active farm. The land is divided into several fields, with some fields used for grazing, others for growing crops or native plants. The public parking area is a gravel lot next to a small cinderblock house at the edge of Baker Valley road. The house is a private residence and not open to the public. Next to the parking area are several waysides. The Thomas Farm Trail starts here. One-hundred-eighty feet northeast of the parking area are the remains of a blacksmith shop next to a small group of trees. The main cluster of farm building is 700 feet north of the parking area off of Baker Valley Road. In addition to a two-story, brick farmhouse; there is a corn crib, a stone tenant house, a well house, a shed, and a large red barn. The stone tenant house is open seasonal (spring through fall). There are restrooms, exhibits, and a water bottle filling station inside. The Thomas Farm trail follows the gravel farm lane past the red barn. The trail leads to the river before turning and making a loop around several of the fields.",

Ingeborg resided with the higher-priced ticket holders, while John remained below deck with the lower-fare travelers. Along with their sons Ole and Fred, they built the farm around 1890. Ole and Fred Thoreson and Ole's son Leonard ran the farm though the 1950's.<br /> <br /> According to Leonard Thoreson, Port Oneida was the best place in the world to grow up. The neighbors had many good times together but worked hard. \"The farmers all pulled together and thrashed & filled silo and worked together; anybody that needed help buzzing wood, they all helped. The more you helped somebody else, the more people you had to help you on yours.\"<br /> <br /> The Thoresons were welcoming and always seemed to have a someone staying with them. They took care of sick neighbors and hired others who needed money. And if they needed to get their cherries off the trees, neighbors came-women and children-and helped pick.<br /> Remnants of the families' once extensive apple and cherry orchard are visible in a field northwest of the farmyard, with the grid layout still evident.<br /> <br /> In partnership with the National Park Service, volunteers from the Glen Arbor Art Association have been restoring the farm buildings and using the site as an arts education center. The equipment shed has been rehabilitated for class-room and studio space. They have repaired the red granary building and the barn. They are now working on the interior of the house. The farm is one of the hosting farms during the annual Port Oneida Fair</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A gravel driveway leads through a vast grassy field to the Thoreson Farm, located on the west side of Thoreson Road about 2 miles from M-22. This farm, which is situated near the Lake Michigan bluffs, is one of 18 historical farms located in the Port Oneida Rural Historic District. There are several buildings still standing at the farm, including a 2-story white clapboard farmhouse with a concrete front porch stretching across about two-thirds of the building's front side. There is one concrete step leading up from the grass to the porch, whose roof is supported by 3 thin pillars. There are 2 gables on the front of the farmhouse, one topping the 2-story section to the left of the porch, and one above the porch roof. Affixed on each gable just below the roofline and above their respective windows are decorative wood panels-one, a half-circle, the other, a triangle-each painted with a red and white sunburst design. Other buildings at the farm include a 2-story red clapboard granary building with center gable and sloping shed roof on one end; a large weathered wood barn with a tall central gable, a long one-story wood building with a rusty metal roof, a fieldstone building with large white-painted double doors but no windows; and a small white-painted stone milk house with one side built into the adjacent hill. Located alongside the driveway are 2 additional small white clapboard buildings placed side by side. A cutout on the door of one of the building is shaped like a crescent moon with its open side facing right. This is the farm's outhouse. One additional structure is the farm's corncrib, a narrow building with outward-slanting sides constructed of red-painted wooden slats stacked horizontally with wide gaps left between them. The building's back end has the same slat construction, whereas the building's front end has a single white wooden door, shaded by the structure's overhanging gable roof. Located behind and to one side of the corncrib is a rectangular concrete trough, its thick walls measuring about 2 feet high. A short metal pole topped with a bright blue handle-a water pum-stands in the grass to one side of the long, narrow trough.",

A hike through the woods along the old road leads to the fascinating old farmhouse and related buildings.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets are allowed on the trail.</b><br /> <br /> Charles Treat was a farmer and an engineer. He and his wife Martha purchased 220 acres including several buildings from John Tweddle (of the nearby Tweddle Farm) in 1912.<br /> <br /> The farm is of historic and cultural importance and is also one of the most beautiful areas for spring wildflowers in Michigan.<br /> The farmhouse is a white two story building built by the Tweddles. Later the Treats rebuilt the front porch, adding a concrete foundation and a workshop with a metalworking forge under the porch. There was no running water at the house and a deep well dug to provide running water silted up quickly and completely. The Treats modified the gutter system of the house to direct rainwater from the roof to a cistern built into the ground in the back of the house and then hand pumped water into the kitchen.<br /> The barn, restored in 2004, is a steep roofed vertically planked structure with an imposing prow covering the barn's pulley, which was \"mostly used for raising hay into the hayloft.\" Treat bought the barn in the Detroit area. He had it disassembled, had each piece numbered, and had it shipped to the farm where he reassembled it on a concrete foundation which he poured.<br /> <br /> A concrete root cellar built into a hill is the smaller of two structures which show Treat's ongoing interest in working with reinforced concrete.<br /> <br /> There is a larger circular garage which Treat built using four-inch thick reinforced concrete wall, poured a bucket of concrete at a time. The roof was 2.5 inches thick made of reinforced concrete with a frame of heavy cedar and a hand set spiral network of steel bar for reinforcement.<br /> <br /> There are several other buildings including a woodshed and machine sheds for storing farm equipment.<br /> <br /> The Treat Farm was primarily a subsistence farm. They grew asparagus, beans, plums, apples, potatoes and raspberries among other plants, mostly for their own consumption. They raised corn and hay for animal feed. They maintained a small dairy herd and raised chickens as well, and despite the poor soil, continued farming into the 1930's.</p> <h3>Lake Overlook</h3> <p>After exploring the Treat Farm, hike through poplars and other unique foliage to the ridge above the water for a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan and the surrounding beach and dunes. Climb to the top of Old Baldy (you can't miss it) for a wide-open Lake Michigan view and an up-close-and-personal look at the Empire Bluffs immediately to the north.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Charles H. Treat Farm is situated at the end of a ½-mile-long trail that leads slightly uphill from the corner of Norconk Road through a portion of the maple-beech forest. The buildings still remaining at this farm include a 2-story gable-roofed farmhouse dating to around 1880, a barn, a concrete garage, a root cellar, a machine shed, and a chicken coop. The final approach to the farm is a wide grassy path running through a clearing flanked by low vegetation. The Treat farmhouse, which is clad in white clapboard, has a porch situated on its left side as you approach from the grassy path. A set of 4 concrete steps flanked by low concrete barrier walls on both sides leads up to the rightmost end of the porch, which is edged by a concrete kick wall on 2 sides. Supporting the porch's shed roof are 4 square white-painted pillars positioned atop the kick wall near the roof's front edge. The porch holds a picnic table with attached benches; you will encounter one end of this table a few feet to your left as you step onto the porch. Protruding from the house to the right of the porch, and tucked below a secondary gable on the main structure, is a 4-sided building appendage resembling a bay window with a foundation. At least 2 of the 4 windows on this appendage are boarded up while the others are covered by louvered shutters. Located about 4 feet from the rear of the house, and jutting up about 6 inches from the ground, is the round concrete cap of the farmhouse cistern. Placed atop this cap, which measures about 3 feet in diameter, is a wooden frame consisting of a flat board with a short leg on each end. Hanging from the nearby roof is a section of a metal gutter once used to drain rainwater into the cistern. Take care as you approach the cistern as the wooden frame, which is positioned perpendicular to the house, juts out several inches beyond the cap's edge. Two additional structures at the farm include a garage with a concrete dome roof and a rounded concrete root cellar built into the hill near the garage. The garage and the root cellar each have 2 wide metal doors with a single padlock in the center.",

The gender is undefined. This figure marks the grave of Marian “Clover” Hooper Adams (1843-1885) in Washington, DC. The piece by Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907) reflects a search for fundamental truths amid personal tragedy and a changing world.</h4> <br /> Marian “Clover” Hooper Adams was born to a prominent Boston family and married one of the remaining descendants of an American political dynasty. This member of elite social circles was known for her wit, intelligence, and athleticism. She became a skilled photographer. However, Adams also experienced the isolation of gender constraints by those around her. Henry Adams (1838-1918), her husband, was a sharp cultural critic and eclectic intellectual. In 1877, the couple moved to a home along Lafayette Square in Washington, DC.<br /> <br /> In 1885, Clover Adams died by suicide after suffering from depression. Henry Adams was inconsolable with grief, guilt, and the stigma of suicide. He hardly spoke of his late wife again and only broke his silence by commissioning this piece of art.<br /> <br /> In the wake of her death, Henry Adams traveled to Japan. There, he was drawn to Buddhist philosophy and iconography relating to Nirvana, a transcendent state beyond suffering. He requested that Augustus Saint-Gaudens express this philosophy in a memorial to his late wife. The sculptor noted in his sketchbook the phrases: “Adams – Buhda[sic] – Mental Repose – Calm reflection in contrast with the violence or force in nature.” In 1891, the finished work was installed near the gravesite in Rock Creek Cemetery. There is release and detachment in the figure’s expression, but there exists a palpable sorrow as well.<br /> <br /> The figure marked the grave of Marian Adams without depicting her likeness or stating her name. Saint-Gaudens referred to his work as “The Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding.” Henry Adams was adamant that the sculpture remains nameless. The timelessness and enigma of the personal memorial stood in opposition to the popular belief in progress and rationality during the Gilded Age. The artist “meant it to ask a question, not to give an answer,” Adams explained. This sculpture continues to be a source of contemplation for people of all backgrounds. “Like all great artists, St. Gaudens held up the mirror and no more.” This recasting was installed amongst the hedges in 1972.<br /> <br /> The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else.

            "audioDescription": "Audio Description (i.e., a Physical Description of the Location) We refer to this work as “The Adams Memorial”. It has also been called the “Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding.” Others have used the succinct title “Grief.” The artist is Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It is a bronze sculpture. The sculpture is 6 feet in height and mounted on a 10-inch-tall granite pedestal. A 7 feet tall and 5 feet wide granite slab stands just behind the bronze figure adding presence and weightiness to the work overall. As people approach this work, they’re immediately struck by the intense emotion and mystery that surrounds the figure. The heavy, hooded cloak falls across the figure’s lap and covers their legs and feet. The features of their face are obscured by the dark shadow of the hood. One arm is raised toward their face in a pensive gesture. As you come nearer, their features are clearer. Their eyes are cast downward, and their expression is marked by pain, resignation, and peace. Their facial features are notably androgenous. That’s because this figure is not meant to represent a human man or woman. Rather, the sculpture was intended to be an allegorical representation of a Nirvana-like afterlife, or as Saint-Gaudens put it, “The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding.”",

Unveiled in New York City’s Madison Square Park in 1881, the statue depicts Admiral David Glasgow Farragut (1801-1870) looking resolutely ahead. The Civil War commander stands in full naval uniform with feet apart. His coat billows open as if from a strong, salty gale while passersby may sit in the wide bench below to share the figure’s outward gaze.</h4> <br /> Augustus Saint-Gaudens’ first major public commission immediately received praise from the press and art critics. The realistic representation and care for dramatic detail brought a new energy to American public sculpture. While harnessing this naturalism, Saint-Gaudens crafted a stoic and idealized hero at the heart of the city. The artist also pioneered the integration of architecture, landscape design, and monumental sculpture to create a powerful setting for his work. The invitation to sit at the semi-circular bench, known as an exedra, was designed by the architect Stanford White (1853-1906) and carved in bluestone by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and his brother, Louis (1854-1913).<br /> <br /> Having finally received a large-scale commission, Augustus Saint-Gaudens married Augusta Homer (1848-1926) in 1877 after a five-year engagement. Shortly afterwards, the newlyweds worked together in a Paris studio where Augusta Saint-Gaudens contributed to the details of Admiral Farragut’s clothing. Though she would remain instrumental to her husband’s career and legacy, this was the only time she assisted in the physical process of sculpting. This piece would also be the first of many collaborations Saint-Gaudens undertook with longtime-friend, Stanford White.<br /> <br /> In 1934, the City of New York replaced the deteriorating bluestone base with a granite replica. The original base was relocated here in 1984 and topped with a recasting of the statue.",
            "audioDescription": "The title of the sculpture is the Farragut Monument. The artist is Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It is a bronze statue on an elaborate stone pedestal. This work depicts Admiral David Glasgow Farragut. The figure is eight feet, three inches tall. Admiral Farragut is wearing a long, double breasted overcoat as part of a naval uniform. One side appears to have been blown open by the wind. There is a sword in its sheath by his hip. He holds a pair of binoculars near the center of his body with his right hand. His left arm falls straight against his side. The elbow is only slightly bent and his fingers make a loose fist. His feet are spread wide as if to gain stability on the deck of a ship. The tip of his left foot hangs over the edge of the six-inch teared bronze platform atop the central pedestal. The words “PARIS 1879 1880 CAST BY ADOLPHE GRUET” are inscribed on the front face of the bronze platform. Admiral Farragut gazes ahead. His brows are slightly burrowed creating vertical wrinkles above his nose. He wears a tight military cap with an eagle insignia on the front. The tops of his ears are covered by patches of hair emerging from under the hat’s brim. The statue is installed on a central stone pedestal about 7 feet high. Wings extends from each side of the central pedestal about 8 feet and curve inward. There are three steps with small lips to reach a peddle-covered platform, also known as an exedra. A sweeping bench is built into each wing atop the platform. You are welcome to sit on the benches, touch the carved pedestal, and feel its elaborate designs. The pedestal is carved from Blue Stone. It is a greyish color with a slight blue tint. A rippling design is carved in the central pedestal below the feet of the bronze figure. An upward sword is carved on the viewer’s right. The words “David” and “Farragut” are visible in capital letters at the top of the pedestal. The stone has mostly deteriorated around what originally read “Glasgow.” There is a relief of a seated woman carved in each of the two wings. Their backs are to the central pedestal. Their stoic faces are turned towards the viewer and they wear long, flowing dresses. The chest of the figure to the viewer’s right is covered with loose armor. Her shoulders are bare. Her arms extend straight outward and rest on her knees. She represents Courage. The female figure on the opposite side of the central pedestal is seated in a similar pose. Her right arm extends straight away from her body while her left arm bends slightly more than ninety degrees at the elbow. The left lower arm is parallel to the right arm. Fabric appears to drape over her left shoulder and exposes her right breast. This allegorical figure represents Loyalty. Carved ornamental fish form the ends of the curved architectural wings. The creatures’ tails arch above their open mouths and form a curved edge inward. They are parallel to the front face of the central pedestal. Ripples surround the fish evoking waves in the ocean. There is text engraved on each wing. The lettering is elaborate but has deteriorated in some places. The text on the viewer’s left states: “THAT THE MEMORY OF A DARING AND SAGACIOUS COMMANDER AND GENTLE GREAT-SOULED MAN WHOSE LIFE FROM CHILDHOOD WAS GIVEN TO HIS COUNTRY BUT WHO SERVED HER SUPREMELY IN THE WAR FOR THE UNION 1860 -1865 MAY BE PRESERVED AND HONORED AND THAT THEY WHO COME AFTER HIM AND WHO WILL OWE HIM SO MUCH MAY SEE HIM AS HE WAS SEEN BY FRIEND AND FOE HIS COUNTRYMEN HAVE SET UP THIS MONUMENT AD 1881.” The text on the viewer’s right states: “BORN NEAR KNOXVILLE TENNESSEE JULY 5 1801 MID-SHIPMAN 1810 BATTLE OF ESSEX AND PHOEBE MARCH 28 1814 LIEUTENANT 1825 COMMANDER 1841 CAPTAIN 1855 BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS APRIL 25 1862 REAR ADMIRAL 1862 BATTLE OF MOBILE BAY AUGUST 5 1864 VICE ADMIRAL DECEMBER 23 1864 FIRST ADMIRAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JULY 26 1866 DIED AT PORTSMOUTH NEW HAMPSHIRE AUGUST 14 1870.”",

Further off to the south, the rounded dome of Navajo Mountain rises 80 miles distant. Within the boundary of the park, the tilted layers of Sinking Ship reveal the location of the Paunsaugunt fault. See the Geology section for more information. Nearly directly below the viewpoint, the park's most famous hoodoo, Thor's Hammer stands. It is perhaps best seen along the Two Bridges side of the Navajo Loop. To the south, the rim rises toward Inspiration and Bryce Points.

            "audioDescription": "Sunset Point and Sunset Point wayside 347 words<br /><br />Sunset Point offers vistas of some of the most famous and breathtaking of Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. A railing with metal posts and chain-link fencing surrounds the overlook. The Navajo Loop Trail descends from Sunset Point. Water and restrooms are in the vicinity.<br /><br />Directly below the point and to the south, rising from the canyon floor, a web of spired hoodoos and fins are packed in tight formation. Vibrant red, oranges, and yellows of the lower half of the cliffs change to white toward the top of the plateau. Just below the overlook at the northern edge, a hoodoo named Thor's Hammer stands alone. Isolated from other hoodoos it stands a very tall spire with a wide base that narrows toward the top where it seems as if a large rock were placed at the tip, resembling the head of a hammer. <br /><br />A panel at the overlook reads: <br />Sunset Point.<br />At the top of the panel a watercolor illustration labels points of interest in the distant landscape. From left to right: boat Mesa is 2 miles away sinking ship is 3 miles in the distance and the Aquarius plateau is 15 miles in the distance. Next the Canaan Mountain 21 miles, and far right, Kaiparewits Plateau 45 miles and Navajo Mountain 82 miles away.<br /><br />A color photograph below the illustration shows Sunset Point in winter. The hoodoo spires in the foreground are tipped with snow and the distant mesas and plateaus are snow-covered with only the greens of pine trees dotting the white landscape. Caption reads: water, ice and snow continue to carve the formations at Bryce Canyon.<br /><br />Another photograph shows clusters of icicles hanging from the underside of the red cliffs. A quote by Peter Farb from the Face of North America, 1963 is below the photograph, it reads:<br />\"...In this thirsty land, water has been the prime creator of scenery. Water formed these sedimentary rocks under ancient seas, and water sculpted them as they rose. Water carved the buttes and mesas, chiseled Bryce Canyon into every shape known.\"",

            "bodyText": "<p>Along the shoreline of Lands End are the ruins of the once mighty Sutro Baths, the public ocean water bathhouse envisioned and financed by Adolph Sutro in the late 1800s. Right on the beach, the ruins are an interesting place to wander about as the tide rolls in and out.</p> <h3>History of the Baths</h3> <p>Adolph Sutro, self-made millionaire, San Francisco mayor and all around entrepreneur, developed the lavish Sutro Baths in 1894. With his special interest in natural history and marine studies, he constructed an ocean pool aquarium among the rocks north of the Cliff House. Sutro then expanded his ocean front complex by constructing a massive public bathhouse that covered three acres and boasted impressive engineering and artistic details. Sutro's dream was to provide a healthy, recreational and inexpensive swimming facility for thousands of San Franciscans.<br /> <br /> The baths weren't just any swimming hole. Inside a massive glass enclosure were seven swimming pools kept at various temperatures, not to mention slides, trapezes, springboards and a high dive. During high tide, the Pacific Ocean could fill the 1.7 million gallons of water required for all the pools in one hour. The baths were capable of accommodating 10,000 people at once, offered 20,000 bathing suits and 40,000 towels for rent. But no flip flops.<br /> <br /> Also included at the baths was a cultural educational component that focused on natural history exhibits, sculptures, paintings, tapestries and artifacts from Mexico, China, Asia, and the Middle East, including Egyptian mummies. Sutro Baths was a venue for concerts, talent shows and restaurants. A railroad provided transportation to Lands End by the late 1890s, so a visit to Sutro Baths became a feasible family day trip.<br /> <br /> For all their glamour and excitement, the baths were not commercially successful over the long-term. They became less popular largely due to the Great Depression, the reduction in available public transportation and new public health codes. In attempts to make the facility profitable, the Baths were converted into an ice-skating rink, but it was not enough to maintain the enormous building. In 1964, a high-rise apartment development was proposed. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed the Baths in 1966, extinguishing an era of guild and glamour. The concrete ruins just north of the Cliff House are the remains of the grand Sutro Baths.</p> <h3>John Harris and the Dibble Civil Rights Act</h3> <p>4th of July, 1897. It's a scorcher in old San Fran. A group of friends decides to cool off by taking a trip out to Sutro Baths. After paying the entrance fee, San Francisco native John Harris is denied entry to the pools because he's black.<br /> <br /> Mr. Harris decided to sue Adolph Sutro. Mr. Harris brought his landmark case before the San Francisco Superior Court under California's Dibble Civil Rights Act of 1896, which declared: all citizens \"of every color or race whatsoever\" shall \"be entitled to the full and equal\" facilities of \"all places of public accommodation or amount.\" As usual, California was ahead of its time, seeing as how the Supreme Court made the reprehensible decision to uphold separate but equal segregation policy for public spaces in Plessy vs. Ferguson the year prior.<br /> <br /> The suit was successful, but personally for Mr. Harris, the victory was bittersweet. The amount he won in damages was insufficient even to cover his legal expenses. Furthermore, due to his vast wealth and the small amount of the fine, Mr. Sutro was able to continue his exclusionary practices at the baths. The case, however, did have an impact on the state at large, contributing to a wave of suits in the wake of Harris' success.</p>",

Sutro Heights in its modern form may not sport the grandiosity of the original garden, but the natural beauty and secluded locale are worth a visit.</p> <h3>Citizen Sutro</h3> <p>Born in Germany on April 29th, 1820, Adolph Heinrich Joseph Sutro grew up to embody the American immigrant dream. He arrived in California during the Gold Rush in 1850. He was well educated in the field of mining engineering and business, which proved to be far more profitable than panning for gold. Sutro made his fortune by devising and implementing a ventilation system that rid the silver-rich Comstock Lode mineshafts of water and gas by driving a tunnel through Mount Davidson.</p> <h3>Sutro in San Francisco</h3> <p>After his work in the silver mines, Sutro moved back to San Francisco where he invested heavily in coastal real estate. In 1881, he purchased 22 acres of undeveloped land, including a high vista overlooking the Cliff House and Seal Rocks. Sutro's land boasted some of the best views of the Pacific Ocean, Mount Tamalpais, and the Golden Gate. He built a mansion home on the grounds, and named the property Sutro Heights, a luxurious public garden that was open to all citizens. Although not it its full splendor, part of the mansion's foundation and the gardens remain.</p> <h3>Sutro Heights Back in the Day</h3> <p>San Fran Big-Timer Adolph Sutro was committed to sharing the wealth-specifically his wealth-with the citizens of San Francisco. In 1885, he commissioned 20 acres of hilltop land for a lavish garden, Sutro Heights Park, designed to showcase views of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate strait. Sutro spared no expense. The garden included observation decks, flower beds, forests, walkways, hedge mazes and parterres-a trendy European tradition of shaping bushes into figures-and 200 imported replicas of Greek and Roman statues.<br /> <br /> Sutro was a dreamer, and he always dreamed big. Sutro Heights was his imagined vision of European style superimposed onto an American landscape, a balance of refinement and natural ruggedness.</p>",

He supplemented the family’s income as a carpenter and part-time undertaker.</p> <p>With John away serving in the Confederate Army, Martha took the children to her sister’s farm on Stony Ridge during First Manassas.

Ten men had bled to death in mother’s bedroom the night before. Carpets and all furniture were out and gone…The old farm well in the back yard was full of everything that would go in it. Such as China ware, cooking utensils, flat irons, and everything you can imagine used by a family was thrown in it.

The structure is a two-story, whitewashed frame house with an attached lean-to on its south side. The northern half of the house is, most likely, a postwar addition to the wartime house. The house has one large central chimney and four symmetrical second-floor windows protruding above the roof. There are two doors on both the west and the east sides of the structure. Seven windows are found on the first floor. The Thornberry House is, in many ways, representative of the numerous middle-class residences occupying the area at the time of the Civil War.",

            "audioDescription": "This overlook faces east across a field to a line of trees. Above the trees are mountains in the distance. From the left the mountains visible are North Marshall, The Peak, Fork Mountain, and Oventop Mountain. Straight ahead, when two hills create a v-shape is Thornton Hollow. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Thornton Hollow Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. This graphic is split horizontally in two. The upper portion displays the title text, \"The Many Moods of an Overlook,\" with the quote below, \" â€˜No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.' Heraclitus of Ephesus, Greek philosopher.\" Behind this text is an image from an overlook of the sun rising over the mountains in the distance. The rays of the sun cover the landscape with warm fall colors. The lower portion of the graphic is layered on a warm gray transparent background. The body text reads, \"Changes in seasons, time of day, light, weather, and temperature - all of these changes and more affect what you see when you gaze out from any viewpoint in Shenandoah. You could stand in the exact same spot at different times of the year or at different times of day and never see the same thing twice. It's similar to how colored glass beads inside a kaleidoscope can never land in precisely the same arrangement twice; a view can never repeat itself because there will never again be the same combination of sunlight, humidity, temperature, precipitation, or fog there is in the one moment you stand here and take your picture, mental or real, of the landscape below.\" To the right of the text is a collage of six color photographs with thin white borders of the same overlook at different times of year and times of day. From the upper left is, a spring day with color staring to sprout on a tree in the foreground and yellow flowers popping up, a winter day with some snow on the ground and bare trees, a sunrise with fog forming an ocean on the mountains, a lush summer day with green everywhere, and lower, a sunset in winter with a deed red sun and dark mountains, and finally a fall sunrise with a pale colored sky and neutral autumn colors in the mountains. To the side of these images is the caption, \"One of the main reasons for creating Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive was so that you, the visitor, could take in scenic views and marvel at the landscapes spread out below you. Skyline Drive has nearly 70 overlooks and it leads to starting-off points for hikes to peaks and summits, all of which offer dramatic vistas.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

The trail begins 0.25 miles (0.4 km) north of Sunrise Point along the Rim Trail and is part of the larger 8 mile (12.9 km) Fairyland Loop. It descends steadily 1.5 miles (2.4 miles) into Campbell Canyon, reaching a 200 yard spur trail that leads to the Tower Bridge hoodoo. Hikers should then turn around and ascend back to the rim to complete the hike. Those looking for a strenuous hike can continue on along the Fairyland Loop.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/towerbridge.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Fairyland Loop Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 8.0 miles (12.9 km)<br /> Elevation change: 1,716 feet (523 m)<br /> Average time: 4-5 hours</strong><br /> Along the the Peekaboo Loop, the Fairyland Loop provides some of the best strenuous hiking in the park. It can be begun from either the Tower Bridge Trailhead or further notice at Fairyland Point (not accessible by vehicle in winter months). Spending 2.5 miles (4 km) along quiet ponderosa forests on the Rim Trail and the rest below surrounded by hoodoos within Fairyland and Campbell Canyons, it provides an excellent experience of the diversity above and below the rim. The trail can be hiked either clockwise or counter-clockwise, though many prefer the latter for the opportunity to descend rather than climb the Tower Bridge Trail section.<br /> Generally the trail traces a large circle centered on Boat Mesa, the large flat-topped feature capped with the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. This rock layer is one of the park's youngest, from a time after the freshwater lakes that would deposit the vibrant Claron Formation that forms the park's hoodoos had drained away, leaving large braided rivers that drained mountains to the north. <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fairylandloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p>Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.<br /> Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</p> <h2>I Hiked the Hoodoos</h2> <p>Hiking is great exercise and Bryce Canyon's \"I Hiked the Hoodoos!\" program is not just hiking, it's also a scavenger hunt with a special reward!<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Hike a minimum of 3 mi / 4.8 km, or find at least 3 benchmarks and complete steps 2 through 4 below.<br /> <br /> 2. Each individual must have either a pencil rubbing of the benchmark (see Jr. Ranger Book) or a\"selfie\"with the benchmark.<br /> <br /> 3. Only special \"I Hiked the Hoodoos\" benchmarks qualify for the reward.<br /> <br /> 4. Rewards are available at the Visitor Center!</strong><br /> <br /> See your park newspaper or Junior Ranger book for more information. Benchmarks are located on Mossy Cave, Rim Trail, Tower Bridge, Queen's Garden, Navajo Loop, Peekaboo Loop, Sheep Creek, and the Bristlecone Loop trails.</p>",

Their farm dates to the late 1850's or early 1860's and is the oldest maintained farm in the Port Oneida Historical District.<br /> <br /> Port Oneida was known as a close-knit community, but this doesn't mean the community didn't have its share of serious disagreements. Fifteen years after building their farmstead, the Werners were informed by their neighbor to the north, Thomas Kelderhouse, that their home was on the wrong side of the line. We don't know why the two men could not come to an easier agreement, but the Werners had to disassemble their hard-built home and farm and relocate 1/4 mile south to this location.<br /> <br /> In 1885, the Werner's son and daughter-in-law, Richard and Katie (Portner) Werner, were farming at this site. After Richard Werner's death in 1890, Katie married Benjamin Holland, who took over the farm. Ben was known for being very particular. \"He had the straightest corn rows in the area!\" By 1891, Frederick and Margaretta Werner had divided their parcel, ceding the northern 122 acres to their daughter and son-in-law, Mattie and John Miller.<br /> <br /> The Werners established a family cemetery atop the bluff along the lake that is believed to contain the five children who died here during the early years, as well as Frederick, Margretha, and others.<br /> <br /> Frederick and Margaretta Werner's great-grandson, Franklin Basch, was raised on the farm and purchased it in 1943. According to Franklin Basch, their farming activities ceased around 1930 because they were unable to produce adequate crops.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A paved driveway provides access to the Werner Farm, located on the west side of M-22 just west of the intersection with Thoreson Road. This farm is also close to the trailhead of the Bay View trail. The farm dates to the late 1850s or early 1860s. The first building you will encounter as you enter the property is a 2-story light blue-gray clapboard farmhouse with a red-shingled gable roof. On the left side of the facade, or the side closest to the driveway, is what appears to be an enclosed porch lined with several windows flanking a single entrance door. This wooden door, which is covered by an outer screen door, is painted dark bluish-gray, as is the wooden trim surrounding the house's many windows. Hugging the front of the house are several sizeable bushes and trees, including a tall leafy green tree rising like a wide column in front of the porch's front left corner. The top of this tree reaches high above the farmhouse roofline. Other buildings at the farm include a large weathered gray barn, a small white clapboard outhouse, a small stone garage with a red-shingled gable roof, as well as sheds and other outbuildings of various sizes. Flanking the driveway are two wooden poles, each about 5 to 6 feet tall, with 5 rows of metal fins spaced evenly below a top cover resembling an angled roof. These structures house yard lights. Jutting out of the ground to the side of one light pole is a cylindrical well pipe, about 1 foot tall. Take care to avoid these objects as they may present tripping hazards.",

Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>When available, hikers may reserve seats on the Rainbow Point Tour bus for transportation to Rainbow and Yovimpa Point. However, this service is seasonal in nature. Reservations and detailed information may be obtained by calling (435) 834-5290.</p>",

A You are Here arrow points to Whiteman Bench, very near the middle of the park. Panel content describes backcountry rules and campsites in the vicinity. Text continues: Bryce Canyon's Backcountry Bryce Canyon is best known for its hoodoos-bizarre pinnacles of rock left standing by the forces of erosion. Hoodoos are best experienced from the park's day hiking trails. By contrast, our backcountry trails offer forests, meadows, some interesting geologic features, lots of solitude, but few hoodoos. There are four backcountry Campsites in the area of Whiteman Bench: A color photograph for each of the four campgrounds shows A clearing in a forested area to set up camp.",

            "audioDescription": "Yellowstone River Picnic Area<br />745 words<br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (210 words)<br />You are standing in front of the first of two wayside exhibits located in Yellowstone River Picnic Area. The first wayside, entitled \"A Bear's Picnic,\" features three color photos of a bear searching for food, first digging a hole beside a downed log, then by ducking its head into the hole. Bands of melting snow dot the green grass surrounding the bear. Text to the right of the title tells us:<br /> \"All in a Day's Work. Hunting, digging, uprooting boulders and scouring logs...bears spend a lot of time foraging for edibles. Guided by a keen sense of smell and using their claws as tools, they eat plants and animals, large and small. Curious and intelligent, bears have an excellent memory for food sources and work hard for nourishment.<br /><br />\"These traits serve bears well when they eat a natural diet, but if bears obtain human food, they may aggressively search for more--putting you, others and the bear in grave danger. Never feed a bear!\"<br /><br />To the left of the photos is a drawing of a tree with short branches. A caption to the right of the tree reads:<br /><br />\"The whitebark pine is a long-lived, slow-growing tree of high elevation forests. The pine seeds provide a high-fat, high-energy food for bears.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (162 words)<br />Spanning across the bottom of the panel is a wide box with the subtitle \"What do bears eat?\" Text below the title reads: <br /><br />\"Spring:<br /><br />\"Winter-killed carcasses<br />\"Elk calves<br />\"Earthworms<br />\"Tender grass shoots<br />\"Clover<br />\"Dandelions<br />\"Ants<br />\"Pocket gophers<br />\"Summer:<br /><br />\"Elk and bison calves<br />\"Spawning cutthroat trout<br />\"Thistles<br />\"Fireweed<br />\"Mushrooms<br />\"Moths<br />\"Berries<br />\"Clover<br />\"Ants<br /><br /><br />\"Fall:<br /><br />\"Buffaloberries<br />\"Whortleberries<br />\"Whitebark pine seeds<br />\"Insect nests<br />\"Starchy tubers and roots<br />\"Rose hips<br />\"Mushrooms<br /><br />\"Winter:<br /><br />\"Both black and grizzly bears hibernate during the winter. They generally do not eat or drink during this time; instead, they live off a layer of fat built up during the summer and fall.\"<br /><br />Also in this text box are small photos of a brown wolf, a brown and beige speckled moth, and a rose hip, which resembles a small red berry. Two captions tell us:<br /><br />\"Bears also depend on wolf-killed bison and elk in spring, summer, and fall.<br /><br />\"Grizzly bears may eat up to 40,000 army cutworm moths a day in late summer.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (211 words)<br />The second wayside exhibit, entitled \"Bears Need Your Concern,\" features a large close-up color photo of a massive brown bear that appears to be looking straight at us. Text at the top of the wayside tells us: <br />\"Enjoy your picnic and remember...<br /><br />\"Bears need your concern, not your food!<br /><br />\"Bears become dangerous when they obtain human food. Stay safe--and help protect Yellowstone bears!\"<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two subtitles, each followed by instructions highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"If a bear approaches the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Make noise, bang pots, yell, or honk your car horn to alert the bear to your presence. <br /><br />\"If the bear continues toward the picnic area, take all of your food and trash, get into your car, and alert other people in the area of the bear's presence.<br /><br />\"If a bear enters the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Do not run!<br /><br />\"If the bear is not threatening you, take all of your food and trash and get into your car.<br /><br />\"If you do not have time to safely gather your food and garbage, get into your car without it.<br /><br />\"If the bear shows interest in the food on your table, honk your car horn. This may scare the bear away.<br /><br />\"If the bear approaches your car, drive away.\"<br /><br />Section 4 (136 words)<br /><br />Located at the bottom of the panel is a box with the subtitle \"Grizzly or Black Bear?\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Color can range from black to brown to cinnamon to blond for both grizzly and black bears. Grizzly bears frequently sport white-tipped fur, giving a grizzled, silver-tipped appearance.\"<br />To the left of this text is a drawing of a brown grizzly bear accompanied with the following labels: \"rump is usually lower than shoulders; hump at shoulder; dished-in face; long, straight claws.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a drawing of the smaller and darker black bear with these labels: \"Straight profile; rump is higher than shoulder; short, curved claws.\"<br /><br />One final message at the bottom of the panel instructs us: \"Report all bear encounters to the nearest Ranger Station or Visitor Center.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The top half of the panel features a large black and white photograph that fills the whole background of the panel. The bottom half of the panel has 3 columns. The first column has text and the next two columns each have a black and white photograph with a caption.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Behind this wayside is a flat, grassy area that leads up to a grass and shrub covered hill that the Wright Brothers Monument sits atop. To the right and left is a path that leads up to the top of the hill.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND IMAGE: A black and white photograph of 4 men carrying a glider up a sand dune. Two men are holding the gliders wings, while the other two are holding the front and read sections of the glider. A fifth man stands to the left of them in the image. He is wearing a dark suit and a hat. Waves are crashing into the shore in the distance behind the men.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Friends and surfmen from the nearby US Life-Saving Station helped the brothers carry their gliders up the dune.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Big Kill Devil Hill. When the Wright Brothers were here, Big Kill Devil Hill – the hill in front of you- was a massive sand dune. Thousands of times, the brothers trekked up this and three nearby dunes to conduct glider experiments.Climbing the hill was strenuous. Deep, soft sand caused every step up the slope to slip part-way back down. The Wrights were also burdened with carrying their heavy gliders up the hill for each flight. Their tireless efforts paid off as they mastered their flying skills and refined their flight controls.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph showing a glider with a pilot flying from the dune. The flyer is angled, as if turning. A big sand dune can be seen in the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Wrights mastered flight controls with their 1902 glider.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph showing a man pushing a plow behind a donkey. They are working on a sand dune. In the foreground is bunches of grass ready to be planted.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Starting in 1929, workers planted grass to stabilize Big Kill Devil Hill so the Wright Brothers Monument could be built on top.",

This site provides park visitors a dock, picnic tables, and a privy. The historic boathouse, cabins, ice house, and root cellar are open for exploration. The pilings for the trestles and railroad grade can also be seen.</p> <h4>History</h4>   <p><em>The Logging Era<br /> Camp 75</em><br /> <br /> In 1905 Edward Hines and the Weyerhaeuser family pooled their resources to create the Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company. The flag ship of the company was its sawmill in Virginia, Minnesota, which could process one million board feet of lumber a day.<br /> <br /> To transport logs to the sawmill before the days of modern logging technology, logs had to be floated down rivers and winched across lakes in giant booms by amphibious boats called gators. Hoist Bay, home of the Virginia and Rainy Lake Logging Camp 75, was one of these destinations.<br /> <br /> At Hoist Bay, a hoist machine lifted the logs out of the water and placed them on empty train cars for transportation. Pictured below is the railroad trestle and hoist built across the water. The train then transported the logs to Virginia, Minnesota to be cut into boards.<br /> <br /> Between 1913 and 1929 the camp in Hoist Bay operated for 16 years. In its lifetime, 13.5 million board feet of lumber entered its waters. By 1929 most of the white and red pine stands were cut; Camp 75 was shut down and dismantled, ending one part of the Hoist Bay story.<br /> <br /> <em>The Recreation Era<br /> Monson's Resort</em><br /> <br /> The Hoist Bay area lay dormant for almost 10 years, changing ownership 50 times, until 1939 when Ted and Fern Monson purchased the land, starting a new chapter in its history.<br /> <br /> When the Monsons arrived, there were few reminders of the previous logging era. The only remnants included the railroad trestle, an old root cellar, and a garbage dump.<br /> <br /> Between 1939 and 1945 the Monsons built 4 cabins; each cabin had 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. Modern amenities such as indoor bathrooms and electricity were added in the 1950s.<br /> <br /> In all, the Monsons built 14 buildings that were enjoyed by summer visitors, and they catered to their guests’ needs for 35 years only closing for 3 years during World War 2.<br /> <br /> Ted and Fern decided to sell the resort in 1973, and in 1978 the Hoist Bay land was acquired by the National Park Service. It was designated a point of interest for visitors, and a new chapter in the history of Hoist Bay began.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Hoist Bay is only accessible by water. Upon arriving into the bay, wood can be seen sticking up from out of the water from what was previously a railroad trestle. A boat dock is located to lead to a grouping of white buildings that once served as resort cabins. To the left of all the cabins near the woods is a wooden building that once was an ice house, where ice was stored before refrigeration.",

            "bodyText": "This small log structure was originally constructed by Conrad Kohrs sometime around 1880, to store blocks of winter ice. At that time there were no refrigerators on the ranch and perishable food items such as meat and dairy products were kept from spoiling by being stored inside the basement below or inside of an ice filled cabinet located in the ranch house. <br /> <br /> There were originally no windows in this room and the door was made of thick boards. The log walls acted like a natural insulator to keep the ice cold. Most winters the nearby Johnson Creek was turned into a pond and large blocks of ice were removed by hand or horse-drawn saws. Each block of ice weighed a few hundred pounds and several tons were stored in here each winter. The large blocks were then covered and surrounded by sawdust, which acted as an insulator between each layer and row.<br /> <br /> Just like a modern insulated cooler today, the ice did melt, but very slowly.  The floor was covered with an iron plating that was slightly higher in the front than the back. This kept melted water from soaking into the wood underneath and allowed the water to run down to an opening in the back of the building.  The ice usually lasted through the summer heat until the late fall when freezing temperatures returned to area.<br /> <br /> In the 1930’s Conrad Warren installed refrigeration in the ranch house and this building was converted into a tack room to repair and store the harnesses and other equipment needed to connect the teams of horses to wagons, buggies, and ranch machinery.  Today visitors can view some of the ranch’s historic bridles, harnesses, saddles, driving lines, and other tools on display inside of this building.",
            "audioDescription": "The icehouse is a one-story, square, log building with smaller extensions on the west and south elevations. The original portion is constructed on a stone full-basement foundation. The building is whitewashed with red trim. The walls are constructed with whitewashed logs. The gable roof runs east west and is covered with wood shingles over tongue-and-groove sheathing. The east elevation of the log component contains two glass windows. There is a centered, wooden, two-panel door that serves as the entrance to the building. The main floor of the original log building consists of one room finished with 1\" x 5\" wall and ceiling boards. The floor is reinforced wood boards covered with tin. Both the tin covering and the heavy floor joist evidence the historic ice-storage function. Blocks of ice weighing 200 to 300 pounds were stored in this main-floor room, insulated with sawdust. A nine-panel door provides access to the basement, where, historically, meat and dairy products were stored. The basement has a brick and mortar floor and stone walls. Between the west basement wall and the west addition are two windows. The west addition is finished with five-inch wall and ceiling boards and five-inch floorboards. Five-inch boards also cover the walls, ceiling, and floor of the south addition. Inside the room is a small work bench to the right of the entry way. On the bench are various tack and leather tools on display. Hanging on display against the walls and ceiling are numerous bridles, saddles, harnesses, and other tools as needed for working with horses and hooking them up to wagons and ranching equipment. In the middle of the room sits a small pot belly stove that connects to a chimney on the roof.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Hike into a mile-high valley featuring spectacular waterfalls surrounded by rolling ridges. This is a very popular area, so be prepared to share the trail with others.<br /> <br /> Graveyard Fields is an extremely popular hiking area. Easy trail access is from the Graveyard Fields Overlook at Milepost 418.8 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but the property is managed by Pisgah National Forest. Finding a parking spot on a weekend or during a busy time of year requires an early start to the day, a great deal of patience, or the willingness to park a significant distance away and walk on the road to the overlook. Signs on the roadsides clearly mark where motorists can and cannot park. Cars attempting to park in restricted areas have rolled over the edge down a steep embankment! Please do not put yourself or your family in danger. If the parking lot is full, visit one of the other hiking areas available along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Be sure to investigate your options before you embark on your journey.<br /> <br /> A sign at Graveyard Fields explains one theory behind its strange name. Many years ago, a windstorm uprooted the forest, leaving behind stumps that gave the area the appearance of a graveyard. Other theories include that logging in the early 20th century, prior to the area being under management of the US Forest Service, left tree stumps covered in moss resembling gravestones. Later, the Graveyard Fields area burned, destroying the stumps.<br /> <br /> The headwaters of the Yellowstone Prong, a tributary of the Pigeon River, originate in the mile-high valley. The two waterfalls in the Graveyard Fields area are accessible from the trailhead near the vault toilets in the overlook on the Parkway. The trail descends steps that give way to an asphalt path, necessary due to the amount of use the area receives. Many parts of the trail beyond the asphalt portion have been worn into deep ruts which are often muddy due to the frequency of precipitation. A trail map is available in the overlook parking lot. Familiarize yourself with the general loop trail prior to hiking. “Social trails” (or illegal trails) have been created over the years, which can make navigating confusing. Please do not compound this problem by going off the established trails. The 1.2-mile loop trail is rated as easy overall, however the “spur” trails to the waterfalls are steep and add additional mileage to the hike. Climbing on and near waterfalls is dangerous. Rocks near waterfalls are notoriously slippery.<br /> <br /> If you don't mind crowds, Graveyard Fields is an appealing hiking area for a variety of reasons. The Graveyard Fields Loop Trail is a reasonable hiking distance for families, including children, and includes waterfalls. It offers a variety of different plants, shrubs, and trees, as well as bird and wildlife diversity for natural history buffs. The trail connects to other trails in the valley and beyond, allowing further exploration for those who want a longer hike.<br /> <br /> Camping is not allowed in the Graveyard Fields area. During the season, the nearest National Park Service campground is located at Mount Pisgah. Dispersed camping is allowed nearby at Black Balsam and in the Shining Rock Wilderness. Contact <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=48260&actid=34\">Pisgah National Forest</a> for camping information and regulations. During the winter season, the Blue Ridge Parkway may be closed in this area due to ice and snow.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Graveyard Fields is a picturesque high elevation valley with two scenic waterfalls. A parking overlook provides access to a loop trail. The paved parking lot curves off of the main road. On the right of the parking lot, a small stone building has vault toilets, which are open spring through fall. The parking area has a paved, level sidewalk on the side of the lot that is farthest from the roadway. The trailhead for the loop trail can be accessed from the parking area. The trail is steep and has numerous steps. The natural surface is uneven and is muddy for a large portion of the year. The trail winds through rhododendrons, mature trees, grassy areas, and stream corridors. The valley is surrounded by rolling mountains.",

Officially named the Middle Mountains, locally this range is called the Seven Sisters. These seven individual “sister” peaks ascend from 3,680 feet to 5,260 feet and culminate in the area’s “father” highpoint, Graybeard Mountain.<br /> <br /> Graybeard Mountain is often draped in clouds with just its peak exposed, giving it the look of a “gray beard” covering the mountain. Access to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail in both north and south directions is available from this overlook.</p>",

The views from the overlook were used by Hollywood for the opening shot in the film. <br /> <br /> Located at approximately milepost 350.3 on the Blue Ridge Parkway, the overlook takes its name from the mountain whose rocky face is located across the parkway. Enjoy spectacular views into the valleys created by the headwaters of the Catawba River. Views to the southwest offer waves of ridges and valleys that continue into the distance. To the southeast, Lake James looks like small puddles nestled among surrounding distant ridges, and the southern end of Linville Gorge offers its last rocky exposure before disappearing into Lake James and the Catawba River Valley. <br /> <br /> The overlook also serves as a trailhead for two United States Forest Service Trails: Green Knob Trail and Snook’s Nose. The Green Knob Trail (FS182) will take you to the fire tower and then connects to the Lost Cove Trail (FS182) which descends to the Black Mountain Campground located on the South Toe River. Snook’s Nose (FS211) descends into the Curtis Creek valley. ",

Directly across the parkway the rocky face of the knob for which this overlook gets its name rises upward. The Green Knob Trail (FS182) has access 0.1 mile north from the northern overlook entrance. It is marked with a white diamond and carsonite sign designating the trail. The forested area is mixed hardwood with occasional pockets of rhododendrons and firs.",

It is the oldest American Civil War monument still standing in its original battlefield location.<br /> <br /> Col. William B. Hazen's brigade played a central role in the fighting at the Round Forest on the first day of the Battle of Stones River. Hazen's men held their position between the Nashville Pike and the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad through four Confederate attacks. The brigade's determined resistance ended the advance of the Confederate Army of Tennessee and kept it from pushing the Union Army of the Cumberland back to Nashville.<br /> <br /> After the battle, Hazen and Col. Isaac C. B. Suman, 9th Indiana Volunteers, felt there was a need for a monument to honor the soldiers who died at Stones River. Lt. Edward Crebbin, Company F, 9th Indiana, led a detail of soldiers who built the monument between June and October 1863.  They placed the monument in the midst of the 55 soldiers buried in the brigade cemetery. In 1864, two soldiers from the 115th Ohio Infantry carved the inscriptions on the monument.<br /> <br /> Two other monuments appeared on battlefields prior to 1863. A monument commemorating the death of Col. Francis S. Bartow at the First Battle of Manssas was destroyed during the second battle on that site. The 32nd Indiana Monument originally marked the site of the Battle of Rowlett's Station (December 17, 1861). It was later moved to Cave Hill National Cemetery and is now located at the Frasier International History Museum in Louisville, Kentucky.<br /> <br />  </p>",

            "audioDescription": "A parking area and an overlook sit next to the park road. The overlook, on a small wooden platform, offers panoramic views of the Craters of the Moon landscape. Immediately on the right is Inferno Cone, a tall, barren black cone. A faint trail leads 164 feet up the steep side of the cone. The top of Inferno Cone offers 360-degree views of the park. A wayside exhibit on the viewing platform is divided into two small panels on either side of a very long panel with a panoramic photo of the view in front of us, with labelled landmarks. The left panel reads: “Round Knoll Kipuka. The same searing lava flows that destroyed everything in their path, today protect some of the last remaining islands of natural sagebrush steppe vegetation on the Snake River Plain. These features are called kipukas, a variation of the Hawaiian term puka that means hole. Kipukas show scientists what native plant communities looked like before grazing livestock and non-native plants changed them. They also provide important baseline data for monument staff in their work to protect and restore native vegetation.” The right panel reads: “Inferno Cone. Cinder Cones form when gas-rich volcanic froth erupts high into the air and then piles into a mound. Climb Inferno Cone, if you wish, but don’t be disappointed if you are unable to locate the source of the eruption at the top. These cinders were actually blown by the wind, and possibly squirted in this direction, from a vent far below near the Spatter Cones parking lot.”",

The grey shingled roof angles up steeply from all sides, reaching a small square plateau in the center. Gabled second-floor windows stick out from the roofline on the left and right sides. Grey shingles also cover the wide front porch, which is supported by four thin carved wooden columns. A white post-and-rail fence about four feet high surrounds the home. A sign five inches wide by 12 inches tall hangs on the gatepost. Beneath the title \"Varney House “, the image of the sprawling house shows a leafy tree standing at the entryway, a covered porch. A caption reads: \"Varney House circa 1930.\" Text beneath the image reads: \"Hannah Varney built this house in 1899 after divorcing her husband.

Directly behind the kiosk, a 3-foot-wide, concrete sidewalk stretches 50 feet away from you to a restroom with a pit toilet. In between the information kiosk and the toilet are two picnic tables, adjacent to the sidewalk on the grass and dirt areas. As the tables are not anchored, their exact location may change. Beyond the pit toilet are pine trees and cliffs of dark rock several hundred feet high. 150 feet to your right is the boat ramp and beach. The boat ramp is concrete, 20-feet-wide, and extends to the water line. The beach is sandy and stretches as far as you can see, and the water level varies by season. The lake is approximately a mile wide and the opposite shore contains bare, gently sloping hills with occasional steep cliffs of grey rock. Behind you, the parking lot extends for another 300 feet, before becoming grass with scattered pine trees. Left from the information kiosk is the entrance into the paved parking lot, beyond which is the paved entrance road, a neighborhood, and more tall, dark cliffs withs scattered trees.",

Visitors are welcome to enjoy a shore lunch while immersing themselves in Voyageurs’ fishing history. Peek into the ice house, relax, watch for birds, and enjoy Harry Oveson’s life on Rainy Lake. <br /> <br /> Harry Oveson was born in 1906 in Roseau, Minnesota and moved with his family, in 1921, to International Falls. In his youth, he worked at many different jobs; from his father’s bait and tackle shop to the local lumber mill. During the Great Depression, Harry engaged in train hopping to travel across America. During World War II, Harry served in the U.S. Army stationed in Alaska. In 1959, he settled on Rainy Lake to build his fish camp.<br /> <br /> In a typical day, Harry would rise before dawn and often see the sun come up from his front window. By 6:00 am he headed out on his 16-foot Alumacraft boat to lift his nets, remove the fish, and reset the nets for the next morning’s catch. At 10:00 am he would be back at the fish house to prepare and pack the fish. He removed the entrails of the whitefish, but the walleye could be packed whole. His catch of the day would be packaged in fish boxes and put on crushed ice for transport. A good day’s catch would produce around 300 lbs. of whitefish and 50 lbs. of walleye. As a bachelor, he was content with his dog Goofball and the various birds that frequented his North Woods haven. Quiet evenings and dark skys made for excellent reading and star gazing, two of Harry’s other interests.</p>",

The top half of the panel features an aerial view of this area showing the entrance road winding its way from the highway at the right into the heart of the dunes at the left, where it makes a loop. Labels at the top identify the changing landscape from the brown-colored Chihuahuan desert at the right, through a changing innerdunal zone, where the brown shows streaks of white, into the heart of the dunes which is totally white. A label marks your current location about half way between the edge of the desert and the loop at the end of the road. Across the middle of the panel is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “You are entering a rare wonder. Explore this white world of gypsum sand.” The bottom part of the panel shows an elevated view of the white dunes stretching towards the mountains along the horizon. Two hot air ballons hover near the ground, one dark blue, the other a light grey. Smaller inset photographs highlight activities in the dune. One at the left side, labeled “Explore,” shows two women with backpacks following a trail of footsteps through the white landscape. In the middle, another picture shows two men and a woman, lying side by side in the sand, looking out at us. The label says, “Connect.” To the right of that is a picture of an open hand, covered with sand. The label reads, “Feel.” At the right is a picture of a young boy sliding down a slope in a green, plastic sled, bare feet raised high. The label reads, “Play.” More text reads, “White Sands offers you an other-worldly experience like no other place on the planet.

            "bodyText": "<h4><b>Preserving a Lighthouse and its Stories</b></h4> <p>More than a century of exposure to the harsh Lake Superior environment took its toll on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=39A46A6F-DF79-416C-A1D8-17C71F6F3249\">Miskominikaani-minis</a> (Raspberry Island) Lighthouse. The roof leaked, the foundation was cracked, clapboards were rotting, and plaster was falling down. Other buildings near the lighthouse had similar problems. The light station known as the \"showplace of the Apostles\" needed substantial restoration to ensure sustainability. A major project began in 2002 to stabilize the shoreline and rehabilitate the property to preserve its historical, architectural, and cultural significance. The historic keeper's quarters now looks much like it did (inside and out) in the early 1920s. Maintaining the light station's historic buildings and grounds is a continuous challenge for National Park Service staff. A small dock below the lighthouse is available for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">boaters</a> visiting the island on a first come first serve basis. </p> <h4><strong>Lighthouse History</strong></h4> <p>The Raspberry Island light was first lit in July of 1863 to serve as a beacon to many steamboats traveling through the west channel of the Apostle Islands. The original structure was a single family dwelling surmounted by a square tower. A brick fog signal building was added to the station in 1903, creating a need for additional staff. In 1906 the original lighthouse was rebuilt into a duplex at a cost of $7500 to house the head lighthouse keeper and his two assistants! The duplex structure is the building we see at Raspberry Island today. </p> <h4><b>Keeping the Lighthouse</b></h4> <p>When lighthouse keepers lived at the lighthouse, they regularly maintained the buildings and grounds. Note these entries from the lighthouse logbook in May 1915:</p> <blockquote> <p>5/3 - Washing walls interior and working in signal.<br /> 5/4 - Cleaning in signal & mowing the lawn. <br /> 5/5 - Painting on the dwelling this forenoon.<br /> 5/11 - Painting on dwelling & out houses.<br /> 5/12 - Painting boat house, trimmings on fog signal and other work. <br /> 5/13 - Painting in signal and railing to dock. <br /> 5/18 - Painting outside and inside of lantern, also verandah floors. </p> </blockquote> <p>This attention to regular maintenance ended when the Coast Guard automated the station in 1947. </p> <h4><strong>Lighthouse Rehabilitation</strong></h4> <p>Raspberry Island Light is the national lakeshore's most visited lighthouse, hosting thousands of people each year. In order to preserve the station, a $1.4 million shoreline stabilization project in 2002 and 2003 provided rock walls, better drainage, and a re-vegetated slope to keep the fog signal building and lighthouse from sliding into the lake. A $1.3 million project to rehabilitate the lighthouse and keeper's quarters followed from 2005 to 2007. This work included foundation repairs, a new roof, restored windows and doors, and repairs to interior and exterior walls. The National Park Service fights a never-ending battle with the harsh environment to maintain all these historic buildings. </p> <h4><strong>Recycling the Past</strong></h4> <p>How can we keep alive the stories of the keepers and explain their connections to the broader community they served? Once the lighthouse was rehabilitated, the National Park Service refurnished the lighthouse keeper's quarters as it may have been in the early 1920s. This helps park rangers tell the keepers' stories so visitors can better understand what life was like for the keepers and their families. Ongoing station rehabilitation efforts include grounds and other buildings and associated structures like the flagpole, swing, and birdhouses. Dedicated volunteers and park staff help plant and maintain the flower and vegetable gardens that historically, were such an important part of the light station's landscape. <a href=\"https://friendsoftheapostleislands.org/\">The Friends of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore</a><strong> </strong>assisted restoration efforts and spearheaded the rehabilitation of the Raspberry Island boat house. Please contact them at PO Box 1574, Bayfield, WI. 54814 if you wish to contribute to this effort. <br /> <br /> Saving a lighthouse is recycling the past. It connects us to the past and helps form a bridge to the future. Anthropologists Mary Catherine Bateson wrote: \"The past empowers the present...\"</p> <p>Recycling our past is reviving it to the present...bringing history back to life! Rehabilitation of Raspberry Island Light Station is the ultimate recycling project. </p> <h4><strong>Trails</strong></h4> <p>There are two <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking trails</a> located on the island. The Sand spit Trail is 0.75 miles long and connects the East Bay sand spit up the lighthouse. The West Bay trail is 1.0 miles long and starts at the lighthouse and winds around down to the West Bay. </p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",

En esta sala impresionante, los indígenas y colonos españoles rezaban y celebraban la misa todos los días. No había bancos. La gente se arrodillaba o se paraba durante los servicios. A lo largo de las paredes hay cuatro altares laterales donde se podrían colocar velas devocionales. En las paredes hay nichos donde estuvieron situadas estatuas vistosas de santos.<br /> <br /> A lo largo de las paredes interiores, la deterioración y el desgate debido al clima ha expuesto los ladrillos de adobe, los cuales fueron hechos por los residentes de la misión. Las paredes estaban pintadas de colores brillantes. Fueron decoradas por las manos firmes de artesanos indígenas y españoles.<br /> <br /> Con el amanecer del sol, las familias y las personas que vivían en la misión se dirigían a la nave para reunirse y comenzar el día. Es probable que hombres y mujeres fueron separados por sexos, la cual fue una costumbre de la época colonial. Aquí, los indígenas aprendieron y practicaron nuevas tradiciones religiosas en nuevos idiomas. Adoptaron un nuevo dios y establecieron una nueva perspectiva mundial bajo la dirección de los padres. En este espacio hubo lágrimas tanto de alegría como de tristeza. Hubo pérdida, celebración, aprendizaje y cambio.<br /> <br /> Poco después de que los residentes se fueran en 1848, los colonos locales se llevaron las vigas del techo para usarlos en otro lugar. Durante los siguientes setenta años, la nave estuvo expuesta y fue dañada por el clima. Los saqueadores, en busca de un tesoro jesuita que nunca existió, escarbaron agujeros en las paredes y los pisos.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "As you walk into the main church entrance down the entrance ramp, you enter the Nave. This is the long, narrow body, or main corridor of the church measuring about 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width. A narrow, arched adobe brick doorway rises to the right, leading through a vaulted tunnel to the baptistry. Near the arched main entrance to the church, there are two columns, one on each side of the nave, that rise from the floor to about 10 feet in height, now diminished to adobe ruin. Two more columns, closer to the front of the church, can be seen on each side of the Nave rising to the ceiling from a tapered decorative base about 10 feet above the floor. Each column holds a tall, narrow niche with a corbel or statuary shelf, which is now empty. The floor of the nave is made of burnished, dark red bricks. Two side altars line each wall of the nave along the length of the room. Each of these altars is now a rectangular mound of adobe brick ruins, rising from the floor to varying heights between a few inches off the floor to about 4 feet, and protected from visitors by stanchions made of wooden posts laced with thick rope. Tall, narrow arched statue niches are recessed into the walls above the altars. A few colonial style, unadorned, dark wooden benches line the walls between the altars. The walls are made of exposed, time-worn adobe bricks that are grey-brown in color. In some places along the walls, especially on the upper portions, a whitish, age-stained plaster coating covers the aged bricks in large irregular shapes, having fallen off or been damaged over the course of centuries. On both sides of the nave, there are many uneven holes in the walls, some fist-sized and some much larger, resulting from weathering, vandals, and treasure hunters from previous centuries. Light enters in a stream from a window above the main entrance door to the church, and from a window on the eastern wall about 30 feet in front of the entrance. The long, narrow space of the nave leads the visitor's sight forward to the south end of the church, the sanctuary, which rises at the top of 5 adobe brick stairs at the front of church. The stairs are covered by an arched entrance and flanked on the right side of the nave by the simple reconstructed base of the pulpit, protruding from the wall as an inverted triangular structure about 4 feet off the floor.",

This range is often overlooked due to being flanked by the taller Great Smoky Mountains to the north and the Great Balsams to the south. But seasoned Parkway visitors know that some of the best views can be seen from the Plott Balsams. Waterrock Knob (6,292 feet) is the highest peak in the Plott Balsam Range, while Waterrock Knob Visitor Center, at 5,820 feet, is the highest-elevation center along the Parkway.</p>",

Resacas are former channels of the Rio Grande. As the Rio Grande has shifted its position over time, it leaves these resaca beds behind. In their natural state, resacas are dry and then fill up during times of heavy rainfall. Some of the larger resacas can hold water for several days or even weeks after a heavy rain. They do not have a natural connection to the Rio Grande. It is through the pumping of water from the Rio Grande that they have any water flow. Resacas, like this one, are filled with a variety of wildlife including Alligator Gar, Texas spiny soft-shell turtles, and egrets.</p>",

According to legend, when travelers approached with questions about accommodations, he would only point to his wife and say, \"She boss.\"<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are no remnants of Sheboss Stand visible at the site and exact location of the house is unknown.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/trail-of-tears-benge-route-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Benge Detachment</a> of Cherokee people on the Trail of Tears passed this location on an unimproved path into Hickman County Tennessee in late 1838.

            "bodyText": "<h4>Hiking, Camping, and Boating</h4> <p>The Apostle Islands have a complex human history that is an integral part of the natural landscape. Sand Island <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=D229E630-D7FC-4D1A-8E75-BA6147231A07\">Waabaabikaa-minis</a> is an outstanding place to view the return of wild nature to lands that have experienced many complex and changing human uses. Second growth forests, old farm clearings, foundations, and existing structures all tell stories about the people who used and continue to use Sand Island. Today’s visitors experience these stories in several ways. A two-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm#CP_JUMP_6932928\">trail </a>connects the camp sites at East Bay with the Sand Island Lighthouse. A half mile north of East Bay the trail passes through an overgrown field (part of Hansen farm). Justice Bay and a view of the Swallow Point sea caves are found at the trail’s midpoint. A mile and a half north of the camp sites, the trail passes through an area of virgin white pines. These 250-year-old trees were protected within a lighthouse reservation. An overlook with a panoramic view of Lighthouse Bay is a quarter mile south of the lighthouse. A second trail begins at the East Bay camp sites and leads west for one third of a mile to a farm site once occupied by the Noring family. The site contains historic farm equipment and remnants of buildings. Beware of the old well located among the ruins.<br /> <br /> A steel L-shaped <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">dock</a> is available for public use in East Bay. Docks at the west side and southeastern tip of the islands are for private use. Please avoid using these docks. A rock shelf near the lighthouse is fitted with mooring cleats. Submerged rocks make extreme caution necessary when using this landing. Boats often anchor at East Bay, Justice Bay, and Lighthouse Bay, depending on wind conditions. Visitors exploring the sea caves in sea kayaks or small boats should note <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">weather conditions</a> and use caution.<br /> <br /> Insects and mud can reduce your enjoyment of Sand Island. Long-sleeved shirts, long pants, hiking or waterproof boots, and insect repellent are recommended. Black bears inhabit the island. Campers, kayakers, and boaters should take precautions to store food properly. Keep campsites and dock areas clean to avoid unwelcome guests. Pack out whatever you pack in. Help us preserve the island’s outstanding natural and historic resources while honoring the privacy of its remaining summer residents.</p> <h4>Sand Island History</h4> <p>In 1881, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/sand-light.htm\">Sand Island Lighthouse</a> was built to help guide ships to western Lake Superior ports. Some of these ships carried lumber, brownstone, and fish from the Apostle Islands to large cities on the lower lakes. The ships also carried passengers from around the globe to help settle the region. By 1918, Sand Island supported a population of more than 100 people. The majority of these were Norwegian immigrants who farmed and fished for a living. The stories of long time Sand Island residents offer interesting glimpses of life on the Apostle Islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>Emmanuel Luick </strong><br /> Emmanuel Luick was the Sand Island lighthouse keeper from 1892 to 1921. “Sand Island was just like home,\" according to Luick. “There we felt free with the wind and the sun and plenty of open spaces.” In 1896, Luick married 16-year-old Ella Richardson (he was 29). Despite her youth, Ella inspired confidence in her abilities. She was frequently left in charge of the station for days at a time while her husband went to the mainland for supplies. The marriage did not last, however. On May 19, 1905, the keepers log indicated that “Mrs. Ella Luick left for Bayfield on the steamer Barker at 6PM.” She never returned to the island.<br /> <br /> Another disaster affected keeper Luick on September 2, 1905. “The storm that sunk the Sevona was one of the worst… She was on ore carrier on her way down the lake with a load of granular ore, and ran into the storm 20 miles below Outer Island. After battling the dense fog, wind and rain for hours she was forced to turn back…they tried to make York Island and were grounded on the reef with seven lives lost.”<br /> <br /> “In 1911, I married a girl from Iron River and took her to live at the lighthouse,” said Luick. “She was lonesome at times but when the children came, she was kept busy enough.” He and his wife, Oramill, had four children, but only two survived infancy. Mrs. Luick remembered that, “My only neighbors were the wives of fisherman, but we stuck together. We organized a sewing circle…We met twice a month at each other’s houses, and got up nice little parties, besides…When you live for years with just a handful of neighbors, you remember them all your life… Some of the fishermen’s wives raised garden stuff, and a little fruit. We went three and a half miles for our milk, every other day.” Emmanuel Luick was transferred to the Grand Marais, Minnesota light when Sand Island was automated in 1921. He retired there in 1936.<br /> <br /> <strong>Burt Hill</strong><br /> Burt Hill lived on Sand Island from 1910 to 1941. In 1896, he married Anna Mae Shaw, daughter of Sand Island’s first European settler. When Anna Mae’s father, Francis, retired from farming, the Hills left their home in Ashland to take over Mr. Shaw’s island farm. “Early in 1911 I had made application for a Post Office to be established on the island which was granted and named Shaw, in honor or Mr. Francis W. Shaw,” recalled Hill. “On June 20, 1911, I received my appointment as postmaster and I opened an office. It was no trouble to get the mail carried during the summer months while the boats were running… But it was during the winter months that it was a hardship to get the mail in and out… We endured these hardships for five years, until May 15, 1916 when the Post Office was discontinued.”<br /> <br /> “On June 15, 1918, all of the residents of the island gathered at the schoolhouse for the purpose of organizing a cooperative association and starting a store. The move was unanimously adopted, and a store was opened up July 19, 1918. It was given the name of the Sand Island Co-Operative Association. Fred Hansen was elected President… and I was its manager and secretary, which office I held until the association closed up. My salary was a commission of 5 percent of the sales and added up to between $80 and $100 a year.” Burt and Anna Mae Hill maintained their island home until poor health forced them to move to the mainland in 1941. They were among the last full-time residents on the island. Today, several cabins on the island’s southeast corner are still privately occupied. Please respect the privacy of these summer residents as you explore the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fred Hansen</strong><br /> Fred Hansen was a young boy when his parents emigrated from Norway to Sand Island in the 1890's. In 1913, at the age of 28, he began keeping a diary of his daily activities. His concise entries illustrate a way of life that changed little over a 25 year period. </p> <blockquote> <p>June 1913<br /> 2 Lifted. (Gill nets).<br /> 3 Lifted. Through with plowing and seeding.<br /> 5 Lifted. Had birthday party in evening - everyone had a good time. <br /> 15 Got up at 3 - went over to Brownstone (Devils Island) and trolled; caught 9 fish. A fine day. <br /> 16 Lifted. The price raised to 7 cents (per pound). <br /> 17 Stormy. Built hog pen and planted rutabagas. <br /> <br /> July 1913<br /> 4 Went to Light on a picnic in morning. Dance in eve. <br /> <br /> December 1913<br /> 22 Mended nets. I and Herman Johnson went to Shaws in eve and played cards. <br /> 23 Hunted Christmas tree in AM. Swamped in PM. Hills spend evening here played whist. <br /> 25 Spent a very quiet Christmas at home. <br /> 26 I and Noring cut wood. At schoolhouse in evening-program. <br />  </p> </blockquote> <p><br />  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Sand Island is located four miles from Little Sand Bay on the western edge of the Apostle Island archipelago in Lake Superior. There are four miles of hiking trails through forested areas and six campsites available with a picnic table, fire ring, and metal food storage locker. There is a total of 9.7 miles of shoreline which consists of a mixture of sandy beach, sandstone rock ledges, clay banks, and cobble beaches with boulders. On the northern tip of the island there is a staircase leading up to a stone lighthouse on the edge of the lake that was built in 1881. The light was later automated in 1921. Two of the campsites in East Bay are accessible by boardwalk. Vault toilets are available by campsites 1-6 and there is a small dock for boaters in East Bay. The northeastern shoreline of Sand Island has sandstone sea caves that are accessible by kayak.",

            "audioDescription": "The Overall Run Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken of a view of the vivid green of the Wilderness, the blue-green of the mountains, and the powder blue of the sky with a line of white clouds bisecting the tranquil scene. The text reads, \"Border Crossing: To reach Overall Run Falls, you cross an invisible boundary into Wilderness. You will find all the things you expect to see in the woods: green plants, elusive animals, and water tumbling free over rocks and roots. You won't find many things built by human hands, such as campgrounds and roads. This is by design: Wilderness is specially designated land that is kept free of development to always be wild and natural. Such designation protects the ecosystem and provides enjoyment for those who wish to enter. Wilderness's primeval character offers you physical and mental challenges, solitude, and refreshment.\" \"Standing on the ledge above Overall Run Falls, you are surrounded by Wilderness. You won't hear much of anything except for the roar of the falls, the croak of the raven, and a breeze in the leaves. You delight in the journey that brought you here and the simplicity of nature. This is the Wilderness experience.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of 2 hikes: one to Overall Run Falls. That trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Overall Run Falls; 6.1 mile round trip, moderately strenuous, 4.75 hours hiking time, 1,694-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail south. Turn right on Tuscarora-Overall Run Trail. Follow the trail to a rock viewpoint from which Overall Run Falls is visible. Retrace your steps to return to the starting point.\" \"Hike #2: (The shorter round trip trail is marked in purple on the map.) Appalachian Trail North: 0.5 mile round trip, easiest, 0.5 hour hiking time, 114-foot elevation gain. Leave the parking lot from the south end and follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north across the Skyline Drive. Continue on the A.T. north to the vista. Retrace your steps to return to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. ~ Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per. Pets must be on a leash at all times.

Southside Park represents an element of early 20th Century urban planning within the city of Sacramento. Following the model of mid-19th century Park Movement neighborhoods, the park was created to encourage adjacent residential construction in a portion of Sacramento. The park was designed by architect Rudolf Herold and city engineer George Randle. The result was a twenty-acre expanse of trees, lawns, paths and recreational facilities completed in 1913. By the 1920s, Southside was already a multicultural neighborhood, a natural expansion of the diverse West End to the north, and neighborhood residents sometimes called Southside the “League of Nations.” Originally occupying eight city blocks, the park was constructed on the site of a former slough in order to facilitate a large pond in the park’s center. The park retains sufficient historic integrity and demonstrate its role in city planning, and its subsequent role as community gathering space for celebration and recreation through the 20th century.",

Dogs are predators that can chase, scare and transmit diseases to local wildlife. Even their lingering scent can disrupt an animals’ natural movement and behavior. In such a harsh desert environment, expending energy in this way threatens the survival of species that the park aims to protect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pets can disturb or destroy natural resources, such as native plants and fragile desert soils. Sensitive cultural and archeological sites may be inadvertently damaged by inquisitive pets.</p> </li> <li> <p>The safety of your pet should be a top priority. Canyonlands is a harsh desert environment with many hazards, including sharp rocks, cliff edges, rattlesnakes and scorpions that can harm your pet. Dogs can easily become the hunted.

The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge’s multi-modal design is a direct example of the mindset of commuters during the 1930s. Constructed in 1936, the bridge was used to support the increase of automobiles and public transit lines in the early half of the 20th century. The need for the Bay Bridge became apparent during the 1920s when the number of automobiles registrations and population increased. California in the 1920s was the forerunner in the nation leading the way for automobile use. The invention of the automobile and the successful market transformed the urban environment and embraced new construction for the evolving 20<sup>th</sup> century society.<br /> <br /> In total the bridge is 5-miles long and consists of three different bridges and a tunnel. Due to foundational challenges and the ingenuity Charles Henry Purcell as the chief engineer on the project, the resulting design broke world records. The suspension section of the bridge is among the longest constructed in the United States. Today the record has been surpassed but at the time of its construction, was considered the longest in the world with a cantilever spanning 1400 feet. Today the Bridge continues to pay a vital role in transportation as it serves as a major freeway connector for many who travel to and from the Bay Area.",

            "bodyText": "<p>In the late 17th century, Spain struggled to hold Florida’s inland borders as the British North American empire pressed farther south and the two imperial powers competed for alliances with indigenous nations. At the height of its power in Florida, Spain’s Catholic missions stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, but British colonists in South Carolina and the neighboring Lower Creek Indians threatened Spanish dominance. To defend their settlements in the northern Florida region, Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries founded the empire’s northernmost outpost on the Chattahoochee River. Named Apalachicola Fort, this outpost in present-day southeastern Alabama is an important archeological site and a National Historic Landmark.<br /> <br /> The fort site sits above the banks of the Chattahoochee River, which is the natural border between Alabama and Georgia. Spain chose this site because it was close to the Lower Creek town of Apalachicola, an important trade center in the region. Throughout the Spanish colonial period, Spain depended on the Catholic mission system to impose authority over its colonial settlements and American Indians. Apalachicola Fort was a small outpost, on the edge of the Spanish frontier. Approximately 20 Spanish soldiers supported only a few missionaries. Between 1689 and 1691, the Catholic friars at Apalachicola Fort tried to convert the nearby Lower Creek Indians to Catholicism and to create trade ties with them. The Spanish believed these ties could strengthen their relationship with the Lower Creek Indians, who were already trading with the British. Despite the Spaniards’ efforts, the Lower Creek and their British allies began to raid Spanish settlements, and the colonists at Apalachicola chose to abandon their post.</p> <p>Having not built the fort strong enough to withstand a heavy assault, the Spanish destroyed the fort in 1691 rather than trying to hold it against an attack. Apalachicola Fort’s rectangular blockhouse, which was about 61 by 53 feet and had four bastions, was of wattle and daub. This ancient building technique uses woven branches, or wattle, to create a frame that then gets a plaster of daub, made from mixtures of mud, clay, or animal dung. The Spanish brought this technique with them from Europe to Florida and often used it for dwellings, because it created a cooler space than wooden buildings. A clay half-wall, about four feet high, surrounded the blockhouse and an 11-foot-wide moat surrounded the entire fort site.</p> <p>The site of Apalachicola Fort was lost for centuries after the Spanish abandoned it. In 1956, local historian Mark Fretwell and Brother Finbar of Holy Trinity used documentary evidence to identify the location of the fort’s ruins on a private farm. The area is heavily wooded and grown over, but beneath the brush, the sunken outline of the fort ruins is visible. Several years after the scholars identified the site, archeologists from the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Alabama partnered to excavate Apalachicola Fort. They found evidence of the Spanish structures and blockhouse beneath the topsoil. They also discovered pieces of Majolica, a popular type of glazed ceramic pottery, and olive jar fragments the experts determined were made during the late 17th century. In 1964, just eight years after discovery, Apalachicola Fort became a National Historic Landmark. The Russell County Historic Commission purchased the fort for $1 in 1971 and archeological excavations are ongoing at the site.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>At the height of the Civil War, self-emancipated African Americans left their Union-occupied homes and fled to various cities, including what is now known as Alexandria, Virginia. As thousands of malnourished, ill and impecunious African Americans arrived in hopes of attaining freedom and justice, they were met with the continued horrors of racism and segregation. Eventually, they gained their freedom via the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<br /> <br /> These individuals were known as “Contrabands and Freedmen” and are buried at the Contrabands and Freedmen cemetery located at 1001 South Washington Street in Alexandria, Virginia. The historical site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Established by the federal government in March of 1864, the cemetery is the resting place of over 1,700 African American people. At the time of its inception, it was one of very few sacred resting places specifically for Black people.In 1864, a successful petition by over 400 USCT (United States Colored Troops) residing in Alexandria’s L’Ouverture Hospital resulted in the disinterment of approximately 118 USCT from Freedmen’s Cemetery and reburial with full military honors in Soldier’s Cemetery (currently known as the Alexandria National Cemetery) in recognition of their service to the US. The petitioners wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>As American citizens, we have a right to fight for the protection of her flag, that right isgranted, and we are now sharing equally the dangers and hardships in this mighty contest, andshould shair [sic] the same privileges and rights of burial in every way with our fellow soldierswho only differ from us in color….We ask that our bodies may find a resting place in the grounddesignated for the burial of the brave defenders of our countries flag.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Over a three-week period in January of 1865, the USCT soldiers were reburied in Section B of the National Cemetery. Nearly a century later, in 1955, a gas station and later, an office, were built on the burial ground. Several years later, recurring archaeological excavations revealed the presence of over 600 graves. Speculative assumptions now had accompanying physical evidence and the irrefutable presence of graves sparked a movement by local citizen activists to purchase the gas station and office building lots so that the cemetery could be preserved, protected and honored in its entirety.<br /> <br /> Activists diligently used lobbying and education efforts to push for the creation of a memorial and once the gas station and office building were demolished, memorial efforts went underway.The names of those interred in the cemetery allowed for the identification of an extended network of descendants in Alexandria and across the nation. Contrabands and Freedmen Cemetery is not only a reminder of the harsh reality of American chattel slavery, but of the continued struggle for freedom.The memorial site has routinely served as a place of gathering, reunion and protests with one of the most recent being a Black Lives Matter demonstration in 2020.</p> <p>The Contrabands and Freedmen Cemetery and Memorial was designated to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in June 2021. <br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements.</em></p>",

But why don't we know? Whoever made the tunnel had to carve a path straight through basalt rock big enough for people. No small task. For government agencies not to have kept records about such an endeavor is curious, since so much of what they did was carefully regimented and recorded. Was there a reason for an intentional forgetting of the facts? One theory is that the tunnel was completed by Chinese immigrants, conscripted to work in unsafe conditions for extremely low pay. We'll probably never know, but the theory itself has value. Regardless of whether it's true or not, it's a powerful reminder that most of history is invisible, yet produces tangible results.</p>",

By using poles, a notched log, ropes, chain, and a pulley system a carcass could be raised up and “dressed out” into various roasts, steaks, and other basic cuts. The meat was then stored in a room under the icehouse until the 1930’s, when a walk-in refrigerator was installed in the basement of the ranch house.<br /> <br /> It took a tremendous amount of patience, practice, and skill to properly butcher a cow. When Conrad Kohrs first arrived in Montana, he set up butcher shops in the territory’s early gold camps. In 1918, John Bielenberg sat on a nearby fence, took out a sharpened knife and directed a young Conrad Warren on how to properly clean, skin, and butcher a cow using this very hoist. Several years later, Conrad would fondly remember this valuable lesson that he had learned from his great-uncle on the ranch that day.  ",
            "audioDescription": "The beef hoist sits to the west of a dirt road and is north of the draft horse barn and north west of the dairy barn. The small structure is primarily composed of a rectangular shaped wooden post and rail enclosure with four wood corner posts sent into the ground. The pen is oriented east/west. There are six side rails along each side with two large poles sent in the center of the enclosure about five feet apart. A windlass shaft cross member connects these two poles and extends about one foot beyond the northern pole. This connects to the leaver system of the hoist. Four thin posts creating an X act as the level system that rotates the windlass to lift cattle for slaughter. The hoist deck is composed of eight 2”x12” boards. The entire structure is coated in a red stain. The main structure is designed in a U-shaped and contains a 9 x17’ plank platform that is resting on log cribbing with wooden rail sides. The front rails are not fastened down and can be removed to create an opening. There are two upright posts that hold a notched log sitting in “U” brackets that allow the notched log to spin. There are several long poles set at a 90-degree angle through the notched log with a rope threaded through the ends of the poles. The notched log has a hook on a chain attached to the center of it that would wrap around the notched log and hoist the cow carcass when the rope is pulled, spinning the notched log. The entire structure is sloped to the West.",

In the image foreground is a fir tree and snow-covered ground. The text on the panel reads, “Winter in the Sierra Nevada mountains usually means a deep snowpack. Each plant that grows here has a strategy to survive the winter. Conifers—pines and other needle-bearing trees—have a conical shape and densely packed, slippery needles that shed snow . Flexible branches bend easily to dump snow before too much accumulates. Thick bark insulates the trunk from cold. Broadleaf trees and bushes grow shorter and rounder. When they lose their delicate leaves each fall, only their bare branches are exposed to cold. Smaller plants spend the entire winter under the snowpack, sheltered from wind and temperature extremes.”",

This site commemorates the lives and accomplishments of all pioneers and the changes brought about by the Homestead Act. Legend has it that Daniel Freeman filed his claim 10 minutes after midnight at the Land Office in Brownville, NE on January 1, 1863, the first day the Homestead Act went into effect.</p> <p>Mr. Freeman came from Illinois to Nebraska alone and began corresponding with Agnes Suiter, a young woman from LeClaire, Iowa. Agnes had been engaged to Daniel's brother James, who died in the Civil War. Daniel proposed marriage through the mail, and in 1865, brought his new bride back to his homestead claim. There, they had 8 children over the years. As the children grew, some married and built homes on the old homestead.</p> <p>During the tenure of the Freeman family, a variety of structures were built upon the land. A small log cabin was built in the north forty of the claim, as well as traditional farming outbuildings. This cabin was often photographed and later depicted in engravings as the First Homestead Cabin. In later years, the family was financially secure enough to build a two-story brick house near the woodland edge of the claim. A barn and other outbuildings were built nearby. Other features of the homestead included an Osage Orange hedgerow, planted and pruned to keep animals out of productive fields. Remains of this hedgerow still exist on the land today. The Freeman family and tenant farmers planted corn, wheat, and oats and orchards of apple and peach trees.</p> <p>The brick house burned in 1916, 8 years after Daniel Freeman's death in 1908. It was replaced with a small wood frame house near that site for Daniel and Agnes' daughter Agnes Freeman Quackenbush. A similar house was built for Agnes next to the old freight road near the center of the claim. She often cared for grandchildren there, and lived in the home nearly until her death in 1931. None of the Freeman homes exist on the site today.</p>",

The carriage is connected to the brick wall. Look under the embrasure and you will discover an opening. A metal plate, called a tongue, connects the carriage to a metal pin in the wall.<br /> <br /> This system locked the cannon to the wall and helped soldiers point their weapon.

Each casemate in the fort had one or two windows, or embrasures. Soldiers fired cannon through these embrasures. This cannon is a 32-pounder. It sits on top of an oak carriage. The carriage is connected to the brick wall. Look under the embrasure and you will discover an opening. A metal plate, called a tongue, connects the carriage to a metal pin in the wall. This system locked the cannon to the wall and helped soldiers point their weapon. Look down at the floor and you will find granite blocks, or traverse stones. With iron rails bolted on top, travers stones made rolling cannon from side to side easier. Today you can still see the remains of traverse stones and rails around the fort. Cannon like this 32-pounder made a lot of smoke. Vents above embrasures allowed the smoke to escape. When a cannon fired, fresh air entered a casemate through a chimney or a diamond-shaped opening in the ceiling. Help protect Fort Pickens. Do not climb on the cannon. <br /><br />End of Description.",

This building housed a 103-horsepower Babcock & Wilcox boiler, a feed pump, and heater. Coal was stored in a casemate near the sally port. By the 1920s, the Army no longer needed the central power station. The equipment was sold, and the boiler house demolished. Help protect Fort Pickens.

            "bodyText": "<p>The commanding officer at Fort Scott coordinated the operation of the military post from the post headquarters in front of you. He was in charge of the health, safety, cleanliness, and security of the post. He routinely dealt with housing issues, property, supplies, and personnel management. He oversaw post discipline; he could arrest other officers and he convened courts-martial in this building. In these offices, he and his adjutant prepared reports and kept records that kept his superiors informed of affairs and assured the smooth functioning of the fort. In addition to the offices and court-martial room, the ordnance storeroom and artillery shed are also attached to this building.</p> <h3>Court Martial Room</h3> <p><br /> Discipline was rigidly enforced at army posts of the Nineteenth Century, and the commandant of Fort Scott saw that infractions of the regulations were severely punished. The enlisted men were at the mercy of the superior officers. Justice was administered by a court-martial convened at the post. A general court-martial, consisted of five to eleven officers, had the power to try capital cases, officers, and to fine more than one month's pay of or imprison a soldier. Regimental court-martials were administered by three officers and were for less severe infractions. Mitigating circumstances that appeared during the trial could not be considered during sentencing but were adequate grounds for recommending mercy. All court-martial proceeding were approved by the commanding officer who could remit sentences if so inclined.</p> <h3>Commandant's Office</h3> <p>Each commandant was responsible for the discipline of his troops and the good state of everything entrusted to his charge. A commander had to see that the rules and regulations were enforced, the supplies of provisions, arms and ammunition were sufficient, and the quarters and defenses in a proper state. He had local maps drawn showing the locations of roads, rivers, hills, etc., which related to the military resources and capabilities of the country, including the defensibility of the area. The commanding officer was responsible for the monthly records of his post. He sent the guard after deserters, convened court-martials, and recommended disability discharge for soldiers unable to perform their duties. When his post was abandoned, it was his duty to see the surplus property was accounted for and turned over to the Quartermaster's Department for a Board of Survey to inspect.</p> <h3>Adjutant's Office</h3> <p>The adjutant was the commanding officer's first deputy and did most of the work requiring his approval and signature. The adjutant supervised the selection of the men for details, wrote the monthly post records and reports concerning court-martials, was the Treasurer and Librarian, and was responsible for the security and good order of the post. He was expected to pass along all orders of his commanding officer without discussion, and he made semi-annual reports of a confidential nature to the War Department, which were counter-signed by the commandant. Perhaps his biggest task was that of keeping the morale of the staff high and things running smoothly at all times.</p> <h3>Ordnance Storeroom</h3> <p>The ordnance storeroom served as a work area and storage facility of military stores for the post ordnance sergeant. By army regulation, the ordnance sergeant was to have served in the military for a minimum of eight years. General character, fidelity, sobriety, qualifications as a clerk, and fitness for duty were required for this selection. He was responsible for two storage areas, the Powder Magazine consisting of kegs of Black Powder and the Ordnance Storehouse consisting of small arms, sabers, bayonets, and ammunition. In addition he was charged with receiving and preserving all ordnance, arms, ammunition, and other military stores at his post. He would make minor repairs of arms and equipment for the troops. The ordnance sergeant spent much of his time applying coats of lacquer to guns, renewing leather, and preventing moths from destroying woolen sponges used in artillery. When a post is closed, the ordnance sergeant remained on duty in charge of the government property until proper disposal of these items could be made.</p> <h3>Gun Shed</h3> <p>Artillery consisting of two 6-pound field cannons, with carriages and equipment, were supplied to Fort Scott and used from 1845 to 1853. The evidence indicates that the cannon barrels were made of iron, and were susceptible to moisture. The gun shed served as a safe storage area to protect these pieces from the weather. Also present in the shed is a mountain howitzer, which was not present at Fort Scott, but would have been used by dragoon soldiers out on western expeditions.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Post Headquarters (HS-11)-Exterior 60 wordsThe reconstructed Post Headquarters is a one-story white clapboard building with a wood door and transom window. This door is flanked on the left by two windows and on the right by one window and a 7-foot-wide doorway leading to the fort's artillery shed. Please take care when stepping up onto the tall stone landing outside the wood exhibit door. 8B. Interior intro and wall panel394 wordsThere are two furnished rooms inside this exhibit space-the Adjutant's Office directly in front of you and the Commandant's Office visible through a doorway to your left. Both rooms are blocked from visitor access by wood-framed glass barriers. First draw your attention to a wall panel hung to the right of the Commandant's Office door. This panel features a black-and-white drawing of two uniformed men, one, with pen in hand, sitting at a table covered with a dark cloth. The other man, who holds a piece of paper, stands beside him. A large map is mounted on the room's wall. Text on the panel reads: \"Post Headquarters. The Commanding Officer, with the assistance of a small administrative staff, was responsible for governing the army post according to the Articles of War and Army Regulations.\"He was expected to maintain well-trained troops ready to respond to situations which emerged along the frontier. He was charged with maintaining orderliness and discipline on the post. He was authorized to conduct court-martial.\"The command staff comprised the Post Adjutant, First Sergeant, clerks, Post Quartermaster, Post Subsistence Officer, Post Surgeon, and the field officers. \"Violations of regulations were tried by court-martial. The following excerpts from an actual trial summary illustrate typical infractions and penalties. \"Charges against Private Thomas Fraser, Company D, 4th Infantry, preferred against him by order of the General Court Martial, Fort Scott, Missouri, 28 September 1843.\"Charge 1st-Absence without Leave. Specification: did absent himself from Fort Scott, Missouri, on the evening of the 3rd day of July, 1843 and did remain absent until the morning of the 5th day of July 1843.\"Charge 2nd-Desertion. Specification: did desert whist a prisoner and did remain absent until brought back by a command sent in his apprehension.\"To which charges and specifications, the accused pleaded \"Guilty.\"\"Finding: The Court, having maturely considered the evidence adduced, finds the accused, Private Thomas Fraser as follows, on the specifications and charges: \"Guilty.\" \"Sentence: And thereupon the Court sentences the said Private Thomas Fraser to receive fifty lashes on his bare back, well laid with a raw hide, forfeit all pay and allowances which may be due to him, except just debts due the sutler and laundresses, make good the thirty dollars paid for his apprehension, and serve six months in charge of the guard at hard labor without pay.\" 8C. Commandant's Office321 wordsA small sign mounted on a waist-high pillar placed beyond the glass barrier in the Commandant's Office reads: \"Commandant's Office, Court-Martial Room. The office of the Post Commandant is furnished in the style of a military office (1842-1850), which was a combination of both military regulation and the personal preference of the commanding officer. The room to your right was the Court-Martial room. Military discipline and justice of the 19th century was the responsibility of the post commander and often severe. The room behind you is the Adjutant's office. Army regulations recommended that the adjutant be an experienced officer who was familiar with administrative procedures and military protocol.\"Furniture in the 15-by-18-foot Commandant's Office includes three rectangular wood tables-one positioned prominently in the center of the room-all covered with bright blue tablecloths. The central table holds various papers, a pair of wire-rimmed eyeglasses, a blue officer's cap, and 3 candlesticks. Two small green-painted chairs are placed at this table. Placed against the wall near the room's back right corner is an open wood secretary desk holding a rectangular wood pendulum clock, its glass decorated with gold paint. The closed door to the Court-Martial Room lies just to the right of the secretary.The other two tables are placed against the back wall and left-hand wall respectively and hold various items including a cylindrical leather saddle valise, a large document box, several rolled maps or other documents, and a hatchet. A large black-and-white map entitled \"Pictorial Map of the United States\" hangs on the room's back wall just to the left of one of the room's two windows; various territories on the map are indicated with brown ink. Other items include a black wood-burning stove, its flue pipe exiting through the room's ceiling, and a saber with a piece of red cloth attached to its hilt, propped against a back wall timber. The windows are covered with thin blue curtains.8D. Adjutant's office163 wordsThe larger 15-by-20-",

            "audioDescription": "1A. Introduction-Welcome and History 348 words Welcome to Fort Scott National Historic Site, located in the city of Fort Scott, the county seat of Bourbon County, Kansas. Established in 1842, Fort Scott was one of several forts built along the Military Road in eastern Kansas along what was then considered the \"permanent Indian frontier.\" The fort's soldiers enforced peace between white settlers moving west, native tribes like the Osage, and other native peoples relocated from the east. The fort was named for General Winfield Scott, who was the commander of all American armies in the 1840s. Fort Scott was home to both infantry soldiers and dragoons, elite troops trained to fight on horseback and on foot. The fort provided troops for various dragoon expeditions throughout the west, and both infantry and dragoons left the fort to support the army in the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. The army abandoned Fort Scott in 1853, and the buildings were auctioned in 1885 as the \"permanent\" frontier moved further west. During the late 1850s, an era known as \"Bleeding Kansas,\" army troops returned to Fort Scott to enforce peace between free state and pro-slavery groups. Troops returned again during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, when Fort Scott served as a major supply depot for Union armies in the West, a general hospital for soldiers, and a haven for others fleeing the war-displaced Indians, escaped slaves, and white farmers. The 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, sworn in on the grounds of Fort Scott, was one of the first African-American regiments to fight with the Union Army.From 1869 to 1873, the military returned yet again to establish the Post of Southeast Kansas at Fort Scott to protect railroad workers from squatters who opposed the new railroad. After the army left in 1873, the old fort buildings served as residences and commercial properties for many years. Eventually some structures were destroyed by fire or torn down. Later, federal funding made a rebirth of the old fort possible, and in 1978, Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service.1B. AD Overview 543 wordsThe current Fort Scott site contains 20 historic structures in and around the fort's 2 Â½-acre parade ground, as well as a section of restored tallgrass prairie. Although most of the fort buildings have been reconstructed, several surviving structures have been restored to their original 1840s appearance. These include three officers' quarters, the quartermaster storehouse, the post headquarters, the bake house, and the hospital building, which also houses the site's visitor center. This audio-described tour provides information about all key structures as well as numerous wayside panels at Fort Scott National Historic Site. Also included on this audio description tour are four off-site features. The Lunette-Blair Blockhouse, the Twin Trees Monument and historic marker, and the Sutler Store marker are all located in the town of Fort Scott within one block west of the historic site. Fort Scott National Cemetery is located on East National Avenue, approximately 2 miles southeast of the fort.The landscape within the historic site is generally flat, and most buildings and other features can be accessed by either concrete or brick walkways. Take care as some of the walkways are uneven, as are the stone porches of some of the buildings at ground level. Some thresholds as you enter the buildings are several inches high; these will be noted as part of specific building descriptions. Some of the wood plank and stone floors found indoors slope slightly or are uneven as well. There are several exterior and interior staircases at the fort. Please use the handrails as these stairs are steep. There are wheelchair ramps located outside some structures, including the three buildings housing restrooms and drinking fountains-the Visitor Center, the Enlisted Infantry Barracks directly beside and to the west of the Visitor Center, and a second Infantry Barracks located on the east side of the parade ground. The wood stairs and wheelchair ramps on the buildings' exteriors can become slippery in wet weather, so please watch your step. Most exterior staircases will be roped off and unavailable for use during inclement weather; use interior staircases in these instances.The fort's only elevator is located in the Enlisted Infantry Barracks building beside the Visitor Center. A 23-minute film entitled \"Fort Scott and the Growth of a Nation\" is shown in the theater space on the building's second floor. Hand-held devices that allow access to the audio description are available at the Visitor Center. Most exterior doors leading to rooms or exhibits open to the public are marked with a small sign that reads \"exhibit.\" You will encounter a number of benches and chairs-either moveable or fixed-both on the buildings' porches and inside some of the interior rooms or hallways.

At the top of the image, one side of the bridge extends out from the shoreline to cross the Canal then disappears into the water. At the bottom of the image on the opposite shoreline, the other half of the bridge spans out to cross the canal but ends abruptly. In between, water flows freely. Text at the top right reads: Blow-Down. On the night of February 12, 1979, a windstorm blew across the Olympic peninsula. Along the coast, gusts reached 96 miles per hour. Trees fell like toothpicks, 92 toppled in this campground alone, leaving a quarter mile-long corridor of downed trunks. The same storm sank the Hood Canal Bridge. Blow-downs are only a phase in the forest’s life-cycle. In the new clearing seedlings thrive on sunlight, and can begin life on the decaying trunks of storm-downed trees. Below the text is a blue and tan weather map of the Northwest Coast showing closely spaced circles within circles with the letter L in the middle, all centered over the Olympic Peninsula. A straight black line with arrows stretches across the blue Pacific Ocean from south to the north ending at the letter L. A caption reads: Path of storm, February 12, 1979.",

The Riverside Community Settlement House was initially established to serve local ethnic populations in 1911. Services were first housed in a house on Fourteenth Street, and later expanded to a group of buildings previously occupied by a Japanese and Mexican employment agency on East Thirteenth Street. The existing building historically associated with the organization was constructed at a third location on Bermuda Avenue in 1947.Specifically designed to meet the needs of the Riverside Latino community, the Community Settlement House initially provided services that included health care (prenatal care), sewing instruction, citizenship classes, and social etiquette classes. Operated by the Community Settlement Association, a prominent Riverside organization rooted in the American Settlement Movement, the Community Settlement House was identified by the local Latino community as an important historic resource. It is a rare extant example of a building associated with a prominent organization that supported Latino immigrants during the mid-to-late twentieth century.",

During these years, she also became the first African American playwright and the youngest playwright to win the New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award for Best American Play. An instant celebrity, Hansberry was photographed in her book-lined apartment on Bleecker Street for Vogue Magazine one month after the play’s premiere. <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>, considered a classic, has become part of established literary canon and is taught in schools throughout the United States.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e0b41f29-0d04-4157-b20e-944679cfd43a}{252}\" paraid=\"501684014\">The Hansberry Residence is also significant for its important role in breaking the barriers of the time that challenged traditional views of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Hansberry was a dedicated activist for social justice and she worked alongside civil rights activists, such as writer James Baldwin, and singer Nina Simone. She contributed to a variety of publications that focused on racial justice, communism, women’s equality, and LGBT causes in her lifetime. Many of these articles were written in her apartment at 337 Bleecker Street. Even before the success of <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>, Hansberry privately began to explore her lesbian identity; she found community in her small lesbian social circle in Greenwich Village and had at least two relationships with women who lived close to her Bleecker Street apartment. While she was vocal about civil rights and other issues, she remained private about her sexuality, choosing instead to participate in LGBT issues anonymously through her writing, both before and after she achieved literary fame.   </p>",

Events, students, and faculty at the school during its period of significance are directly associated with Lee v. Macon County Board of Education (1963-2006), the nationally significant landmark Civil Rights case that set a precedent for an enhanced role for the federal government in the desegregation of local schools through judicial relief, direct on-ground intervention, and compliance monitoring. The case is also significant in that it replaced the necessity of addressing integration school district by school district with a statewide approach and grew in scope to affect other education-related institutions. Macon County High School is an illustration of successful integration in the late 1960s and 1970s that received nationwide and international attention as a model example of integration by 1974.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bf4fd4-af7b-4781-9a88-be56aa355267}{228}\" paraid=\"1203900624\">Macon County historically became known as a center for African American education when the legislature established what is now known as Tuskegee Institute, or Tuskegee University, in 1881. Until the mid-20th century it was implied that Tuskegee Institute faculty abided by “the unspoken pledge to stay out of politics.” The institute was created primarily to train African American teachers, and thus increase the quality of education that was available to black children in the South.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bf4fd4-af7b-4781-9a88-be56aa355267}{242}\" paraid=\"1863766477\">The school stands today with elements of Spanish Colonial Revival and International styles. Unusual for a rural Alabama public building, the building’s original construction catered to a segregated all-white institution. In 1965 the county built International style buildings after segregationists bombed the school during its initial integration in the spring of 1964. The centerpiece of the campus then as it is today was the Spanish Colonial Revival auditorium/gymnasium, which became an important public building for all sorts of community events for the remainder of the 20th century. </p>",

Sandy Island is home to an African American community founded and settled by freed slaves during the Reconstruction era. It is located within the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, an area established by the U. S. Congress to recognize and help maintain the cultural traditions of the Gullah Geechee people. The Corridor extends from Jacksonville, North Carolina southward to Jacksonville, Florida. Sandy Island is one of the few South Carolina Gullah Geechee island communities that remains accessible only by boat and has no paved roads.<br /> <br /> The island and village were established by Philip Washington following the Civil War. Philip Washington was a newly freed enslaved person who purchased several hundred acres of land on the southern tip of the island. The island houses the Sandy Island School which is historically significant in a variety of topics. From its uncommon architecture style in the Neoclassical Revival to its influence of African American civil rights in history and education.<br /> <br /> The construction and establishment of the school would not have been possible had it not been for Prince Washington, the great-grandson of Philip Washington, who played a significant role in the Sandy Island School from its planning through its conversion into a community center. Washington sold a portion of his property to Archer Huntington to construct the Sandy Island School in 1932. Washington transported students across the river to attend Howard High School and offered seniors Citizenship School classes in the late 1950s. The school served as the central location for islanders’ activism for political representation and cultural preservation. The school embodies the self-sufficiency of the Sandy Island community in the face of unequal and scarce educational resources for African Americans throughout the twentieth century. Through the islanders’ collective determination and action, students received a quality education in the face of meager resources, enabling them to flourish in their chosen careers off the island.",

The rise of these centers aligned with the activism of the second-wave women’s liberation movement.

The inclusion of multiple perspectives from diverse organizations helped to create a more radical version of feminism and affirmed the need for women’s spaces within male-dominated society. Two prominent lesbian organizations — Lesbian Feminist Liberation and Lesbian Switchboard — developed at the WLC in the early 1970s to advocate for increased rights for and improved visibility of lesbians. In addition to serving as a pioneering women’s space, the WLC also helped to cultivate lesbian activism both within and separate from the general gay liberation movement, which often overlooked lesbian issues. By serving as an alternative to the general movement, the WLC provided women with increased autonomy to advocate for their own rights both inside of and separate from the gay liberation movement. The WLC set a precedent for other LGBT centers and activism spaces, showing how these centers could focus not only on the political but also on the social and cultural needs of LGBT individuals.  </p>",

            "audioDescription": "The Marys Rock Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white photograph taken of a group of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) \"boys\" as they paused in their work on the trail near Marys Rock. The narrow trail that curves around a bend in the trail has a abrupt 10-foot drop off held in place with an impressive hand-laid stone retaining wall. The text reads, \"Value Added - The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), created in the early 1930s by President Franklin Roosevelt, helped ease the sting of the Great Depression. It put young men to work in public lands like Shenandoah National Park, and taught them skills like carpentry, landscaping, and masonry. CCC boys built the retaining walls along the Appalachian Trail south to Marys Rock. Those walls, like CCC work all over Shenandoah, endure as handsome reminders of the program that provided a depression-plagued nation with food, shelter, and trade skills.\" The bottom left of the panel has a photograph of a trail through lush, green forest. Downed trees span the trail, with the section over the foot path removed. The remainder of the trees lie on either side of the trail. The text reads, \"Life Out of Death - On the Appalachian Trail north toward Pass Mountain, you will see lots of fallen trees, downed by storms, disease, or simply old age. Trail crews have removed the sections of the downed trees blocking the trail, but have left the debris beside the trail on purpose. Trail maintenance in the Park works toward preservation and regeneration: dead trees will provide habitat and food for wildlife and will eventually return to the ground as rich soil from which living things can draw life.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Marys Rock Summit and Pass Mountain Loop. The Marys Rock trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Marys Rock Summit - 3.7 mile round trip, moderate, 2.75 hours hiking time, 1,210-foot elevation gain. Take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south. Look for double blazes, indicating a change in the trail; the A.T. will make some sharp turns. Continue to a trail post; go right to Marys Rock viewpoint. Return by retracing your steps, being careful at the trail post to go left, to take the A.T. north back to Panorama.\" \"Hike #2: Pass Mountain Loop - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 3.4-mile circuit, moderate, 2.5 hours, 670-foot elevation gain. Take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north. Cross U.S. 211. Continue for another tenth of a mile to Skyline Drive; cross the Drive. Go right onto Pass Mountain Hut Road. Stay on the fire road to Pass Mountain Hut. To return, near Pass Mountain Hut, look for the blue-blazed Pass Mountain Trail leading back to the A.T. south. Take the A.T. south back to Panorama, first crossing Skyline Drive, then U.S. 211, to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\"",

It is not possible to take strollers etc. on this trail.<br /> <br /> This trail provides scenic ocean views, the chance to see whales migrating in the winter months, various marine life, and a look at the native vegetation. Please stay on the trail as we have dangerous cliffs, sensitive vegetation, and the possibility of rattlesnakes off trail. Some of the sensitive vegetation may look dead, especially in the summer, but they are just dormant, waiting for the winter and spring rains.<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed on the trail as long as they are on a 6 foot or shorter leash.

Since 2007, Eric Metzler, an expert entomologist and volunteer at White Sands, has discovered over 650 different species of moths in these dunes. Sixty of those species are entirely new to science.<br /> .<br /> This moth research is critical because moths are a great indicator of a ecosystems health. The greater the diversity of moths, the greater the diversity of other animal and plant species, therefore the healthier the ecosystem! If moths died out, songbirds would all but disappear. </p>",

There are recycled plastic railings on both sides. A vertical board at the bottom of the side rails clearly marks the edge of the walk. A metal grill leads up at a slight angle from the ground to the beginning of the walkway. A sign at the entrance to the walk warns that the boardwalk is slippery when frosty or wet.",

This is the marking of the kelp forest in the Cabrillo State Marine Reserve.<br /> <br /> The kelp forest provides an essential resource to the area and is one of the reasons why it is a protected marine reserve. “Kelps” are a class of brown algae that can grow to large sizes. They attach to the ocean bottom, and many have flotation devices to buoy themselves to the water’s surface. Several marine algae species can be found in the intertidal area, but the most impressive are the large forests of kelps that grow in water about 25 to 70 feet (8 – 21 meters) offshore. You can see roughly where they grow by looking for the brownish, smooth areas on the water’s surface. In Point Loma the kelp forest is dominated by giant kelp (<i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i>), which grows up to 150 feet (46 meters) long!<br /> <br /> Organisms ranging from sea urchins to Gray Whales can be spotted in this habitat. Although this forest is underwater, it has just as much biodiversity as forests on land. Many species found in the kelp forest can also be spotted in our tidepools.<br /> <br /> <b>Access and Safety</b><br /> Not wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> Please make sure to wear sunscreen and bring enough water before attempting the trail.</p>",

Walking barefoot results in the risk of cuts or injury to visitor. Rocks are slippery due to algal growth and visitors should proceed with caution.<br /> <br /> The tidepools are accessible to explore only at low tide. Guests are encouraged to check the San Diego tidal calendar before visiting. The best time to see low tides at the park are during the fall and winter months. In spring and summer, the water level is above the tidepools during park hours. The Rocky Intertidal Zone is one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet. During your visit, you may see plants and animals such as hermit crabs, sea stars, algae, mussels, and barnacles. Everyone plays a part in preserving this ecosystem.

From the parking lot a sandy path follows the northern escarpment, carrying you over sand dunes. As you walk into the canyon, the sounds and sights of the city fade away and may be replaced with the coo of a mourning dove or a collared lizard sunning itself on a basalt boulder. Here you see prehistoric and historic petroglyphs, rock wall alignments and shelters, and wildlife living in the vegetation growing throughout the canyon.<br /> <br /> The geology of the area shows the remnants of volcanic eruptions of 200,000 years ago. The basalt from these flows capped the sandstone of the Santa Fe Formation. As the softer sandstone eroded away, the basalt broke off and tumbled down the hillside. This naturally occurring geologic action of weathering and erosion formed the volcanic escarpment as we see it today and is also where the Ancestral Pueblo People carved petroglyphs.<br /> <br /> The Rinconada Canyon trail follows the northern escarpment, allowing the hiker views of a variety of petroglyphs. The trail is 1.1 miles long to the back of the canyon (2.2 miles roundtrip) and is moderately strenuous.<br /> <br /> As with any hiking in the park, or the desert Southwest, carry plenty of water and drink often. Wear a hat, sunscreen, and sturdy walking shoes or boots. Watch out for rattlesnakes which inhabit the canyon.<br /> <br /> <strong>DO NOT leave valuables visible inside your vehicle. Lock your vehicle and set alarm.</strong>",
            "audioDescription": "A mile long canyon surrounded by a dark basalt volcanic mesa. There are many dark boulders covering the escarpment, some of which have petroglyphs pecked into the rock. There is a sandy soil with grasses and other plants growing from it. A trail leads away from the parking lot with metal posts and cables on either side of it. Powerlines cross the mouth of the canyon in a few locations.",

Relish a primitive bathing experience while enjoying unparalleled scenery.</p> <p>Along a stretch beginning upstream of Rio Grande Village, a series of thermal springs emerge adjacent to the Rio Grande. All of the hot springs in this region are believed to be related to normal faults. These Basin and Range type faults formed between 18 and 23 million years ago. Today, groundwater circulating deep in the earth becomes heated before it returns to the surface as hot springs.</p> <p>The most famous of the thermal features along the Big Bend of the Rio Grande is the Langford Hot Springs. Located where Tornillo Creek enters the Rio Grande, some four miles upriver from Boquillas Canyon and the Mexican village of Boquillas. The natural springs at the site are known as Boquillas Hot Springs. <em>Boquillas</em> is Spanish for \"little mouths\" and refers to the many small streams or arroyos that drain this part of the Sierra del Carmen range and flow into the Rio Grande. Later, when the springs were promoted for their health benefits, the settlement and spa resort there was called Hot Springs, and a post office by that name was established at the site in July 1914. Although there are several other small hot springs in the area, these larger and more accessible springs are the best known.</p> <p>Hot spring water is considered old water, fossil water, ancient and irreplaceable. Heated by geothermal processes and emerging at 105° F., the water carries dissolved mineral salts reputed to have healing powers. The water contains calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, and lithium. The springs' flow rate in 1936 was 250,000 gallons a day, but more recent measurements show a decrease. The therapeutic value of heat has long been touted as a remedy of both body and soul.</p> <p>Be aware that some hot springs can burn you either with the scalding effects of heat or the caustic nature of the water chemistry. Use caution when bathing and limit the exposure of children to the warm waters.</p> <h2><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Visiting the Langford Hot Springs</span></h2> <p>Contact <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/contacts.htm\">Big Bend National Park</a> for more information and before visiting to get any current conditions or updated information.  </p> <h3>The Rules</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Be respectful of others; soak only, and use no soaps or oils.</p> </li> <li> <p>Swimming is not recommended; be aware that adjacent river currents and depths can be unpredictable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please help to keep the area clean by picking up trash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcoholic beverages and glass containers are prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overnight camping in the area of the Hot Springs is prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is illegal to purchase items from vendors operating on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Directions</h3> <h4><strong>Hot Springs Road</strong></h4> <p>The two-mile gravel road descends down a rough, narrow wash to the Hot Springs Historic District and trailhead area. <em>Note: Motor homes and oversize vehicles are prohibited on the one-way sections of the Hot Springs road.</em></p> <h4><strong>Hiking to the Hot Springs</strong></h4> <p>From the trailhead, the hot spring is a 0.5 mile round trip.

As a designated wilderness area, there are no roads, trails, motorized vehicles, or other human facilities so that the resources of the park shine. Overnight camping is allowed with a free permit that can be obtained in person at the visitor centers. Day hiking doesn’t need a permit in the south unit. The north unit of the wilderness features such sites as Flattops and Karens Point. Access for overnight use is limited to Kachina Point and Mile Marker 24.",

The forest was originally accessible by vehicle and the old road constructed by the CCC in the early 1930s still exists. The old road was also called the First Forest-Eagle Nest Rock Road. The historic road was closed on October 8, 1965 to reduce illegal petrified wood removal. The current overlook was completed that same month. Jasper Forest was home to geographical landmarks such as Eagle Nest Rock and the Snow Lady, both of which no longer exist because of erosion. The old road alignment can be explored using the Jasper Forest Off the Beaten Path route.",

            "bodyText": "<p>To the pioneer missionary, it was an isolated settlement offering small comfort during the Great Mormon Migration deep into Arizona. To the families who lived here, the ranch was the centerpiece of daily life where hard work was required to tame and survive the rugged yet beautiful desert. For some it offered employment in a hardscrabble setting, and for later owners it promised rustic peace and quiet. Today, Lonely Dell Ranch still serves its main purpose as a place for the traveler to rest a while, enjoy variety of nature, and bask in the shade of the trees.</p> <p> <b>A Homesteading Mission </b><br /> Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon missionary sent by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, successfully crossed the Colorado River near here in 1864. Seeing its importance in the settlement of Arizona, Hamblin recommended his church establish a river crossing. Over the years three Mormon families, the Lees, Johnsons and Emetts, sent here to homestead and work the busy river crossing known as Lees Ferry.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>Lonely Dell Guided Hike Information: </h4> <p><strong>Distance: 1 miles ( 1.6 km) round-trip<br /> Easy</strong></p> <h4>Lonely Dell Guided Hike</h4> <p>The self-guided walking tour follows an improved dirt road leading back to the ranch and orchard with two uneven dirt trails leading to the ranch buildings and grassy picnic area. Walk among the fruit trees and pick what is in season. Watch your step, as hand dug irrigation channels help bring water to the orchard. Take care in extreme temperatures, and avoid hiking during the hottest parts of the day. Bring plenty of water. Be flash flood aware if you continue hiking up the Paria River Trail.  Pets allowed on trails. Keep on leash, no longer that 6 ft (1.6 m)<br /> <br /> Do not remove any natural or cultural objects from the park including fossils, rocks, animals, plants and artifacts. </p> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Lonely Dell Orchard</span></p> <p>Walk among the fruit trees in the orchard and search for a ripe snack. Collection of fruit at Lonely Dell Ranch Orchard is permitted for personal consumption only and not for purposes of sale or exchange.

            "audioDescription": "Upon entering the ranch, an orchard made up of many rows of varying fruiting trees and bushes to the right of the dirt road. The road leads to the living site for former pioneers and later private property owners. Today the ranch consists of a cold storage log structure built into the ground dating back to the 1890s, four one story single room log cabins built pre 1920s, a long ranch house made of large pieces of stone constructed in the 1930s, and a pioneer cemetery. The green of the tree tops from the orchard and ranch are a dramatic difference from the dry desert dust and red cliffs that surround the isolated homestead. Interpretive sign at entrance has photographs of Ferryman Warren Johnson and family on steps of home, covered wagon, Samantha's Cabin, and visitors enjoying a panic on the grass in the shade of the trees.",

Looming above you to a height of 14,410 feet, Mount Rainier is the most intensely glaciated mountain in the contiguous United States with 25 glaciers covering 34 square miles - enough to cover more than half of the city of Tacoma, WA in ice! Mount Rainier actually has two summit craters, of which the rim of the east crater is visible from Sunrise. Warmed by escaping steam and gases, the rock rims of the craters remain visible year-round, despite the mountain’s permanent coating of glacial ice. From this vantage you can also look down and across the White River Valley on the left as you head towards Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely. The Sunrise Road is steep and winding. Watch out for bicyclists and other drivers on the road, as well as wildlife. Please do not stop your vehicle in the road and block traffic.</p>",

The pullout is located 2.3 miles up from the gate along the Sunrise Road. A wayside exhibit panel next to the pullout provides additional information about the rock formation. <br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Columnar Rock Formations</b><br /> The lava that formed the columnar rock formations you see at this stop flowed here during an eruption approximately 496 thousand years ago, making it one of the oldest lava flows from Mount Rainier. Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist from the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We’re very high up here and you have to ask the question, how did the lava flow get here? Why did it perch up here so high? And the reason is because... when the eruption occurred, the valley of the White River was filled with a thousand feet or so of glacier ice at least to the surface that we are at today.”</p> </blockquote> <p>These lava columns are evidence that the valley was once filled with glacial ice. As the lava cools it crystallizes into columns pointing in the direction of cooling. Normally, one would expect them to be vertical, assuming that the coldest direction would be the air above the lava flow. These columns however lay horizontally, indicating that the cooling surface was to the edge of the lava flow. Geologists think that this lava flow actually erupted while the White River valley was filled with a very thick Ice Age glacier. The lava flow skirted the edges of the glacier, cooling as it came into contact with the ice along its flank. When the glacier eventually melted away, it left behind the lava ridge Sunrise is built on.<br /> <br /> While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely.

It has big boulders set into a fine matrix and much of that is from the Osceola Mudflow, the big mudflow that formed 5600 years ago when we had an eruption of Mount Rainier... So we’re looking at this landslide from just the base of the mountain, and you’ll see as you travel that it did travel a fair ways up the valley wall... It hardened here in place and you can see it’s a very unstable slope and we get a lot of small rock falls off this slope over the years.”</i><i></i><i></i></p> </blockquote> <p>While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely.

As the rest of the miners hauled equipment to Lees Ferry, two men spend the fall of 1910 building a trail up this sheer cliff to a coalmine at Warm Creek Canyon, 30 miles away. Pack mules carried several loads of coal down the trail later that year. The trail climbs over 1500 feet in only a mile.<br /> <br /> If you choose to go up the Spencer Trail instead of continuing on the Historic River Trail, be prepared. </p> <h4>Spencer Trail Information: </h4> <p><strong>Distance: 4.4 miles (7 km) round-trip<br /> Difficult</strong><br /> <br /> A short but strenuous hike with amazing views of the Colorado River and the City of Page, this rocky climb up switchbacks ascends out of the canyon surrounding Lees Ferry. Avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day. Best times include Spring and Fall. Bring plenty of water with you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead:</strong>Follow the Lees Ferry access road 5.8 miles (9.3 km) to the boat launch. A gravel parking lot at the end of the paved area will give you access to the start of the historic district. Divert from River Trail roughly .36 miles (.58 km) at posted junction. No overnight parking.</p> <p> </p>",

Treaties made with the tribes were changed and ignored as westward expansion by emigrants, trains, and military forces increased. Mistrust, fear, and retaliation on both sides fueled continued conflict. The Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples native to the region fought back in vain as they tried to maintain their way of life.<br /> <br /> It is said that the seeds of this conflict lay in a clash resulting from two cultures both desiring the same geographical area for disparate reasons.<br /> <br /> <i>Can you of think of other times when a rivalry between two cultures has resulted in violence or tragedy? What has been the result for those involved? How did one culture claim “dominance”?</i></p>",

The Welcome Gate by artist Lillian Pitt represents how Chinook people welcomed someone arriving by canoe and serves as a fitting entry to the Vancouver Land Bridge (Link: <a href=\"https://nativeamerica.travel/listings/confluence-land-bridge-in-vancouver\">https://nativeamerica.travel/listings/confluence-land-bridge-in-vancouver</a>).</p> <p>At this location, the Hudson’s Bay Company stood as the first European trading post in the Pacific Northwest, and Lewis and Clark camped at this site during their expedition. Fort Vancouver was built twenty years later.</p> <p>“The Land Bridge is a real link connecting back to the Klickitat Trail, Lewis and Clark, and the development of the Northwest. It completes a circle that’s been broken,” states Johnpaul Jones, acclaimed Native American architect and landscape architect who worked on the project along with designer Maya Lin.</p> <p>The Welcome Gate is the perfect creative entryway to the Land Bridge, which tells the story of river, land and people along the Columbia River. Artist Lillian Pitt states, “The site was built to honor the Chinookan people, who were awesome traders. They lived and traded from the mouth of the Columbia River in Astoria, all the way upriver to the area where my ancestors lived at Celilo. And this area they established within modern-day Vancouver was a major gathering place for them . . . and so it was here that they welcomed many people to trade.”</p> <p>About the author: Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist. She was born and raised on the Warm Springs reservation in Oregon and her ancestors lived in and near the Columbia River Gorge for over 10,000 years. The focus of her work is on creating contemporary fine art pieces that delight today’s art lovers, and at the same time, honor the history and legends of her people.</p> <p>For more information about Lillian Pitt’s work and a list of her other public art pieces to view in the area, please visit <a href=\"http://lillianpitt.com/\">http://lillianpitt.com</a>.</p>",

The BMI’s collections are evocative reminders of Baltimore’s great history and explain, more effectively than any textbook, how the city developed from a small trading post to a thriving industrial center.

            "bodyText": "<p>Cave Hill Cemetery is a 296-acre Victorian era National Cemetery and arboretum. It is the largest cemetery by area and number of burials in Louisville. Cave Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Cave Hill National Cemetery, containing military graves, is also on the National Register, added in 1998.</p> <p>Cave Hill was chartered in 1848 on what was William Johnston’s Cave Hill Farm, then a rural property some distance east of Louisville. Johnston, who died in 1798, had built the first brick house in Louisville on the grounds circa 1788. City officials had purchased part of the land in the 1830s in anticipation of building a railroad through it, and a workhouse was built there. The railroad was built elsewhere, and the land was leased to local farmers.</p> <p>In 1846, Mayor Frederick A. Kaye began investigating the possibility of developing a rural or garden-style cemetery on the grounds, a popular concept at the time. Hartford, Connecticut civil engineer Edmund Francis Lee was hired, who planned a cemetery with winding paths, graves across the tops of hills, and lakes and ponds in the valleys. The Cave Hill Cemetery Co. was chartered in February 1848, and the cemetery was dedicated on July 25, 1848. Reverend Doctor Edward Porter Humphrey delivered the dedicatory address and elaborated on the idea of the garden cemetery, noting, among other things, that “. . .Reason and taste suggest that [this cemetery] should be decorated appropriately by the beautiful productions of our great Creator. . .”</p> <p>Before the era of large municipal parks, it was common for cities to promote a garden cemetery as a green oasis and recreation destination, and Louisville was no exception. This largely ended with the opening of nearby Cherokee Park in 1892. After administrators sold several acres of land for the burial of Union soldiers during the Civil War, local Confederate supporters purchased nearby land as well. Several deceased patients from the Brown General Hospital and other nearby army medical facilities were interred in Cave Hill Cemetery.</p> <p>The grounds were expanded and remapped in 1888 to their modern size of nearly 300 acres (1.2 km<sup>2</sup>). In the 1980s, razor wire was added to the brick walls surrounding Cave Hill to keep out after-hours visitors.</p> <p>The first scenic overlook for the cemetery, Twin Lakes Scenic Overlook, opened on August 20, 2008.</p> <p>There were about 120,000 people interred by 2002, with space remaining for 22,000 more graves. Notable among those interred in the cemetery is:</p> <ul> <li>George Rogers-Clark – A soldier from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War. Brother to Captain William Clark of the Corps of Discovery.</li> <li>Patty & Milred Hill – The sisters who composed the Happy Birthday song.</li> <li>Colonel Harland Sanders – The founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken</li> <li>Muhammad Ali – American professional boxer, activist, philanthropist, and Louisville’s Native Son</li> <li>Enid Yandell – An American sculptor who studied with Auguste Rodinand and Frederick William MacMonnies. The sculpture collection at Speed Art Museum (Louisville, KY) includes a large number of her works in plaster.</li> <li>Jeptha Barnard Bright, Jr – Better known as Barney Bright, was a sculptor from Louisville, KY and is best known for his work on the Louisville Clock.</li> </ul>",

Eventually, the only things remaining were foundations and the powder magazine. </p> <p>The Fort de Chartres, however, stands again, after many years of restoration. It is full of buildings and reenactors who make visitors feel like they’ve been transported back to the 18th century. Reenactors wear period clothing and give a great perspective on what life was like when the fort was built. Visitors will quickly notice the quality and authenticity of all of the restorations, as the fort has been steadily improved upon with painstaking detail since the 1920s. One would hardly know that they weren’t in France!</p> <p>History lovers will be able to gather during the trade fair, where craftspeople sell reproductions of period crafts and people play historic games, as well as events like demonstrations of 18th century cannons and a popular New Year’s Eve celebration. While there are always adventures to be had at Fort de Chartres, these event days have a special feeling of community amongst the visitors who all decide to travel back in time together.</p> <p>Whether you are in the area during one of these special occasions or passing through on non-event days, be sure not to miss Fort de Chartres!</p>",

Constructed in 1897, the Forum is representative of a late nineteenth century meeting and social hall. It served as the heart of the Grand Boulevard community’s society, culture, and commerce. The Forum’s period of significance expands from its construction date, until 1969. The building was designed by prominent local architect Samuel Atwater Treat, also known for his design of St. Luke’s Hospital (Chicago). The initial construction of the building is composed of the main block which includes: the red brick two-story hall and stores section, and one-story commercial section which fronts 43rd Street. In 1900, the property was expanded with a three-story addition at the northwest corner of the main block. The building ranged in use and space as a community center for events from political campaigns, ward mass meetings, and speeches by Oscar Stanton de Priest and Dr. Emil G. Hirsch; performances by Nat King Cole, Tiny Parham, and the Johnny Long Orchestra; to Civil Rights activities such as the Chicago Scottsboro Defense Conference and the “Negroes in major leagues” movement.While the Forum was built for the initial citizens of the community, wealthy, as well as middle-and working-class American-born whites of Irish, Scottish, and English descent, German Jews, and a small African-American population, it seamlessly became a meaningful part of daily life for Black Metropolis which developed at the beginning of the twentieth century. By the 1920s, the Great Migration had brought an influx of African Americans to Chicago’s South Side. Soon after, the 43rd Street corridor became part of the core of the jazz and blues music scenes of Chicago. While the demographics of the community changed over the course of the period of significance, the Forum’s use remained consistent and central facility to the community.  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>The evening of July 19,1805, was a hot one in the wilderness that would later become Montana. On the Missouri River, not far from present day Helena, the hardy members of the Lewis and Clark expedition toiled to move upstream. Rock embankments made towing from shore impossible, and the deep channel forced the men to row rather than pole their boats forward.</p> <p>Suddenly, there loomed before them towering rock formations unlike any they had ever seen. From both sides of the river, limestone cliffs rose to a spectacular height of 1200 feet. “In many places,” wrote Meriwether Lewis, “the rocks seem ready to tumble on us.” At each bend in the waterway, great stone walls seemed to block passage, only to open like gentle giant gates as the expedition drew near. In his journal, Meriwether wrote: “I shall call this place: “GATES OF THE MOUNTAINS“.</p> <p>The name stuck, and for nearly two centuries travelers have ventured down this stretch of the Missouri to marvel at its natural wonders. Today, most visitors enjoy the beauty of the Gates of the Mountains from aboard a tour boat – the “Canyon Voyager” or the “Sacajawea” (named after the only women and indigenous person on the Expedition). Aboard a comfortable open-air boat (covered in case of rain), you’ll glide through magnificent country Meriwether Lewis would still recognize if he could return.</p> <p>Great towering walls of limestone still stand guard over the river. Bighorn sheep and Mountain Goats scamper in the rocks high above the water. Ospreys, eagles (bald and golden), vultures and falcons (peregrine and prairie) still soar on the updrafts. The canyon is also home to otters, deer, squirrels, ermine, beaver, mountain lions, black bears and other wild creatures. The life list for bird species is over 120 right now.</p> <p>From the vessel you can see Mann Gulch, the site of the raging forest fire that killed 13 smokejumpers, August 5, 1949. This tragedy was the main subject matter of Norman Maclean’s book “Young Men and Fire”. The story of Mann Gulch is one of the more interesting stories told by the guide and pilot.</p> <p>Near Mann Gulch the pilot will hug the shoreline to give you a look at Indian pictographs painted on the rock wall. Proof that indigenous people lived here long before Meriwether named it the Gates of the Mountains.</p> <p>The tour’s main attraction, though, is the inexhaustible scenery – wooded slopes, rugged rock formations, and the placid beauty of the timeless Missouri.</p>",

The remains of 500 Union men, 24 Confederate soldiers and 98 local dead were buried in three separate sections—all victims of Civil War battles. In 1868, the city began efforts to secure designation of the Union veterans’ areas as federal property, eventually succeeding with a Congressional appropriation and recognition in 1898. Several years later, in about 1903, the Fitzhugh Lee Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy erected a monument in remembrance of the 24 soldiers who died for the South. A memorial for local Union dead was added in 1909.</p> <p>Established in 2017, the William Halbrooks Arboretum at Oak Hill Cemetery was named for William Halbrooks, Oak Hill’s third superintendent.Its purpose is to provide a quiet and healing landscape for mourners while respecting the history and dignity of those interred at Oak Hill Cemetery. It will promote public awareness and appreciation of urban greenspaces by providing a safe, serene and beautiful setting. “This is a tremendous accomplishment that represents a team effort in achieving the certification for our historic facility,” said Chris Cooke, Superintendent. This accreditation” represents the culmination of many hours of labor put in by countless volunteers as well as a generous grant from the Southwestern Indiana Master Gardener Association,” he added. “Without each and every one of them, we would not have reached this goal.” A core goal of the Arboretum is to protect and cultivate existing trees and woody shrubs, while augmenting the historic landscape by selecting and appropriately locating new acquisitions. Additionally, it will promote general awareness and appreciation for trees and landscaping through social media, publications and public events.</p> <p>More than 120 individual tree species are represented within the Halbrooks Arboretum including juniper, holly, blue spruce, tulip tree, dogwood, catalpa, sycamore, locust, Japanese ginkgo, magnolia, and varieties of pine, oak, cedar, maple, and willow.</p> <p>The Halbrooks Aboretum has achieved Level II Accreditation from <strong><a href=\"http://arbnet.org/accreditation/levels-accreditation/level-ii-criteria\">www.ArbNet.org</a></strong>.</p> <p>Oak Hill Cemetery and Arboretum is centrally located off Highway 41 just north of the Lloyd Expressway and offers traditional ground spaces, mausoleum chapel, cremation garden, and a Veterans’ Memorial Plaza.</p>",

Originally scouted out by the indigenous people, these paths took advantage of the shallow river crossing to connect to the roads on the other side of the river. ",

            "bodyText": "Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2019, the Mosquito Beach Historic District is a significant example of a historic commercial and recreational epicenter for the coastal black community in the Charleston area during Jim Crow segregation. The surviving buildings, sites and overall character of the strip embody the empowerment and entrepreneurship, as well as the sustainment of culture and tradition, displayed by African Americans during a time of systemic oppression. The district represents tangible evidence of the widespread segregation of recreational space in the decades leading up to and during the Civil Rights era. Prior to the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Mosquito Beach became less a convenient gathering place for local workers and more a community beacon during segregation. The families of Sol Legare Island owned their land and maintained a self-sustaining economy based on seafood and truck farming, but as black citizens, their social, political and recreational rights significantly diminished once leaving the island. Environmental injustices spurred by segregation was evident in the post-World War II period, as the national desire for recreational leisure increased significantly.  As the coast of South Carolina became a destination for many, the state’s public beaches became some of the most segregated spaces in the south.In Charleston County, Mosquito Beach was one of six “black beaches” accessible to the African American community in 1960. Of the six beaches, Mosquito Beach survives as the last visible example of the recreational use dedicated to the African American community. The other five historically black beaches have either lost contributing buildings due to natural disasters, neglect, or turned to development properties to accommodate the rise of vacationing and tourism along the Charleston coast. Mosquito Beach is a vitally important and living historic resource to Sol Legare Island, James Island, and Charleston County.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Located in the downtown area of Rock Hill, South Carolina, McCrory’s Five and Dime began operation in 1937. Originally built in 1901 and operated as the Rock Hill Supply Company, the structure was designed by local architect Hugh White, along with contractor A.D. Holler. The building’s first floor was home to McCrory’s, which at the time was a national chain of five and dime stores. Patrons could expect to find souvenirs, clothing, snacks, and other items of convenience when shopping the local chain. Each store included lunch counters, where hot meals were prepared for customers. This quickly became one of the store’s main attractions. However, McCrory's prohibited African Americans from sitting at lunch counters to enjoy their meals. For African Americans, access to hot food was limited to take-out orders only.<br /> <br /> A watershed moment in history occurred on February 1, 1960. Four African American students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University of Greensboro, N.C., held a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth’s store. The students sat at the lunch counter, which similarly to McCrory’s, prohibited African Americans to take-out orders only. Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil came to be known as the “Greensboro Four”. Inspired by the stand for equality displayed by their Carolina neighbors, Black students at Friendship Junior College, a predominantly African American institution in Rock Hill, planned their own demonstration. <br /> <br /> Sit-in demonstrations kicked off on February 12, 1960, with an estimate of 100 Friendship students participating. The sit-ins split between Woolworth’s, Good Drug Company, J.L. Phillips “Rexall” Company, and McCrory’s store. Each store denied Black patrons the right to dine-in, and instead opted to close business for the day. The following day, stores opened for business with the omission of lunch counter use for two weeks. This continued until February 23, when counters reopened. To the dismay of store owners, Black students resumed their sit-in, which continued for nearly a year.<br /> <br /> A climatic point occurred on January 31, 1961, with protests outside the McCrory building. Eighteen student protesters marched, carrying signs. Congress of Racial Equality leader, Thomas Gaither, along with nine Friendship College students, entered the store and took their seats. The nine Friendship students, Charles Taylor, Willie McLeod, James Wells, Clarence Graham, David Williamson, Robert McCullough, Mack Workman, Willie Massey, and John Gaines, were arrested. The next day, ten protestors were tried on the charges of trespassing. The protestors were represented by civil rights attorney Ernest A. Finney, who later became a South Carolina Supreme Court Justice. Each student was forced to either pay a $100 fine or serve thirty days labor at the York County Prison Farm. Some chose to carryout their days on the Prison Farm, as $100 was more than they could afford. Their sentences began on February 2 of that year.<br /> <br /> Despite efforts by Rock Hill officials, the protests at McCrory’s become a nationwide story. The original nine protesters become known in the national press as the “Friendship Nine”,  reminiscent of the “Greensboro Four”. This inspired another movement known as the “Jail no Bail” protest. Prior to the “Friendship Nine” accepting their charges from McCrory’s, most posted bail when they could. As an act of solidarity, protestors had begun instead serving out their sentences. For protestors, this was an opportunity to continue the fight for equality in the most nonviolent manner. Further demonstrations and arrests followed in Rock Hill and throughout the United States, spurring national politicians to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which desegregated public accommodations such as five and dime stores like McCrory’s, along with department stores, restaurants, bus terminals, and government buildings. McCrory’s Five and Dime store of Rock Hill, South Carolina is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As of June 2021, the site became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a>.<br /> <br /> <i>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements.</i></p>",

The plaza features statues of Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, York, George Druillard, and Lewis’ dog Seaman. The plaza commemorates June 4, 1804, when the expedition camped in the area. Then, proceed to the north side of the Capitol to view the Louisiana Purchase statue, originally designed for the 1904 World’s Fair. One can get a great view of the Missouri River from this location. On the south side of the Capitol is a large statue of Thomas Jefferson, commemorating the namesake for the city.</p> <p>After touring the Capitol grounds, venture inside to see the Missouri State Museum, which encompasses both wings on the first floor, to learn about the history and resources of the state. The governor’s portraits in the first-floor, west wing have paintings of both Lewis and Clark honoring their respective terms as Missouri Territorial Governors. Throughout the Capitol are a variety of artworks related to the expedition. Proceed to the second floor hallway to view the lunette mural titled, “Lewis and Clark at the Mouth of the Osage River.” Then go up one floor to the third-floor Rotunda to view the Lewis and Clark statues and associated lunettes. From the windows of the Senate viewing gallery doors on the fourth-floor you can view the large mural titled, “Jefferson, Lewis and Clark.”</p> <p>After seeing the resources of the Capitol Complex, venture downtown for coffee, lunch, and shopping. Then go to the Jefferson City Greenway Skywalk Trail to walk over the Missouri River (adjacent to the highway bridge) and have a splendid view of downtown Jefferson City. At the Carl R. Noren Access, you can walk right up to the river’s bank. The Noren Access will also lead you to the KATY hiking/biking trail, which crosses virtually the entire state east-west.</p> <p>If you want a short-road trip, drive eight miles east to Clark’s Hill/Norton State Historic Site and enjoy the same view that William Clark did on June 2, 1804, when the expedition camped at the base of the hill, and Clark decided to climb to the top of the hill to enjoy its view.</p>",

The building undertook an extensive renovation and restoration in 2018, and today the St. Nicholas Landmark offers upscale pub favorites, amazing entrees and specials, and fresh, local craft beer brewed at its sister location, the St. Nicholas Brewing Co., in nearby Du Quoin, Illinois.

The building was designed by prominent Richmond architects J. Binford Walford and O. Pendleton Wright of Walford & Wright, Architect. The building served for some 40 years as the principal administrative offices for statewide services for the blind, as well as provided vocational training, an ophthalmological clinic, and a regional Braille and “talking machine books” libraries. The success of the school would not have been attainable without its significant associated with Lucian Louis Watts. Watts’ efforts and achievements in his life were addressing the social welfare of the blind population of the Commonwealth. Watts was acknowledged as a leader in demonstrating the ability of a state agency to deliver a wide range of services to blind adults and children. Watts was involved in the founding of state and national organizations for the blind, namely, the Virginia Association of Workers for the Blind (now Virginia Industries for the Blind), the Virginia Commission for the Blind (now the Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired), and the American Foundation for the Blind. His work influenced educational and training opportunities for blind Virginians for more than 30 years, and his legacy has continued to the present day.",

The other was a tributary of the Yellowstone which Clark called “Yorks Dry Creek.” However, it was later renamed “Custer Creek.” The cluster of islands were officially designated as “Yorks Islands” by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in 2000, following a push for recognition by the Crimson Bluffs Chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, located in Townsend, MT. While the islands are predominately privately owned, there is public access available at the Yorks Islands Fishing Access Site, located along the Missouri 3.6 miles south of Townsend, Montana.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "Ledges Trailhead. 275 words This covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel sits along a wide, paved path which is a continuation of the Ledges Road which provides automobile access to this area. The path then passes the Ledges Shelter on the left and heads into the woods. As you face the kiosk the parking lot lies over your left shoulder. The shelter with its restrooms may be reached by a path at the left end of the parking lot or by passing the kiosk and turning left to cross the grassy lawn. The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern edge of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. Managed by different agencies over the years, the park gave area residents more space for recreation and play. Most of the Virginia Kendall structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.” The bulletin board to the right of the panel has maps showing the network of looping trails available near this point.

            "bodyText": "<h3>The Corps of Discovery and the Nez Perce</h3> <p>Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery traveled through Nez Perce country in the fall of 1805. After some initial apprehension, the Nez Perce embraced the expedition and provided help when the party was nearing starvation. After journeying further west, Lewis and Clark returned in the spring of 1806. They spent more time with the Nez Perce than any other tribe encountered during their expedition.</p> <p>Lewis and Clark engaged in a diplomatic exchange with Nez Perce chiefs. The captains sought to establish trading posts and intertribal peace in the region. The Nez Perce were willing to cooperate as long as guns and other weaponry were provided to the tribe.</p> <p>Like their Shoshone neighbors, the Nez Perce were without guns or ammunition. This left them vulnerable to their enemies who could obtain weapons from Canadian traders and also hampered their ability to hunt buffalo. The Nez Perce were known for their horsemanship and breeding, especially the Appaloosa horses, which provided a great advantage in traversing long distances in order to hunt and fish.</p> <h3>The Flight of 1877</h3> <p>Chief Joseph’s father refused to sign the 1863 Treaty. On June 15, 1877, The Wallowa Band of  Nez Perce (Nimíipuu) fled their homelands in Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon to escape being forced to move to the reservation in Idaho. They hoped to evade violent engagements with settlers and the United States Army and find a more peaceful existence living according to their traditions. An estimated 750 to 800 men, women and children and 250 warriors were pursued by military which included the 7th Infantry and 7th Calvary of the U.S. Army. They set off near Wallowa Lake in eastern Oregon and traveled a circuitous 1,170 miles over five months through Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The Tribe planned to ally with the Crow for security, but when the Crow refused aid, the Tribe headed toward the Canadian border.</p> <h3>Route through Yellowstone National Park</h3> <p>They entered Yellowstone National Park on August 23. Only a small part of the route taken by the Nez Perce who fled from the US Army in 1877 went through Yellowstone (established in 1872), and they largely eluded their pursuers while there.</p> <p>During their time here, the Nez Perce encountered about 25 visitors in the young park, some more than once. Warriors took hostage or attacked several of these tourists, killing two. The group continued traveling through the park and over the Absaroka Mountains into Montana. </p> <h3>Nez Perce Commemorative Sites in Yellowstone</h3> <p>Although none of the officially designated historic sites associated with the Nez Perce are located in Yellowstone, the historic trail goes through the park, and it is considered a sacred place by many Nez Perce who have continued to honor their ancestors and carry on their memories through ceremonies conducted in the park.</p> <h3>End of the Flight</h3> <p>Leaving Yellowstone, the Nez Perce continued their flight to Canada. Along the way, the Nez Perce warriors valiantly fought U.S. military and citizen volunteers across a series of battles. But starved and exhausted from the journey and persistent clashes, the brave Chief Joseph surrendered following a battle near Bears Paw Mountains in Montana, less than 40 miles from the Canadian border. It is here that it is believed the flight ended and Chief Joseph said, “From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.”<br /> <br /> Led by Chief White Bird, nearly 300 Nez Perce men, women and children managed to escape the battle at Bears Paw and make their way into Canada where they joined Sitting Bull and the Lakota near Fort Walsh. Following surrender, the Nez Perce were sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and eventually to reservations in Oklahoma, where deplorable conditions led to the death of most babies born on the Indian Territory. Today, the trail represents a sacred journey, connecting the surviving Nez Perce people to the past, present and future.</p> <h3><strong>Auto Tours:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Travelers can retrace the Nez Perce National Historical Trail by car along more than 1,500 miles of federal, state and county roads narrated by the Auto Route, with trail signs along the way.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/maps-pubs/?cid=fsbdev3_055663\">Auto Tour Pamphlets </a>with maps, history and points of interest of all eight segments of the trail</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=45.890008,-116.828613&spn=1.911731,3.295898&hl=en&msa=0&z=8&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zv7KavdVnCwU.kid9pjyMdX-c\">Google Map </a>of Nez Perce Historic Trail Auto Tour</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Hiking/Horseback Tours</strong></h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.discovernw.org/store_1877-nez-perce-flight-nez-perce-nee-me-poo-national-historic-trail-map_18998.html\">Trail Map </a>with modern-day travel routes and sites to visit along the trail.</li> <li>Essential Trail Companion: Following the Nez Perce Trail, A Guide to the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail with Eyewitness Accounts by Cheryl Wilfong</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6BdkOyoCAPkATlA!/?ss=110199&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=null&navid=151120000000000&pnavid=151000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&ttype=main&pname=Nez%20Perce%20National%20Historic%20Trail-%20Outdoor%20Safety%20&%20Ethics\">Outdoor Safety & Ethics </a>&<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/home/?cid=stelprdb5245913\"> FAQs</a></li> <li>Each summer, the Nez Perce Trail Foundation offers a week-long driving, hiking and camping <a href=\"http://nezpercetrail.net/summer-educational-trail-tour/\">educational tour </a>of the trail, visiting sites that include Wallowa Valley, Lolo Trail, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Big Hole Battlefield and Tamkaliks Celebration & Friendship Feast.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Bear Paw Battlefield is the site of the final conflict of the Nez Perce War and Flight of 1877.</li> <li>Beartooth All-American Road: Lush forests become alpine tundra in just a few miles on the highest elevation road in the Northern Rockies, with access to Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>The Chief <a href=\"https://travelwyoming.com/listing/yellowstone-national-park/chief-joseph-scenic-byway\">Joseph Scenic Byway in northwest Wyoming</a> links the town of Cody with the Beartooth Highway and the Northeast Gate of Yellowstone National Park.

            "audioDescription": "Nez Perce National Historic Trail921 wordsThere are 4 sections in this description.Section 1 (314 words)You are standing in front of a large wayside exhibit located alongside Nez Perce Creek Pullout. The exhibit kiosk is trimmed with brown wood and shaded by a shingled gable roof; it stands atop a low stone base. There is one panel on each side of the exhibit. The panel on the north side of the kiosk is entitled \"\"Chance Encounter.\" A large painting features several Native American people-men, women, and children-either sitting or standing in a grassy meadow. In the center of the painting, one man sits atop a pale horse. A caption on the painting's right side tells us:\"On a summer night in 1877, hundreds of \"non-treaty\" Nez Perce-bands refusing confinement on a reservation-camped near here. They journeyed 1,170 miles (1,883 kilometers) in their quest for freedom.\"More text below the exhibit title reads: \"Across the meadow, a fire burned in the campsite of nine tourists on the night of August 23, 1877. The Cowan party had unknowingly camped near hundreds of Nez Perce men, women, and children who were under violent pursuit by the United States Army. Through the darkness, the Cowan's firelight flickered and was spotted by Hemene Moxmox (Yellow Wolf) and other Nez Perce scouts. With the heightened instincts of war-torn hearts, the scouts entered the camp at daybreak. They dared not risk the Army learning the whereabouts of their people. Instead of taking chances, they took the tourists with them.\"The coming hours revealed human emotions found in any war: fear, anger, and compassion. A Nez Perce leader, Wa-wook-ke-ya Was Sauw (Lean Elk), released the campers with a warning to stay hidden, but the small group was later overtaken. This time tempers flared. George Cowan was shot and left for dead, but eventually made a full recovery. Others sustained shots or escaped. Emma Cowan and her siblings were released unharmed the following day.\"Section 2 (236 words)The panel on the south side of the exhibit kiosk is entitled \"Nez Perce War: Journey through Yellowstone.\" Text below the exhibit title reads:\"On August 23, 1877, more than 600 men, women, and children camped in the woods near here. Sustained by courage, social structure, and knowledge of the land, they were midway from their homeland in Eastern Oregon to the hope of freedom in Canada. They carried with them the burden of grief from the loss of their homeland and the sharp pain of losing loved ones.\"With them were two thousand horses. Behind them were hundreds of soldiers. Within them were strength, endurance, and the ability to face enemies and atrocities. This was the Nez Perce War of 1877.\"Section 3 (228 words)More text highlights the history of the times leading up to the conflict and the war itself: \"Mounting Pressure. For more than two decades, the Nez Perce endured pressure to sign away their homeland and live on a reservation. In I 877, United States government representatives ordered \"non-treaty\" Nez Perce-bands standing firmly against confinement-onto the reservation.\"The War Begins. Conflict erupted, followed by battle in White Bird Canyon. The soldiers were quickly defeated. General Howard arrived with reinforcements, but the Nez Perce eluded them in rugged terrain.\"As the war continued, Chiefs Toohoolhoolzote, Five Wounds, Rainbow and others strategized tactics. Chief Heinmot Tooyalakeket (Chief Joseph, left) led the elderly men, women, and children.\"\"Tragedy at Dawn. The Nez Perce gained many miles on General Howard. But on August 9th, Colonel Gibbon's soldiers swooped into the sleeping Nez Perce camp, killing men, women, and children. Warriors leapt to defend their people.\"Like many others, Chief Joseph's wife was wounded severely at Big Hole. In combat, he protected their newborn in his arms.\"Hope and Heartache. The Nez Perce out-maneuvered and battled their foes repeatedly, upheld both young and old, and withstood unthinkable losses. Under unrelenting pursuit, they traveled 1,170 miles, eventually falling short on supplies. In the bitter cold of late September, just 40 miles from Canada, they were overtaken. With hearts heavy and torn, they surrendered.\"Section 4 (231 words)Also featured on this panel is a large map drawing detailing the route of the Nez Perce and the commands of General Howard, Colonel Gibbon, Colonel Sturgis, and Colonel Miles during the Nez Perce War of 1877. A half dozen army forts are also marked on the map.The route of the Nez Perce leads from the west in Oregon Territory, northeast through Idaho Territory toward Fort Missoula in western Montana Territory, then south and east again to Camas Meadows in eastern Idaho Territory. From here, the route heads further east and then north through Wyoming Territory to Canyon Creek in south central Montana Territory and finally through Bear Paw in the north central section of Montana Territory. Indicated by black \"x\" marks are battle sites at Clearwater and White Bird Canyo",

            "bodyText": "Industrialist and philanthropist, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. was a major benefactor in the creation of George Washington Birthplace National Monument. He purchased 275 acres and held the land in trust until the Wakefield National Memorial Association completed their building vision of the Popes Creek Plantation where George Washington was born. Rockefeller’s philanthropy at the birthplace did not stop once the land was turned over to the National Park Service in 1932.<br /> <br /> In May 1937, Rockefeller offered to donate three of his retired carriage horses – one Morgan stallion, Gipsey King, and two mares, Minerva and Nunda. Superintendent Philip Hough agreed, with the hopes of breeding the Morgan stallion to produce saddle mounts for mounted rangers at other parks within the National Park Service. After discussing the idea with the NPS, Hough secured a promise that a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp, already working at nearby Westmoreland State Park, would construct a horse barn, paddock, and fencing, if the horses were donated.<br /> <br /> By July of the same year, Rockefeller had sent the horses on their way to the park, before the barn had even been built. Concerns had risen during the months before the horses arrived about disturbing archeological resources where the barn was to be built. This concern had delayed the planning and building of the barn. But with the horses en route, the NPS proceeded with plans to build the horse barn in the historic area core.<br /> <br /> Construction of the horse barn continued throughout the winter of 1937 and by February 1938, the project had been completed.<br /> <br /> Hough’s plan to breed the horses appears to have met with some success in the early years as three colts, Wakefield Duke, Black Baron, and Gipsey Chief, sired by the stallion, Gipsey King, were sent to Yellowstone a few years later.<br /> <br /> As the country struggled economically due to World War II, the park’s care and maintenance of the Rockefeller horses were no longer a priority and the plan of breeding the Morgan horses ended.<br /> <br />  ",

Its current building was erected in 1904. Beyond serving as a space for community and worship, St. Paul UMC has also played a critical role in the pursuit of civil rights.<br /> <br /> In 1956, just after the current church building was erected, St. Paul served as the site of meetings to integrate Birmingham buses. During Project \"C\" (for \"conflict\") in the spring of 1963, St. Paul UMC hosted meetings and training sessions in nonviolent civil disobedience for demonstration participants. Great personal restraint was needed to face violence with peaceful protest. These trainings were instrumental to achieving the goals of Project C, also known as the Birmingham Campaign. Also during Project C, St. Paul UMC served as the mustering point for the Palm Sunday Children’s March in 1963, which ended with police, dogs, and fire hoses aggressively dispersing the nonviolent marchers under the eye of national media. Images of snarling dogs attacking children participants, some as young as 6, served as an inflection point for a nation grappling with racism's legacy. Notoriously callous Eugene “Bull” Connor, the Commissioner for Public Safety, led the police forces that day. Laveeda M. Battle, parishioner at St. Paul UMC, points out the juxtaposition between Connor’s faith and actions: </p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{c62c7a97-afd9-4a42-9d76-60ef50afec0b}{34}\" paraid=\"891417443\">Here we had children marching from a Methodist church for equality and we had a United Methodist as the Commissioner over public safety, siccing dogs and having fire hoses turned on children. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c62c7a97-afd9-4a42-9d76-60ef50afec0b}{44}\" paraid=\"1159695792\">- Laveeda M. Battle </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{c62c7a97-afd9-4a42-9d76-60ef50afec0b}{50}\" paraid=\"1983773895\">Eventually, the church-led efforts to desegregate Birmingham rippled across the nation. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed in large part due to Project C and the faith-driven individuals and institutions, banded together in the belief that a better society could be built.<br /> <br /> Today, St. Paul UMC still serves as a place of worship and continues to host events promoting civil rights. Visitors can sit in the pews and marvel at the stained glass windows. Of particular interest is the design in the far left corner, dreamed up by a middle-school student to represent the story of the Civil Rights Movement and the faith that guided it. Descend into the basement where Movement participants met to strategize desegregation efforts, and where civil rights leaders such as Dr. King encouraged action. Ask the parishioners about their experiences during the movement - many will tell you riveting accounts of what they lived and breathed through during this historic pursuit of civil rights in the Deep South.</p>",

Sequoia trees line the path that stretches ahead along the right side of the meadow.<br /><br />On the upper corners of this wayside exhibit frame are tactile sequoia cones made of brass. The cones have been flattened on the bottom to help secure them to the frames. Most wayside exhibits on this trail have similar cones.<br /><br />A background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of sequoias against a dark sky.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Prime Sequoia Habitat<br /><br />Welcome to one of the best places on earth for giant sequoias. In Giant Forest sequoias grow bigger than anywhere else, and Round Meadow is one of the best sequoia habitats within Giant Forest.<br /><br />As you circle Round Meadow on the Big Trees Trail, notice where these magnificent trees thrive and where they do not. Where are they largest? Where are they absent? As you walk the trail you can learn what factors determine where sequoias grow.<br /><br />The map shows a long, rough oval shape with the words \"Round Meadow\" in the center. Surrounding the shape is a series of dots that cross each other at the bottom edge of Round Meadow, indicating a loop trail. The words \"You are Here\" are above and to the right of where the dots cross. The text reads,<br /><br />Big Trees Trail<br />Distance 0.6 miles (or 1.0 km)<br /><br />Accessibility<br /><br />The trail is very flat with no steps. It is paved except for small stretches of wooden boardwalk.<br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />In memory of John Palmer.<br /><br />The Big Trees Trail is dedicated to John Palmer, Chief Park Interpreter from 1969 to 1987. His vision, a Giant Forest preserved for the sequoias and the people who want to experience them, has finally come. <br /><br />Additional wayside exhibits along this trail will be described as if you are continuing on this trail to the right and circling the meadow counterclockwise.",

Sequoia roots can't live in this soggy soil. Rainwater and melting snow drain here from the surrounding hills. The water collects in a depression in the bedrock, creating this moist opening.<br /><br />Yet giant sequoias need enormous amounts of water. By growing near the meadow but not in it, they can benefit. Their roots capture moisture as it drains toward the meadow.<br /><br />A background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of giant sequoia trees against a dark sky. An illustration, layered on the top of the photo, shows sequoia trees on the right and left side of a meadow. A section cuts through the ground, revealing a pool of water collecting below the meadow on bedrock.<br /><br />A line stretches across the meadow, between the two trees.<br /><br />The text for this line reads,<br /><br />Too Wet for Trees to Grow<br /><br />The amount of water in the meadow varies with the season. In Spring, with winter's snowmelt, there may be standing water across the meadow.",

To avoid congestion, visit earlier or later in the day or on a weekday.  <br /> <i>Winter/Spring (October - June)</i>: The Paradise Meadows are covered in deep snow in winter, but the area remains open for snowshoeing and other winter recreation. The road to Paradise closes nightly at the gate at Longmire typically from November to mid-April depending on weather; always check road status before starting your trip. Snow can linger well into June or even July.  <br /> <br /> Starting from the Muir Steps, a set of steps inscribed with a quote by John Muir, a network of trails weave through the famous subalpine meadows of Paradise. There is a ramp to access the trails to the right of the Muir Steps. Views along the trails include Mount Rainier as well as the Tatoosh Range, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and the Cascade Range. Look for wildlife, including black-tailed deer, marmots, and birds, in the meadows. The meadows fill with a wide variety of flowers, with peak bloom in late July or early August, and can have colorful fall foliage starting in September. During the winter, trails in Paradise are covered by a deep layer of snow and are mostly unmarked. Snowshoers should have experience with route finding and avalanche terrain. Always check current conditions before heading out and be prepared with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/hiking-safety.htm\">Ten Essentials</a>.<br /> <br /> Please do not feed any wildlife. Stay on the trail at all times to protect the delicate subalpine vegetation. Pets are not allowed on trails. Download a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/upload/2019-Paradise-Area-Trails_508.pdf\">Paradise Area Trails Map</a> or pick up a map from a ranger at the Jackson Visitor Center before starting your hike.<br /> <br /> <b>Skyline Trail - </b>5.5 miles round-trip, 1700 feet elevation gain.<br /> The Skyline Trail is the premiere loop trail through the Paradise Meadows. There are several side trails to modify the main route, which may add or decrease the total trail length and elevation change of your hike.<br /> <br /> Hiking the loop clockwise, the trail climbs 2 miles until reaching Panorama Point, where a toilet is provided for hikers. Past Panorama Point use of the High Skyline Trail avoids a dangerous icy slope that does not melt. This connects back to the Skyline above the junction with Golden Gate trail (an alternative for a shorter hike). Another 0.75 mile and the Skyline Trail reaches the Stevens-Van Trump Memorial and its junction with the Paradise Glacier Trail. From there it descends into the Paradise Valley, then climbs slightly to Myrtle Falls and finally back to Paradise.<br /> <br /> <b>Deadhorse Creek Trail and Moraine Trail</b> - 2.5 miles round-trip, 400 feet elevation gain.<br /> For excellent views of the Nisqually Glacier, follow Deadhorse Creek Trail to Glacier Vista and return via the Skyline Trail.<br /> <br /> <b>Alta Vista via the Alta Vista and Skyline Trails</b> - 1.75 miles round-trip, 600 feet elevation gain.<br /> Follow the Skyline Trail and then climb up to Alta Vista at 5,940 feet for views of Mount Rainier and the surrounding Paradise Meadows. Return via the Alta Vista Trail.<br /> <br /> <b>Lakes Trail Loop, via Reflection Lake</b> - 5 miles round-trip, 1300 feet elevation gain.<br /> This trail follows the southern portion of the Skyline Trail to connect to the Lakes Trail and loop around the Paradise Valley. Consider parking at Reflection Lakes and hiking up to Paradise, then returning downhill to your vehicle.<br /> <br /> <b>Skyline Trail to Myrtle Falls</b> - 1 mile round-trip, 100 feet elevation gain.<br /> Suitable for wheelchairs with help and strollers, this easy portion of the Skyline Trail leads to a scenic waterfall with views of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> <b>Nisqually Vista Trail - </b>1.2 miles round-trip, 200 feet elevation gain.<br /> Connect to the Nisqually Vista Trail from the main Paradise Meadows Trailhead or start this trail from the west end of lower Paradise parking lot. This easy trail features viewpoints overlooking the Nisqually Glacier and Nisqually River Valley.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Muir Steps, and the trailhead to the Paradise Meadows, is on the north side of the Paradise upper parking lot, between the Jackson Visitor Center and the Plaza (slate) restrooms. The steps are light grey stone and framed by low stone walls and lead up to a paved path that heads through the meadows towards the summit of Mount Rainier. On the vertical sides of the steps text reads \"\"...the most luxuriant and most extravagantly beautiful of all the / alpine gardens I have ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings.\"/ - John Muir, conservationist, 1889.\" A three-panel wayside with trail information stands to the left of the steps while a long paved trail provides a ramp around the steps on the right side. The paved trails in Paradise are approximately 6-8 feet across. Edges of the trail can be rough with some short drops due to erosion and is often bordered by a low rope to discourage off-trail hiking. The trail is completely snow covered in winter, with patches of snow and ice lingering into June or July. As the trails climb in elevation, paved trails give way to narrower dirt trails often broken by rock steps and uneven terrain. The portion of the Skyline Trail to Myrtle Falls and most of the Nisqually Vista Trail have a medium-to-gentle slope. The trails are surrounded by patches of lush subalpine meadow, filled with blooming wildflowers during the summer months, and interspersed with patches of subalpine firs and mountain hemlock trees.",

Model map builder Bob Miller used information from topographic maps and overflights of the area to construct the model in his basement. It took over a year to complete. He cut the map into seven pieces to be transported to the opening of the Glen Canyon Visitor Center, later renamed after Arizona senator and water use proponent Carl Hayden.<br /> <br /> This terrain relief model of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and vicinity can only be described as precisely accurate. The topography shown was based on both topographic maps and aerial photographs. Everything on the map actually exists just as it appears to, considering the vertical scale of the model. When it was installed at the visitor center at Glen Canyon Dam, is was oriented to real life. You could use it for wayfinding.<br /> <br /> In 2017, during the instalation of new exhibits at Carl Hayden Visitor Center, the relief map was cut into the original seven peices and removed from the building.

The violence raised a nationwide public outcry, hastening integration in America's most segregated city.</p> <p>Birmingham, site of the first mass beatings of Freedom Riders, was selected by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) for a massive protest campaign. Kelly Ingram Park (historically known as West Park), was an assembly point for participants in the SCLC's Project \"C,\" (for Confrontation)--sit-ins, boycotts, marches, and jailings designed to end segregation in Birmingham. Under the on site direction of SCLC President Martin Luther King, Jr., and local SCLC affiliate Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, department stores were targeted for boycotts and protest marches organized. Dr. King was arrested and held in solitary confinement for three days, during which he wrote, smuggled out of jail, and had printed his \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" a profoundly moving justification for the moral necessity of non-violent resistance to unjust laws.</p> <p>When police filled the jails with mass arrests and depleted the ranks of adult demonstrators, the SCLC called on the city's children to join the protests. On May 2, under orders from Public Safety Commissioner Bull Connor, police arrested 600 child picketers (some as young as six years of age); by the next day, 1,000 children had been jailed. In the days that followed, firemen blasted the protestors, including children, with high-pressure fire hoses, and police used their nightsticks indiscriminately. Police K-9 units loosed their dogs into crowds of peaceful demonstrators, pinning down one woman and severely wounding three teenagers. One young bystander was whirled around by a policeman into the jaws of his German Shepherd. An Associated Press photographer standing nearby captured the incident, which quickly became the symbol of the unrest in Birmingham.</p> <p>Fearful of a race riot and worried about lost business, local businesses made a \"pact\" with the SCLC, but Alabama's Governor Wallace disavowed any settlement and Bull Connor urged whites to boycott the stores involved. To prevent any violence that would undermine the agreement, President Kennedy ordered 3,000 Army troops to the outskirts of the city. Local merchants removed their \"whites only\" signs and desegregated their lunch counters. The newly-elected mayor repealed the city's Jim Crow laws and eventually desegregated the library, city golf courses, public buildings, and finally the schools.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

Here on a quiet day you can even hear the distant roar of white water. If we can hear it over three miles away through dead space, how loud must it be at the river itself?",
            "audioDescription": "From the shuttle bus stop, move 80 feet (24 m) east along a two-foot (60 cm) high stone wall lining the inside of the asphalt sidewalk to a three-foot (1 m) wide opening on your left. Move away from the road down three stone steps onto another asphalt sidewalk, and proceed 20 feet (6 m) forward to a vast overlook lined with a four-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing running left-to-right along the edge of the canyon.<br />At the northernmost corner of a wide promontory, Pima Point provides a vista of over 40 miles (64 km) along Grand Canyon, from Bright Angel Canyon in the east all the way west to Powell Plateau and the Great Scenic Divide. Grand Canyon rock layers are on full display from the two-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the canyon up through the various layers of sandstone, shale, and limestone all the way up to the rim.<br />Far below, the Colorado River is visible in several places as it winds through deep gorges, including Granite Rapids to the east. Stand still, be quiet, close your eyes. Can you hear the distant roar of the rapids, or the wing beat of a passing raven? <br />Various sections of the Hermit Trail are in view, zigzagging down through rocky buttes, as are the meandering paths of numerous side creeks lined with green vegetation. Debris flows appear in several places on the faces of the canyon walls, evidence of side washes where raging water rushed over cliff edges, triggering avalanches of rock, mud, water, and depositing boulders in their wake, and sometimes all the way into the river below.",

Text at the top right reads: \"Revealing Features Mary Colter's attention to detail is reflected in every element of the Desert View Watchtower. Each rock and painted wall was intended to convey meaning. Colter used ornamental details, seeming haphazardly, to create an added charm of the unexpected. Find triangular and diamond patterned rocks, horizontal bands of different sizes, and actual petroglyphs with pecked designs. The tower features T-shaped doors and tapered windows like buildings hundreds of years old. Colter used uneven masonry surfaces to \"create shadow and give more vigor to the walls.\" At the bottom left of the panel, text continues: \"Stories Preserved in Stone Many ideas from Colter's research trips emerge in this architectural masterpiece. Climb the 85 steps and allow the artists' and masons' details to reveal themselves.\" The first of 4 black-and-white photographs to the right shows a man wearing jeans, a long-sleeve white shirt, and a headband standing next to a T-shaped stone door from Chaco Culture National Historical Park, followed by a close-up of diamond-patterned rocks from the same location. The next picture of petroglyphs from the Painted Desert shows various animal and human figures and a sun spirit. The last photograph shows a couple perpendicular stone walls with intermingled rows of roughly rectangular- and triangular-shaped stones—examples of ornamental masonry from Wupatki National Monument.",

The Center is a self-guided museum featuring rotating and permanent exhibits. Dedicated to sharing Shawnee culture, the center hosts a variety of events that allow visitors to take part in, and experience, this vibrant heritage.</p> <p>The Center’s mission is to provide a place for Shawnees to tell the story of their past, how that past informs and shapes Shawnees today, and who they see themselves becoming tomorrow. Through interactive exhibits visitors can listen to stories of the past, learn about traditions, and help envision the tribe’s future.</p> <p>The Shawnee exhibit visually tells the story of the Shawnee people through objects that represent essential aspects of Shawnee life— both today and throughout history. The installation displays no written information. Shawnee language, like many indigenous languages, is not traditionally a written language. History and ways of life are deeply rooted in oral tradition, with knowledge being shared and sustained from one generation to the next. While much has been written about Shawnee culture, a considerable amount of the information is incomplete. From sacred ceremonies to family stories, the exhibit supports Shawnee people in telling their own story. It invites conversation and investigations about Shawnee culture, with consideration for different ways of learning, sharing, and preserving.</p> <p>The Shawnee Tribe Cultural Center also features work by tribal artists, like that of Shawnee artist Gibson Byrd, who was a lifelong artist and educator. To honor his passion for art and teaching, interactive art exploration activities accompany the display. Past shows include “From Ancient Hands,” the center’s inaugural, award-winning exhibition featuring historic Shawnee pottery as well as contemporary pottery made in partnership with community members as well as scholars and scientists.</p>",

Early in her career, Slowe was so highly regarded that the District chose her to establish the first African American junior high school in the city. But it was as the first Dean of Women at Howard University where Slowe left her greatest mark. During her tenure at Howard, she supported expanding educational opportunities for women students. She helped introduce curriculum changes and persuaded female students to pursue careers outside of education, further diversifying opportunity for females attending Howard. Slowe’s relationship with her students extended beyond the classroom to the confines of her own home in the District of Columbia. <br /> <br /> In her role as Dean of Women, Slowe oversaw the construction of the university’s first women’s dormitories. Beyond her prescribed duties at Howard, Slowe founded the National Association of College Women, which she led as president for several years before it evolved to become the National Association of University Women. Slowe also founded the Association of Advisors to Women in Colored Schools, the Association of Deans of Women and Advisors to Girls in Negro Schools, and assisted civic leader Mary McLeod Bethune in the 1935 creation of the National Council of Negro Women, where she served as the secretary. Slowe was additionally involved with the Young Women’s Christian Association and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom and was also regularly consulted by women in administrative roles at other universities nationwide, who wrote to her for professional advice.<br /> <br /> The Queen Ann style home was built by James T. Ward in 1890, and in 1922 Slowe and Burrill bought the house together. Slowe’s partner, Mary Burrill was also a dedicated educator throughout her life. She taught at several District schools during her career, but her longest tenure was at Dunbar High School. Slowe and Burrill remain the best-known example of a same-sex female couple in Washington, DC during the early twentieth century. The women largely practiced discretion and led private lives due to societal non-acceptance of alternative lifestyles at this time. Slowe and Burrill lived together as life partners for more than twenty years. Their relationship parallels same sex relationships in the District, where individuals were pressured to remain “in the closet” to escape persecution and societal prejudice against LGBTQ lifestyles during the early twentieth century. Concealing lifestyle and sexual preferences during this time was critical to self-preservation, especially for those with social and professional goals. <br /> <br /> Same-sex cohabitation among single women became increasingly common in the African American community during the 1920s. However, this did not extend to an acceptance of gay and lesbian lifestyles. It is generally believed that Slowe and Burrill concealed their relationship from the public eye in order to live together while also pursuing their own professional goals. In the era they lived, society did not accept either equal rights for African Americans or LGBTQ individuals. Even the African American community proved mostly unwilling to accept same sex relationships or alternative lifestyles. This can be partly attributed to the beliefs of some of the community that achieving civil rights meant obtaining public respectability from the white community, and alternative lifestyles that flaunted social norms were not viewed as respectable.",

The Hohokam called the Sonoran Desert home, cleverly adapting their way of life to the desert’s scarce and variable rainfall. A small settlement stood on the edges of this wash, inhabited from late spring through the fall. Hohokam family-groups spent the hot dry foresummer (May, June and July) planting rows of drought-tolerant crops: corn, tepary beans and squash. Irrigation ditches were dug between the rows and down into the wash below. When the monsoon rains of August began to pour onto the parched earth, the water collected in washes and flash-flooding occurred.<br /> <br /> Dams were built in strategic places to divert the floodwaters into irrigation ditches where the water would be most useful. In a months time, and with less than four inches of rain, crops would mature and produce a staple food source, without which humans could not have survived this environment.<br /> <br /> The Tohono O’odham continued these dry-land farming practices learned from their Hohokam ancestors. They built shade structures called <i>ramadas</i>, similar to those in our picnic areas, to shelter them from the harsh summer sun as they lived alongside the wash. They spent months planting crops and harvesting saguaro and organ pipe fruits, all the while praying and waiting for the life-sustaining rains to come.",

Deep purple fruits called <i>tunas </i>are an important food in many parts of Mexico and among Native Americans. The flat pads are modified stems, functioning in the place of leaves. The prickly pear has adapted to the desert by keeping its pads straight up and thus only receiving sun on its edges, preventing sunburn under the harsh noon sun.<br /> <br /> These cacti are very important to sustaining animals in the desert. They provide food for the javelina who, like goats, will eat anything. Tortoise love to eat the fruit. Prickly pear cacti prove useful to humans, too. The new pads, or <i>nopales</i>, are filled with juices and may be picked to make a great salad or a bittersweet jelly.",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Who Was Maggie Lena Walker?</strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>In spite of humble beginnings in post-Civil War Richmond, Virginia, Maggie Lena Walker achieved national prominence as a businesswoman and community leader. Her business acumen, personality, and lifelong commitment to a beneficial burial society fueled her climb to success. She was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/historyculture/female-bank-presidents.htm\">the first African American woman in the United States to found a bank</a>. As a leader her successes and vision offered tangible improvements in the way of life for African Americans and women.</p> <p><strong>Achievements</strong></p> <p>When she was a teenager, Maggie Mitchell joined the local council of the Independent Order of St. Luke. This fraternal burial society, established in 1867 in Baltimore, administered to the sick and aged, promoted humanitarian causes and encouraged individual self-help and integrity.</p> <p>She served in numerous capacities of increasing responsibility for the Order, from that of a delegate to the biannual convention to the top leadership position of Right Worthy Grand Secretary in 1899, a position she held until her death. Under her leadership the Order's membership and numbers of councils were significantly increased throughout the country and its finances achieved solvency. Through sound fiscal policies, a genius for public relations and enormous energy, she took a dying organization, gave it life and helped it thrive.</p> <p>In 1902 Mrs. Walker established a newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/historyculture/st-luke-herald.htm\">The St. Luke Herald</a>, to promote closer communication between the Order and the public. In speeches Mrs. Walker had reasoned, \"Let us put our money together; let us use our money; Let us put our money out at usury among ourselves, and reap the benefit ourselves.\" In 1903 she founded the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/the-st-luke-penny-savings-bank.htm\">St. Luke Penny Savings Bank</a>. Mrs. Walker served as the bank's first president, which earned her the recognition of being the first African American woman to charter a bank in the United States. Later she agreed to serve as chairman of the board of directors when the bank merged with two other Richmond banks to become The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company. Until 2009, the bank thrived as the oldest continually African American-operated bank in the United States.</p> <p>In addition to her work for the Independent Order of St. Luke, Maggie Walker was active in civic groups. As an advocate of African American women's rights, she served on the board of trustees for several women's groups. Among them were the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) and the Virginia Industrial School for Girls. To assist race relations she helped to organize and served locally as vice president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was a member of the national NAACP board. She also served as a member of the Virginia Interracial Commission.</p> <p><strong>Family Life</strong></p> <p>Maggie Lena Mitchell was born in Richmond, Virginia July 15, 1864. Her mother, Elizabeth Draper, was a former slave and assistant cook in the Church Hill mansion of Elizabeth Van Lew, a Civil War spy. Later, Elizabeth and her husband William Mitchell moved the family to their own home in an alley between Broad and Marshall streets where Maggie and her brother Johnnie were raised. After the untimely death of William Mitchell in 1876, Maggie's mother supported the family by working as a laundress and young Maggie helped by delivering the clean clothes.</p> <p>Maggie Mitchell was educated in Richmond's public schools. After graduation she taught grade school for three years. Her teaching career ended in 1886 when she married Armstead Walker, Jr. She then directed her energies toward caring for her family and strengthening the Independent Order of St. Luke. Life was full and prosperous for the Walkers and their sons, Russell and Melvin.</p> <p>Tragedy struck in 1915 when her husband was accidentally killed, leaving Mrs. Walker to manage a large household. Her work and investments kept the family comfortably situated. When her sons married they brought their wives to 110 1/2 East Leigh Street. A major addition to the house in 1922 enabled Mrs. Walker to provide a home for her sons and their families, her mother, and the household staff.</p> <p>Mrs. Walker's health gradually declined, and by 1928 she was using a wheelchair. Despite her physical limitations she remained actively committed to her life's work including chairman of the bank and leader of the Independent Order of St. Luke until her death on December 15,1934.</p> <p><strong>The House</strong></p> <p>The residence at 110 1/2 East Leigh Street was built in 1883. The address became a prime location in the heart of Jackson Ward, the center of Richmond's African American business and social life at the turn of the century. The Walkers purchased the house in 1904 and soon began making changes. Central heating and electricity were added, and with the addition of several bedrooms and enclosed porches, the home increased from 9 to 28 rooms. In 1928 an elevator was added in the rear of the house to provide Mrs. Walker access to the second floor.</p> <p>The Walker family owned the home until 1979, when it was purchased by the National Park Service.</p> <p>Most of the furnishings throughout the home are original family pieces. They are valuable in understanding the 1904–1934 period of her occupancy. Together the house and the furnishings help us to learn more about Maggie Walker and the world in which she lived. Her community of Jackson Ward, a National Historic Landmark District, continues to exemplify the success of African American entrepreneurship.</p>",

John Mitchell Jr. was truly a renaissance man. He was born in 1863 at Laburnum in neighboring Henrico County and he attended the public schools of Richmond, graduating from Richmond Colored Normal in 1881.<br /> <br /> After a short stint in teaching, Mitchell would embark upon a career in journalism that would span nearly fifty years. He is perhaps best remembered for being the fiery, fearless editor and publisher of the Richmond Planet newspaper from 1884 until 1929. Mitchell used his pen as a sword to fight injustices locally and statewide. He also tirelessly fought for a federal anti-lynching bill. Mitchell served for a time as president of the Afro-American Press Association. As the founder and president of the Mechanics Savings Bank, he was for a number of years the lone African American member of the American Bankers Association.<br /> <br /> Mitchell was also very active in politics. He served on Richmond’s City Council from 1888 until 1896 and he even ran for governor in 1921 on the Lily Black ticket which included pioneering banker, Mrs. Maggie L. Walker as a candidate for the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Mitchell also played a major role in the 1904 streetcar boycott in Richmond in response to discriminatory practices. John Mitchell, Jr. died in 1929.",

It was without windows, and so was available only at night.\" (p.5)  The black-colored furniture in this room is upholstered with horsehair, which, T.R. recalls \"scratched the bare legs of children.\" (Autobiography, 5)<br /> <br /> As one examines the bookcases, one finds many heirloom books, which the family enjoyed. T.R. himself loved to read. He states \"While I was still a small boy...I already begun to read some of Mayne Reid's books and other boys' books of adventure...I was too young to understand much of Mayne Reid, excepting the adventure part and the natural history part- these enthralled me.\" (Autobiography, p. 15-16). Theodore Roosevelt was encouraged to read what he wanted, unless it was a dime novel or Ouida's books, which were deemed inappropriate for the young boy. One of T.R.'s prized possessions was a couple of books by J.G. Wood that he received from his father. When one looks closely in the bookcases, to this day, one still finds a book on natural history that J.G. Wood wrote. <br /> <br /> Additionally, in his autobiography, Theodore Roosevelt mentions an art piece called the \"Transfiguration\"- Today one sees a replica etching hanging above the fireplace mantle piece.<br /> Looking on the mantle piece, one can spot two black obelisks. These were souvenirs brought back from a trip down the Nile River that the family took in 1872. On that trip, T.R. brought back samples of bird taxidermy for his \"Roosevelt Museum.\" Today, these taxidermy birds are on display at the American Museum of Natural History. ",

On the Mantlepiece sits two black Obelisks and a clock embedded in the base of a statue that depicts Neptune or other Norse God. Above the mantlepiece hangs an etching. On the right side of the fireplace sits a desk/bookcase combo. On the left of the fireplace, a large bookcase full of books. In the center of the room is a table, with a table lamp, and chandelier that hangs from the ceiling. two arm chairs sit at either end of the table. Opposite of the wall with the fireplace there is a large, horsehair sofa, with seats at either end. Hangig on the wall above the sofa are a couple of art pieces. On both ends of the room are passages to the front parlor and the dining room. Pocket doors with decorative plate glass can be drawn closed to separate the rooms.",

The building’s architecture is affectionately known as “parkitecture.” The Civilian Conservation Corps commonly used this style in parks around the country.<br /> <br /> Parkitecture is reminiscent of the craftsmanship of early carpenters. It includes the use of heavy beams, low silhouettes, horizontal lines, and colors and materials found in local surroundings. The Octagon shape here was more complicated, yet it still looks like a natural, almost native part of the landscape. A large grassy playfield sits next to and in harmony with the shelter.<br /> <br /> Today, the Octagon Shelter may be reserved at <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/233367\">recreation.gov</a> by groups and families with up to 50 people for a fee.

Electrical outlets for normal, two-pronged household appliances such as coffee pots and crock pots are available. It does not have centralized heat.

            "audioDescription": "Octagon Shelter. 436 words This wayside graphic panel faces this dark brown, wooden structure. At right the building is shaped like an 8-sided octagon. One of two wide stone fireplace chimneys is on the side closest to us. At left, a wing extends out to the side. During the warmer months, several side panels are removed. Inside the floor is paved with flagstones and picnic tables are arranged around the walls. In the center is a central column surround by a built-in bench. On the far side of the left wing is a patio area with more picnic tables and access to the restrooms. A wide grassy lawn extends around the left side bordered by trees. Text on the wayside panel reads, “Parkitecture. The Octagon Shelter, like most Civilian Conservation Corps structures, used ‘rustic style’ architecture developed in the early 1900s by National Park Service planners. Coined ‘parkitecture,’ rustic style emphasizes low silhouettes, horizontal lines, and colors and materials found in local surroundings. The octagon shape is reminiscent of shelters found in the Adirondack Mountains, which provide sweeping views of the surrounding area.” The bottom of the panel has an architect’s drawing of this side of the building showing the octagon-shaped pavilion at right and the wing extending to the left. At left a quote reads, “The use of native materials in proper scale, and the thorough avoidance of rigid, straight lines, and over sophistication, gives the feeling of having been executed by pioneer craftsmen with limited hand tools. It achieves sympathy with natural surroundings and with the past. – A.H. Good, Akron architect and designer of Virginia Kendall facilities, defining rustic architecture.” On a wall inside the shelter is a graphic panel titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” which features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern side of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. Octagon Shelter. Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. Managed by different agencies over the years, the park gave area residents more space for recreation and play. Most of the Virginia Kendall structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.” End of description.",

The Blackfeet nation were enemies to many of the tribal nations that the Corps of Discovery were in alliance with, such as the Nez Pearce and Shoshone nations. The Blackfeet Nation was also understandably unwelcoming to white men. It is no surprise that when Meriwether Lewis and three others, George Drouillard (an interpreter hunter, and cartographer), and brothers Joseph and Reubin Field (two of the expeditions top hunters) were walking on Blackfeet Territory and happened on a group of young Blackfeet tribesmen, there was fear of an outbreak of violence. However, the expedition narrowly avoided any violence during the initial meeting.</p> <p>On the evening of July 26, 1806, the camp was awoken to the sound of Blackfeet attempting to steal firearms. Unsuccessful in their attempt, two to three Blackfeet tribesmen were killed while the rest escaped. Quickly after this encounter, the campsite was packed up and the expedition fled in fear of a larger attack.</p> <p>In addition to the Two Medicine Fight Site being the first encounter with the Blackfeet Nation and first violent encounter, it was also the first military conflict between the US and a plains tribe.</p> <p>Today, the Two Medicine Fight Site is still in the Blackfeet Indian territory on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.

A worker leans on one knee, using a pickaxe to carve further up the ridge. <br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />You are standing at the start of an amazing footpath that has an inspired story. From here thanks to hardy trailbuilders in the park's early years, you can hike to the Sierra Nevada's highest peaks. <br /><br />In the 1920s Congress extended Sequoia National Park eastward from the sequoia groves to the crest of the Sierra Nevada. <br /><br />Superintendent John White knew that people needed access to the new park area. Rather than build roads, he envisioned a \"High Sierra Trail\" from the Giant Forest to Mount Whitney. <br /><br />For his trailbuilding project, White set forth two criteria: minimal damage to the land and as few ups and downs as possible. Despite the steep. rocky terrain, trail crews met his challenge. Using White's route, hikers today can travel from sequoia grove to Sierra crest with remarkable ease for such a rugged landscape. <br /><br />A quote by Park Superintendent John White,<br /><br />\"... the Kern Canyon and High Sierra area should be developed only as a trail park...the honk of the motor horn should never echo in [them}.\" <br /><br />A black and white photo of a woman standing with a horse, with a snow dappled mountainside behind her. She is wearing a hat, scarf, long sleeve shirt, gloves, pantaloons with a leather pouch tied around her waist, in tall boots. She stands facing forward, her arm is curled under the neck of the brown horse, touching its cheek. The horse's head is nestled against her side. Next to her, is a pile of large rocks and a wooden sign on a post that reads, \"Sierra National Forest, Muir Pass Elevation 12,059 feet\" The caption reads,<br /><br /> Susan Thew in the high country<br /><br />The text below reads,<br /><br />Getting Involved<br /><br />When a debate began over whether the High Sierra should be added to Sequoia National Park, a local woman took action, Susan Thew hired a photographer and set off into the mountains. Upon returning, she mailed her photos to every member of Congress, showing them the wild beauty that was at stake.",

            "bodyText": "<p>In 1800, America's western border reached only as far as the Mississippi River. Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 the country nearly doubled in size and pushed its western edge past the Rocky Mountains. Yet the wilderness known as Oregon Country (which included present-day Oregon, Washington and part of Idaho) still belonged to the British, a fact that made many Americans eager to settle the region and claim it for the United States.</p> <p>American Indians had traversed this country for many years, but for European Americans it was unknown territory. Lewis and Clark's secretly funded expedition in 1803 was part of a U.S. Government plan to open Oregon Country to settlement. However, the hazardous route blazed by this party was not feasible for families traveling by wagon. An easier trail was needed.</p>   <p>Robert Stuart of the Astorians (a group of fur traders who established Fort Astoria on the Columbia River in western Oregon) became the first white man to use what later became known as the Oregon Trail. Stuart's 2,000-mile journey from Fort Astoria to St. Louis in 1810 took 10 months to complete; still, it was a much less rugged trail than Lewis and Clark's route.</p> <p>It wasn't until 1836 that the first wagons were used on the trek from Missouri to Oregon. A missionary party headed by Marcus and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/learn/historyculture/narcissa-whitman.htm\">Narcissa Whitman</a> bravely set out to reach the Willamette Valley. Though the Whitmans were forced to abandon their wagons 200 miles short of Oregon, they proved that families could go west by wheeled travel.</p> <p>In the spring of 1843, a wagon train of nearly 1,000 people organized at Independence, Missouri with plans to reach Oregon Country. Amidst an overwhelming chorus of naysayers who doubted their success, the so-called \"Great Migration\" made it safely to Oregon. Crucial to their success was the use of South Pass, a 12-mile wide valley that was virtually the sole place between the plains and Oregon where wagons could cross the formidable Rocky Mountains.</p> <p>By 1846, thousands of emigrants who were drawn west by cheap land, patriotism or the promise of a better life found their way to Oregon Country. With so many Americans settling the region, it became obvious to the British that Oregon was no longer theirs. They ceded Oregon Country to the United States that year.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>More Information</h4> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h3>",

She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from the University of Chicago, and had a keen interest in genetics. She sold milk to local dairies, sold goats to North and South America, and kept an active schedule of showing goats at regional contests.</p> <p>Click the audio below to learn how Mrs. Sandburg and her daughter Helga first started raising dairy goats.<br /> <br /> \"While we were in Michigan, one of the children, our youngest Helga, wanted a cow and then Carl was the one who said, you can’t possibly handle a cow, but a goat would be the right one for your size to handle. Goats you can just put in the family car and drive off, she went with me anyway to see about the goats since her father really said no, that a cow was impossible. We had some goats near the house, and I not only went home with one goat, but I said two goats, we’ll certainly need two goats if we’re going to have our family milk supply. Those goats turned out to be way out of the ordinary goats, that’s how we got into having goats\".  </p>",

He oversaw the overnight construction of the redoubt on top of Breed's Hill - where the Bunker Hill Monument now stands. He is effectively considered to have been the commander of the redoubt. When dawn broke and British cannon opened fire on his position, accounts identify Prescott walking on top of the dirt walls of the redoubt, showing the men they had nothing to fear under fire. In a sense, this statue portrays Prescott walking that same redoubt wall, defiantly encouraging his men to stand up to cannon fire and continue holding their position.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The statue of Colonel William Prescott is located on the path leading up to the Bunker Hill Monument from the Massachusetts Gate. It is centered between the southwest and southeast lawns, and is visible from the Bunker Hill Museum. Located in the center of a granite brick-paved square, two sidewalks from the Massachusetts Gate run on the left and the right side of the square, with grass patches in front and behind the square. The statue sits on a light-red granite pedestal. The front face of the pedestal reads, “Colonel William Prescott. June 17, 1775.” William Prescott is shown to be wearing colonial era clothing, which includes a long coat and hat. The hat is tilted slightly up and Prescott looks ahead with his neck angled slightly to the right. His right foot is a step in front of his left foot, causing the coat to hang by his right hip behind his right outstretched foot. He holds a sword in his right hand, with the sword pointed downward. His left arm is stretched down by his side, angled slightly behind him with his left hand is open.",

It is a park of outstanding natural beauty, referenced in William Clark’s journal as the “birnt hills” from when Clark and his party camped in what is now the Glendive area on their return journey down the Yellowstone.</p> <p>Makoshika is a sprawling mass of badlands layered with color and awash in classic badland formations like caprocks, hoodoos and natural bridges. The habitat is almost entirely rugged badlands with stands of juniper and pine, with some open native prairie at the “top” of the park. Large mammals like mule deer and mountain lions (though they are rarely, if ever seen) inhabit the park. Native birds such as mountain bluebirds and turkey vultures return to Makoshika each year to breed. Many other bird species, including bald and golden eagles, can also be seen. Besides its outstanding natural beauty,</p> <p>Makoshika is also a world-class fossil bed and a place of incredible scientific importance, especially to paleontologists. The badlands of Makoshika are part of the celebrated Hell Creek Formation, famed worldwide as one of the richest caches of dinosaur fossils on the planet. Dinosaur fossils are routinely recovered from Makoshika, including the most popular dinosaurs like triceratops and Tyrannosaurus Rex. Several fossils of particular importance to science have been recovered from Makoshika.</p> <p>Dig expeditions from major scientific institutions such as the Museum of the Rockies, the Burpee Museum, the University of Wisconsin, Notre Dame University, and others come to the park every summer to search for new fossil finds.</p>",

How do you think tourism might effect the climate of the cave? <br /> <br /> This chamber is named for Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, “Kentucky's eccentric naturalist”. Here, you have the opportunity to see the effects of water on the limestone walls at lookout mountain, see images of some of the cave inhabitants, and learn about a mushroom growing venture gone wrong. The chamber branches off to right and to left. The continuations do not go very far before they taper and become impassable. Take a moment to look around. This is the turn around point for this journey.</p>",

These signs list the distance from the Point at Point State Park, a nearby scenic attraction that you can travel to via your non-motorized boat. The access points have ramps or docks for easy access to the water, and most of them have resources such as parking, boat racks, and interpretive signage that discuss the historical significance of the rivers.

When Theodore Roosevelt bought the property in 1880 it already included an Orchard, fields of corn, asparagus, and buckwheat as well as an old barn. After the purchase, Roosevelt had his own ideas of what the farm should look like and cleared about 47 acres, including pastures. With a garden, fields, orchard, pigs, cows, horses, and chickens the farm required a full time farm manager and several full and part time farmhands. Even the Roosevelt family had chores to do. Edith kept the farm books; The children tended their sections of the garden, pulled weeds, and brought in the milk; While Roosevelt loved to roll up his sleeves at haying time.",

The elusive pink bark beetle will not be visible; however, evidence of the pine bark beetle can be seen from the sections of dead trees along the trail. The Woodland Trail is a 1.6 mile paved accessible trail that winds through the loblolly pine forest. Stop on the north side of the trail at the Pony Overlook to try to catch a glimpse of the horses. Don’t forget to pack the bug spray!",
            "audioDescription": "The Woodland Trail is a paved accessible 1.6 mile loop with little to no grade and is wheelchair accessible. When entering the trail there will be trees that have been downed and/or removed from both the left- and right-hand sides due to storms and damage from pine bark beetles. In about 50 yards, you will come to a split in the trail. A sign pointing to the left will say “Bivalve Trail” and a sign pointing to the right will say “Pony Overlook”. The Woodland Trail is a loop, so if you plan to do the whole trail you can go either way. Through the entire trail you will see tall stands of loblolly pines on both your left and right sides. Many trees may have vines growing up them and brush and shrubbery along the forest floor. Delmarva fox squirrels, rabbits and birds are also a common sight along the trail. The trail will be shady in many spots with some areas of sunshine peeking through the trees. Benches for sitting are available periodically along the trail.  If you choose to take the path to your right to the Pony Overlook, it will be about ½ mile until you reach the overlook platform. As you walk through the maritime forest, you will see stands of loblolly pines, thistle, Catbrier and Devil’s Walking Stick. You may also see or hear the Delmarva fox squirrel or Sika Elk rustling in the brush and red headed woodpeckers.  If you choose to take the path to the left, you will encounter the Bivalve Trail about ½ mile in on your left. When looking to your right, you may notice wooden boxes attached to some of the loblolly pine trees. These boxes are not birdhouses, but rather for the Delmarva fox squirrels. On your left and right, you will see pine trees, thistle, Virginia creeper and cat briar. You will likely hear songbirds as well the pecking of woodpeckers.",

This route was first pioneered by the Fremont expedition in 1845 and promoted a year later by the ambitious Lansford W. Hastings as a shorter route to the Humboldt River in Nevada. However, the Hastings Cutoff involved a perilous 90-mile waterless trek across the Great Salt Lake Desert sand dunes and mud flats in mid-summer heat with heavy wagons.</p> <h4>Site Information</h4>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/california-national-historic-trail-nht-hastings-pass\">Safety Considerations</a><br /> This road is an unpaved, gravel road. Please check for road conditions and appropriate vehicles before planning a visit.</em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/california-national-historic-trail-nht-hastings-pass\">More Site Information</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

In 1846, Horseshoe Springs became a stop on the Hastings Cutoff emigrant trail and was visited by the infamous Donner Reed party.<br /> <br /> Today, Horseshoe Springs is managed for its important riparian, fisheries, and widlife habitat. There is a visitor kiosk and boardwalk providing access for fishing and other recreation. There also is an interpretive display for the California National Historic Trail.

The Houstoun house had an air of nobility. The home of Priscilla and Patrick Houstoun [pronounced “HOW-ston”], these Frederica residents were founders of a colonial dynasty. Pivotal to shipping goods between Frederica and Savannah, Houstoun also served as Quartermaster of the Regiment. He eventually inherited the title of an English baronet and was later appointed to the Royal Council of Georgia.<br /> <br /> One of Priscilla and Patrick Houstoun's six children, John, in his adult life served as delegate to the Continental Congress and was later elected Governor of Georgia after the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> At Frederica, the Houstouns were more noted for their love of the grape. Archeologists found hundreds of wine bottles behind the house.</p>",

Beyond the hills, the trail is about 6 miles north of Interstate-80, where the sun glares off the white salt crust and daytime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees. Some years, out on the salt salts, emigrant wagons bogged down in the mucky clay and salt beds. James Reed's (Donner-Reed Wagon Train) thirst-crazed oxen bolted into the desert and emigrants miserably stumbled along, desperate to reach water. <br /> <br /> On the right at about milepost 22 stands the distinctive hooked peak of <strong>Floating Island</strong>, so named because atmospheric conditions often make it appear to float on hot air above the flats. The Hastings Cutoff crosses north of Floating Island and continues across the next basin toward Silver Island peak. From the Tree of Life sculpture along the freeway, the trails lies about 11 miles to the north. </p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p> An orientation panel at the rest area shows the location of the California and Pony Express Trails relative to the highway. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

The refuge consists of twenty-two islands and four mainland tracts scattered along 362 miles of the upper Ohio River. Most of the refuge’s 3440 acres of land and underwater habitat are located in West Virginia; however, Pennsylvania and Kentucky each have two refuge islands.</p> <p>The refuge is important in conserving the “wild” Ohio within one of our nation’s busiest inland waterways. Refuge islands are gradually returning to forested conditions after years of farming, oil and gas extraction, and other activities. The refuge works to protect wildlife and habitats native to the Ohio River and its floodplain. Migratory birds and endangered freshwater mussels are among the important wildlife emphasized on the refuge.</p> <p>At the Visitor Center, visitors can explore exhibits describing mussels, other local wildlife, and historic uses of the Ohio River and its islands. A 1200 gallon aquarium features fish native to the river. There are also two turtle tanks and a unique aquarium featuring freshwater mussels. Interpretive programs are offered throughout the year. The trails surrounding the visitor center are an excellent place for birding or for enjoying the area’s natural splendor.</p>",

When the tide was high, workers were able to get shallops (shallow bottomed sailboats) up to the Dock. This let them bring in raw materials and ship out finished and semi-finished products.<br /> <br /> The shallops would bring gabbro from Nahant, and additional tools and labor to the iron works. Cast iron pots, salt pans, merchant bars, flat bar and slit bar were all shipped outbound from the Dock aboard the same boats for local coastal trade. Other times cargo could be loaded from the iron works boats directly on to larger ships or to a Boston warehouse bound for more distant locations such as London or Barbados.</p>",

It was constructed in the 1930’s by a Works Progress Administration (WPA) crew in exchange for Conrad Warren providing housing for WPA workers on the ranch.<br /> <br /> The WPA was established during the Great Depression as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's “New Deal,” which provided jobs and improved infrastructure around the nation. While the program was best known for completing large scale projects, 2.3 million outhouses were constructed across the country to improve sanitation and public health in rural areas.<br /> <br /> Every WPA outhouse was identical in both design and construction. They were built with a 4’ x 5’ foot wooden frame, a hanging roof with a 6” wide fascia board on all sides, square pots set at a 45-degree angle, and a ventilation chimney with a metal screen that vented polluted air outside and kept flies from coming inside. Each outhouse was also constructed with a concrete foundation, floor, and vault because it was quickly discovered that outhouses with wooden vaults and floors were extremely difficult to clean and deteriorated quickly.<br /> <br /> Because of its association with the WPA and the “New Deal” program, this one-hole outhouse was known on the ranch as the “Roosevelt Building.”",

There is a small, ventilation chimney made of steel coming out of the roof. The structure rests on a concrete foundation. The building is covered with white vertical boards. A red, 6”, rectangular fascia board covers the roof rafters. There is a single, wooden toilet in the middle of the room. In the center of the structure is a large rectangular door facing east. The door opens from the right to the left. There are no windows on the structure.",

Half-Creek Indian and half-British, Musgrove was a frontier trader and Oglethorpe’s interpreter and liaison to the Indians. Her diplomacy bridged the gap between the two cultures and aided Oglethorpe’s desire for humane and peaceful relations with the Indians. She also helped secure Indian alliances against the Spanish. <br /> <br /> Archeological evidence shows that a living area was located on the left and a cooking area with a fireplace on the right. Sleeping quarters occupied a second floor or loft. Today it may be hard to imagine that entire families lived together in houses as small as this. Frederica’s settlers followed the same rural house-building traditions as their counterparts in England. James Oglethorpe chose settlers accustomed to hard work and plain living. Much of colonial life was spent outdoors working and gathering food. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Some of South Manitou's earliest residents rest eternally in this small cemetery located in the island's interior. A visit here reveals the hardships of life on this remote island. The graves of the Sheridan family-Aaron, Julia, and their son-serve as a reminder of the danger of working and living on Lake Michigan; the family tragically lost their lives in a boating accident. Unexpected history is discovered in the story of Private Andrew T. Burdick-he served in northern Russia at the end of World War I. Here, too visitors learn something about the resilience of islanders. Bertha Peth, beloved by the island children, lived on South Manitou nearly all of her adult life and was known to many as the \"Island Queen.\" Many more untold stories of life on South Manitou Island lay here, waiting for discovery.<br /> The South Manitou Island cemetery is open to the public.</p> <h3>The Sheridan Family</h3> <p>Aaron and Julia Sheridan were both born in New York. They began their married life together on March 21, 1865 in DeKalb, Illinois. Aaron, a wounded Civil War veteran, became Keeper of the South Manitou Island light in 1866. He and Julia started a family on the island, eventually having six sons! After the new 104 foot lighthouse tower was constructed, the Lighthouse Service appointed Julia as the very first Assistant Keeper, making her the only woman to officially serve at the South Manitou Island light. The Sheridan's also owned eighty acres of land on the island near Lake Florence, where they had a small farm.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, tragedy struck the Sheridan family in March of 1878, Julia, Aaron and their youngest son Robert were returning to the island when their boat capsized. All three drowned. The five other Sheridan children went to live with their grandparents in Illinois. Aaron and Julia had lived and worked at the lighthouse for twelve years. Lyman Sheridan, Aaron's cousin, succeeded him as light keeper. Today, descendants of Aaron and Julia often visit the island and work as volunteers. In 2006, the family placed grave stones for Julia, Aaron, and Robert in the island cemetery.</p> <h3>Andrew T. Burdick</h3> <p>Andrew T. Burdick was born on South Manitou Island on November 23, 1889. His parents, Andrew Putnam Burdick and Sarah Ellen Kitchen had been married since 1874. Andrew had six older siblings, five of whom survived to adulthood. His father was a farmer and he and his brothers worked on the farm and went to school at the island's one-room school house. Andrew's oldest brother, James Putnam, worked his way up the ranks at the South Manitou Island lighthouse as a Second Assistant, First Assistant, and eventually the longest-serving Keeper. His brother William also worked as Second and First Assistant. Andrew's father passed away in January 1917, leaving him the head of household on the farm. Later that year in June, Andrew registered for the draft. His draft card reveals that he was unmarried, working as a farmer, and supporting his widowed mother. He described himself as short and of medium build with blue eyes and light hair.<br /> <br /> The United States entered World War I in the spring of 1917. Private Andrew Burdick served in Company B of the 339th Regiment in the U.S. Army's 85th Division. The 85th Division headed to Camp Custer near Battle Creek, Michigan during the summer of 1918 to complete their training before departing for England. Once in England, the men of the 339th were issued Russian weapons and set sail for Archangel, Russia; their mission was unclear-originally, they were only meant to guard military stores. However, their role became much more complicated. While sailing for Archangel, an outbreak of Spanish Influenza had occurred on two out of the three transport ships. When the 339th arrived in Archangel on September 4, 1918, over a hundred men were seriously ill. Andrew Burdick died just fifteen days later on September 19, 1918 of disease at the age of twenty eight. The fall of 1918 marked the start of the worldwide influenza epidemic that claimed the lives of over fifty million people-more than died in World War I.<br /> <br /> Andrew Burdick's regiment went on to become actively engaged in fighting the Bolsheviks, who had overthrown the Russian Czar the previous year. Fighting actually continued past the end of World War I on November 11, 1918. The men of the 85th division became known as the \"Polar Bears\" because of the long winter they spent fighting Bolshevik troops. American troops were not withdrawn from northern Russia until June 1919 and finally returned to Detroit in July. Andrew Burdick was one of over two hundred casualties during the nine months the Polar Bears spent in Russia. He was eventually laid to rest on his peaceful island home.</p> <h3>Bertha Peth</h3> <p>Bertha Peth immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1881 with her parents when she was about seven years old. At some point in the early 1890s, she came to South Manitou Island to work-some people that knew her wrote that Bertha came with a visiting family as a nursemaid for their children; others stated that she was hired by a family on the island. In 1893, at the age of nineteen, she married island farmer John Hutzler in Chicago, Illinois. By 1900, the couple had one child, a son named Stanley. Tragically, Bertha and John lost their son when he was just two years old. He died in Chicago in 1901 after twenty days of illness, possibly of leukemia. Back on the island, rumors began to circulate about the cause of his death and about Bertha. In 1904, John filed for divorce which was granted the following year. Bertha may have stayed in Chicago for a time after the death of her son and divorce, but by 1920 she had returned and was living in a house in the village on South Manitou.<br /> <br /> From the 1920s through the 1940s, Bertha lived in her house in the village and supported herself in a number of ways. She operated a small store from her home, collected and sold wild ginseng, and may have done laundry for the men at the nearby U.S. Coast Guard Station. Former islanders wrote that she and John Hutzler may have helped each other even after they divorced-she baked bread for him and he chopped wood for her. Children that grew up during that time on the island later shared very fond memories of Bertha. Former islanders, like Ronald Rosie, described her as being \"always at a trot\" as she walked around the island, looking for ginseng. Ronald's friend, John Tobin said that he thought the world of Bertha and described her as very motherly, even though she was something of a character. He also mentioned that she \"always had candy.\" Visiting her small store to pick out candy and gum was a treat for school children and many returned to visit her as adults, even after moving off of the island.<br /> According to an article from a Benzie County newspaper published in Charles M. Anderson's memoir of his childhood on the island, Bertha left South Manitou when she was eighty-two. She had injured her eye and the U.S. Coast Guard transported her to the hospital in Frankfort. She then moved into a nursing home on the mainland. Apparently, Bertha had once spent a period of over twenty years on South Manitou without leaving-earning her the nickname of \"Queen of the Island.\" Bertha died in 1953. Her story is still well known by many who visit South Manitou today.</p> <h3>Ronald W. Riker</h3> <p>Ronald Riker arrived on South Manitou Island with his parents, Ed and Esther, and his two older brothers in 1953 when he was just a year and half old. His parents had been hired by William Boals of the Lee Island Company, a group that purchased several farms on the island in the late 1940s and attempted to start a resort business. In addition to tourism, the Lee Island Company also continued some farming and started a small Hereford cattle operation. The Rikers came to work as tenant farmers and raise cattle, but also ran tours of the island for summer visitors. At one point, they were the only year-round residents living on South Manitou.<br /> <br /> When the Riker boys got older, they attended school and lived on the mainland during the school year with their mother, returning to the island in the summer time. Tragically during the summer of 1967, sixteen year old Ronald drowned while exploring the wreck of the Fransisco Morazon with friends. Ed and Esther Riker continued to work for the Lee Island Company until South Manitou Island became a part of the newly-established Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. In 1972, they were the last permanent residents to leave the island. In 2005, Ed and Esther were buried near Ronald in the island cemetery.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Located about 2 miles from the South Manitou Island village is the island's main cemetery, which can be reached by hiking one mile north of the island's schoolhouse on Ohio Road. Here you will find about 2 dozen granite or marble headstones and smaller grave markers indicating the final resting places of several descendants of the island's earliest settlers. All of these markers bear dates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Families represented here include Burdick, Beck, Sheridan, Haas, Hutzler, and Peth. Two short sticks, each holding a United States flag, and, below the flag, a round brass medallion adorned with a star marked \"U.S.\" in its center, are planted alongside the graves of Aaron A. Sheridan, who lived from 1834 to 1878, and Private Andrew T. Burdick, who lived from 1889 to 1918. The men's respective headstones also tell us that Sheridan served as a corporal in the 13 Illinois Infantry during the Civil War and acted as South Manitou's Lighthouse Keeper from 1866 until his death and that Burdick served in Company B of the 339th Infantry. Although most of the headstones are scattered about with large areas of grass between them, take care as you walk around the cemetery as the ground is hilly in several spots and you may encounter a number of tall shade trees and small bushes.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Today a trip to South Manitou Island can feel like visiting a ghost town. Yet less than a century ago, this island was a bustling logging, farming, and maritime community. Native Americans used South Manitou seasonally for fishing and hunting. They were followed by the first permanent settlers, who began to arrive in the 1830s.<br /> <br /> The island's location along a major shipping channel, the Manitou Passage, and its deep harbor made it a logical place to seek refuge during bad weather. Steamships also needed to refuel with wood cut from the island's forests. Some of South Manitou Island's very first permanent settlers made a living cutting and selling cord word to passing steamships. Logging also soon became a profitable business.<br /> <br /> Once many of the island's hardwood forests were cleared, islanders made a living by farming and fishing. With the increase of commerce and shipping in the area, shipwrecks began to occur at a higher frequency.<br /> <br /> In order to provide aid to mariners, the federal government provided funds for the construction of the first South Manitou Island Lighthouse in 1839 and a United States Life-Saving Service Station in 1901. The men of the Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service and their families quickly became a part of the small island community.<br /> <br /> South Manitou Island was a close-knit, interdependent community. Everyone on the island knew everybody else. Admiral Willard Smith grew up on the island in the 1920s; and according to Admiral Smith, \"growing up on SMI was probably the greatest experience a youngster could have. You had an island with a nice little lake in the middle of it, sand hills and woods, that was your backyard. You could go anyplace you wanted and do anything you wanted to do, and it was a great place to be a small boy.<br /> <br /> The island children liked to watch the beach cart drill, the firing of the little cannon. The children had to stay out of the way as the crew set up the drill, but they would let the children ride down on the beaches buoy once in a while. The surfmen taught the children about signaling, how to tie knots and hand lines, and how to make bow and arrows.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The South Manitou Island dock is located on the southernmost tip of the Crescent Bay shoreline on the island's eastern side. This is where the passenger ferry arrives and departs. As you face in from the water, the first dock section you will encounter is a narrow L-shaped wooden platform or pier built over the water atop thick wooden pilings. This dock section extends several feet onto shore where it eventually transitions into a sandy path running to the right of the island's boathouse. Both this pier and the wooden walkway that continues on shore are flanked by evenly spaced wooden posts, or bollards, on both sides. Situated to the left of this narrow section is a wider wooden section, spanning about 25 feet across, that extends inland to the island's boathouse. This section also once served as a boat launch for Coast Guard vessels. Take care as you step along this central dock section as it slants slightly upward and is elevated a few feet above the ground as you near the wide doors leading into the boathouse. There are no railings. Finally, to the left of the wider dock section is a wooden ramp, about 8 feet wide, that slopes downward to a paved path that runs along the left side of the boathouse. This third ramp, also without railings, is wheelchair accessible. Flanking each side of the boathouse, and level with the wide central dock section, is a small wooden platform measuring about 2½ feet square. Four steps on the front of each platform, or the side facing the bay, lead to the ground below. There are wooden railings on the platforms' backs and the steps' outside edges only. To the left of the paved path extending from the wheelchair ramp and leading into the South Manitou Island village is a metal bench with a slat back, its long side facing you.",

From here a wide sidewalk curves gently to the right towards a rounded arch entrance in the side of the weathered brick fort. Near the entrance another sidewalk curves around to the left towards a small brick building against the wall of the fort. <br /><br />Left of the entrance weathered brick of the fort's walls rise tall. Small openings covered by iron bars are spaced along the walls. To the right of the entrance a section of the fort's walls is missing giving a glimpse of the arched gallery along the inside of the far wall. A wooden rail fence runs across the opening left by the missing wall section.<br /><br />Behind you as you face the entrance to the fort, on the far side of this end of the parking lot, is a sidewalk leading towards a group of white wood-frame buildings, some single-story and others two-story. <br /><br />Interpretive panel: Step back in history.<br /><br />On the right side of this panel is a map showing the layout of the fort as it looks today. The basic shape of the main fort is five sided with an extended area called a bastion at each corner. The fort is longer in the north-south direction than east-west. Your current location at the corner of the parking lot is at the end of a sidewalk which leads to the entrance in the northern face. The northwest section of the fort, the original Bastion D, is missing.<br /><br />The open area in the middle of the fort is called the parade. A roughly rectangular structure, called Battery Pensacola, lies across the middle of that space.<br /><br />Along the eastern side, the left on the diagram, is an outer wall called the counterscarp wall with a dry ditch between it and the main walls of the fort. <br /><br />A dotted line shows the route of a wheelchair-accessible tour route through the fort. Symbols indicate the location of restrooms and drinking fountain down a sidewalk to the left of the main entrance. The bookstore is located on the right along the entrance tunnel through the north face.<br /><br />In the bottom left corner of the panel is a black and white photograph looking down into the parade area. Two of the inner walls are visibly lined with arched openings. A pyramid of stacked cannon balls sits in one corner. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Fort Pickens was a Union fort during the Civil War.\"<br /><br />At upper left text reads, <br /><br />\"Fort Pickens played a critical role in an 1800s homeland-security program. Pickens was the largest of four forts the US government built to protect Pensacola Bay and the navy yard. The fort succeeded, not against a foreign invasion, but against the Confederacy during the Civil War. To learn more about the fascinating history of this defensive fortification, follow the sidewalk straight ahead and begin your self-guiding tour. The fort closes at sunset.\"<br /><br />Below the text is a quote by Lieutenant Henry W. Halleck, \"Report on the Means of Defence,\" 1843, which reads, <br /><br />\"...as the means of preserving peace, and as obstacles to an invader, [the forts'] influence and power are immense.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

Trueman's guns and equipment were moved to Battery Cullum in 1943.\"<br /><br />To the left of the text is a small map showing this western end of the island with Fort Pickens.

            "audioDescription": "The Bay Campground is one of three campgrounds located on South Manitou Island and the closest campsite to the island's dock. To reach this campground, which is located close to the beach on the island's crescent-shaped eastern shore, take a half-mile hike north from the dock and Ranger Station. From this campground, there is a largely unobstructed view of the bay to the east. The campsites are situated in dirt-floored clearings surrounded by both deciduous and evergreen trees. Marking the locations of the campground's 25 individual sites and 3 group sites are 28 wooden posts measuring about 3 feet tall with white triangles painted near their tops. Each individual site is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Each group site is designed to hold from 9 to 20 campers, with a maximum of 10 tents. Group sites are available by reservation only. As you walk around the campsites, you will encounter a number of wooden benches, each constructed of a single wooden timber perched atop 2 smaller wooden blocks positioned at each end. These benches either stand alone or in pairs, and up to 4 such benches surround the campground's metal community fire rings. Each fire ring, which measures approximately 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches high, is topped with a metal grill. These grills can be lifted to place wood in the otherwise open ring. Campers may collect dead and downed wood found on the island to make open fires in these rings during their visit. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own water filtration equipment because there is no source of purified drinking water at the campsites. Campers are also warned to look out for poison ivy, as it is common in this area. Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping at any of the island's campsites.",

            "bodyText": "<p>In 1895 or 1896, a solid-looking shingle-style cottage was constructed here by a couple known as Mr. and Mrs. Hewitt. Shirley Foote Alford described the Hewitts' Cottage Row house, furnished in burlap and calico, as \"the prettiest cottage of all.<br /> <br /> A few years later the Hewitts, who were immigrants from England, sold the cottage to Dr. John Edwin and Louise Rhoades. In a wooded area adjacent to the cottage, the Rhoades built a small play house for their daughter, Margaret. Later, after Margaret married Roderick Peattie, a lower floor was added to the play house, transforming it into a small, two-story, private cottage for Margaret and Roderick called \"the treehouse.\"<br /> <br /> In 1927, soon after inheriting her parent's cottage, Margaret Peattie sold the property to the Manitou Island Association. Jean Lundquist recalled that sometime during 1937-1950s the tree house was occupied by an American Indian man named Raphael. The cottage eventually fell into disuse and was torn down by the Manitou Island Association. However, Margaret and Roderick Peattie's \"treehouse\" remains standing on the site.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Backed by woods and standing beside a tree stump measuring about 4 feet tall is a 2-story weathered gray clapboard structure with a side-facing gable roof and a foundation faced with wooden shingles. This building was once a private cottage known as the Treehouse. The Treehouse began as a play house for the daughter of the Rhoades family, who lived in the main cottage on this lot in the early 1900s. The main cottage, which was built by the Hewitt family around 1895, is no longer standing. Located to the right of the structure's right-most upper-story window, and situated at least 12 feet above the grassy ground, is a rectangular door opening covered with a wooden board. Two of the 3 small windows here also appear to be at least partially boarded up. There are no doors at ground level on this side of the building. Directly behind the tree trunk, which is situated near the building facade's left side, is a small one-story addition with a shed roof that extends from the building's left end. There is a 6-pane window located on the side of the addition that faces the tree trunk.",

Bronze totem heads representing legendary or sacred beings sit atop the three totems: “She Who Watches” by Lillian Pitt, “Salmon” by Ken MacKintosh, and “Crow” by Rick Bartow. The sculptures face inward, forming a small plaza with a river-like pathway with a bronze spiral inset in the center.</p> <p>Describing the artwork, Lillian Pitt states, “We wanted to do something that was in keeping with the diverse neighborhoods that were nearby, and we wanted to do something to honor the maple trees that used to grow on that spot. We ended up using legendary images from different tribal traditions to represent the diversity in Native American culture, and we placed these giant images on top of pillars in the shape of maple tree trunks.”</p> <p>The educational aspect of the Ainsworth project was enhanced by including a poetry project for students at the Ockley Green Middle School . Students learned to write poetry, and in keeping with the aims of the greenspace goals, were inspired to write about nature. The class was taught by collaborating artist and author, Gail Tremblay, who has worked frequently with Lillian over the years. Many of the resulting children’s poems are engraved onto the maple-tree columns that serve as the stands for the totems.</p> <p>Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist. She was born and raised on the Warm Springs reservation in Oregon and her ancestors lived in and near the Columbia River Gorge for over 10,000 years. The focus of her work is on creating contemporary fine art pieces that delight today’s art lovers, and at the same time, honor the history and legends of her people.</p> <p>For more information about Lillian Pitt’s work and a list of her other public art pieces to view in the area, please visit <a href=\"http://lillianpitt.com/\">http://lillianpitt.com</a>.</p>",

The artists used traditional motifs to symbolize the life-sustaining relationships of nature. Pitt served as team leader of five members to complete her vision. She states, “The Interstate project was the first public art project I worked on. At the time, there was not one public art project in Portland that was done by a Native American artist. So I thought, that’s not right, and I went ahead and applied for the job.”</p> <p>Artistic interpretations of historic petroglyphs from the Columbia River Gorge appear on columns, custom benches, and railing panels. A traditional basket weave pattern is repeated in the pavement. And, at the ends of each of the shelters near the apex of the roofline, are sculptured images of birds, fishing apparatus and other symbols of cultural significance. “I designed the bricks into a basket design, the fence railings and the gable ends,” states Pitt.</p> <p>Pitt’s artwork along the Tri-Met has become known for an iconography rooted in the Columbia River petroglyphs of her ancestors. Through her use of this and other petroglyph symbols, Pitt has helped to bring the Indigenous iconography of the Columbia River to the public eye and affirm the ancient as well as contemporary Indigenous presence in the region.</p> <p>Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist.

            "bodyText": "<p>The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) station on South Manitou Island was built in 1901 and officially opened in August of 1902 with a Keeper and a crew of six surfmen. From 1901 to 1915, surfmen gave aid not only to mariners and shipwreck victims, but also to civilians living on the island. The USLSS reports for South Manitou reveal that surfmen often used their boats to take gravely ill islanders to the mainland doctor or to bring the doctor to the island. They also helped put out fires at farm houses and on board ships, provided basic first aid, and rescued people and animals from drowning.<br /> <br /> USLSS Keepers and Surfmen became members of the island's close-knit community. The station house only provided housing for the Keeper and his family and the single men of the crew. Many island residents turned to the USLSS for work when jobs in logging and farming began to decline. Often, family members served on the USLSS crews together and over time, some families had a several generations of men that served the USLSS.</p> <h3>Surfmen stories</h3> <p><strong>Gerald Crowner</strong><br /> Gerald E. Crowner served as a surfman for the United States Coast Guard on South Manitou Island from 1926 to 1928. He published a memoir, The South Manitou Story, of his time on the island in 1982. His book is filled with short stories, poems, and photos that bring his service on the island to life for readers today.<br /> <br /> <strong>The South Patrol on a Windy Fall Night</strong><br /> by Gerald E. Crowner<br /> <br /> <strong>I walked alone<br /> one starlit<br /> windy night<br /> and saw the clouds,<br /> like stately galleons<br /> pass in flight,<br /> eclipsing the star-beams<br /> with shadowy grace,<br /> as they twinkled<br /> and sparkled<br /> through unending space.<br /> And the surf<br /> came in blasting,<br /> with crests flying high,<br /> like the manes of wild horses<br /> against the dark sky.<br /> And over my soul<br /> came a glorious peace,<br /> as I walked<br /> in the starlight<br /> beside turbulent seas.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>John F. Tobin</strong><br /> John F. Tobin lived on South Manitou Island as a boy. His grandfather, John K. Tobin, served in both the Coast Guard and the Lighthouse Service on South Manitou. John's father, Harold, was born on the island and served at the Coast Guard station there until WWII. While Harold served in the war, John F. and his family moved off of the island. In 2010, John F. was interviewed for an oral history project at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. He shared stories about growing up on South Manitou, attending school, and playing pranks. He was a self-proclaimed \"stinker\" and \"rascal\" during his boyhood days! In this interview clip, John describes the life-saving drills practiced by the Coast Guard, the Navy visiting on the Fourth of July, and the trouble he got into playing with black powder.</p> <h3>U.S. Life-Saving Service</h3> <p>Congress established the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) in 1871 in an effort to reduce the number of lives lost on the oceans and the Great Lakes due to shipwrecks. The surfmen of the USLSS became known as \"storm warriors\" and \"storm fighters.\" Their unofficial motto was, \"you have to go out, but you don't have to come back.\" USLSS crews braved perilous conditions to save shipwreck victims from certain doom.<br /> <br /> The narrow Manitou passage, which runs between the islands and the mainland, is one of the most dangerous on the Great Lakes. Ships have to make several turns here, and because of the shoals surrounding the islands, `they fell asleep. At night, surfmen patrolled the beaches. Each station handled beach patrol a little differently. If stations were fairly close to each other, surfmen on beach patrol carried a small medallion, called a check, which was inscribed with the name of his station and his number. During beach patrol, the surfman hiked down the beach the required distance, up to four or five miles, where he met a surfman from the neighboring station and they exchanged checks. Each surfman turned the check into their Keeper in the morning as a way to prove that he had completed his patrol. Other stations, especially isolated stations such as South Manitou, used time clocks in order to prove that surfmen completed their patrols. A surfman would carry the small clock on a strap over his shoulder as he made their way down the beach. At the end of the patrol was a wooden post in the sand containing a key. The surfman inserted the key into the clock, which recorded the time on a roll of paper. Not only did this prove that surfmen completed their patrols, but also that patrols were completed on time.<br /> <br /> The crew also responsible for maintaining the station; this included keeping it clean. Every morning they cleaned the lamps and lanterns and trimmed and filled them. They swept the hallways; filled wood boxes; swept sidewalks; cleaned cuspidors and ash trays; dusted the stairway; and made their beds neat and smooth. On Saturdays, or scrub day, all station floors were scrubbed, windows washed, and brass polished.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also kept the buildings and equipment gleaming. Maintenance of buildings usually meant repainting the buildings and cutting and splitting wood (enough wood for the two kitchen ranges and two wood burners in the station). But when needed, expanded to renovation tasks like putting on new roofs, laying new flooring, building new outhouses, and even laying new sod (and watering that sod).<br /> <br /> The main duty of the Service was the protection of life and property on the water. But local citizens often looked to the crew when they needed help. An annual report from 1895 lists some of these \"Miscellaneous Services\": surfmen rigging the rope on the flagstaff of the county building, extinguishing 21 fires in homes or buildings, catching a runaway horse, repairing a wagon owned by two ladies who were kept out of the rain at the station while the surfmen worked on their buggy, finding a child lost in the woods, helping sick people get home. And once, helping a farmer get his horse out of a well.</p> <h3>Living at the USLSS</h3> <p>The crew spent most of their down time on the first floor (the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated). The crew's quarters served as a lounging room. According to Gerald Crowner a surfman on South Manitou in 1926, \"A round oak table stood by the east window with a big oil lamp suspended over it. Near the table was a wall bookcase full of books that were seldom read. In the southeast corner stood the little stand that harbored our Monkey Ward record player and the pile of records that were so often played. The big wood burner occupied a space near the south wall, near the door that led to the hallway. Rows of hooks also lined the west wall, where one could hang up coats and caps. Six or eight chairs were lined up under the double window on the north wall that faced the bay.\"<br /> <br /> In the fall and winter months, the monotony of long cold months was broken up by sharing stories and tall tales around the wood burner. Neighbors often stopped in to add their tales. Mail days were happy days. They all looked forward to letters from home, friends, and sweethearts and often gathered at the post office at mail time waiting for the letters to be sorted.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency. This allowed the men to people spend a little more time at home.<br /> <br /> There was a telephone cable that snaked its way from Sleeping Bear Point through South Manitou on to the North Manitou Lighthouse and Coast Guard Station and homes. Gerald Crowner a South Manitou surfman in 1926 tells us, \"One of the crewmen on North Manitou played the mouth organ, and he played it beautifully. Quite often, he would call me when I had the midnight to two watch and play songs for me. He could play just about everything in the book. . . .Many times I would call Sleeping Bear Point, and he would call the operator at Maple City, and all of us would enjoy his music and carry on a four-way conversation.\"</p>",

            "audioDescription": "The Popple Campground is one of three campgrounds located on South Manitou Island and the furthest campsite from the island's dock. It is an approximately 3.5-mile hike from the dock and Ranger Station to the campground, which is located close to the beach on the island's northern tip. From the Popple Campground, visitors are offered a clear view of North Manitou Island as well as easy access to the beach fronting Lake Michigan. With 7 individual campsites, this is the smallest of the island's campgrounds. Standing to the right of the narrow dirt trail leading to the campground is a wooden post supporting a small wooden sign with the word \"Popple\" carved into its face. Also carved into the sign is an upward facing arrow and an image of a tent. The campsites are nestled in dirt-floored clearings within a forest of tall leafy trees. The location of each individual campsite is marked by a wooden post measuring about 3 feet tall with a white triangle painted near the top. Each of the 7 campsites is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Take care as you step around the campground as you may encounter some fallen logs and piles of stones near the various sites. Please note that there are no fire rings at this campground. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own water filtration equipment because there is no source of purified drinking water at the campsites. Campers are also warned to look out for poison ivy, as it is common in this area. Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping at any of the island's campsites.",

To reach this campground, which overlooks Lake Michigan from the bluffs on the island's south side, follow the wooded trail about 1.3 miles past the lighthouse located south and west of the dock. Standing alongside the narrow dirt trail leading into the campground are at least 2 wooden posts supporting small wooden signs with the words \"Weather Station Campground\" carved into their faces. Another wooden post carved with the words \"Lake Access\" is painted pale blue on its top section only to highlight the word \"lake.\" The Weather Station Campground is largely forested with its campsites well secluded from each other. There are 20 individual sites and 3 group sites here, with their locations indicated by 23 wooden posts measuring about 3 feet tall and with white triangles painted near their tops. Each individual site is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Each group site is designed to hold from 9 to 20 campers, with a maximum of 10 tents. Group sites are available by reservation only. As you walk around each campsite, you may encounter one or more wooden benches, each constructed of a single wooden timber perched atop 2 smaller wooden blocks positioned at each end. There are also several low metal community fire rings topped with metal grills. These grills can be lifted to place wood into the otherwise open rings, which measure approximately 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches high. Campers may collect dead and downed wood found on the island to make open fires in these rings during their visit. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own water filtration equipment because there is no source of purified drinking water at the campsites. Campers are also warned to look out for poison ivy, as it is common in this area. Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping at any of the island's campsites.",

The shelter created by the pilings, mixed with a deep drop off into the dredged channel, attract large grouper, tarpon, barracudas, and the occasional shark. You can also expect to see a variety of smaller fish and colorful coral living on and around these pilings. <strong>Remember to recreate responsibly, there is no lifeguard on duty and the nearest medical help is 70 miles away. The park is a no touch no take area. All coral, reef fish and cultural artifacts are protected.

            "audioDescription": "This panel, entitled \"The Legend of the Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear,\" features a large color drawing of 3 dark bears-1 adult and 2 cubs-stepping from a sandy lakeshore into pale blue water. Text below the wayside's title tells us: Once, long ago, in the land called Wisconsin across the great lake, there was terrible hunger and many people died. A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food. They walked for many days on the beach together, but after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake. They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very tired, and so the bear said, 'Try hard, the land is not very far.' And very soon they did come in sight of land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned. The bear's heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died. Eventually, both of them came to the surface as two little islands, and so the bear still lies there atop the dunes, looking after her children. To the right of this text is another smaller title: \"Speak Anishinaabemowin.\" Text below this title tells us: The Anishinaabek told parables like this one to teach cultural values. They shared these teachings in the winter around their wigwam fires. For a people dependent on harvesting their own food, famine was the great fear. The choice the bear, or makwa, had to make between starvation or a perilous journey would've been familiar to all. Below this text is a short excerpt from this parable-written in both English, which appears in black lettering, and Anishinaabemowin, which appears in red. This parable echoes the legend presented in the first section of audio description for this panel.",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing in front of a wayside panel entitled \"Stories in the Sky,\" which features a large blue map of a star-filled night sky. Superimposed over the map are thin blue and white lines connecting the stars of about a dozen constellations, which are also labeled by name. Text under the wayside's title tells us: Throughout time and across the world, people have gazed in wonder as points of light circled above them, reappearing in the same position at the same time each year. Like many cultures, the first people of this region named constellations after characters and objects from stories that illustrated their worldview. Where some see the Big Dipper, the Anishinaabek saw an animal called a fisher whose travels around the North Star (or Polaris) come to life in the legend excerpted below. Below the sky map are small drawings showing the changing positions of the Big Dipper in the winter, spring, summer, and autumn. The accompanying excerpt, entitled \"The Legend of Fisher and Skyland,\" reads: Winter: One year, the winter did not end. A squirrel said to Fisher, \"Go to the place where the skyland is closest to the Earth. There the skypeople are keeping summer. Go there and bring warm weather back.\" Fisher and his friends agreed and set out for skyland. Spring: Otter and Lynx could not break through the sky, but Wolverine did. Fisher jumped through the hole. Finding the world's birds caged, Fisher released them. He then made the hole bigger and summer began to leak into the land below, melting the snow. Summer: The sky people chased after Fisher. But Fisher knew that if he didn't make the hole big enough, the sky people would seal it up and winter would rule again. So he kept chewing the sky hole larger, while dodging the arrows of the sky people. Autumn: Finally, however, an arrow struck Fisher just about his tail. He rolled over on his back and began to fall towards the world below. Gitchee Manitou honored him for his bravery and placed him among the stars. Each year he circles the heavens. Running horizontally along the panel's bottom edge are drawings of 13 small spheres representing the 13 moons of the Anishinaabek: Great Spirit Moon, Bear Moon, Snow Crust Moon, Broken Snowshoe Moon, Sugar Moon, Suckerfish Moon, Blossom Moon, Berry Moon, Rice Moon, Changing Leaves Moon, Shedding Leaves Moon, Freezing Moon, and, lastly, Little Spirit Moon.",

Here open meadows mix with forested hilltops. Under most conditions, the forest expands its range and competes with the prairie for water and space. Wet years provided the moisture that allows young pine seedlings to establish themselves on the prairie. Given time and the right conditions they eventually will crowd out the grasses.</p> <p>Fire acts as the balancing mechanism, burning off trees and maintaining the prairie. Due to fire suppression practices over the past century, the forest has expanded. With the increase in forest size there has been a corresponding decrease in the amount of water flowing from the mountains. Trees, even ponderosa pines, need more water than grasses, so the streams of the Black Hills are smaller than they used to be, because of fire suppression. Historically, the lands of Wind Cave National Park burned every 8-12 years.</p>",

When the larvae emerge from the eggs, they initially bore into the nutritious inner bark and eventually tunnel through the wood before developing into adult beetles. Some boreholes may be seen if you look closely at these snags.</p> <p>The longhorned beetled and the other insects found on the snags are an important food for many types of birds.

Text below the wayside's title tells us: Once, long ago, in the land called Wisconsin across the great lake, there was terrible hunger and many people died. A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food. They walked for many days on the beach together, but after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake. They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very tired, and so the bear said, Try hard, the land is not very far.' And very soon they did come in sight of land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned. The bear's heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died. Eventually, both of them came to the surface as two little islands, and so the bear still lies there atop the dunes, looking after her children. To the right of this text is another smaller title: \"Speak Anishinaabemowin.\" Text below this title tells us: The Anishinaabek told parables like this one to teach cultural values. They shared these teachings in the winter around their wigwam fires. For a people dependent on harvesting their own food, famine was the great fear. The choice the bear, or makwa, had to make between starvation or a perilous journey would've been familiar to all. Below this text is a short excerpt from this parable-written in both English, which appears in black lettering, and Anishinaabemowin, which appears in red. This parable echoes the legend presented in the first section of audio description for this panel.",

Oat, flax, wheat, rye, and other grains were the dominant crops here and throughout Long Island in the early 19th century. In his 1804 ledgers, Nicoll Floyd II recorded selling just 10 bushels of Indian corn and 20 bushels of corn. But, by the mid 19th century corn had grown in popularity. In 1860, John Gelston Floyd Sr. wrote that he expected to produce 5000 bushels of corn in the year.  </p>",

            "audioDescription": "The Visitor Center is divided into two small rooms. First, the main room with a cement floor, 11 feet wide by 20 feet deep with a bench in the middle, displays a passport station, exhibit panels and artifacts that describe the natural and cultural history of the island. The adjacent lighthouse lens room to the left of the entrance is 11 feet wide by 11 feet deep. The original Fresnel lens on display fills most of the space. MAIN EXHIBIT ROOMAs you enter, moving counterclockwise around the room, wall panel exhibits with text, images and artifact cases illustrate island life, marine mammals, seabirds, rocky reefs, kelp forests, tide pools and human history. Beginning with Island LifeISLAND LIFESelected plants and animals found on the island are displayed in a collage through a series of vibrant photographs each with a caption. Animals on the islandTwo photographs on the upper right of the panel display the deer mouse, peeking its head through a crack in the ground and next the slender salamander, a small brownish black, smooth skinned amphibian with a narrow, almost snake like body, long tail and short stubby legs. Caption reads: Only a few vertebrate animals like the deer mouse and slender salamander live on Anacapa. Visitors rarely see these small secretive animals. Deer mice, the only native land mammals, no longer occur on the east islet. Competition with invading black rats may be part of the cause. Alien rats also prey on native salamanders. Island plantsThree photographs of the giant coreopsis plant illustrate it during different seasons. The first two images show the giant coreopsis in full bloom of yellow, growing in clusters across the landscape. This tall tree like plant grows two to four feet tall with yellow daisy-like flowers, clusters of lacy green leaves on bare trunks two to four inches thick. Caption reads: Giant coreopsis grows only on the Channel Islands and a small section of nearby coast.The next image shows the giant coreopsis in the dry season, the leaves and flowers wither and turn brown, so the plant may appear to be dead, the bare trunks and branches stick out across the landscape like sculptures. Caption reads: Giant Coreposis blooms in profusion following winter rains, but the dry heat of summer sends these woody sunflowers into nine months of dormancy. The next series of four photographs across the bottom of the panel highlight three additional plants found on the island; Gumweed, Indian paintbrush and sea figs. The first two photographs show close ups of gumweed, a compact growing plant with yellow daisy-like flowers. Caption reads: Gumweed, named for its sticky white sap, adds color to summer hikes on Anacapa. Few other plants flower here during the dry season.Next a photograph of the Indian paintbrush, a stunning scarlet red flower contrasts with yellow flowers growing beside it in the image. Each flower is made up of a cluster of smaller trumpet like flowers along the tip of the stem, grouped and tufted like hairs of a paintbrush. Caption reads: Native plants like this Indian paintbrush are among Anacapa's most colorful flowers.The last photograph is of the invasive sea fig. It sprawls low to the ground with pinkish spiny looking blossoms and thick green, fleshy, succulent leaves. Caption reads: Coast Guard employees introduced sea figs to the island for erosion control and landscaping. However, this alien plant competes with native species by crowding them out. Channel Islands National Park strives to protect plants and animals and to eliminate introduced aliens. Next Exhibit Panel MARINE MAMMALSA series of photographs are displayed in a collage featuring whales, dolphins, sea lions and seals, each with caption. A large photograph of the open ocean fills the left third of the panel. The iconic, broad, wedge- shaped tail of a gray whale peeks above the water and is centered in the image. Caption reads Gray whales pass near Anacapa Island on their annual ten-thousand-mile migration between Baja California and the Arctic waters.The next two photographs show the head of a gray whale at the surface of the water. Its skin is blotchy gray and covered with lumpy white barnacles. The baleen, a comb like feeding structure within the whale's mouth, is visible. Captions read:During their round trip journey from Mexico to Alaska, gray whales may pause near the channel island kelp bed to rest or feedBaleen, clearly visible in this whale's mouth, strains small crustaceans from the water during feeding. Barnacles and whale lice give gray whales their blotchy color. Below the gray whales is an image of two orca whales sticking partially out of the water with shiny, jet black bodies and distinctive white eye patches. Their tall, pointed, black dorsal fins protrude, shark like. Then an image of a single dolphin also partially out of the water, with its dark gray back, pointed snout and small dorsal fin.Captions read: Orcas, also called killer whales, hunt prey in small family groups.

Please use caution, as several wooden display boards hang over each island model, and are likely to knock into one’s head when touching the models. If it is windy, they tend to swing unpredictably as well! Near the center of this table display, a 2 1/4” wide by 1/8” high tactile bar indicates a ½ mile distance: about a 10-minute walk for an adult without physical disabilities. This is the scale for all of the island models in the breezeway. Each island sits on a table with curved edges, depicting the ocean. On the island’s surface, rough textures indicate areas of taller vegetation—brush and trees—often concentrated in valleys and canyons, and on the north shorelines. Let’s now explore this first island. Moving left along the table, about 4 feet from the tactile scale bar, at 10 o’clock, is the first and smallest of the Channel Islands in the National Park: Santa Barbara Island.",

            "audioDescription": "INTROWelcomeWelcome to the Channel Islands Visitor Center! Thank you for visiting. Please keep in mind that there is always a staff member within earshot. Please feel free to ask if you would like any assistance. Each audio section or subsection will generally provide three things: a general description of any graphics, videos, and displays, a reading of any text associated with that display, and directions to the next exhibit area.And so - let's continue this introduction with an overview of the exhibit space layout. General Space and Layout:This is the upper level of the 1,000 square foot visitor center. Turning with our backs to the counter provides a view of this open space, with tall windows providing views of a native plant garden. Bright graphics on the windows show the scenery and life of the Channel Islands. Most of the Visitor Center is about 2 feet below us, and is accessible by two ramps. The closest one is straight ahead, about 6 feet away. It leads to a gift shop at 1 o'clock. Continuing counterclockwise, at the lower level, are:a tidepool aquarium at 11 o'clock, complete with audio of the ocean, and a graphic mural of waves and birds along the shoreline.the main exhibits, from 11 to 9 o'clock, including the model of an enormous, bellowing bull elephant seal, native American Chumash songs and stories, and a life-sized model of an archaeological dig site. Another ramp back up to this level is at 9 o'clock.If you turn to face the counter, now, we can continue our counterclockwise review of the layout. A changing exhibit area is to the right, at 2 o'clock, about 20 feet away.A tactile display of specimens from the Channel Islands is at the end of this counter, at 2 o'clock.This Visitor Center Desk stretches from 2 o'clock to 9 o'clock.The Breezeway, our next exhibit area, is through doors to the left at 8 o'clock, about 12 feet away. Before heading to the Breezeway, though, it might be helpful to explore a tactile globe and map first, to understand the scale of the Channel Islands in context. Please ask the staff to provide these, if they are available.Globe: The globe of our planet Earth is 12\" in diameter, and 1\" represents roughly 700 miles, or about a 30 days walk for a fit adult without physical disabilities?. has two large land masses, or continents, that end in a point near the bottom of the globe. The one with the skinniest point is South America. Above this, connected by a thin strip of land, is another continent, North America. On the left side of it, there is a thin peninsula that runs parallel to the coastline. It is Baja California, part of Mexico. The United States begins slightly above the point where the peninsula connects to the mainland. About 1/2 inch above that connecting point you will feel a ridge, running parallel to, and about 1/4\" inland, from to the coast of North America. This is the Sierra Mountain range. Although they are too small to feel on this globe, the Channel Islands, are located off the coast, about Â¼\" left of the bottom of this ridge. Nation: This map of the United States is scaled so that 1\" = 100 miles, or about a 5 days walk for a fit adult without physical disabilities The left , or West, side of the map is bumpier than the right , or East side. On the far left, about a Â½ inch in from the edge of the continent, is a long vertical groove , about the length and width of an adult index finger. This is California's Central Valley, with the Sierra Mountains on the right side and lower coastal mountains on the left. With your fingertip at the very bottom of this valley, the Channel Islands can be found about an inch away, below and slightly to the leftÂ¬-4 tiny bumps in the flat expanse of the Pacific Ocean. California State: The map's scale is 1\" = 30 miles, about a 10-hour walk for a fit adult without physical disabilities. On the bottom, or Southern edge, at the coastline, you will feel a bumpy mountain range that heads upward and then (about 6 inches from the bottom) makes a right turn left, or due West, ending in a large bump near the coast in Santa Barbara County. (Keep this bump in mind!. An inch or two below this big bump, you can feel a row of 4 small bumps - the largest Channel Islands. From left to right (West to East), these are San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. An inch and a Â½ below Anacapa is the fifth Channel Island in the National Park - Santa Barbara, about the size of a grain of salt. By feeling the rest of the State map, you will get a sense of the powerful tectonic forces that created these islands. Several mountain ranges converge near this point, created by the uplifting pressure of tectonic plates colliding beneath them. Now, for larger models - more than 100 times this size-let's head out to the Breezeway. Pressing together create those bulges. Directions to Tidepool: Following the counter to the left about 11 feet takes us to a 6 foot-long ramp down into the main exhibit area. Continuing straight ahead from the bottom",

The two chairs have this arm rest panel on the right \"arm,\" and the other two have it on the left \"arm.\"An information panel, titled \"Santa Rosa Island Interpretive Guide,\" is posted on the wall inside the School House.The panel background is a black and white photo showing twelve people on horseback, in front of a wooden fence. Behind it is a thick section of trees. In the distance, to the left, is a large hill.The text reads,Learn more about ranch history, including a complete map and guide to the ranch area, in the Santa Rosa Island Interpretive Guide.The guide also provides detailed information on island Chumash history, military history, and natural history. In addition, it serves as a trail guide for the 1.75 mile hike from the pier to Water Canyon Beach via Cherry Canyon.Borrow the guide and return it or take it home and donate at ciparkfoundation.org/join-support/.Below and to the left of this panel is a small metal box with a locked panel in front, and a slanted top with a slit in the center, about three inches wide. To the right of this box is a wall mounted plastic holder that contains the guides. This exhibit panel, titled \"Channel Island Ranchos,\" provides cultural history about Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island.The panel background is a faded sepia photo, in shades of brown. It shows a steep, rocky shoreline, with a wooden staircase rising from the beach to the rocky plateau above. On the plateau are a large, long building, two smaller buildings, and canvas tents. The text reads:Santa Cruz Island covers almost 61,000 acres, its fertile central valley girded by rugged mountains, reaching 2,434 feet.Santa Rosa Island encompasses over 54,000 acres, of strikingly different topography - rolling grassy hills, mesas with deep-cut arroyos, and dunes that shift in the almost continuous winds.The Early Years.Humans inhabited the Channel Islands as early as 12,000 years ago. In 1542, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo found populous Chumash villages on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel islands. The waters of the Santa Barbara Channel teemed with marine life, and the Channel Islands were regular ports of call for fur traders, hunters, and fishermen in the late eighteenth century, although most trade was illegal under both Spanish (1769 to 1821) and Mexican (1821 to 1848) rule. The sea otter population experienced a serious decline by 1820 and the seals by 1830. By 1810 the islanders, victimized by European disease and their economy disrupted, began to migrate to the mainland at the urging of Franciscan padres.Deve",

            "audioDescription": "On the valley floor, within the protection of a wide canyon is the Scorpion Ranch housing complex that consists of a two-story ranch house with a kitchen, bakery with a built-in masonry oven, dining area and two rooms upstairs for housing ranch staff. A bunkhouse and a storage shed, about the size of a garage, are also within the 5-foot-high wooden split rail fence that surrounds the compound. Gardens, shrubs and fig trees edge the buildings.The two-story, adobe Scorpion Ranch house, now the visitor center with exhibits, is tucked in close to the canyon walls and faces the open valley to the south. The ranch house was built in 1886 of rubble-wall masonry and rests on a stone and mortar foundation. The building has a rectangular plan that measures 51 feet by 18 feet. It has a shed roof and walls that are 20 inches thick and composed of local stone, adobe bricks, mortar covered with white stucco, and limestone. Windows across the face of the building provide natural light. The first floor has two main rooms, both are open to the public with exhibits and audio visual components that describe the natural and cultural history of the area. The bakery is at the west end of the building and also contains exhibits. The bunkhouse is located immediately south of the adobe ranch house. Built in 1914, this one-and-a-half story wood frame structure has a simple, gable-roof and white board-and-batten siding. A panel at the entrance to the complex reads:Welcome to the Visitor CenterWe invite you to explore this historic ranch building and find out what makes SantaCruz Island like nowhere else on Earth.Investigate the dining room exhibits: discover how isolation from the mainland hasfostered Santa Cruz Island's unique plants, animals and ways of life and learn whatthe National Park Service is doing to protect and restore the island.Wander through the kitchen: listen to stories of living and working at ScorpionRanch.Peek into the bakery: See where bread was baked for the island workers - youmay also hear roosting bats.Take a guided walk or use the interpretive guide: Learn more about the island'shistory and ecology.Interior ExhibitsThe visitor center is on the first level of the ranch house. The two exhibit rooms are full of natural light with white walls and large square terra cotta tile flooring. On the floor, laid out in a figure eight pattern that weaves between both rooms are 19 specially printed floor tiles that tell the history of Santa Cruz Island in timeline format from 8,000 years ago, to 2007. Timeline tiles read:1. Saxipak'a Once upon a time.2. 8,000 years ago Earliest evidence of human life on Santa Cruz Island.3. 2000 years ago Chumash have highly developed technology and systems of transportation and trade.4. 1542 First European explorer, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, visits the island.

            "audioDescription": "ORIENTATIONBecause this exhibit shows so many fish and marine mammals, we start with a general description of four tactile items: models of a generic fish, a bottle-nosed dolphin, a grey whale; and a specimen of whale baleen. Please ask the visitor center staff to place these on the counter in front of you, going from your left to your right. We will start by describing the fish on your far left.Generic Tactile Fish Model Description:Although there are approximately 22,000 species of fish in a variety of shapes and sizes, most fish have a shape similar to this generic fish model-shaped like a deflated football or flattened torpedo, balanced on its long, thin edge, with an opening for the mouth in the front, a tall fin on top, a wide flat tail fin in the back, and more thin fins along the sides and bottom. (Please note that there is a two-inch circle indent on one side of this fish model that was caused by the manufacturing process. It is not normally on a fish. The colors are also artificial, so this model is for tactile purposes only.) A more detailed description of the fish model follows.Detail about the Tactile Fish Model:Fish are animals that are cold-blooded, with fins and a backbone. They generally have very small, fine scales that are bony in structure and overlap each other to protect the soft body of the fish. On a live fish, the scales are covered by a slimy mucus layer that helps to prevent infection. The opening you feel on the front end of the fish is its mouth. If you hold the fish horizontally, so the biggest ridge is on top, it will be upright. Above the mouth, on either side of its head, are the fish's eyes. On a real fish, the eyes would not stick out quite so much. Above the eyes, on the top of head are two side-by-side small indents that are called nares. Nares are the nostrils of the fish and detect odors in water. Behind the corners of the mouth is a curved ridge covering the gills. Gills allow the fish to pull oxygen from the water and release carbon dioxide. In a live fish, these gills would open and close about a Â¼ inch every few seconds. Behind the gills are the first of several thin ridges or flaps you will be feeling on this fish, all representing fins. In a live fish under water, these fins would all be sticking away from the body. Fish move all of these fins in order to swim and turn though the water. These first fins, behind the gills, shaped like a flattened tooth, are side or pectoral fins. There is another pectoral fin about four inches behind the first pectoral fin on both sides. On top of the fish is a triangle shaped dorsal fin that sticks up from the body and just behind it is a smaller rounded adipose fin. The fin that sticks out on the bottom of the fish is called the anal fin. At the back of the fish is an upright tail, called a caudal fin, with a slight curve at the end, like a mustache that sticks out further on the top and bottom. This fin generates most of the forward momentum when a fish swims. Behind the front pectoral fins and running along the sides of the fish is a lateral line. The lateral line senses water currents and pressure, and movement in the water. On the bottom of the fish in front of the anal fin is the external opening called the vent. The vent is used for waste elimination and is also where eggs or sperm are released. Remember that the thousands of different species of fish come in a variety in the sizes and shapes. However, they will all have these basic parts, and most are have a shape roughly similar to this model. To the right of the fish is a model of a bottle nosed dolphin.Bottlenose Dolphin Model General DescriptionThe dolphin is upright if you hold it flat, so the middle of the dolphin has a point on the top called a fin. The head is on the pointy end. The head has a short, thick snout, shaped like the top of a long-necked bottle with eyes on either side. Near the head, two flat side blades called flippers stick out and downward on each side. The dolphin is a marine mammal, which means that it is warm blooded and breathes air. It breathes through a small blowhole, an indentation on the top of the head. The body is firm and its tail has a flat v-shape.Their color ranges from light gray to black with lighter coloration on their bellies.The actual adult dolphin is about 25 times bigger than this model. It can grow as big as 12 feet and 1400 lbs. (Please note that there are ridges on the bottom of the model in between the flippers. These were caused by the manufacturing process and are not on a real dolphin). A more detailed description of the model follows.Detail about the Tactile Bottlenose Dolphin Model:Below the dolphin's snout, the mouth is closed. If you were to open the mouth of a real dolphin you would see 18-26 pairs of sharp, conical teeth in each jaw. A dolphin does not chew its food. The teeth are used to grab the often-slippery prey. The corners of the mouth curve upward, giving the dolphin a permanent \"smile\". Above the snout",

            "audioDescription": "Santa Barbara Island: Island Power PanelAn exhibit panel, titled \"Island Power,\" is mounted on the exterior wall, adjacent to the door of the Visitor Center building.The text reads,Island PowerThe National Park Service built this ranger residence in 1991 to make it as energy efficient as possible. Solar panels provide all the electricity. Passive heat collection through floor tile and us of energy-efficient appliances all result in a residence that uses less energy per day than your household refrigerator.A photo shows three dark-grey rectangular solar panels, side by side, tilting backward. Each panel has eight horizontal sections with a grid of thin white lines. The Santa Barbara Visitor Center has a 3 foot by 4 foot entrance foyer. Across from the entrance door is a wall mounted wooden rack, with four shelves that hold guides and pamphlets. Above this rack is a square credit plaque, with a National Park Service logo. The text reads,This exhibit has been made possible byDenton O.\" Buster\" HyderSanta Cruz Island FoundationChannel Islands National ParkSanta Barbara FoundationSanta Barbara Museum of National HistorySanta Barbara Botanical Gardens.The entrance area opens into an exhibit area is about 10 feet by 12 feet in size. The exhibits focus on the natural and cultural history of Santa Barbara Island. The room is white with a red Salteeyo tile floor, lit by the natural light of tall windows with views of the ocean. The main exhibit area is generally laid out along the walls with a tactile exhibit in the center. Starting from the entrance, and moving from the left to the right around the room, you will first find a wall-mounted fire extinguisher at waist height, followed by a wall mounted exhibit panel about the seasons, and a wooden side table. On the table sits a National Park Service passport cancellation station and a sign-in book. Beyond this is an exhibit panel about geology.As you continue around to the side of the room facing the ocean, there are exhibit panels about marine life, and the island's history, and preservation. Along the next wall are a map of underwater topography and an inset case with natural specimens and tactile objects. In the next corner is a large shoreline diorama, and another exhibit panel. Along the back wall is a painted wall mural of an underwater scene. In the center of the room is an exhibit with a bronze tactile model of the island. Santa Barbara Island: Exhibit: â€˜Tis the Season...SummerThis exhibit panel has text with three photos with captions. At the top of the panel is the title, \"Tis the Season.\" Summer. For nesting birds & pinnipeds.A photo shows a broad cactus with pancake-shaped leaves, covered with thorny spines. On the ground just below the plant, and difficult to see at first glance, is a fluffy bird.Its large round eyes are yellow, with what look like dark feathered \"eyelashes\". It has a short, curved, yellow beak. Its face and upper wings are a light gray with white spots. At its neck and breast, small feathers puff out like layers of ruffles. The caption reads,A burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) well hidden (and well protected) in its thorny habitat. This photo is provided bySteve JunakThe text reads, As the foliage of the giant coreopsis dries and the thick stems are exposed, the stands begin to resemble diminutive forests surrounded by a desert landscape. While walking on the trails on Santa Barbara Island, you may be treated to the sights and sounds of nesting land birds. The most common of these are the western meadowlarks which serenade you with their melodious song, horned larks, orange-crowned warblers, and American kestrels. Also look for the diminutive rock wren in rocky areas.California sea lions pup on the rocky beaches in early summer. These curious marine mammals can be heard barking throughout the day and night as they rest on the rocks and swim in the offshore kelp forests. You may even encounter them with you in the water if you snorkel or SCUBA dive.A year on Santa Barbara Island is marked by cycles of birth, growth, and death of the island's plants and animals against the backdrop of the seasonal climate changes.A photo shows a rocky shoreline, covered with a dozen furry, tan and gray sea lions. The seals are shaped like fat slugs, with heads like a puppy's but with tiny ears. Shallow pools of water are seen between the rocks. The caption reads,California sea lions (Zalophus californianui) are the best known of all seals since they are the ones most commonly seen in the zoos and circuses. Adult males can be up to nine feet long and weigh over 700 pounds. This photo is provided byWilliam. B. DeweyA photo shows a mother pelican with her chick. The mother bird is light gray, with a black neck, and black tuft of spikey feathers behind her white head. Her long beak is open, pointing downward, with her chick's head wedged up inside of it.

Windows were cut into the structure to let light into the old shop, as boxes for tools and nails began to litter the space. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4ee4257f-c154-4f0b-a02e-e181e97012ec}{11}\" paraid=\"2052360398\">Over his 37 years at the Floyd Estate, Ross experienced the changes of the estate, from the decline of the working farm to the use of the estate for gathering friends and family together in the summer sunshine. He spent much of his time here building and repairing the equipment he needed to manage livestock. For Cornelia Floyd Nichols, the shop became forever associated with Charles Ross.

It is inspiring that people could put aside their differences and come together to build something greater than themselves when the contrary would have been much easier, safer, and simpler.<br /> <br /> The settlement of Cahokia, in Southern Illinois fits this mold. From prehistory to the 1600s, the Cahokians were the most sophisticated and advanced society north of Mexico. With cities bustling with merchants, artisans, artists, priests and more- Cahokia was the premiere Native-American civilization. With their advanced knowledge of agriculture, science, and coexistence, the Cahokians managed to cultivate a civilization larger than London’s in the year 1250, this despite enduring the brutal winters and scorching summers of the Mississippi Valley. </p> <p>Not much remains of this once magnificent Native American cultural and economic hub. However, the Cahokians did an excellent job of leaving behind enough to keep their significant legacy and history intact. Visitors can tour the numerous trails offered on site where people can get a sense of what it may have felt like to live in ancient Cahokia. Bring your gym-shoes because you can even climb the 100 foot tall mounds created by the Cahokians all those years ago! From the top of one historic metropolis, you can see a modern one in S.T Louis- reminding visitors that our cities today would not exist if ancient civilizations didn’t put in the leg work.</p> <p>In the interpretive center, visitors can learn from the myriad exhibits, videos, and knowledgeable volunteers. Visitors will learn everything from the day-to-day life of the Cahokians to what qualified the settlement as an urban-hub. With over 5.4 miles of trails, 100 foot tall mounds, and the engaging interpretive center-visitors will leave the mounds with a much greater understanding of the prehistoric city.</p> <p paraeid=\"{31d09435-0d17-4e84-b147-77b8fd983774}{93}\" paraid=\"104\">Admission to Cahokia Mounds is free to the general public, although donations of $7 per adult, $5 per senior, $2 per child, and $15 for families are suggested. Visits to the Interpretive Center are currently by appointment only. To schedule a tour or for current operating hours, call (618) 346-5160. </p>",

Stroll up a gently curving 150-foot ramp to the bird blind, constructed of sustainably harvested, durable black locust wood.</p> <p>From this quiet spot, you can view birds and wildlife that inhabit the area today as you learn about the flora and fauna–some of which are now extinct, endangered or threatened–that existed here 200 years ago. The artwork serves as a lasting reminder of the impact humans have had on the environment and a model for a new way to envision the connection between people and the natural world.</p> <p>The site was formally dedicated August 23, 2008, with more than 500 people attending.</p> <h4>The Bird Blind</h4> <p>A 1.2-mile trail, built primarily by volunteers, leads from the parking lot to Maya Lin’s elliptical bird blind. The wood used to build the bird blind comes from the black locust tree, a long-lasting, sustainable hardwood that is considered invasive in the Northwest. Using locally harvested black locust for this project supports efforts to eradicate the tree from native forests and reinforces the Confluence Project’s goal of promoting sustainability. The vertical wooden slats of the bird blind are inscribed with the name and current status of each of the 134 species Lewis and Clark noted on their westward journey.</p> <h4>Project Partners</h4> <p>The Sandy River Delta site was built by James E. John Construction, of Vancouver, and Krekow Jennings Inc., of Seattle. Other key partners include the Oregon Department of Transportation, which built a new, safer deceleration lane at Exit 18 on westbound Interstate 84; the U.S. Forest Service, who owns the land at the site; and the Oregon National Guard, who built a new parking lot at the site as part of a training mission.</p> <h4>Directions to Sandy River Delta</h4> <p>The Sandy River Delta is just north of I-84 off Exit 18. Driving east, exit the freeway and turn right at the T, go under the overpass and enter the park at the sign. If you’re driving west on I-84, take Exit 18 and take an immediate right. At the parking lot, look for the gravel path marked “Confluence.” Follow the path for 1.2 miles to reach the Bird Blind.</p> <h4>About Confluence</h4> <p>Confluence connects you to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices. We are a community-supported nonprofit that works through six art landscapes, educational programs, and public gatherings in collaboration with northwest tribes, communities, and the celebrated artist Maya Lin.

It means 'captain.'<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <br /> The smallest of the Channel Islands is deceptive. From a distance, this one-square-mile island may look a bit barren. Upon closer examination, the island offers more than one would expect-an island of resting elephant seals, blooming yellow flowers, tumbling Scripps's murrelet chicks, and rich cultural history. Santa Barbara Island is the center of a chain of jewels, a crossroads for people and animals.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island is 38 miles from the closest point on the mainland. The smallest of the California Channel Islands, it is only one square mile in size, or 639 acres. Formed by underwater volcanic activity, the island is roughly triangular in outline and emerges from the ocean as a giant, twin-peaked mesa with steep cliffs. In 1602 explorer Sebastian Vizcaino named the island in honor of the saint whose day is December 4th, the day he arrived.<br /> <br /> Visitors can witness the incredible recovery of the island's plant life and wildlife after years of habitat and species loss due to ranching and farming activities, including the introduction of nonnative plants, rabbits, and cats. Although nonnative grasses still dominate the landscape, native vegetation is recovering slowly with the help of the National Park Service's restoration efforts. After winter rains, the native plants of the island come alive with color. The strange tree sunflower, or coreopsis, blossoms with bright yellow bouquets. Other plants, like the endemic Santa Barbara Island live-forever, shrubby buckwheat, chickory, and cream cups, add touches of color to the island's palette.<br /> <br /> This recovery of native vegetation, along with the removal of nonnative predators, has aided in the reestablishment of nesting land birds. Today there are 14 landbirds that nest annually on the island. Three of these, the horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, and house finch, are endemic subspecies found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the island's recovery did not come soon enough for the endemic Santa Barbara Island song sparrow. The destruction of this sparrow's sagebrush and coreopsis nesting habitat and the presence of feral cats led to the extinction of this species in the 1960s. This sparrow, which was found only on Santa Barbara Island and is now lost forever, was one of the smallest forms of song sparrow, differentiated by its very gray back.<br /> <br /> Seabird colonies have also benefited from the recovery of Santa Barbara Island. The island is one of the most important seabird nesting sites within the Channel Islands, with 11 nesting species. Thousands of western gulls nest every year on the island, some right along the trailside. Fluffy chicks hatch in June and mature to fly away from the nest in July. The steep cliffs also provide nesting sites for the endangered California brown pelicans, three species of cormorants, three species of storm-petrels, and one of the world's largest colonies of Scripps's murrelets.<br /> <br /> The rocky shores of Santa Barbara Island also provide resting and breeding areas for California sea lions, harbor seals, and northern elephant seals. These marine mammals feed in the rich kelp forests surrounding the island. The raucous barking of sea lions can be heard from most areas of the island. Overlooks, such as Sea Lion Rookery, Webster Point, and Elephant Seal Cove, provide excellent spots to look down on seals and sea lions. Visitors can also jump in the water to see what lies beneath the ocean surface. Snorkeling in the Landing Cove, visitors can see bright sea stars, spiny sea urchins, and brilliant orange Garibaldi fish. California sea lions and occasional harbor seals frequent the Landing Cove waters and the surrounding rocky ledges.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Island Facts</strong></u></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Fifty-four miles from Ventura; 38 miles from the nearest mainland (San Pedro); 24 miles from Santa Catalina Island.<br /> <br /> - Approximately 1.5 miles wide by one mile long; one square mile; 639 acres.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-12 inches.<br /> <br /> - Tallest peak-Signal Peak, 634 ft.<br /> <br /> - Home to 14 endemic plant species and subspecies that occur only on the Channel Islands. Forms of buckwheat, dudleya, cream cups, and chicory are found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> - The endemic, threatened island night lizard occurs only on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, and San Clemente Islands.<br /> <br /> - The island's cliffs offer perfect nesting habitat for one of the world's largest breeding colonies of Scripps's murrelets, rare seabirds.<br /> <br /> - Absence of freshwater led the Tongva and Chumash to use the island on a seasonal basis and as a stopover between Santa Catalina and San Nicolas Islands.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Things To Do</strong></u><br /> One-day trips and overnight camping are options when visiting Santa Barbara Island. However, this island is more challenging to get to due to the limited transportation schedule. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Santa Barbara Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips April through October. Travel time is about three hours. Landing is at the Landing Cove where visitors step from the boat onto a ladder to a small dock. From the dock, visitors must climb 200 feet along a Â¼-mile trail to the top of the island. More...<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is no water available on the island. Visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> Picnic tables are available at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> A small visitor center is located on the island. Features include displays on the natural and cultural resources of the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats run to the islands, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after the concession boats arrive on the island. A variety of guided hikes may also be offered during weekends that Island Packers drops off campers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Once visitors have scaled the rugged cliffs using the steep trail from the Landing Cove, they will find just over five miles of trails that meander over gentle slopes and low mountain tops to dramatic overlooks and magnificent coastal views. All hikers must stay on the trails for visitor safety and to protect fragile vegetation and nesting seabirds. No off- trail hiking is allowed. Portions of trails are subject to closure when pelicans are nesting from January through August.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available (10 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided. No water is available. Distance from landing to campground is a quarter-mile and includes a 200-foot climb. Due to the boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Santa Barbara Island is an ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. Since Santa Barbara Island is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. Excellent watersports can be experienced at the Landing Cove. The underwater visibility is usually very good and the water is teeming with life. Kayaking north towards Arch Point or south towards the Sea Lion Rookery provides great wildlife viewing, sea caves, and arches. Experienced kayakers can circumnavigate the island's five-mile coastline.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the marine reserves located around the island. Fishing is allowed outside of these areas. To fish in Channel Islands National Park, possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> There is excellent wildlife viewing on Santa Barbara Island. A variety of seabirds can be seen throughout the year, including brown pelicans, cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and western gulls (gull nesting and chicks can be observed from the end of April through July). Seals and sea lions may also be viewed from Landing Cove and from the Sea Lion Rookery and Elephant Seal Cove overlooks. Santa Barbara Island is a great place to see the recovery of native vegetation with incredible wildflower displays. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. The brilliant yellow coreopsis flowers usually peak between late January and March. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Tidepools are not accessible from Santa Barbara Island. However, at a very low tide some intertidal plants and animals are visible from the dock or on the small shelf in front of the dock.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>History and Culture Overview</strong></u><br /> The smallest of the Channel Islands, Santa Barbara Island is about thirty-eight miles from the mainland and is centrally located in relation to all eight of the offshore islands. Surrounded by sheer cliffs on all sides, the island sits alone in the sea with only little Sutil Islet and Shag Rock to the southwest and northeast respectively to keep it company. Few beaches are found on the island, and those that are prove to be rocky and often treacherous to reach. The island has a pastoral quality with rolling slopes and a wide saddle between twin peaks, the taller of the two reaching 634 feet. Santa Barbara Island is home to native seabird colonies, barking sea lions, and a rich cultural history.<br /> <br /> <strong>Native Occupation and European Contact</strong><br /> Due to the lack of fresh water and few terrestrial resources, Santa Barbara Island most likely did not support any permanent native settlements. Recent studies show evidence that occupation of the island dates back at least 4,000 years, suggesting seasonal visits to the island. Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br /> <br /> <strong>Early History</strong><br /> Santa Barbara Island came into the possession of the United States in 1848 and has continued in U.S. government ownership since that time. Early government surveys done in 1853 and 1871 provided a topographic map of the island and Signal Peak was given its name when a triangulation signal was used at its highest point. While no leases were recorded on the island prior to 1909, people did periodically occupy the island. In The Land of Sunshine, published in 1897, author J. R. Britton compared the island's profile to that of a camel; he wrote that \"upon the higher hump stands the decaying beacon of the U. S. Coast Survey.\" He also noted \"a narrow shelf where a crayfisherman has built a hut of lath and canvas.\"<br /> <br /> Fisherman and hunter Heman Bay Webster lived on Santa Barbara Island as a squatter in the 1890s. He built a cabin in 1896 near the arch on the island's northwest point that now bears his name, Webster Point. In a 1940 interview, he recalled \"abundant\" cats living on the island until disease diminished their numbers. Webster was at home with the elements, going barefoot and having interests in other islands, mainly Anacapa where he ran sheep. Other men made Santa Barbara Island a regular port around the turn of the century as well. Buster Hyder recalled that Carl Jergensen and Bert Johnson spent years fishing for lobsters at Gull Rock (Sutil Island) in Thor, a boat built by Hyder's father.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor began leasing the island for agricultural and recreation purposes in 1900, advertising the island for a five-year lease in newspapers along the coast. J.G. Howland, being the highest bidder, obtained the first recorded lease of Santa Barbara Island on July 6, 1909. Soon after, Howland sublet the island to C.B. Linton for the purpose of propagating pearls in abalone. After five years, Howland did not renew his lease on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Hyder Family</strong><br /> In the spring of 1914, public notices were again posted for a five year lease of Santa Barbara Island. Two bids were received, T.D. Webster of Carpinteria and Alvin Hyder of San Pedro; Hyder made the higher bid of $250 a year and acquired the lease on June 16, 1914. The largest settlement of people on the island in historic times moved onto the island with Hyder. At one time around 1915, about fifteen people lived on the little island including Alvin's wife Nora and son Denton O., \"Buster\", as well as his two brothers and their wives.<br /> <br /> The year prior to the families' arrival, Hyder and his brothers had built a house near the edge of the island 100 yards south of and 150 feet above the landing. They anchored the house to the ground by cables so the wind would not blow it off the cliff. Hyder rebuilt the pier at the landing, where supplies and equipment were unloaded with a boom. To provide relief from carrying goods up and down 150 feet, he rigged a sled on wood tracks down the steep slope between the landing and the house.<br /> <br /> Since the island had no springs or flowing water, the Hyders constructed a system of reservoirs. They built two large concrete cisterns at the house and brought water on Nora II from the mainland. In 1918 they installed a Rambler auto engine to pump the water to the house from the landing. They searched the island for water sources, even looking for fresh water deep in sea caves, with no luck. Any collecting methods possible were used, no matter how disgusting. Buster recalled how \"you had to limit your drinking water. It had to last a year. Then it got stagnant. Many times when it was raining I'd drink water out of horse tracks. No kiddin'.\" Buster had the job of removing dead mice from the drinking water supply every day. \"Boy, it was hard to drink it. But when you don't have anything else, you have to drink it.\"<br /> <br /> In the early decades of the century, people made good money raising rabbits, marketing the meat and selling the pelts. Following the trend, the Hyders brought hundreds of pure black and pure white Belgian hares out to the island and turned them loose. They also brought about 300 sheep to the island in 1915, the first known sheep to graze there, where they would be fattened and sold for meat. The Hyders also had two horses, Dan and Charlie, and two mules, Jack and Beck, which they kept in a barn they built. Along with these animals, the Hyders also kept goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys and geese on the island.<br /> <br /> The Hyder lease expired in 1919 but they stayed on anyway. After seven years of hard work and frustration, they decided to leave the island in 1922. They took their twelve goats, 300 sheep, dogs and four horses to their homestead in Cuyama Valley north of Santa Barbara. Following the terms of the lease, they tore down the buildings and brought the materials to the mainland, although they failed to remove the main house. Reportedly Alvin Hyder tried to lease Santa Barbara Island for another term without success; an entrepreneur from Venice outbid him. Nevertheless, he took 250 sheep back to the island for fattening many years after their lease had run out.<br /> <br /> <strong>Government Activities on Santa Barbara Island</strong><br /> After the Hyders left the island, several attempts to lease and build resorts were made, but none succeeded. No major improvements were made to the island until the government built lighthouses. As early as 1853 government officers made note of the potential of Santa Barbara Island for lighthouse purposes. However, it would take 75 years to get a navigational aid built on Santa Barbara Island. On July 27, 1928, the Bureau of Lighthouses authorized an automatic light on the northerly point of the island \"for the protection of inter-island navigation in general and particularly for the protection of the Hawaiian Island and trans-Pacific traffic, which follows a course passing six miles to the northward of the island.\" In 1934, a second light tower went up on the south end of the island, on the westerly side, located 486 feet above the water and visible for twelve miles. When Santa Barbara Island became part of the Channel Islands National Monument in 1938, two parcels of land and right of entry were retained for by the government for lighthouse purposes.<br /> <br /> In April 1936, the Commandant of the 11th Naval District requested permission to install and maintain a range finder marker on Santa Barbara Island. The Navy built a tower about ninety feet tall at the highest point on the island, 634-foot Signal Peak, which was probably removed by 1942 when the Army Signal Corps installed radar on the island. At the outbreak of World War II, the military ordered both lights to be temporarily extinguished. They were relit in 1943 when the immediate threat to Los Angeles Harbor was felt to be over. During the war, the Navy took over responsibility for U. S. Coast Guard activities, including aids to navigation, and instituted a program of timed blackouts of coastal lights in case of enemy attack. The Navy also set up Coastal Lookout Stations on the island to help prevent attacks on the mainland.<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Barbara Island and Channel Islands National Monument</strong><br /> As early as 1932, the Bureau of Lighthouses suggested transferring Santa Barbara Island, as well as Anacapa Island, to the National Park Service for preservation. Not until 1938 did the National Park Service respond, and on April 26, the island became part of the newly designated Channel Islands National Monument, encompassing Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands. On June 28, 1939 NPS biologists E. Lowell Sumner, Jr. and R. M. Bond submitted a report on the biology of the islands suggesting protection of the island by the Coast Guard and State Division of Fish and Game, as well as posting signs in order to alert visitors of the island's new Monument status.<br /> <br /> In 1949 the monument boundaries were expanded to include \"the area within one (1) nautical mile of the shoreline of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.\" On Santa Barbara Island, this meant that the rocky beaches, offshore rocks and Sutil Island and Shag Rock would be protected. The Channel Islands National Monument was moved from the supervision by Sequoia National Park to be overseen by Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego in 1957. Rabbits and vandalism became major problems on the isolated island, but by the time it became part of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980, the rabbits were gone and vandalism was declining.<br /> <br /> To help develop the island for visitor use, the National Park Service constructed a new dock and ranger residence on the island in 1991. Extensive habitat restoration efforts have been underway on Santa Barbara Island to increase the native plant and bird populations which were destroyed after years of rabbit and sheep grazing. Today, visitors can camp, hike trails covering the whole island, snorkel and kayak to see the beautiful natural environment this small, remote island has to offer.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong></u><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

It means 'in the ocean' or deriving from muwu which means 'ocean, or any large body of water.'<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> According to legend, Santa Cruz Island was named for a priest's staff accidentally left on the island during the Portola expedition of 1769. A Chumash Indian found the cross-tipped stave and returned it to the priest. The Spaniards were so impressed that they called this island of friendly people \"La Isla de Santa Cruz,\" the Island of the Sacred Cross. Today the protection and preservation of Santa Cruz Island is divided between The Nature Conservancy and the National Park Service. The Nature Conservancy owns and manages the western 76 percent of the island, while the eastern 24 percent is owned and managed by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> In its vastness and variety of flora, fauna, and geology, Santa Cruz Island resembles a miniature California. At over 96 square miles in size and the largest island in California, Santa Cruz contains two rugged mountain ranges; the highest peaks on the islands (rising above 2,000 feet); a large central valley/fault system; deep canyons with year-round springs and streams; and 77 miles of craggy coastline cliffs, giant sea caves, pristine tidepools, and expansive beaches. One of the largest and deepest sea caves in the world, Painted Cave, is found on the northwest coastline of Santa Cruz. Named because of its colorful rock types, lichens, and algae, Painted Cave is nearly a quarter mile long and 100 feet wide, with an entrance ceiling of 160 feet and a waterfall over the entrance in the spring.<br /> These varied landforms support more than 600 plant species in 10 different plant communities, from marshes and grasslands to chaparral and pine forests. There are 140 landbird and 11 land mammal species; three amphibian and five reptile species; large colonies of nesting seabirds, breeding seals, and sea lions; and other diverse marine animals and plants. Owing to millions of years of isolation, many distinctive plant and animals species have adapted to the island's unique environment, including the island scrub-jay and eight plant species found only on Santa Cruz and nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> The island is also rich in cultural history with over 10,000 years of American Indian habitation and over 150 years of European exploration and ranching. Santa Cruz Island, known by the Chumash people as Limuw (translates to \"in the sea\"), was home to a ten villages that housed over 1,200 people. Many of these islanders mined extensive chert deposits for making tools and produced \"shell-bead money,\" used as a major trade item by tribes throughout California. The largest village on the island as well as on the northern Channel Islands, Swaxil, occupied the area of Scorpion Ranch at the time of Spanish contact (1542). Large plank canoes, called tomols, provided transportation between the islands and mainland. Remnants of Chumash civilization can still be seen in thousands of shell middens on the island.<br /> <br /> Remnants of the ranching era also can be seen throughout the landscape of the island. Adobe ranch houses, barns, blacksmith and saddle shops, wineries, and a chapel all attest to the many uses of Santa Cruz in the 1800s and 1900s.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, along with The Nature Conservancy, has made great efforts to preserve and protect these island resources, including stabilization of cultural sites, rehabilitation of historic buildings, removal of nonnative plants and animals, the recovery island foxes, reestablishment of bald eagles, and restoration of island wetlands. All of these efforts have made Santa Cruz Island one of the best places to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Island Facts</strong></u></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Twenty miles from Ventura.<br /> <br /> - Santa Cruz is California's largest island, almost three times the size of Manhattan. Approximately 24 miles long and up to six miles wide; 96 square miles; 62,000 acres; 77-mile shoreline.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-20 inches. Temperature range-20Â° F to 100Â° F.<br /> <br /> - Diablo Peak (Devil's Peak) is the tallest peak on the Channel Islands at 2,450 ft.<br /> <br /> - Painted Cave is one of the largest known sea caves in the world.<br /> <br /> - Santa Cruz has the greatest number of plant and animal species of all the Channel Islands, including over 60 endemic, or unique, species.<br /> <br /> - The island scrub-jay is only found on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> - In spring 2006 Santa Cruz Island was home to the first bald eagle chick to hatch unaided by humans on the Channel Islands in over 50 years.</p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Things to Do</strong></u></p> <p>Santa Cruz Island is the perfect place for a one-day trip and short or long overnight camping trips. This is the easiest island to get to, has the best weather, and offers the most recreational activities. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Santa Cruz Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips year round. Travel time is one hour. Trips are either to Scorpion Anchorage or Prisoners Harbor. Landing is via a pier at both locations.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> Channel Islands Adventure Company, the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area, operates guided sea kayak tours, limited convenience item sales (no food items), snorkel equipment rentals, and guided snorkel tours at Scorpion Anchorage on Santa Cruz Island only. There are no other goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is water available at Scorpion Anchorage. However, there is no water at Prisoners Harbor so visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> At Scorpion Anchorage, picnic tables are available at the beach and near the ranch area. At Prisoners Harbor, tables are located near the beach.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> A visitor center is located in the historic Scorpion ranch house. There are no other visitor centers on the island. The visitor center includes an orientation area that helps visitors plan a safe trip on the island and a variety of interactive exhibits that describe the island's tremendous biodiversity, rich cultural history, and current resource issues.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats run to Scorpion Anchorage and Prisoners Harbor, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after the Island Packers boats arrive on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Several trails and roads traverse eastern Santa Cruz Island, providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities. These trails and roads range from the maintained, relatively flat, signed trails of Scorpion Valley to the unmaintained, rugged, mountainous paths of the MontaÃ±on area. While visitors may explore the national park property on Santa Cruz Island, no hiking is allowed beyond the national park boundary onto The Nature Conservancy property. The boundary is the property line (marked by a fence line) between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available at the Scorpion Ranch Campground (31 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Water, picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided. Shade is available. Distance from landing is a flat one-half mile. This is the most family friendly campground on the islands. Backcountry camping is available year round at the Del Norte campsite near Prisoners Harbor. This is currently the only backcountry campground on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> The mixed sand and cobblestone Scorpion Beach is a world-class destination for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking because of easy beach access, clear ocean waters, nearby camping, year-round Island Packers boat transportation, extensive kelp forests, and a spectacular shoreline with sea caves to explore. However, there are no lifeguards on the island. For snorkeling and diving, the easiest kelp beds to access are the ones near the pier and those to the eastern end of of the bay. Beach access is also available at Prisoners Harbor and by hiking over to Smugglers Cove, but the snorkeling is not as good at these locations. Kayaking east towards Scorpion Rock or west towards Cavern Point provides great wildlife viewing and sea caves. Kayaking from Prisoners Harbor is also very scenic.<br /> <br /> For the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area on Santa Cruz Island visit: Channel Islands Adventure Company. For kayak guide and outfitting services in other areas of Santa Cruz Island (excluding Scorpion area), visit the Visitor Services List.<br /> <br /> Several locations on Santa Cruz Island offer good surfing. Generally, the north shore is best during the northwest swells of winter/spring and the south shore is best during the south swells of summer/fall. However, all surf spots are remote and are best accessed by private boat due to the island's rugged terrain and the hiking distance from the designated landing areas.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed at Scorpion Anchorage since it is within a marine reserve. Fishing is allowed on Santa Cruz Island outside of the marine reserves. Possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> A variety of seabirds can be seen throughout the year (especially around Scorpion Rock), but most birders go to the island to see the endemic island scrub-jay-only found on Santa Cruz Island and no other place in the world. Best viewing is at Prisoners Harbor, but they are also spotted around the Scorpion area as well. Island foxes are often seen around the ranch and campground at Scorpion Anchorage. Remember that it is illegal to directly or indirectly feed animals in the park. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Tidepooling at Scorpion Anchorage and Prisoners Harbor is limited. Better tidepools can be found at Smugglers Cove.<br /> <br /> <u><strong>History and Culture Overview</strong></u></p> <p>Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most diverse of the eight Channel Islands, has a long and varied history that is tied closely to its physical attributes. Its vast grasslands, coastal scrub vegetation, oak woodlands, and rich coastline sustained the Chumash for millennia and they maintained a number of villages and seasonal settlements on the island. For most of the nineteenth century, mariners found shelter in its coves and hunters and fishermen exploited the marine life. Immigrant ranchers grazed livestock, and the military took advantage of the island's strategic location.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash Civilization and European Contact</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal. Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw.<br /> <br /> In 1602, Sebastian VizcaÃ­no led the last Spanish expedition to California. His map named Santa Cruz Island the Isla de Gente Barbuda (island of the bearded people). Between 1602 and 1769 there was no recorded European contact with the island. Considering, however, the amount of traffic passing the islands, a number of unrecorded visits were probably made. Finally, in 1769, the land-and-sea expedition of Don Gaspar de la Portola reached Santa Cruz Island. Traveling with him were Father Juan GonzÃ¡lez VizcaÃ­no and Father Francisco PalÃ³u. Father PalÃ³u wrote of Father VizcaÃ­no's visit to the Santa Cruz village of Xaxas that the missionaries on ship went ashore and \"they were well received by the heathen and presented with fish, in return for which the Indians were given some strings of beads.\" Upon returning to their ship the missionaries soon realized that they had forgotten their staff in the village. Father PalÃ³u wrote:<br /> <br /> \"They immediately gave it up as lost, on account of the cross that it carried for it was of iron, and it was known how the Indians coveted this metal. But they were so honest that at daybreak it was discovered that one of the little canoes of the island was coming to the ship, and that one of the heathen was carrying in his hand the staff with the holy cross. Climbing on board he delivered it to the father and after being rewarded returned to the island. For this reason it was called the Island of the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz), and as such it has been known ever since.\"<br /> <br /> The island was considered for establishment of a Catholic mission to serve the large Chumash population. When the mission at San Buenaventura was founded across the channel in 1782, it commenced the slow religious conversion of the Santa Cruz Chumash. In 1822, the last of the Chumash left the island for mainland California.<br /> <br /> <strong>Maritime Commerce</strong><br /> Santa Cruz served as a base for otter hunters, fishermen, and smugglers. Smugglers Cove, for instance, derived its name from these illicit activities. The Channel Islands often provided smugglers and bootleggers with convenient and isolated hideaways in which to store their goods for a time.<br /> <br /> George Nidever recalled hunting otter at Santa Cruz in the winter of 1835-1836. Working from a base camp at Santa Rosa Island, he and two others obtained 60 skins that season. Fishermen encamped on the island, trading fish for other goods from passing boats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Early Ownership</strong><br /> With Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government asserted its control over California. In an effort to increase the Mexican presence, the government began sending convicted criminals to populate many areas. Around 40 prisoners were sent to Santa Barbara where, upon arrival, they were sent to Santa Cruz Island. They lived for a short time in an area now known as Prisoners Harbor. Read more about their interesting story by following this link.<br /> <br /> Through a land grant from the Mexican government, Captain Andres Castillero became the first private owner of Santa Cruz Island from 1839 to 1857. When California became a state in 1850, the United States government required that land previously granted by Spanish and Mexican governments be proved before the Board of Land Commissioners. For twelve years Castillero's claim to Santa Cruz Island was disputed, even after his property had been sold. During Castillero's ownership, Dr. James B. Shaw, an English physician, acted as manager of the island. He built the island's first ranch house by 1855 and is thought to have brought the first French Merino sheep to the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ranching on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Andres Castillero sold the island to William Barron, a San Francisco businessman and co-owner of the company Barron, Forbes & Co., in 1857. During the twelve years that Barron owned the island, Dr. Shaw continued manage it as superintendent and was charged by Barron to expand the sheep ranching operation begun during the Castillero era. The Civil War significantly increased the demand for wool and by 1864 some 24,000 sheep grazed the hills and valleys of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Shaw's island sheep ranch was well known by 1869, the year he left Santa Cruz. He imported cattle, horses, and sheep to the island and erected one of the earliest wharves along the California coast at Prisoners Harbor by 1869. He built corrals and houses for himself and his employees and expanded the road system. Shaw was the first rancher to ship sheep to San Francisco by steamer, some selling at $30 per animal. The press frequently praised the quality of sheep and wool coming from the Santa Cruz Island ranch. In 1859, the Sacramento Daily Union published an article about the sheep in the Santa Barbara area:<br /> <br /> \"Sheep of a much finer quality can be found in this county, and we doubt if anything superior can be found in the State than those owned by Dr. Shaw, on the island of Santa Cruz. Judging from the number of persons who have purchased from the doctor, for the purpose of raising sheep, Santa Barbara Country bids fair, in a few years, to be one of the greatest sheep producing sections in the state.\"<br /> <br /> When Barron sold the island in 1869, Shaw left for San Francisco and Los Alamos where he continued ranching. At that time, the gross proceeds from the ranch on Santa Cruz Island were supposedly $50,000.<br /> <br /> <strong>Justinian Caire and the Caire Ranch</strong><br /> William Barron sold the island to ten investors from San Francisco for $150,000. One of the investors, Justinian Caire, was a French immigrant and founder of a successful San Francisco hardware business that sold equipment to miners. By the late 1880s Caire had acquired all of the shares of the Santa Cruz Island Company which he and his colleagues had founded in 1869. He continued a successful livestock and ranching industry on the island for many years.<br /> <br /> From the ranch headquarters in the central valley (also called Rancho del Medio for its central location on the island), Justinian Caire developed an impressive agricultural operation with satellite ranches on the east and west ends of the island and at Prisoners Harbor, as well as seasonal and short-term ranches on other parts of the island. Diversified production, including wool, beef, wine, fruit and nuts, in addition to sustainable gardens, orchards and flocks of fowl, decreased the need to import food and goods from the mainland and sustained the ranching operations through the boom and bust cycles of the livestock industry.<br /> <br /> Caire brought architectural styles and culture from Europe and, during its heyday, more than 100 workers, mostly Italian but including French, American, Mexican Californian, and Indian, were employed at the ranch and worked as blacksmiths, masons, carpenters, painters, sheep-shearers, team drivers, vintners, butchers, dairymen and sailors. Caire's legacy is visible on the island in brick and stone ranch buildings, the groves of ornamental trees and fruit and nut orchards, the numerous dry stone masonry structures walls and dams, and the road system. Descendents of Justinian Caire still reside in California and many are active in the preservation of the island history.<br /> <br /> An extended and complicated series of litigation among Caire family members resulted in the division of the island and the sale of most of it in 1937. Justinian Caire's descendents retained 6,000 acres on the east end of the island, on which they continued the sheep ranching operation. Other family members sold the remaining 90 percent of the island to Los Angeles oilman Edwin Stanton in 1937.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Stanton Ranch</strong><br /> Edwin Stanton's purchase of the major part of Santa Cruz Island brought a major shift in agricultural production on the island. After trying for a short time to continue the sheep operation, he decided to switch to beef production. At the time, the beef industry in California was growing rapidly, with Santa Barbara County among the top ten beef producers in the state.<br /> <br /> The Stanton Ranch was a major part of Santa Barbara County's cattle industry between the 1940s and 1980s and, at 54,000 acres, was the largest in size. Neighboring Santa Rosa Island exceeded Stanton's cattle numbers on similar acreage.<br /> <br /> Edwin Stanton's ranch on Santa Cruz Island saw changes that reflected the evolution of cattle ranching in a working landscape. While retaining most of the 19th century structures dating from the Caire period, Stanton constructed a few buildings to meet the needs of his cattle ranch, the most notable of which is Rancho del Norte on the isthmus. Pasture fencing and corrals were altered to suit the cattle operation and an extensive water system was added to provide water to the cattle.<br /> <br /> <strong>The End of Island Ranching</strong><br /> The Gherini family, descendents of Justinian Caire, continued their sheep ranching operations on the east end of Santa Cruz Island until 1984, using Scorpion Ranch as their base. They managed the island with resident managers and laborers and often worked as a family during shearing and during the summer. Production dropped during the 1970s and 80s and the expense of ranching on a remote island rose. By 1984 the last ranch lessee vacated the island and a newly formed hunting club called Island Adventures leased the facilities from the Gherinis. The hunt club used the ranch houses at Scorpion and Smugglers to house guests who came to hunt the feral pigs and remaining sheep.<br /> <br /> With Edwin Stanton's death in 1964, his widow and son, Carey, re-incorporated the Santa Cruz Island Company and continued the cattle operations on the island. Carey Stanton died unexpectedly in 1987 at the ranch and was buried in the family plot in the island chapel yard at the Main Ranch. His personal possessions on the island, some of which dated to the Caire era, were left to the Santa Cruz Island Foundation. The real property passed to The Nature Conservancy through a prior agreement that Carey Stanton had established with the non-profit organization. The Nature Conservancy rapidly liquidated the cattle operation and ended the ranching era on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Military Uses of Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> The military forces of the United States took notice of Santa Cruz Island during World War II, and since that time have constructed and maintained strategic installations in the name of national security. Like all its neighbors, Santa Cruz Island served as an early warning outpost watching for enemy planes and ships during World War II. The Cold War brought the communications station as a part of the Pacific Missile Range. This station remains in operation, although not at the levels of its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.<br /> <br /> <strong>The National Park Service</strong><br /> While Santa Cruz Island did not attain National Park designation until 1980, visitors and previous owners of the island have understood the resource values of the island and contemplated preserving the property as a park for perhaps 100 years.<br /> <br /> In 1936 the Caire family reportedly offered their 9/10ths of the island for $750,000 to the state of California for use as a state or federal park. Nothing came of this proposal and the property was sold to Edwin Stanton. Stanton's son and heir was not interested in a government purchase of his beloved island and took steps to avoid such events by forging an agreement with The Nature Conservancy and the property was transferred to the organization upon his death. Although Santa Cruz Island is included within the boundaries of Channel Islands National Park, The Nature Conservancy portion of the island does not belong to the park. A transfer of 8,500 acres from the Nature Conservancy to the park was completed in 2000.<br /> <br /> Channel Islands National Park owns and operates approximately 24 percent of Santa Cruz Island. Today, a combination of organizations which includes The Nature Conservancy, the National Park Service, the University of California Field Station, and the Santa Cruz Island Foundation work to protect the island's natural and historic resources.</p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong></u></p> <p>Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Restoring Santa Cruz Island</strong></u></p> <p>Close to the mainland yet worlds apart, Santa Cruz Island is home to plants and animals that are found nowhere else on Earth. Like the Galapagos Islands of South America, the Channel Islands exist in isolation, allowing evolution to proceed independently, fostering the development of 145 endemic or unique species. Santa Cruz Island is host to 60 of these endemic species. Some, like the island jay and the Santa Cruz Island silver lotus, are found only on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this isolation has also made these species vulnerable to extinction. The melodic song of the Santa Barbara Island song sparrow and the crimson flower of the Santa Cruz Island monkey flower are no longer heard or seen within the park. The destruction of these species' habitats by non-native, exotic plants and animals has caused their extinction along with eight other rare and unique island species. Once found only on the Channel Islands, they have been lost forever.<br /> <br /> To save 10 other island species, including the island fox, from the brink of extinction as well as to protect more than 3,000 internationally significant archeological sites, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy embarked upon a multi-year program to restore Santa Cruz Island. This restoration program was part of the National Park Service mission, as mandated by Congress, to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. As owner of over 70% of Santa Cruz Island, it is the mission of The Nature Conservancy to preserve the plants and animals that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the land and waters they need to survive.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Problem</strong><br /> The National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and natural and cultural resource experts identified non-native feral pigs and non-native fennel (an invasive weed) as the most significant disturbances to the island's sensitive resources. Both pigs and fennel caused major direct impacts to native plant communities, rare plant species, and archeological sites.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting caused massive destruction of native species, resulting in bare ground that is easily eroded and colonized by invasive weeds, especially fennel. This activity was a factor in the decline of nine island plant species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting also damaged a large number of archeological sites on the island that are associated with the Chumash native people who occupied the island from at least 9,000 years ago until the early 1800s. The feral pigs rooted three feet deep at a number of sites, completely disturbing and desecrating these sacred sites and destroying their archeological value.<br /> <br /> In addition, feral pigs played a pivotal role in the catastrophic decline of island foxes. Piglets provided a year-round food source for golden eagles, allowing these formerly rare or occasional visitors to expand their range and establish resident populations on the island that then prey on island foxes. Golden eagle predation placed the fox on the brink of extinction on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Solution</strong><br /> The consensus among numerous experts was that the eradication of feral pigs was the most important action that can be taken to protect and restore Santa Cruz Island. The National Park Service has had tremendous success restoring other islands in the park through the removal of non-native animals. The eradication of European rabbits from Santa Barbara Island and sheep and burros from San Miguel Island resulted in tremendous natural recovery. Feral pigs were eradicated from Santa Rosa Island in a similar program. Pig eradication began on Santa Cruz Island in 2005 and was completed in 2007.<br /> <br /> Other management actions to initiate recovery of the island ecosystem were also been implemented. Golden eagles were captured and relocated to northeast California. A captive breeding program for island foxes was established as insurance against losses due to golden eagles. This program was so successful in reestablishing a wild population that the program was shut down in 2008 and the island fox was removed from the endangered species list. Monitoring of the island fox population still continues.<br /> <br /> Also, native bald eagles were reintroduced. This predator disappeared in the 1950s due to DDT poisoning. Bald eagles eat fish, seabirds, and animal carcasses, not live foxes, and are very territorial. Once they mature, they establish territories and drive off any newly arriving golden eagles. In 2006, this program paid off. For the first time in more than 50 years, two bald eagle chicks were hatched unaided from two separate nests on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> This multi-year program to remove golden eagles, reintroduce bald eagles, breed island foxes, eradicate pigs, and control fennel helped restore the balance to Santa Cruz Island's naturally functioning ecosystem offering visitors one of the last opportunities to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p>",

The entrance, located in 30 feet of water, reaches upward 160 feet above the water level to its ceiling, and is almost 100 feet wide. A large boat can be taken into its entrance with room to spare.

It means 'something in the middle of two other things,' as wima is between tuqan and limuw.<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island was included as part of Channel Islands National Park upon the park's inception on March 5, 1980. However, it wasn't until December 1986 that the island came under the ownership of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Located 40 nautical miles from the Channel Islands National Park visitor center in Ventura, Santa Rosa is the second largest island in California at approximately 53,000 acres in size. The island's relatively low profile is broken by a high, central mountain range, rising 1,589 feet at its highest point. Its coastal areas are variable, ranging from broad, sandy beaches gently sloping toward a dynamic ocean to sheer cliffs plunging toward the turmoil of a sea intent on changing the contour of the land.<br /> <br /> As on its larger neighbor, Santa Cruz Island, these varied landforms support a diverse array of plant and animal species. About 500 plant species can be found within nine plant communities, including six plant species found only on Santa Rosa and nowhere else in the world. One of these species, the Santa Rosa Island subspecies of Torrey pine, is considered one of the rarest pines in the world-the last enduring members of a once widespread Pleistocene forest. A remnant, mainland subspecies of Torrey pine also can be found near La Jolla, California, at Torrey Pines State Reserve. Santa Rosa Island also hosts over 100 bird and three mammal species (including the island's largest native mammal, the endemic island fox); two amphibian and three reptile species; and colonies of seabirds, seals, and sea lions.<br /> <br /> Remains of an ancient endemic species, the pygmy mammoth, have been uncovered on Santa Rosa, along with Santa Cruz and San Miguel Islands. These miniature mammoths, only four to six feet tall, once roamed island grasslands and forests during the Pleistocene. The fossil skeleton discovered on Santa Rosa Island in 1994 is the most complete specimen ever found.<br /> <br /> Along with extensive paleontological resources, Santa Rosa Island has rich archeological resources. Home to the Island Chumash until approximately 1820, wima (as the Chumash refer to the island) contains thousands of significant and federally protected archeological sites. Archeological investigations on the island have enabled scientists to construct a more complete picture of Chumash life on the islands. Radiocarbon dating on some of these sites indicates that humans have been using the island for more than 13,000 years.<br /> <br /> Others have come to the island during more recent centuries to exploit its rich resources, sometimes making it their home. In addition to the native Chumash, European explorers, Aleut sea otter hunters, Chinese abalone fishermen, Spanish missionaries, Mexican and American ranchers, and the US military all have left their mark on the Santa Rosa landscape. Visitors can see relics of these occupations in remnants of fishing camps, water troughs and fence lines, the pier where cattle were loaded and unloaded, buildings and equipment of the historic Vail and Vickers ranch at Bechers Bay, and remains of the military installations.<br /> <br /> Surrounding the island are cold, nutrient- rich waters that sustain a diverse web of marine life, including pelagic fish, a variety of marine mammals, and extensive kelp forests.<br /> <br /> As on the other islands, the National Park Service has made great efforts to preserve and protect these island resources, including enforcement of marine protected areas, stabilization of cultural sites, rehabilitation of historic buildings, removal of nonnative plants and animals, recovery of island foxes, and reestablishment of bald eagles.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>Island Facts</u></strong></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Forty miles from Ventura; 26.5 miles from the nearest mainland; three miles east of San Miguel Island and six miles west of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> - Santa Rosa is the second largest island in California. Approximately 15 miles wide by 10 miles long; 84 square miles; 53,000 acres.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-15 inches.<br /> <br /> - Radar Mountain is island's tallest peak at 1,589 ft.<br /> <br /> - Six endemic plant species occur only on Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> - Santa Rosa Island is home to only three native terrestrial mammals-the island fox, island spotted skunk, and island deer mouse. They are all endemic to the Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> - Reptiles and amphibians include the alligator lizard, Baja California tree frog, and three endemic species-the island gopher snake, island fence lizard, and Channel Islands slender salamander.</p> <p><u><strong>Things To Do</strong></u></p> <p>Santa Rosa Island may be visited on a one-day trip, multi-day boat trip, or an overnight camping trip. However, getting to this island is more challenging and the weather can be windy anytime of year-30-knot winds are not uncommon. Therefore, visitors must be prepared for adverse weather. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Santa Rosa Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips spring through fall. Travel time is about three hours. Strong winds and rough seas are possible. Landing is at Bechers Bay via a pier. Multi-island, overnight boat trips frequently visit Santa Rosa Island as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Plane Service</strong><br /> Channel Islands Aviation offers trips year round. Travel time is about 45 minutes Landing is at a graded dirt airstrip in Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is water available in Bechers Bay at two locations-Water Canyon campground and the public bathrooms in the historic ranch area.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> In Bechers Bay, picnic tables are available at Water Canyon Beach (by the road cut at the end of the airstrip) and on the grass area of the historic ranch house.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> There is no visitor center on the island. For information, check with island staff or the visitor center in Ventura.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats or planes travel to Bechers Bay, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after the concession boats or planes arrive on the island. A variety of guided hikes may also be offered during weekends that Island Packers drops off campers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Several trails and roads traverse the island, providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities, including the relatively flat route to Water Canyon Beach to the rugged, mountainous path to Black Mountain.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available at Water Canyon campground (15 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, windbreak, pit toilet, and water are provided. The campground is a flat 1 Â½-mile hike from the pier and a Â¼-mile from the airstrip and Water Canyon Beach. Due to the boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days. Backcountry camping on Santa Rosa Island is currently limited to certain beaches between August 15th and December 31st. Hiking is along the beach and rugged, unsigned dirt roads or unmaintained animal paths. The closest beach for camping is 10 miles from the boat/plane drop-off location in Bechers Bay. Backcountry camping beaches can also be accessed via kayak or boat. Water is available year round in some of the island's canyons. All campers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes, and line for securing tents are recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Due to the strong, persistent wind,swimming, snorkeling, diving, and kayaking are limited and recommended for the experienced visitor only. Despite the wind, Santa Rosa Island offers exceptional beach walking on white sand beaches. Access to one of the best beaches, Water Canyon Beach, is just over a mile from the pier in Bechers Bay and just down canyon from the campground. Beach access is also available near the pier. Surfing can be done at several locations on Santa Rosa Island. Generally, the north shore is best during the northwest swells of winter/spring and the south shore is best during the south swells of summer/fall. However, all surf spots are remote and are best accessed by private boat or by backcountry beachcamping due to the hiking distance from Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the three marine reserves located around the island. Fishing is allowed outside of these areas. To fish in the park, possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> There is limited accessible wildlife viewing on Santa Rosa Island. A variety of common seabirds and shorebirds (cormorants, brown pelicans, gulls) can be seen throughout the year in Bechers Bay, but there is better viewing on the boat ride over. Tell boat staff you are interested in seeing seabirds and they will help keep a lookout. Given the wind, landbirds are best spotted in the canyons such Cherry and Water Canyons. Pinniped viewing is limited to remote locations on the island. Backcountry camping is required to access these spots. Island foxes and other terrestrial species are often seen. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Good tidepooling spots are located within Bechers Bay, including just east of the pier, the east end of Southeast Anchorage, and near East Point. Other tidepooling areas are located throughout the island but require backcountry camping to reach these areas.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>History and Culture Overview</u></strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Societal values about people, places, cultures, and our landscapes shift over time. Santa Rosa Island has a deep history that illustrates this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> For more than 13,000 years Native American people were here, hunting, fishing, gathering, managing, and treasuring the island. The Island Chumash's economy collapsed during the Spanish Mission era and they were forced from wima (Chumash name for Santa Rosa Island) into the mission lifeways on the California mainland. Nevertheless, the Chumash people of today maintain strong cultural, spiritual, and historical ties to the island and their legacy is still embedded in the land.<br /> <br /> Within a single generation of Island Chumash departure, the island had been granted by the governor of Alta California to the Carrillo brothers. Thus began a 150-year period of ranching, during which first sheep and then cattle roamed and grazed the island.<br /> When Congress considered whether or not to include Santa Rosa Island as part of Channel Islands National Park, the open and undeveloped landscape perpetuated by ranching was a key determining factor in their decision. Four generations of the Vail family and their extended ranching \"family\" managed and cared for the island, preserving intact the last original and consistently operational Mexican land grant. The Vail family descendants of today have personal and vital connections to the island landscape and its ranching history.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island is now managed by the National Park Service on behalf of the public for its natural, cultural, historical, and wilderness values. We encourage you explore the island and experience its full complexity, as a landscape that has been loved and lived in for thousands of years and continues to provide recreation, respite, and renewal for current and future generations.<br /> <br /> <strong>Overview</strong><br /> Located 26.5 miles from the closest mainland point, Santa Rosa Island is the second largest of the eight Channel Islands, with over 53,000 acres of sandy beaches, grasslands, steep canyons and occasional groves of trees, including the rare Torrey pine grove above Bechers Bay. Called wimal by the Chumash, the island's native inhabitants, Santa Rosa Island has a history of human occupation stretching back at least 13,000 years. Following the Chumash came European explorers, Chinese abalone fishers, sea mammal hunters and fisherman, as well as ranchers, sport hunters, oil companies and the military, all of them leaving traces of their use of the island<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on Santa Rosa Island and European Contact</strong><br /> Archaeologist Phil Orr's discovery of human bones in 1959 at Arlington Springs provided evidence of the oldest known habitation of the island. Recently radio-carbon dated to 13,000 years before present, these are among the oldest securely-dated human remains in North America. The age of the Arlington remains and a host of archeological sites on the Channel Islands that date to the late Holocene (10,000-6,500 years before present) indicate an early migration route from the Old World into North America along the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island and the other Channel Islands provided rich resources for seafaring peoples to thrive by hunting seabirds, sea mammals, fish and shellfish. With extensive trade networks on the mainland, the island Chumash were able to trade marine resources with mainland peoples for goods they could not harvest or produce on the island. With plentiful food and fresh water, the island supported several villages at the time of European contact.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed up the coast of California in 1542, the first European to visit the Channel Islands, and documented three villages on Santa Rosa Island. A half-century later, Sebastian Rodriguez CermeÃ±o wrote about his interaction with the Chumash on the south side of the island on December 13, 1595, as he sailed southward along the coast:<br /> <br /> ...and there came alongside a small boat like a canoe, with two Indians in it rowing. And having arrived at the launch, they brought some eighteen fish and a seal and gave them to us, for which we gave them some pieces of taffeta and cotton cloth in order that they should bring more. They went on shore and returned in the same boat with three Indians and brought nothing, At this island we went fishing with lines and caught some thirty fishlike cabrillas [sea bass], which we soon ate on account of our great hunger....On both [Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island] the land is bare and sterile, although inhabited by Indians, there are no ports or coves in them in which to take shelter.<br /> <br /> <strong>Maritime Commerce</strong><br /> Following the removal of the Chumash from the island, there were no permanent island residents for the next twenty years. Passing mariners, fishermen and otter hunters visited Santa Rosa Island to exploit its marine resources.<br /> <br /> Desires for fine furs in China and Europe encouraged otter hunting along the Pacific coast in the late 1700s and early 1800s. English, Russian and American companies exploited this trade, employing Aleut and Hawaiian hunters to slaughter the animals. George Nidever, an American otter hunter, used a cave on the island at Bechers Bay as a headquarters for his two recorded hunting expeditions on the island. On his second trip Nidever and his crew collected sixty otter skins, but encountered armed conflict on the island. Nidever tells a legendary story of being victorious after an attack by a group of otter-hunting northwestern Indians working for an English company while he and his crew were hunting at Santa Rosa Island. Read Nidever's story here.<br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction of Ranching</strong><br /> Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, coming into possession of Alta California and the Channel Islands. In 1838, in response to the foreign otter hunting depredations, the government ordered the distribution of land grants to Mexican citizens to prevent incursions by foreign interests. This resulted in the grant of Santa Rosa Island to the Carrillo brothers, who were prominent residents of Santa Barbara. In October of 1843 Jose Antonio and Carlos Barrelo Carrillo gained ownership of the island but ended up selling it a month later.<br /> <br /> The Carrillo brothers sold the island to Carlos' married daughters and their husbands, Alpheus Thompson and John C. Jones, who had engaged in the otter trade and other entrepreneurial endeavors along the coast. According to the land grant, improvements had to be made on the island in order to maintain possession. Consequently, in December of 1843 Thompson had materials shipped to the island for a house and corrals, which were built in 1844. The first structures on the island were located between Skunk Point and East Point in an area now called Rancho Viejo or \"Old Ranch.\"<br /> <br /> Thompson and Jones brought the first livestock to the island in 1844: 270 head of cattle, 51 ewes, two rams, and nine horses. Thompson's employees took up residence on the island and supervised the grazing cattle, sheep and horses. During the following decade, numerous livestock, horseback and wagon trails were developed across the island. In 1855 the owners constructed a house and corral at Bechers Bay, which was more reliable for shipping conditions and provided more level land for ranching and agricultural activities. Drought and litigation between the two partners over control of the island led to the removal of most of the cattle and sheep by 1859.<br /> <br /> <strong>The More Era</strong><br /> In 1859, T. Wallace More purchased part of Jones's interest in Santa Rosa Island. That year, spurred by drought and litigation between the partners over control of the island, most of the sheep and cattle were removed from the island. More and two of his brothers began purchasing Thompson's shares in the island ranch until A.P. More acquired the last of the shares in 1870.<br /> <br /> Following a disastrous drought that devastated California's cattle industry during 1863-1864, the Mores commenced development of a huge sheep ranch on the island, eventually owning between 40,000 and 80,000 head. They erected miles of redwood fences and planted crops. The Mores abandoned the East Point ranch site, developing their headquarters at Bechers Bay. By 1873, they had constructed a wharf at Bechers Bay, a two-story house and barns at the ranch site. They reported that 40,000 sheep were sheared that year.<br /> <br /> As a result of a severe drought in 1876-78, the Mores were forced to slaughter tens of thousands of sheep, but managed to profit from the situation by installing two large boilers in one of the barns, which were used to render the carcasses for fat. The Santa Barbara Press reported on the matanzas (killings) saying that \"25,000 sheep are to be killed, which will leave from 15,000 to 20,000 on the island. The matanza works erected by the firm are said to be among the largest and most complete on the coast.\"<br /> <br /> A.P. More acquired full interest in the island in 1881 and continued to increase the number of sheep on the island. A contemporary writer claimed that 80,000 sheep grazed on the island in 1888. During an 1892 visit to the island, a reporter from Overland Monthly described the island's shearing operations. He noted that sheep at the More ranch were clipped by about forty seasonal shearers who bunked in the loft of the horse barn. During the shearing process, each shearer would place his fleece on a table to be collected and call out his tally number. An experienced shearer could produce up to 100 fleeces every day.<br /> <br /> The death of A.P. More in 1893 led to litigation and the eventual sale of Santa Rosa Island. More's heirs began to sell their shares to Vail & Vickers Co. in 1901. By 1902 Vail & Vickers owned the entire island.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Vail & Vickers Ranch</strong><br /> Walter L. Vail and J.V. Vickers were both prominent cattle ranchers in Arizona. By the turn of the century, they had developed a partnership and expanded their operations to southern California. Vail & Vickers began introducing more cattle to Santa Rosa Island while removing the sheep, running a large \"stocker\" operation where young cattle were brought to feed on the island grass for one or two years, and then sold to buyers on the mainland.<br /> <br /> The ranch headquarters in Bechers Bay comprised the ranch house, bunkhouse and two barns, dating to the 1860s or '70s. A small schoolhouse and other outbuildings were added in the 1900s. Vail & Vickers purchased a new boat, repaired buildings and fences, and built additional fences and corrals. They used the old sheep pasture divisions, enhancing them for cattle use and avoided overgrazing by moving the cattle from pasture to pasture and regulating numbers according to the amount of available feed and water. All pastures, roundups and perennial streams were identified by name, most of which were place names that carried over from the nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers stocked the island on a double season strategy, giving cattle two full feed seasons for growth. Depending on the season and forage quality, between 3,000 and 7,000 head of cattle grazed on the island at any given time. Round-up corrals were located at Arlington, Las Cruces and China Camp by 1929. Vail & Vickers owned the cattle boat Vaquero to transport their cattle to and from the island. When the government confiscated the boat for use in World War II, Vail & Vickers replaced her with the Vaquero II in 1959. The boats were equipped with pens to hold the cattle and the island pier had a loading chute allowing the cattle to be loaded and unloaded on the boat. Cattle leaving the island were held in the ranch corrals at the head of the pier and were run down the pier and loaded onto the boat before sunrise.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers did not develop many roads on the island until the late 1940s. Ranch superintendent C. W. Smith blasted out a road along a cattle trail into the steep canyons on the north side of the island during the 1920s and 30s. Oil companies constructed roads in 1932 and the 1940s for exploratory drilling. The military built roads during the 1950s.<br /> <br /> Members of the Vail family managed the ranch operations from Los Angeles and later Santa Barbara, and regularly visited the island. After Walter Vail's death in 1906, his son N.R. managed the ranch. In 1943 N.R.'s brother Edward took over management until 1962, when his nephew Al succeeded him. Al Vail, the third generation of Vails to manage the ranch, continued ranch operations until the ranch shut down in 1998. The Vail & Vickers cattle operation ended in 1998 with the removal of the last herds of cattle, nearly 100 years after they purchased the island ranch.<br /> <br /> <strong>Other Uses of Santa Rosa Island</strong><br /> The Vails began importing deer and elk to the island for sport hunting around 1910, although there are accounts of deer and elk on the island prior to that date. Elk were reportedly shipped from the San Joaquin Valley, Yellowstone National Park, and the Rocky Mountains. Deer were introduced in 1929 and came from several sources, primarily the Kaibab National Forest. Until the 1970s, hunting was primarily done by the cowboys, Vail & Vickers family members, friends and guests, and included active efforts to rid the island of the feral pig population. Commercial hunting began in 1977 and ended in 2011 with the end of the Vail's reservation of use and occupancy on the island.<br /> <br /> When the Santa Barbara area was discovered to be a rich source of oil, oil companies sought to drill exploratory wells on the islands. Standard Oil Company developed a well in the high elevations of the island in 1932, but was unsuccessful. Signal Oil and its partners also drilled for oil in a number of locations and were not successful. The oil companies constructed roads to their wells that became important routes on the island in later days.<br /> <br /> After the United States joined World War II, the military negotiated a lease with Vail & Vickers in 1943 to set up an early warning radar facility on the south side of the island. The Army Corps of Engineers built a radar system at a location now called Signal Hill and a cantonment about three miles away. The site was closed as the war ended and the buildings and materials were left to be used by the ranch.<br /> <br /> As a consequence of the Cold War, in 1950 the Air Force leased 336 acres on the south side of the island to house the 669th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. They constructed an advanced technical outpost on a high peak and established a residential, maintenance and administrative area for over 200 personnel, along with a pier, at Johnson's Lee. The Navy added missile-tracking facilities on Navy Hill in 1952. The Air Force base closed in 1963 when advancing technology made it redundant. The buildings and materials again were left for the use of the ranch, which made use of the guardrails for corral construction and windows, doors and building materials for new buildings around the ranch.<br /> <br /> <strong>Channel Islands National Park</strong><br /> Legislation creating Channel Islands National Park in 1980 expanded the boundaries of the 1938 National Monument to encompass Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and San Miguel islands. In December 1986, the National Park Service purchased the island from Vail and Vickers. Vail & Vickers retained a twenty-five year reservation of use and occupancy of about seven acres in Bechers Bay and negotiated a special use permit to continue their cattle ranching and commercial deer and elk hunting on the island.<br /> <br /> The Park Service set up its island operations at Johnson's Lee and began improvements to the island's water and wastewater systems. The park established a campground, constructed a generator facility and photovoltaic system, improved the pier at Bechers Bay and opened the island to visitor use. In the mid-1990s the park moved its operations to the ranch area and constructed park housing and a maintenance facility on a hill above Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> Cattle ranching ended on Santa Rosa Island with the last of the cattle being shipped to the mainland in 1998. The twenty-five-year use and occupancy reservation expired in 2011, leaving the entire island under the management of the National Park Service. Approximately 5,000 visitors come to Santa Rosa Island each year to explore the world of the native Chumash, walk the shores where European explorers landed, visit the island ranch complex, and see coastal California as it might have been hundreds of years ago.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>Ethnographic Island Place Names</u></strong></p> <p>Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p> <p><br /> <strong>More Information on the Chumash Name wima</strong><br /> Fernando Librado stated that \"It is here, where the wim̓a does not grow and is hard to get, that the Indians made good board canoes. wim̓a is driftwood, mostly redwood, which floats down the coast after a storm on the sea and comes from the west into the channel... Redwood was the best of the wim̓a from which to make a board canoe.\"<br /> <br /> Harrington noted that wim̓a was essentially synonymous with redwood, and the usages described here are confidently attributed to Sequoia. The Spanish term Pino Colorado may sometimes refer to at least one kind of pine and perhaps to other coniferous trees as well.</p>",

The meaning is unknown.  <br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Scorpion Rock is closed to all landing to protect nesting and roosting seabirds.</strong></em><br /> <br /> <b>An Ideal Isolated Home</b><br /> A cool, salty mist fills the air as you approach Scorpion Rock overlook. The ever-present western gulls and graceful pelicans often can be sighted soaring along the steep, rugged volcanic cliffs. These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Cruz Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to eleven different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> Thirty shorebird and twelve seabird species have been recorded, including: half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls; 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets; the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.; and the the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Impacts to Seabirds</b> </strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island. On Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> <u>Seabird Monitoring and Restoration</u><strong> </strong><br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> On Santa Cruz Island, these efforts have focused on closing off public access to certain habitat critical sea caves and restoring seabird habitat on Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks. These rocks are important nesting islets for burrow-nesting seabirds. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing non-native vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and closures to protect nesting seabirds. For more information about seabird restoration visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/seabird-restoration.htm\">Seabird Restoration Videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.montroserestoration.noaa.gov/restoration/seabirds/santa-cruz-island/\">Montrose Settlement Restoration Program</a> .<br /> <br /> <b>Ocean Habitat</b><br /> <br /> <u>Mixing of Waters and the Diversity of Marine Life</u><strong> </strong><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. Santa Cruz Island lies in the middle of this transition zone. The western half of the island harbors numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on this eastern end of the island.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island also serves as the meeting ground for seabirds and shore birds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, have nested at Fraser Point on the island's west end. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> <u>The Giant Kelp Forest</u><strong> </strong><br /> From this vantage point, one also has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park-the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow 2 feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredientcalled algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> <u>Marine Protected Areas</u><strong> </strong><br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commerci;al harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

Giant coreopsis, dudleya, locoweed, lupine, buckwheat, coastal sagebrush, and poppies are all recolonizing the island to their former extent, returning San Miguel to its more natural state.<br /> <br /> Also making a comeback, after years of hunting, are the thousands of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) that breed, pup, and haul out on the island's 27 miles of isolated coastline. Hikers who make the all-day, ranger-guided, 16-mile round-trip hike across the island to Point Bennett will never forget seeing one of the world's most spectacular wildlife displays-over 30,000 pinnipeds and up to five different species hauled out on the point's beaches at certain times of year.<br /> <br /> Other wildlife include the island fox and deer mouse. Both of these little creatures are endemics-they are found only on the Channel Islands. The island fox, the size of a house cat, is the largest land animal on the island. In the waters surrounding San Miguel, the marine animals get much larger. Dolphins and porpoises are often spotted along with gray whales, killer whales, and the largest animals of all, blue whales.<br /> <br /> In the spring and summer the skies are filled with birds. Boaters entering Cuyler Harbor receive a greeting from western gulls, California brown pelicans, cormorants, and Cassin's auklets that nest on Prince Island. Black oystercatchers, with their bright red bills and pink feet, feed along the beach. Terrestrial residents include the western meadowlark, rock wren, and song sparrow, an endemic subspecies. Peregrine falcons have recently been restored to the island and are nesting successfully once again after years of decimation by the pesticide DDT.<br /> <br /> In addition to the variety of natural resources, San Miguel hosts an array of cultural resources as well. The Chumash and their ancestors lived on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years. Today there are over 600 fragile, relatively undisturbed archeological sites. The oldest one dates back to 11,600 years before the present-some of the oldest evidence of human presence in North America. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and his men laid eyes on San Miguel Island in 1542. Upon claiming the island for the Spanish crown, Cabrillo named it \"La Posesion.\" Some stories say that Cabrillo wintered and died on San Miguel Island. No one knows where Cabrillo is buried, but there is a memorial commemorating the explorer on a bluff overlooking Cuyler Harbor.<br /> <br /> Other outstanding island resources that visitors may experience on San Miguel include the caliche forest (sand-castings of ancient vegetation), fossil bones of the Pleistocene pygmy mammoths that stood four to six feet at the shoulders, 150 years of ranching history, and numerous shipwrecks. Whether you are interested in life of the past or life of the present, San Miguel Island has it in abundance.

However, this island is more challenging to get to and the weather can be windy at anytime of year-30 knots of wind is not uncommon. Therefore, visitors must be prepared for adverse weather. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting San Miguel Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Access By Permit Only</strong><br /> A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics, they will provide the forms to you upon your reservation. Private boaters can obtain the forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trail head entry on San Miguel Island. It is the responsibility of private boaters to contact the park to ensure the island is open before coming ashore. Visitors are required to stay on the designated island trail system. No off-trail hiking is permitted. The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance. In addition, visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond the ranger station. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips spring through fall. Travel time is about four hours. Strong winds and rough seas are possible. Landing is at Cuyler Harbor via skiff onto a beach. Visitors must be prepared to waterproof gear and possibly get wet. Multi-island, overnight boat trips frequently visit San Miguel Island as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Plane Service</strong><br /> On a trial basis, Channel Islands Aviation offers trips year round. Travel time is about 60 minutes Landing is at a graded dirt airstrip above near the ranger station above Cuyler Harbor.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is no water available on the island. Visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> There are no tables available for picnicking on the island. If weather permits, many visitors enjoy picnicking at Cuyler Harbor beach.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> There is no visitor center on San Miguel Island. Please check with a ranger or volunteer for island information or visit our visitor center in Ventura.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> At Cuyler Harbor, rangers and volunteer naturalists offer guided hikes soon after the Island Packers boats arrive on the island. A variety of guided hikes are offered during weekends that Island Packers drops off campers. In addition, private boaters may arrange for a guided hike by contacting the San Miguel Island ranger on marine radio channel 16 or by contacting park headquarters at 805-658-5730.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Several trails traverse San Miguel Island providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities. While many parts of the island are closed to protect wildlife, fragile plants, and geological features, several areas are open for you to explore. Visitors may explore the two-mile long-Cuyler Harbor beach and one-mile-long trail to the ranger station on their own. To see other parts of the island, such as Point Bennett or the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger or volunteer. As described above, they are usually available to lead hikes. All hikers must stay on the trails to protect fragile vegetation and for visitor safety. No off-trail hiking is allowed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is only available at the established campground near the historic Lester ranch site (nine sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, windbreak, and pit toilet are provided. Water is not available and there is no shade. Distance from the boat landing at Cuyler Harbor beach to the campground is a steep, uphill over one-mile hike. Pack gear in backpacks for hauling uphill and waterproof for a possible wet landing. Campers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes, and line for securing tents to ground, table, or wind shelters are recommended. Fog can occur during any season producing cool, damp conditions. Due to the boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Due to the strong, persistent wind,swimming, snorkeling, diving, and kayaking are limited and recommended for the experienced visitor only. In addition, landing and beach access is only allowed at Cuyler Harbor. Despite the wind, Cuyler Harbor is one of the most scenic beaches in the park.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the marine reserves located around the island. Fishing is allowed outside of these areas. To fish in Channel Islands National Park, possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> The reward for enduring the long boat ride, the wind, and the fog is exceptional wildlife viewing. Although the guided, 16-mile roundtrip hike to Point Bennett requires some stamina, visitors get a chance to see one of the largest congregations of wildlife in the world-over 30,000 animals and up to five different species. Cuyler Harbor offers exceptional seabird viewing thanks to Prince Island that hosts 13 nesting seabirds, making it one of the most important and biologically diverse nesting habitats on the West Coast of North America. There is also very good seabird viewing on the boat ride over. Tell boat staff you are interested in seeing seabirds and they will help keep a lookout. Given the wind, landbirds are best spotted in Nidever Canyon. The island fox is secretive, but is occasionally seen around the campground area. San Miguel Island's native vegetation has made a remarkable recovery after years of grazing by nonnative animals. In some spots, the island coreopsis are head high. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Fortunately, the only accessible tidepool location on the island happens to be a very good one. No ranger escort is needed to hike to the tidepools at the eastern end of Cuyler Harbor.</p> <p><br /> <strong><em>Ethnographic Island Place Names</em></strong><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

It means 'the trail of fresh water at swaxǝɬ.'   <br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <b>Geology of Scorpion Canyon</b><br /> Above the canyon lies a layer of the Monterey Formation, a siliceous shale. Within the canyon, erosion has exposed the volcanic rocks lying underneath. These rocks reveal a fascinating story about the formation of the Channel Islands. Between 15-30 million years ago, lava flows and volcanoes covered much of the area that now comprises the northern Channel Islands and the western Santa Monica Mountains. In some places the lava accumulated to as much as 10,000 feet thick. A certain type of lava, pillow lava, found in some of these rocks is evidence that much of the volcanic action took place below the surface of the ocean. In other places, oyster shells and other marine fossils are found embedded in the lava. At times, the buildup of lava was great enough that volcanic islands formed. These islands probably were short lived and were eroded to below sea level after the volcanic action ceased.<br /> <br /> The reason for these volcanic eruptions can be found within the magnetic particles in the rocks. As the rocks were cooling, magnetic particles within the rocks would have been set in line with the magnetic poles of the earth. However, magnetic measurements now taken in these same rocks show that they do not line up. In fact, they are off by about 100 degrees, with the oldest rocks showing the largest discrepancy. Geologists believe that when these rocks were formed, the platform on which the islands rest lined up in a north-south direction along the southern coast of California, with San Miguel Island's position lying just offshore from San Diego.<br /> <br /> As the Pacific plate made contact with and began to slide past the North American plate, forming the San Andreas fault, this platform was rotated in a clockwise direction to its present east-west position. As it rotated, the crust of the ocean thinned and the resulting reduction of pressure allowed molten magma to form and ascend from the mantle, erupting under the sea as lava.<br /> <br /> Around 5 million years ago, compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of these marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common. A major fault that runs through the center of the island has moved nearly 100 feet in the last 30,000 years, and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a landbridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s.

The trail begins as a six-foot-wide compacted dirt path near the Upper Campground and narrows to a single path trail as it meanders through the rocky canyon, coyote bush and other vegetation line both sides of the trail. Bright white chalky sedimentary rock outcroppings mark the grass covered hillsides. <br />Before leaving the canyon and heading up the hillside, turn off the trail and descend into the rocky canyon bottom to explore the ravine where low growing, rock loving plants cling to the cliffs edges.

            "bodyText": "Paddling to Fort Frederica can offer a unique perspective of the former British fort and town site. This type of visit requires advance planning, however. The Frederica River is influenced by the tides, so a tide chart is essential for a paddle here. Consider the wind speed and direction as well. Paddling against the tide and/or wind can make for a challenging experience. Choppy, hazardous conditions in times of high wind are possible. It isn't recommended to paddle during these times.<br /> <br /> The kayak launch is located on the east bank of the Frederica River, just south of the fort. Instructions for use of the kayak launch are listed on the mechanism. Paddlers are to paddle onto the metal frame platform. Climb the ladder attached to the lift system, and use the hand crank on the dock to raise or lower your kayak or canoe.<br /> <br /> Questions about paddling to Fort Frederica National Monument? Call the park at (912) 638-3639 x10. A ranger can offer information about the water conditions and tides.",
            "audioDescription": "A wooden platform extends from a sea wall with medal railing. Two wooden steps with wooden railing on both sides lead down to the wooden platform that is four feet in width. The platform is surrounded on three sides by wooden railing, with the west side facing the water open. Two ropes with hooks extend the open side for safety purposes. A bench sits on the south of the platform. On the open side, a metal ladder rises from the river mud flats. A hand crank and boat lift system are attached to the ladder. A ladder stands next to the platform which paddlers can climb to access the lift system on the dock. A hand crank raises and lowers the metal frame platform where the boat sits. A metal raising on the far side of the lift system offers support for getting in and out of the boat.",

Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> On the north slopes of West Anacapa, California brown pelicans typically nest and raise their young from January through October. In fact, West Anacapa has the largest and most consistently used brown pelican nesting colony on the West Coast of the United States. Brown pelicans will abandon their nests if disturbed, leaving the eggs and chicks defenseless against predators such as gulls and ravens. A serious disturbance can cause an entire colony to be abandoned. For this reason Anacapa's isolation is a critical factor in the successful nesting of these seabirds.<br /> <br /> But even the island's isolation could not protect California brown pelicans from human impacts. The gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and pesticides have all been detrimental. The pesticide DDT nearly caused the pelican to become extinct as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, on neighboring Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made with just one chick surviving. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, the recovery of the California brown pelican and other seabird species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

Each generation of Hampton’s owners, many of their children and spouses, as well as two close family friends, were buried in the Ridgely family cemetery. The headstones marking their graves were usually granite, and varied in architectural styles from Gothic to Celtic and provide insight into the people who lived at Hampton. Only two non-family members are buried in the Ridgely family cemetery: Nancy Davis, formerly enslaved by the Ridgelys and later a paid servant, and Selena Devlin, a paid servant of the Ridgelys.</p> <h2>Ridgely Family Vault</h2> <p>The Ridgelys built their Family Vault in the Egyptian Revival or Greek Revival style, likely between 1810 and 1820. Designed by Baltimore architect Robert Cary Long, Sr., it is believed to have been constructed near or over the graves of Captain Charles (d. 1790) and Rebecca Ridgely (d. 1812). Located at the southeast corner of the property, the vault consisted of three marble walls and one brick wall. A brick walkway surrounded the structure and another walkway, which led to the entrance on the north façade, is evident in historic photographs from the 1930s. Ornamental plantings flanked the walkway and entrance to the Vault. Inside, the structure opened up to a vaulted space holding thirty-two graves, with burials dating from 1814 to the twentieth century.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery in Desha County, Arkansas, is one of only three extant Japanese American confinement site cemeteries in the United States. Japanese Americans incarcerated at Rohwer from 1942 to 1945 designed and built the cemetery which has several monuments, including one honoring Japanese American soldiers who died fighting in Europe during World War II.</p> <p>After Japan's devastating surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, leading to the United States' entry into World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. The Order authorized the establishment of military areas encompassing most of the West Coast of the United States, \"from which any or all persons may be excluded.\" This allowed for the forced removal of Japanese Americans and those of Japanese ancestry from these areas. This was done because of fears that they might support Japan in the war. In March 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9102, which established the War Relocation Authority, the federal agency responsible for the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans and the construction and administration of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/internment/index.htm\">confinement sites</a> throughout the United States. The U.S. military supported Executive Order 9066 by forcibly removing Japanese Americans from states on the West Coast. Through Executive Order 9066 came Proclamation No.1, which was initially a policy of voluntary participation to move. However, incarceration soon became mandatory forcing some 120,000 Japanese Americans and those of Japanese ancestry to move to 10 confinement sites across the nation.</p> <p>Rohwer Relocation Center was one of only two confinement sites located in the eastern half of the U.S. The other was the Jerome Relocation Center, 30 miles southwest of Rohwer. Built five miles west of the Mississippi River, near railway lines for easy transport of incarcerees, Rohwer was deemed secure, isolated, and livable. Construction of Rohwer began in late July 1942 and extended into January 1943, but by September 1942, the confinement site was already admitting incarcerees. Regardless of family ties, even immediate families' members ended up in different confinement sites or were separated within a site due to overcrowding and for logistical reasons. Rohwer consisted of 500 acres of wood-frame barracks, covered with tar paper and divided into blocks with twelve barracks per block. Each block also contained a mess hall, a laundry and a combination bath/toilet building. The barracks buildings were divided into six apartments of different sizes and housed 250 incarcerees. The incarcerees included first-generation Japanese nationals (<em>Issei)</em>, and second- and third-generation Japanese Americans (<em>Nisei</em> and <em>Sansei)</em>. The Rohwer Relocation Center housed a mix of generations with approximately 10% over the age of 60 and 40% under the age of 19. Over 10,000 incarcerees passed through Rohwer Relocation Center during its existence, and over two thirds of these were American citizens. The center closed in 1945, the buildings were removed, and most of the land was returned to agricultural fields.</p> <p>While in Rohwer Relocation Center, some incarcerees volunteered to enlist in the U.S. Army. The volunteer soldiers from Rohwer and other confinement sites received assignment to the 100th Infantry Battalion, a unit within the United States Army's 34th Infantry Division, later activated into the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This all-<em>Nisei</em> unit received recognition as one of the most highly decorated and respected in the U.S. Army. While the Japanese American men who enlisted left Rohwer Relocation Center to fight for their country, their families remained behind as incarcerees.</p> <p>Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery was planned and laid out in 1943-1944 and is set within a rectangular plot containing two historic monuments, 24 low-lying concrete headstones, two entrance markers, 64 concrete posts, a bench engraved with a sun and moon, and sidewalks. All were designed and built by the incarcerees. There are also 17 flowering cherry trees planted in 1994 to replicate part of the original design of the cemetery which also included water features and bridges. The historic monuments within the Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery were the largest and most elaborately detailed of all the confinement site cemeteries.</p> <p>On June 24, 1945 a monument to commemorate all those who died while incarcerated at Rohwer was dedicated at the cemetery. The historic monument still stands and consists of a square base with decorative carving and urns at the four corners. The base supports a tall obelisk with a globe and eagle on top. The base has inscribed floral patterns, and a star and circle alternately at the four corners. Decorative carvings and inscriptions in Japanese and English adorn the obelisk on all four sides. Of particular beauty are the egret and the peacock on the south face, which stand beneath a tree branch and a stylized rising sun. The American eagle beneath the star on the east face stands as a silent testimonial to the patriotism of Japanese Americans.</p> <p>The second monument, sponsored by the Rohwer chapter of the USO and designed and built by incarceree Koheiji Horizawa and his assistant Harry Fujioka, was dedicated on November 4, 1945. It commemorates the soldiers of the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team who served in Europe during World War II. The names of the incarcerees who enlisted from the Rohwer Relocation Center and were killed in action are memorialized on the monument itself. The monument has a base shaped like the lower portion of a tank with a tall, rectangular tablet and a star on top. The relief designs in the concrete feature an American flag with the colors painted into the relief on the east and west sides beneath a carving of an eagle. The inscription on the back of the monument reads \"<em>In memory of our sons who sacrificed their lives in the service of their country. They fought for freedom. They died that the world might have peace.</em>\"</p> <p>In 1982, a new granite monument topped with a bronze eagle commemorating both the incarcerees who died at Rohwer and those who died while serving in World War II, was dedicated at the cemetery. The new monument, located near the two historic monuments, was suggested by Sam Yada, a former Rohwer incarceree living in Arkansas. Mr. Yada was concerned that that the original concrete monuments, which were deteriorating, would be lost, so he proposed a new monument for the cemetery to be made of a more durable material.</p> <p>There are also 24 concrete headstones at the cemetery. All are of a similar design which consists of a low tablet placed on a rectangular base, with a scalloped concrete flower holder positioned at the front. The top of the face of the headstone is decorated with a floral pattern under which is a symbol indicating whether the deceased was Buddhist (a flower) or Christian (a cross). The name of the deceased, with birth and death dates, is located within a rectangle beneath the symbol.</p> <p>In 1974, the Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places and in 1992, it became a National Historic Landmark. Today, the majority of the Rohwer Relocation Center grounds have been converted back to farm land.<br /> <br /> Grants from the National Park Service's Japanese Confinement Sites Preservation Program have assisted efforts to document and restore the Rohwer Relocation Center Cemetery. As part of the grant, the University of Arkansas Landscape Architecture Program volunteered its services to produce an Historic American Landscape Survey report of the cemetery. This effort was aided by the University's Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) which produced a high-density survey (HDS) of the cemetery and the surrounding site. </p> <p>In addition, the National Trust for Historic Preservation worked with the Arkansas State University Heritage Sites program to produce interpretive mapping and establish educational kiosks and audio tours for the Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery. The Central Arkansas Library System also preserves creative artwork left behind by the incarcerees, such as paintings adhered to paper.</p> <p>Today, all that remains of the 500-acre Rohwer Relocation Center is the cemetery and a tall smokestack where the camp's hospital used to stand. There is a replica small scale guard tower that serves as an informational kiosk and visitors can take a self-guided walking tour along the southern boundary of the original camp. There are also interpretive panels and audio stations featuring the voice of actor George Takei, who was imprisoned at the Rohwer Relocation Center with his family in 1942, before being moved to Tule Lake Segregation Center in California. <br /> <br /> Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark,  is located on the Japanese American Internment Heritage Trail off of Arkansas Highway 1, 0.6 miles North of Rohwer, AR, and 13 miles Northeast of McGehee, AR.   For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://rohwer.astate.edu/\">Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery</a> website or contact the McGehee Chamber of Commerce.<br /> <br /> Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery is featured in the National Historic Landmark Theme Study <em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nhl/learn/themes/JapaneseAmericansWWII.pdf\">Japanese Americans in World War II</a>.</em> Rohwer Relocation Center Memorial Cemetery has been documented by the University of Arkansas through the National Park Service's <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ar1148/\">Historic American Landscapes Survey</a> program.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) was the preeminent civil rights leader of the 1950s and '60s. King was a Baptist preacher and evangelist of nonviolent resistance. King rose to prominence through the effort to desegregate buses in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955-6 and the demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 where he wrote is famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" At the height of the Civil Rights movement, King delivered his renowned \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963 during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The demonstration in particular, and the larger movement in general, helped spur lawmakers to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ending segregation and discriminatory voting laws and practices.<br /> <br /> King was particularly notable for his insistence on \"nonviolent resistance,\" a strategy he developed after studying and applying the work of Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, and Reinhold Niebuhr, among others. King realized that non-violent resistance could only succeed \"if the groups against whom the resistance was taking place had some degree of moral conscience.\" If all Americans could see the injustice inherent in Jim Crow laws, King believed morality would compel the nation to side with the activists.<br /> <br /> The strategy of non-violence allowed the demonstrators to retain a clear position as victims of amoral oppression and violence. Television, photographs, and print media would allow the world to witness the drama of oppression in the South. Men, women, and children joined in the protests knowing that they could and would be jailed, injured, or even killed. The people's courage to put themselves in harm's way in the historic moment of the Civil Rights Movement was fueled by generations of blacks that King said had been \"seared in the flames of withering injustice,\" and bolstered by faith in Dr. King's method of non-violence.<br /> <br /> This memorial to King depicts a 30-foot carving of King on a feature called the \"Stone of Hope\" that is being moved out of a feature called the \"Mountain of Despair,\" a reference to a line in the \"I Have a Dream speech\" called back in the inscription on the side of the statue. King is represented standing firm, resolute, and thoughtful, holding a rolled stack of papers. Quotations from speeches and writings are engraved on the arced \"Inscription Wall\" on the flanks of the memorial.<br /> <br /> Books and memorabilia are available in the adjacent bookstore; head through the mountain sculpture and the building will be across the street to the left. Restrooms are also located at the bookstore, accessed from outdoors on the left side of the building. <br /> <br /> The memorial opened in August 2011. The formal dedication was scheduled for the anniversary of the March on Washington on August 28, 2011 but was postponed to October due to a hurricane. The participants included President Barack Obama. </p> <h4>Inscriptions</h4> <p>\"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" District of Columbia, 1968<br /> <br /> \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\" 1963<br /> <br /> \"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger that evil triumphant.\" Norway 1964<br /> <br /> \"Make a career of humanity. Commit yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country, and a finer world to live in.\" District of Columbia, 1959<br /> <br /> \"I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America. I speak out against it not in anger but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and above all with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as a moral example of the world.\" California 1967<br /> <br /> \"If we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.\" Georgia 1967<br /> <br /> \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\" Alabama 1963<br /> <br /> \"I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.\" Norway 1964<br /> <br /> \"It is not enough to say 'We must not wage war.' It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it.

            "audioDescription": "(304 words) The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial is located along the northwest bank of the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park, midway between the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. The memorial covers four acres, and is centered around the Stone of Hope, a 30-foot granite statue of Martin Luther King, Jr. Two similar large slabs of granite sit apart and slightly behind the statue, known as the Mountain of Despair. The King statue seems to emerge from these two large boulders. The MLK figure faces southeast, in the direction of the Jefferson Memorial. His gaze is off slightly to the side and his arms are crossed. He holds what looks to be a rolled-up scroll of paper in his left hand. On the side of the Stone of Hope is the inscription \"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\" The signature of sculptor Lei Yixin can be found in the lower right corner. There are four entrances to the memorial. The main entrance leads through the two large open granite slabs. There are entrances on both sides of the memorial, and a fourth from the opposite side at the Tidal Basin. Restrooms can be found behind the center entrance and across Independence Avenue. Beyond the Stone of Hope is a wide plaza area which opens to reveal a stunning view of the Tidal Basin, Jefferson Memorial, and Washington Monument. Surrounding the King statue is a 450-foot arced wall featuring 14 quotes from King's speeches and writings. Trees surround the wall and also are within the plaza area. Water flows gently from the wall at its openings on both sides.

These buildings are documented by the detailed map of the core of the estate drawn in 1843 by surveyor Joshua Barney. Some of these quarters were near the Farm House, others were near the stables and service buildings east of the Mansion.<br /> <br /> Archeological investigations have not found any items from the days of slavery around this cabin, but newspaper fragments from 1862 were found in the mud and clay mixture between the pine log chinks. It is likely this building was moved or built from the salvaged remains of two previous slave quarters. After the joined structure was renovated and new siding was added in 1908, Charles Budd, the blacksmith, lived here.</p>",
