For many, it combines the love of outdoors with the comforts of home, including good food and a comfortable bed. That combination aptly describes a 1915 backcountry trip that was instrumental in gaining support for the creation of the National Park Service (NPS). As equipment improved in the 1920s, friends gave NPS Director Stephen T. Mather some of the latest glamping gear available.",

Population trends between 2011 and 2019 are summarized by species and park, and in relation to mean spring temperature and amount of snow. Learn which species were increasing or declining at network parks during this period.",
