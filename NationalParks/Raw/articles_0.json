A wide variety of plants and animals live in the park because it is in a transition zone between major life and climate zones.

Stonewall Jackson’s aggressiveness caused great alarm in Washington. Believing Jackson had a larger number of men, Lincoln sent thousands of Federal soldiers back to the Valley. Though this battle was a tactical loss for Jackson, he scored a strategic win by keeping the Federals from Richmond.",

Frozen ground is stable, providing a solid foundation for roads and buildings. As temperatures rise, however, permafrost can thaw and sink under the weight of these structures. Permafrost is impermeable, allowing water to pool on the surface.",

Let’s go a bit further, past the trees, all the way to the coastline. There, just in front of you: a smattering of rocks, exposed by the low tide. Step closer and see water pooling between the rocks, a crab disappearing into the sand, an anemone waving hello, and perhaps a purple sea star, clinging to one of the rocks. You've discovered the rocky intertidal zone.",

Turns out it’s a good place to catch bats that like to hunt along the creek for mosquitos, flies, and beetles. In the last few moments of sunlight, we set up four mist nets (loose, nearly invisible mesh nets) over different parts of the creek and crossed our fingers.",

The work involved removing and/or reducing vegetation next to structures to create a buffer in the event of a wildfire. Using a FireWise® approach, an area of 30 feet is cleared of excess vegetation so that firefighters have a space to suppress a wildfire.",

            "listingDescription": "Upon approaching the Guadalupe Mountains from the west, visitors traveling from the El Paso area will pass through a landscape of barren beauty. The Salt Flats are a remnant of an ancient, shallow lake that once occupied this area during the Pleistocene Epoch, approximately 1.8 million years ago. Salt collected here as streams drained mineral-laden water into this basin. The salt deposits left behind would later become a precious resource to the people of the El Paso area.",

            "listingDescription": "At Arches National Park, scientists measured discharge at three springs less than a mile from each other over 14 years. The results identified spring types that may be more stable over time and have greater ability to make it through extended drought without drying. The study showed how having access to long-term ecological monitoring data can help park managers to maximize the potential success of conservation efforts.",

Having resigned her permanent ranger position after her marriage, Marguerite Lindsley Arnold returned to Yellowstone National Park under the temporary park ranger (naturalist) title from 1929 to 1931. Yosemite rehired Ranger Enid Michael as temporary naturalist each summer from 1928 to 1942. A handful of other parks hired a few new women under the newly created ranger-naturalist designation.",

            "listingDescription": "Beatrice Rhodes spent ten years (1920-30) as the steward of Lehman Caves in Great Basin National Park along with her first husband. Her time there coincided with the era’s burgeoning automobile tourist industry, fueling a desire among many to explore the US West and escape the pressures of urban modernity. Rhodes’ role as an advertiser, tour guide, and even entertainer at the Lehman Caves embodied this trend to seek excitement and individuality in the rural West.",

Fuels include grasses, needles, leaves, brush, and trees. Where and how quickly a fire moves depends on the terrain, weather, and types of fuel. The diversity of plants and animals in many national parks can depend upon fire. What may look at first like devastation soon becomes a panorama of new life.",

Urban forests, however, are beneficial in reducing surface runoff.",

When it first laid tracks down at the Charlestown Navy Yard in the 1860s, it relied on animal-drawn railcars. These trains proved useful in moving bulk materials like coal around the yard, which was increasingly in demand to fuel metal forges and steam engines in workshops.",

Caribou have been vitally important for the survival of all native people whose homelands are now partially encompassed by Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. For some tribes, caribou is just part of a diet which also includes other game, fish and marine mammals. But for the Nunamiut Eskimos, caribou is by far the single most important food source.",

Recorded paleontological discoveries were made in the immediate area as early as 1816. However, the region has lacked the level of attention and scientific study of other northern areas such as the Klondike and the Yukon, and is therefore lesser known.",

Stampeding became a way of life for many frontier adventurers, and when Alaska’s boomtowns became too crowded or the pay-dirt too scarce, these wanderers followed rumors of gold into Denali's Kantishna region.",
