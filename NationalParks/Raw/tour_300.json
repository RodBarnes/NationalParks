                    "audioTranscript": "Voice 1:\n\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean, fish like river herring make their home in the open waters. They compete with other species, dodge predators, and swim free in the salt water. Though the ocean is a prime habitat for fish growth, it may not be the best place for a little herring to hatch. Anadromous fish, like river herring, are a special type of fish that live in the ocean, but lay their eggs in fresh water.\n\nSo those herring that reach maturity head back to a fresh water river to lay their eggs. In the spring they swim up the Chesapeake Bay and into the fresh water rivers like those where they were born—each striving to contribute to the next generation of herring. Some swim north through the Potomac River and eventually find their way up to Rock Creek Park. But here, they hit a wall. In 1903, a decorative waterfall was built on Rock Creek four miles from the Potomac River at Peirce Mill, creating a beautiful water feature for the historic mill, but a big problem for the migrating fish.\n\nObstacles like this one once blocked the fish passage, making it impossible for fish to get to the safe waters upstream to lay their eggs. Luckily everything changed when in 2006 Rock Creek Park reopened 21 miles of the creek to the fish whose ancestors were born here. But the waterfall at Peirce Mill still blocks the creek—so how are fish getting around it? They climb a ladder of course!\n\nBill Yeaman:\n\nA fish ladder is a structure that is built and designed to permit the movement of fish above a barrier of some kind and it could be a sewer line or, in the case of Rock Creek, it’s a historic dam that’s eight feet tall. There’s a baffle that will increase in height as you go from the bottom of the fish ladder to the top. The fish ladder is built so that fish can move past the dam, up the series of baffles to continue upstream.\n\nVoice 1:\n\nNow that the fish can come home to lay their eggs, a new generation of river herring and shad are able to hatch in the safety of Rock Creek before they swim back downstream to the ocean. Maybe one day, if they’re lucky, they’ll find their way back to Rock Creek again.",

The dam provided ambiance to park visitors who visited the site, but it prevented the fish from navigating further upstream.\n\n*Do not walk out onto the dam.

Civic clubs were solicited for construction funds, and an administration building, dining hall, nursery, two pavillions, two bathhouses, three dozen tent platforms, a pool, and ball fields were built.

Before you is a wetland pine savannah with several large trees dotting the landscape of the park. The Battle of Moores Creek Bridge is a Civil War pitting North Carolinians against one another. Years of social upheaval in the North Carolina backcountry left the colony broken and divided. While the Sons of Liberty (Patriots) disapproved of the taxes levied by Great Britain in the years leading up to the American Revolution, the Sons of Liberty in North Carolina would band with Royal Governor William Tryon (1765-1771) to levy similar tax against North Carolinians. These unfair taxes would lead to an uprising between 1768-1771 known as the “War of Regulation” ending with one battle known as the Battle of Alamance. \n\nA victory by Governor Tryon and the North Carolina Sons of Liberty in 1771, created a divide between the Sons of Liberty of North Carolina and the backwoodsmen known as Regulators who lost the war.  The Sons of Liberty in North Carolina only furthered that divide in 1774 when the Continental Congress inquired about them. Stating the Regulators were outlaws and unsuited for the Patriot cause. \nLooking to take advantage of that divide, Royal Governor Josiah Martin (1771-1776). Martin sided with the Regulators after he became Royal Governor, enraging the Patriots. When hostilities broke out up north in 1775, Martin lost control of North Carolina. Martin looking to retake the colony, devised a plan to regain North Carolina by force. This plan involved rallying the Regulators, and Highland Scots who had recently entered the colony. \nThe Highlanders had given their oath to the crown to gain land in the colonies, and many of them had given their oaths to Martin as well. About 200 Regulators and 1400 Highlanders would assemble to fighting the Battle of Moores Creek Bridge.\n\nThe Patriots had suffered from taxes levied against the colonies for years after the French and Indian War. Their biggest complaint was that they had no representation in the British government, no delegate of their own to speak for them. In North Carolina the Patriots gained control in 1775, banishing Royal Governor Josiah Martin.",

The Venus Fly Trap looks like    any other plant, but it contains a deadly secret. It is one of the only carnivorous plants in the world. How does such a simple plant lure unsuspecting animals? The plant gives off a smell that attracts potential prey (namely insects, spiders, and beetles). The animals fly into the open trap and start pressing against the exposed hairs. Once the hairs have been triggered twice, the trap slowly starts to close on the unsuspecting animal. After a few days of digestion, the plant reopens, ready for its next meal. Humans continue to be fascinated with this plant and as a result the plant is on the endangered species list. Moores Creek National Battlefield is one of the only places you will find these wonders of nature in the wild.\n\nThe Historic Road (The Black River Road) is the only visual landmark that exist from the time of the battle.  The road represents commerce and travel during the colonial period, but also it was the route that both the Patriots and Loyalist used to get their respective armies to Moores Creek Bridge, Loyalists trying to get to the coast, and Patriots trying to stop the march to the coast. In front of you today, you can see a remnant of the historic road that passed through here in 1776. This road connected Wilmington to Cross Creek and Campbelltown (modern-day Fayetteville, NC).",

The two armies began playing a game of cat and mouse throughout eastern North Carolina. The historic Black River Road passed through the area, near where you are standing. Loyalist forces under Brigadier General Donald MacDonald began marching from Cross Creek to the coast. Patriot forces under Colonel Richard Caswell were outflanked by the Loyalists at Corbett’s Ferry. Caswell ordered his men to fall back to Moores Creek Bridge, a crossing the Loyalists would have to make. While Caswell’s forces chased MacDonald, more Patriot forces under Colonel Alexander Lillington began constructing earthworks on the east side of Moores Creek. What are earthworks, you may ask? Earthworks are an earthen fortification. Imagine building a life-size sandcastle to defend yourself.  The Patriot force of 1,000 men faced superior numbers from the Loyalists numbering 1,600. To even the odds and improve their chances of victory, the Patriots dug in. They created earthworks for protection. The earthworks placed one hundred feet from the bridge were designed in a circular pattern.  The earthen fortification also sat on an elevated ridge overlooking the bridge. Between the earthworks and the bridge was a long narrow causeway between a swamp and the creek. The terrain and placement of the earthworks would make any attack difficult for on coming soldiers. During the time of the battle of the battle, it is believed that the earthworks were about five feet tall.",

Named for Elisabeth Moore, a lady who owned the land during the time of the battle, Moores Creek is 10-feet-deep in most places. The deep waters of the creek would force the loyalists to use Moores Creek Bridge to cross, making the bridge an ideal defensive position for the Patriots. When you first walk on to the boardwalk you will notice there is no wall on that portion of the earthworks. That is because that portion of the earthwork is defended by the deep waters of Moores Creek and a swampy area just on the opposite side of the creek.",

The night before the Battle of Moores Creek Bridge, around 1,000 Patriots were encamped here. Around 6 pm on February 26, 1776, a Loyalists courier, James Hepburn, entered the camp here with a letter from General Donald MacDonald. The content of the letter asked for the Patriots to surrender to the Loyalists. Caswell refused and sent the courier back to General MacDonald with his reply. While the Loyalists discussed their next move, Caswell ordered his men into the earthworks on the east bank sometime during the night to join Lillington’s men. \nThe Loyalists decided to advance from their position, six miles away. MacDonald who was sick from the cold North Carolina weather, turned command over to Lt. Colonel Donald McLeod. They made a night march to surprise the Patriots, who the Loyalists believed to still be camped on the west bank of Moores Creek. When they entered the camp around 5:00 am the morning of February 27, 1776, they found it abandoned. Feeling the Patriots had abandoned their position, the Loyalists looked for the Moores Creek Bridge.",

A loyalist advance guard encountered the bridge first. Standing on the west bank, the loyalists were unable to see the Patriot forces on the east bank. Standing on the east bank were Patriot sentries. When the loyalists realized they were Patriots, the Loyalists opened fire. The Patriots did not return fire and retreated into the darkness. The Loyalists then gave the order to advance. Crossing the bridge was difficult as the Patriots had disassembled the bridge, leaving only the support beams behind, soaked in animal fat and grease. Some Loyalists fell into the creek as they attempted to cross. Lt. Col. McLeod finally made it across the bridge with around 50 men. McLeod then drew his sword and gave the battle cry, “King George and Broadswords!” The loyalists moved down the causeway feeling the Patriots were now in full retreat. As you walk across the bridge, you will notice a monument to the bridge on the opposite side. The US Army placed the marker in the 1930s to mark the location of the bridge.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The Patriot Army on February 27, 1776, consisted of men from places like Wilmington, New Bern, and Kinston. They were farmers, merchants, blacksmiths, and slaves. Many of these men still considered themselves good British subjects, but they had grown weary of over-taxation by the British Government. When the Patriots learned a British Army was preparing to retake the colony by force, many of them who were Minutemen rushed out of their homes and businesses to take up arms against the Crown. Over the course of a few minutes on February 27, 1776, the fate of North Carolina, and the rest of the colonies, was decided here on these grounds. A Patriot victory here would encourage the Sons of Liberty in North Carolina, on April 12, 1776, to vote for Independence. North Carolina was the first American Colony to do so. Like a piece of a puzzle, the Battle of Moores Creek played an ever-important role in completing the quest for Independence from Great Britain. In 1857, this monument, known as the Grady Monument, or Patriot Monument, was placed here so we could remember the Patriots who fought for our Independence. This monument commemorates this Patriot victory and honors the only Patriot who died during the battle, Private John Grady of Duplin County. During the dedication ceremony in 1857, the cornerstone for the obelisk was laid into a brick foundation, which contained the reinterred remains of Grady. Sometime during that year, the obelisk, which was imported from Philadelphia, was placed on top of the cornerstone and brick foundation. Staring up at this prominent memorial anchoring the corner of this hallowed ground, let us recall the final thoughts from an “Address Delivered at the Celebration of the Battle of Moores Creek Bridge, February 27th, 1857”: “So let that monument which on this spot we build, proclaim to all the world the prompt obedience which our brave forefathers yielded to their country’s bidding and show how– “When their country called, and called in wild despair, the Patriots came, and all their soul was here.” Let us my countrymen, ever hallow in our hearts, the spot on which we stand – let the monument we build on it be an altar of freedom where we may ever rekindle the expiring fires of patriotism.",

                    "audioTranscript": "“King George and Broadswords,” the battle cry, given by the Loyalists as they charged up the causeway in front of the earthworks. Braving a storm of lead given by the Patriots, the Loyalists advanced four times to take Moores Creek Bridge and failed. These Loyalists were not only British; they were not only Highland Scots; but uniquely North Carolinians, fighting for what they considered to be right and just; they fought to protect their families in their new home granted to them by the King. If the Loyalists had not fought here at Moores Creek Bridge, North Carolina possibly would not have instructed its delegates to vote for Independence. The MCMA felt that it was their duty to remember the Loyalists, for without their actions to protect the rightful government of this colony, a new government possibly would have never been formed. In 1909, the Moores Creek Monumental Association, or MCMA, established the Loyalist Monument to remember the Loyalists and their story. \n\nThe monument is a granite, pointed column atop a base of three tiered steps. A polished frame in the column is inscribed and is crowned above the inscription with a bas-relief thistle. A national symbol of Scotland, the thistle refers to the Scottish Highlanders who fought as Loyalists. The thistle also represents earthly sorrows, a symbol typically found in mourning imagery.",

Much of what you sense here comes from the presence of sulfur in its many forms. Hydrogen sulfide gas creates the pungent odor of rotten eggs; microbes convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to clay; and sulfur minerals paint the features in hues of yellow and shades of gray.  \n\nYou may complete the .6-mile (1-km) loop in as little as a half-hour or be out for an hour or more. This audio tour heads toward Dragon’s Mouth Spring and follows the counter-clockwise route, which is steeper than the clockwise route.  \n\nBefore heading out, a few safety notes: \n\nIt can be windy, so cinch down your hats and secure personal items. \n\nStay on the boardwalks and established trails at all times. Superheated water is just below a thin crust throughout the basin. Besides the high chance of breaking through the crust and causing bodily injury or death, leaving the trail can damage hydrothermal features—ruining the experience for everyone. \n\nBoardwalks can be slippery when wet or covered in snow. \n\nWatch for wildlife and maintain the minimum safe distance of 25 yards (23 m or 2 bus-lengths) from any wildlife—and 100 yards (91 m or 8 bus-lengths) from bears or wolves.  \n\nReady? As you walk from feature to feature, listen to the sounds, notice the smells, and observe the colors unique to the Mud Volcano area.",

They described it as “a boiling spring, a placid pond, a deep dry funnel or an active geyser according to the time of one’s visit.” At that time, muddy water would explode 50 feet (17 m) into the air every few hours. The geyser died in the 20th century, its plumbing clogged with mud and gravel. In 1993, soil temperatures skyrocketed for unknown reasons and trees began drying around the geyser’s south rim. By January 1995, a new feature on the south bank of Mud Geyser had burst onto the scene. Steam vents and shallow pools sizzled. In 1999, mudpots formed and then exploded, leaving a deep hole with more sizzling features and mud.",

At any time during this tour, we invite you to spend extra time in any area.\n\nAs you journey with us for the next hour, you'll experience a glimpse of the histories of the towns of Marrill and Malin in southern Oregon, Tulelake in Butte Valley in California.\n\nBy the eighteen hundreds, the principal tribal group of the Tulelake Basin, where the Madoc spending their winters in one of their 20 semipermanent settlements, most a long lost river.\n\nPlease continue to the trapping display.\n\nFur trapping lured whites to this area. The early day trappers come in this area looking for beaver, mostly wood over, and it wasn't used in making gold. They used to make it a fancy top hat that was in place, in those days.\n\nTrapper Peter Skene Ogden wrote of the first contact with the Indians of the Tulelake Basin in December 1826. He described crossing Lost River after the natural bridge was pointed out by friendly Modoc.\n\nThe next whites came in 1846 before the war with Mexico. When Capt. John C. Fremont arrived on a surveying and scouting mission for the government. Technically the land was still part of Mexico.\n\nAfter the Modoc war, the region was open to expanded settlement, farms and ranches began to dot the countryside. Most supply shipped from California to the base and had to follow a twisting road through the mountains to Lairds Landing at the southern end of lower Klamath Lake. Their goods were loaded onto steam boats and barges and hauled north to Linkville. In 1892, Linkville was renamed Klamath Falls to entice people to come to the falls, which following the construction of dams, no longer exist.\n\nContinue to the display of Jesse Carr.\n\nJesse Carr stage contract through the area brought him into contact with Jesse Applegate then living at Clear Lake. By 1872, the two were in cattle partnership while negotiating for the land around Clear Lake, Carr acquired his first property along the shores of Tulelake. He bought the estates of Henry Miller and William Brothertown, who were killed in the Modoc War. By 1888 Carr owned or controlled most of the land between Tulelake and Clear Lake, approximately seventy five thousand acres.\n\nLocate the display of J. Frank Adams.\n\nAfter stage driving from Redding to Ashland, Frank met Charlie Crowley, and the two decided to seek their fortunes in the horse and cattle country farther north. They rode into the Butte Creek country and went to work for Dalton and Fairchild in 1872, breaking horses for troops to use in the Modoc War. Adams was 17 and Crowley, 16, but boys were men in those days.\n\nIn 1879, Adams settled on a piece of property on the northeast side of Lost River near the northern shore of Tulelake. He raised cattle and horses, including registered Percheron large workhorses used throughout the basin.\n\nFrank Adams, Dan and Clint Van Brimmer were among those who believe that farming in the region needed irrigation. The Van Brimmer's spent four years constructing a canal to bring water east from White Lake to the west and south sides of Lost River. Next, Adams began construction on his own canal on the east side of Lost River. As agreed, Adams tapped into Van Brimmer's canal, running water across Lost River through an eight foot wide wooden flume. It was then channeled into a six mile canal to supply water to farmland on the east side of Lost River north of Tulelake. Adams next constructed a channel between White Lake and Lower Klamath Lake.\n\nThrough these efforts, a series of new communities would spring to life. And one of the world's most complex and successful irrigation projects would be developed. W. C. Dalton.\n\nW. C. Dalton arrived in Modoc County January 1st. Nineteen hundred to be foreman of the Carr Ranch, a well-respected and generous man. He was interested in the success of the community of Malin. There he made his home and business, eventually owning and operating the ranch he had come to oversee. The results of his efforts are evident today in the ranch still owned by his family and in the warm and colorful town of Malin.\n\nA lot of good stories. You hear very little that Mr. Dalton. He was strict, he was harsh, but he was fair. And he sold land to people who wanted to Homestead with on the terms that they could pay it off.\n\nAround the end of this hall on your left, find the potato festival and Malin celebrations displays.",

Klamath Basin grown potatoes were the focal point of the event. A modest barbecue was offered in the basement of the Merrill Community Hall. I\n\nn 1936. The tradition of crowning a queen began. And soon, the event included a barbecue, parade, displays, football game and a dance. During the World War two years, the event was scaled back to only include a late harvest dance.\n\nThose humble beginnings fostered the growth of the yearly celebration known as the Klamath Basin Potato Festival.\n\nCelebrations remain a part of the community of Malin.\n\nWe had the national so-called celebration and then went into the elementary school in the football field that we have out there now.\n\nIn nineteen twenty eight, we had a West Coast conference to select conference here, and they had people come all the way from Chicago. They had to make your own entertainment. They had dances, special events, special occasion, anything that can be celebrated. My dad used to tell me they used to have this the spring festival when the ice would break on the lake, they'd have a celebration for that. They would have all kinds of celebrations. They had the pioneer days, which started in the 30s. Pretty soon, the city started having regular celebrations there, 40 or 50 or 60, a diamond jubilee. And we have a car cruise that has been going for several years to celebrate the Fourth of July. And different groups have put different affairs on, and they're always tied into the park.\n\nTurn to see the Buffalo head.\n\nThe Tulelake Butte Valley Fair is an event that symbolizes the pride of the region, where families and friends join together to celebrate, to socialize and to remember.\n\nI have never known better, sharper, more dedicated group of people in my life and that there more have been for the Rotary Club, have you ever had to write.

They develop 80 of those acres into a town recruiting businesses. Soon the town flourished, and by 1909, Mel was known as the flower city because of its large flower mill.\n\nA major fire in 1911 destroyed almost an entire block. New buildings soon replaced those lost cinders from Lava Beds were barged across Tulelake and up Lost River. The boats were tied at the town's docks and the cinders were spread on the streets of Merrill.\n\nAnother major fire struck in 1920.\n\nAgain, the town rebuilt.\n\nBy the 1930s, there were improvements to the town's volunteer fire department. But in 1949, the elementary school was lost to fire.\n\nTwo railroads by the early 1930s aided Merrill's economic growth. Today, Merrill remains a viable agricultural community. It's one hundred and thirty six foot flagpole memorializes American prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action. It represents a strong, patriotic commitment by the proud citizens of Merrill.\n\nContinue stopping next at the section for Malin.\n\nIn 1909, a barren sagebrush covered land on the northeastern shore of Tulelake was shown to the three scouts from the Bohemian Colonization Club.\n\nThey saw past the rabbit infested sandy terrain that rimmed the Tule bordered late. Their insight, ambition and determination led the way for early pioneers who followed them to purchase land, grub the sagebrush, build homes and plant crops.\n\nAnd they had rabbit drys, and that really turned out to be a pretty good thing because Klamath County was paying five cent bounty on jack rabbit ears on a pair of jack rabbit ears. And the first guy they killed over 2000 jackrabbits. Why, Frank Adams, he would loan him equipment, and they only record they kept was just on the back of the barn door. People would write up well such and such got this piece of equipment there that when it was brought back, it be scratched off. Yeah. Farmers way back in the early forties knew with all the ditches and stuff around, was worried about the young kids drowning without a chance to learn to swim. And so the farmers got around and they built the swimming pool at the land. That aside, why cut a tree down, we got all these trees in the park and so started putting lights on in the trees in the park, and first few years they put two or three on and then they were five or six and then people started buying the lights and putting them on. And it got up to where I think this last year, 80 some trees decorated in the park. But we always had a community spirit where the people were helping one another and working together instead of against one another.\n\nAnd my dad always said my uncle said the same thing. They didn't speak the native tongue at home. They want to be good Americans. They had to learn English. And the children were learning at school, so they had to pass it on to them.\n\nThe dances were held in a Malin Broadway hall. And box killing, who also like to dance, was able to get some of the best dance bands. And I especially remember Phil Harris and his dance band. And we danced till 2:30 or 3 in the morning.\n\nNext stop, Butte Valley.\n\nThis area of over a hundred and thirty square miles is located in north central Siskiyou County, in a high desert valley surrounded by mountains. Arid lands of sagebrush and blowing sand give way to lush timber, fertile green meadows and crystal clear creeks. Majestic Mt. Shasta towers above the area, creating a spectacular landscape.\n\nLegendary Modoc chief Captain Jack is said to have been born at Jack Springs near the Oklahoma Flats. White men settled the region in the early sixties.\n\nMany changes have occurred in Butte Valley, but the spirit of survival continues. The largest flagpole this side of the Mississippi, towers two hundred feet above the streets, greeting travelers with a show of patriotism.\n\nButte Valley is a fertile country and lots of different things, potatoes and alfalfa and things like that, and cattle are raised there. It's just a good place to live. I've lived here all my life. Sheepy Creek was named after Indian by the name Sheepy, and he had this property that press doors told him the government was wanting to buy the property and he offered him a dollar for it which Sheepy took. Captain Jack and his Modoc tribe wanted this as a home for their tribe. Captain Jack lived right at a spring at the head of Sheep Creek, and that is called Jack Spring. To this day, prosperous school was established in 1918 and Sheepy Creek.\n\nA lot of your country and Western singers, you know, like Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, all the old country and Western singers, a lot of them would hit the Red Bar, you know, and come there. And it would be a great place, you know, to go and is also a good place to get in a fight. If you want to get in the fight.\n\nContinue walking to the next town.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Some of the most fertile soils in the world were reclaimed after the shallow waters of Tulelake receded. Ten years of redirecting water resulted in 11 homesteading periods. The town of Tulelake has a rich and colorful history from the early boomtown days following the first rounds of homesteading through the World War two years of a Japanese American internment camp and German Italian P.O.W. camp.\n\nIt has been molded by veteran homesteaders, farmers, ranchers and merchants who collectively provide for its economy. Instead of giving up when things get tough, the citizens persevere and overcome to preserve an agricultural, rural lifestyle in a land full of history, beauty and wildlife.\n\nI had the greatest life growing up, hunting, fishing, working hard in a family with my dad.\n\nThe schools pretty much followed the homesteaded. When a group of homesteaders that moved in, there's no time delay had kids of their own and there was no place for them to go to school. So they built a school or moved one in.\n\nAnd I had a job right after the interview because Mrs. Jacobini was leaving. So I was the teacher, the principal, the janitor, the art teacher, the music teacher, the PE teacher and every kind of teacher at our school. We had to make do. And when you do that, your kids become creative. And the milk cans were frozen over in the winter time and we had to chop the ice out of the milk cans to get the big dipper in, to get a drink of water. And you'd think the children would have gotten diseases, but they were healthy little rascals. They were never absent simply because they had to work too hard when they stayed home. So they'd rather come to school.\n\nWhen we got here in 1927, there was no little town of Tulelake. Yeah. Oh, I think the railroad probably was started, gone through and they had a plan for the Tulelake, but we had to go to town of Malin for groceries for the first few years. So they would actually put down a bunch of lumber to hold so their cars could drive through. They would all sink into the ground. So it's probably a lot of lumber up in the main street anyway.\n\nThe town of Tulelake was a rip-roaring frontier town of all things. There were seven saloons and Tulelake at that time. This was at the end of the dustbowl days. And migratory labor came in Tulelake in great numbers at harvest time, especially for the potato picking.\n\nUp on the hill. Deer went past us and that touch the heart of the hunter. The church was made up, first of all, homesteaders, but everybody was very, very friendly, the whole area.\n\nAnd we had lots of community spirit in those days. Everybody got out in helped. And they had dances every Saturday night in the old Legion Hall where we started our school.\n\nNow exit the first maze in turn left into volcanoes and natural wonders.\n\nWe invite you to take your time in this area to learn the processes that took place to create this landscape. Notice our spectacular geological formations, except for a few deposits of muddy sediment washed upon the basin floor, almost all the rocks in this region erupted as molten lava.\n\nThere are 17 volcanoes in the subduction zone known as the Cascade Range, extending from British Columbia to northern California.\n\nAmong them, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta are some of the world's best known.\n\nOur own Medicine Lake volcano is the largest in size in the cascade range. The result is a landscape where a great variety of volcanic features can be seen in a relatively small area.\n\nNow enter the next maze on your left.",

My name is Ivan Jackson. The language I just spoke if of the ancient Modoc. Professional from all over the world, came here in the mid eighteen hundreds to study my people.

The greatest concentration in North America.\n\nIn addition to its geologic features, the monument encompasses Petroglyph Point and the main battlefields of the Modoc War.\n\nLocated about 12 miles southwest of here. The monument offers long and short hiking trails through very important geological and historical areas. Interpretive exhibits, lava tube caves and develop trails await your exploration. Further information is available in the museum's gift shop. \n\nPlease continue to the immigrant trails display where you will find a map and pages from an immigrant's journal.\n\nIt began as an unconnected series of trails used by Native Americans and was expanded in the eighteen twenties and thirties by fur traders. American explorations and westward migration began in the 40s in 1843. The first large wagon train made the five month journey on what was then known as the Oregon Road.\n\nThe Applegate family was part of that first large wagon train. Two of their children drowned when a raft overturned on the Columbia River, making the Applegate brothers determined to find a safer route.\n\nThe Applegate trail that followed the northern shore of Tulelake was blazed in 1846. It passed by Merrill, then across the southern shore of lower Klamath Lake and on to the Willamette Valley.\n\nThat area was settled as a direct result of the the Appalachian Trail. Most days, 10, 12 miles is what they would make per day. And they basically they went waterhole to waterholes. For one thing, most people walk. Most people think that they they rode the wagons, that the wagons were not the kind of stogel wagons that are portrayed in the movies. These were much smaller wagons. And, you know, the box might be six or eight feet long at the most length, four feet wide. And oftentimes they would carry feed inside those wagons. It would be stacked when they came across grasses. They would cut the grasses and place them inside the wagons. And of course, they had their possessions in there. They used oxen, no horses.\n\nMove on to the display of the Modoc Indian War.

The stronghold, the Modoc's one half mile square natural fortress of deep crevices and jagged boulders of molten lava is in front of you to the left. The Peace Commission's meeting place tent is to the right.\n\nModoc in the Tulelake region in the eighteen forties, began objecting to an increasing stream of immigrants. Many pass through, but some stayed, and by the eighteen sixties had ranches or settlements in or near the basin. The Modoc felt crowded and threatened. The settlers feared the Modoc.\n\nFederal officials persuaded the Modoc to leave their land and live with their neighbors, the Klamath Indians.\n\nThough the tribes were similar and related, there was friction, so the Modoc returned to their traditional land on Lost River. Here Modoc leader Captain Jack wanted a reservation.\n\nInstead, settlers pressured the army to move the Modoc back with the Klamath Tribe. On November 29th, 1872, the cavalry from Fort Klamath entered the Modoc camp, ordering them to disarm and return to the reservation.\n\nWords, then shots were exchanged. One soldier was dead and seven wounded. The Modoc headed for the Lava Beds.\n\nAt the same time, another band of Modoc, led by sub chief hooker Jim, was attacked. One Modoc was killed, so in their retreat along the north and east shores of Tulelake, the Indians killed every man they met. A total of 14. The Modoc met at the stronghold and waited.\n\nThe army gathered strength, finally moving near and set up Gillems camp on January 16th, 1873. The next day, they attacked the stronghold, but because of the rough terrain and dense fog, the attack failed. The army suffered thirty seven casualties. Yet no soldier even saw an Indian.\n\nModoc lost no one.\n\nThe army reinforced while public opinion in the east forced the president to attempt reconciliation. A peace commission consisting of five men under General Canby was formed.\n\nCaptain Jack's cousin, Toby Riddle, was married to a white man. She acted as interpreter.\n\nLittle progress was made. The army was unable to promise Captain Jack a reservation.\n\nCaptain Jack refused to surrender the Indians who killed the settlers. During a council in his stronghold, Hooker Jim and his followers taunted Jack into swearing he would kill Canby. At the next peace meeting, despite warning by Toby Riddle, General Canby and Reverend Thomas were killed, Meacham was shot and half scalped but survived when Toby Riddle yelled that soldiers were coming.\n\nThree days later, the Army attacked again, supported by mortars and howitzers.\n\nAfter two days of fighting, the Modoc situation was serious. They were cut off from water and harassed by shelling at night. During darkness, the Modoc withdrew and were loose in the Lava Beds.\n\nPursuit brought more fighting and bloodshed.\n\nHungry and divided by conflict over leadership, Modoc men, women and children began surrendering in small groups. For nearly five months the Modoc with fewer than 60 fighting men held off in Army 20 times their strength.\n\nIt was the most expensive Indian war in the U.S.\n\nIt was the only major Indian war in California.\n\nIt was the only Indian war in which a general officer was killed.\n\nContinue on to view murals representing local landscapes.",

Clear Lake, Tulelake, Lower Klamath Lake and Mece Lake host the more than 400 species of wildlife.\n\nI realize that we live in one of the finest places on the planet, and one of the reasons for me is the abundance of wildlife that exist here, And also this beautiful symbiotic relationship between the farmers, ranchers and and the wildlife as being caretakers of the wildlife, if you will. But this is the heart of the Pacific Highway, and it's the greatest highway we have in the entire United States. And autumn here it is a sight to see with with millions of geese and ducks. Just to be in a swirl of geese, snow geese, cacklers, Canada geese and ducks and Springer odd animals. One of the finest sounds and sites that you can ever experience in a lifetime. Many times growing up and even recently, I've seen the sun literally darkened down here by geese, thousands upon thousands of them.\n\nNow, exit and turn left into the reclamation section.\n\nEstablished May 15th, nineteen oh five by the Reclamation Service, the Klamath project encompasses about two hundred and ten thousand acres of farmland and thirty thousand acres in the Tulelake and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuges.\n\nIncluded in the system are the Frank Adams Canal and then Brimmer Ditch, purchased by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1906.\n\nThis was the twelfth reclamation project in the United States, but the largest of its time. Purposes included reclaiming land, storing and diverting water for irrigation and controlling flooding.\n\nThe first water flowed to project lands on May 16th, 1907, while the Klamath Reclamation Project is very complex, its system is one of the most efficient in the world.\n\nThe project initially cost the government fourteen point seven million dollars. That cost has been repaid by the users through their annual operation and maintenance bill. The economic benefits of the project continue to far exceed its original expense.\n\nContinue on to the World War One display.",

The Selective Services Act passed that same year, increased our military from 200,000 to almost four million.\n\nMy dad was drafted into the Army and left on a ship to France. He was on the ship for 14 days. He was on guard duty. The full time is on. He never took his clothes off.\n\nAnd it was a trench warfare and the machine guns, everybody in the trench, and then somebody came along and developed a tank or could run over trenches on that jury. Warfare's evolve. commanding general Marine Corps with my dad's regimental commander. He's had a statement, that is Smedley Butler. And I always loved it. And it just they got us surrounded again.

He was glad to be home.\n\nContinue to the CCC camp.\n\nFormed in March 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, was one of the first of President Roosevelt's New Deal programs. It was a federal public works project to provide needed jobs.\n\nThe CCC operated under the Army's control, camp commanders had disciplinary powers and corpsman were required to address superiors as sir.\n\nBy September 1935, over 500,000 young men had lived in CCC camps. In all, nearly three million participated in the CCC. The discipline and experience gained soon proved helpful in World War Two.\n\nLocally, the CCC was very active, instructing most infrastructures that the Lava Beds National Monument and Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nNow see the P.O.W. camp displayed behind you.\n\nDuring World War Two, the CCC camp on Hill Road, west of Tulelake was used to house prisoners of war. In May 1944 the first P.O.W.s to arrive were Italian. In June, German prisoners replaced them.\n\nThe purpose of the camp was to provide workers to relieve the farm labor shortage.\n\nAs the first P.O.W.s proved successful in their work, more were ordered with the number peeking at one thousand in September 1945. Tents on a vacant lot in Tulelake were also used to house them.\n\nWe couldn't get help, and of course, they set the high school down and all the high school kids at work, and then we worked with German prisoners over there from the hill there to grab some Mexicans come in. There was another CCC camp down at Gillems camp on the edge, a little bit national monument and the tore this camp down and was one of their functions. And they were trucked back and forth to the camp there on the west side. And they took all the nails out of the board and bent them in a triangle so that if any vehicle tire ran over, it really popped up, and if you didn't get your front tire, you got your rear tire. This provided a tremendous problem over these German prisoners who would scatter these nails out of these truck.\n\nMy mother was the crew boss at the time, and so my grandmother would be cooking lunch and there was never a single thing left.\n\nThe last three hundred and eight prisoners departed the camp November 1945.\n\nDirectly in front of you is our tribute to local war veterans.\n\nTo our courageous men and women in uniform, past, present and future.

The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\n\nThey were serious. They had air raid wardens. Every block, they had blackouts, they had anti-aircraft guns. Everything had come under ration, you had to have stamps for meat, for sugar, coffee, gasoline, clothes. I think we could buy one pair of shoes per year.\n\nStep over to Paul Christie.\n\nYou have to go back to the time places, circumstances. These things happened. That after Pearl Harbor, people on the West Coast particularly were terrified Japanese was going to attack. People don't realize this, but our intelligence lost the Japanese fleet and they didn't know where they had gone, it was sometime around the Battle of Midway. And they thought the Japanese were headed for the West Coast. Gave us p38 lightnings and sent us down the Orange County Airport. Only five of us. We were defensive Southern California, and we will fly out from there. And every day we expected to see the state, the whole Japanese fleet out. We were six weeks out of flight school. We were flying airplanes we didn't know anything about. And to this day, I don't know if we had any ammunition.\n\nThey were just building the hangars there because it was a B-24s. For some of them, we put tail turrets and some we had sideturrets and come to this and that and put a lot of oxygen lines. And we did everything on the planes.\n\nOur base had nothing but B-17 flying fortresses. Most of them had 13 guns to those 50 caliber. I was over there twenty seven months. When I came home I got to see my son for the first time.\n\nMove on to Hank Christianson.\n\nThey shipped us out a few at a time on different ships, and I went on a converted freighter and by the way, over there, they were terrible storms. Ship, you know, real strongly to the right. And I have steel hill plates on my shoes, so I slept on the deck. Well, and it was I was going under the lights and I was on my back. I reached up and caught the lifeline on my hands that hung over the side of the ship. So I slowly worked my way down and waited to the lul of the storm and reached around the stanchion with one hand and got a hold the cable on the other side and reached up, got a hold of the station and slowly inch by inch pulled myself back up on the ship and I laid there. I had my arms around the cable on one side of that, my legs are all over on the other side. And I debated about whether trying to lay there all night until there was help in the morning. And then I thought, well, it was cold too, February, if a wave hit get me hypothermia, would I have to do something? So I decided to try to crawl on my hands and knees up to the hole. When we got back to the States, I took a roll call and they found that they were short eight people.\n\nHerman Bell speaks of Bird Fairclough.\n\nHe first went to Africa and he told me, walk most of the way around the shoreline of Africa, then to Sicily and from Sicily he want to Anzio. And he laid on that beach for 63 days without a bath or anything. And then he went further into Italy and was sent up on a hill to clean out some some nest gunness up there. And Finally was shot through the arm and he went down into one of those cellar like things. And I just they just shot in there with their machine guns and the bullets were going everywhere. But then he said they didn't hit him with had his helmet on and held up pretty bad. And they said the next morning somebody said, anybody in there better come out because we're going to blow it up. And he said it was an American's voice. And he said, boy, don't I'm in here. And so they came in and got him and took him down and had his arm treated. And they said they were going to shipping out. And I said, no way, you're going to ship me out. He said, I know every one of those places, I'm going back up. So he cleaned out several places up there. So that made it safer. And he went a lot of medals and he earned every one of them.\n\nPaul Christie speaks of Al Kongslie.\n\nNorth African campaign al Kongslie landed with the troops to the south of Casablanca when the ships landed there and you marched all the way across North Africa to Tunisia. And even he fought for ground support for Patton. His orders and now as one of the troops that ambushed the German Hakone. And I was came in as ground support for Al and went all the way through the African campaign, And Cicilia came around and was in the Landingham DayDay and all of the war always Hartmut. Hitler and Tojo had to be stopped\n\nDud Lemke.\n\nWe had a cause because we knew the person we were fighting what his intent was.\n\nContinue to the mural of fourteen hundred and fifty two buildings.",

You are atop the peninsula overlooking the Tulelake Relocation Center at Newell, located just eight miles south of here. \nStep over to the wooden cross.\n\nThis is a part of the original wooden cross placed on top of the peninsula or Castle Rock in 1942 by Japanese Americans who signed their names to the wooden plaque.\n\nIn 1943 the camp became a segregation's center. Its population peaked in September 1944 at eighteen thousand six hundred interned Japanese Americans.\n\nThe notice came back in two weeks that you have to leave. Then reality set in that we have to all leave. And that's all we had averaged two weeks time to actually dispose of our personal property, whatever it may be. And then fall into camp, but going to camp was OK. But then again, this is what you can take what you can carry. That it, no more. Tulelake the camp itself is kind of unique. When 1943 July, all the directors got together and decided that Tulelake would be a segregation center because there were more dissidents at Tulelake. And then the camp itself is one and a quarter mile square and had twenty eight guard towers around us. The farm had eleven guard towers around us. In total thirty two miles of fence actually in the fence from Tulelake to Klamath Falls, which is encompassed over 100 miles of barbed wire was strung around us. Eighteen thousand eight hundred inmates. But with twelve hundred full time soldiers on standby.\n\nWhat I would be doing if I was back home, you know, comparing it to camp. And it was really the first time that I had been exposed to so many Japanese people from all over and everywhere there were all blackheads and I'm going I don't know how I would tell my friends apart.\n\nWhat the produce we raised all the quality produce we pack four million pounds a year out of the warehouse, out the siding there, and talk to the other camp people that said they received some from Tulelake, but a lot of it was sent out on the road. So the destination unknown. And one day they were just dumping barrels of fish, to different messhalls, Every messhall got two barrels of fish. Then they went back and looked at the balance. This fish must be pretty old. They look at the barrel packed in 1934 by WP labor. The Army quartermaster would say what we're eating. They said, we're getting fresh fish. And that's how the Chronicle put it up there, and they said, we've been pampered. Ladies will go out there and spend all day long just digging for seashells in this nice seashells, and they'll make beads and birds and different ornaments out of it. Meantime, the men folks will sit out there, be smoking, playing cards, and they see all these seagulls coming there. They were catch these birds draw these stars and stripes and so forth. And so who could do the best designed birds. In the meantime, the birds would go back to the coastline and the game wardens says, where are these birds coming from, where all the insignias and painting on the bottom and birds and finally traced it back to Tulelake and the game warden put a stop there, painted the seagulls because they're protected birds.\n\nThe camp remained in operation longer than any other war relocation center closing March 20th, 1946.\n\nNext, locate the pickle jar display.",

The last groups of homesteaders were drawn in lotteries from 1946 to 1949.\n\nThe pickle jar became the choice for homestead lotteries after the fish bowl became too small. The 1946 drawing held at the armory in Klamath Falls included one thousand three hundred and five names typed on the slips of paper, put into capsules and placed into this three gallon pickle jar. Only 86 names were drawn.\n\nThis pickle jar was filled for the last time in 1949 in the American Legion Hall in Tulelake. Eighty six out of five thousand names were drawn.\n\nWith these drawings they had to have drawings for them because there were so many more applications than there was plots of land available. In the halls was always full. There is always there full of people who are sitting in a desk, people, a lot of them on the edge of the seat, hoping that their name would be the next one drawn out. But the ones that were there, why, they let out a good yell. The tension was there and everybody was just waiting to because they knew it was an opportunity there. They were getting an opportunity for new life in a new community. And it was really something to see.\n\nWhen we got down there where we had guys that came next to us were navy. 'Course we were all army men, two Navy.\n\nThe morning at the we went to move out on our site, when it snowd, and when I got out there close to it, I put the car in second gear and opened it wide open and headed out. And when I hit the yellow post-it, mark my land the phone to the right of it out on the land, And where it got stuck, that was home.\n\nWe spent some time in the tent. The wind blew and mercifully that spring and that poor old tent, what kind of rock and it wasn't real, real comfortable. The dirt came in, of course, and we had our grain stored, our seed grain stored in the tent so it wouldn't get wet.\n\nMove on to the Korean War display.\n\nMembers of our community served under the command of General MacArthur to help protect South Korea from conquest by North Korea, when war broke out in 1950.\n\nWhen I got to Korea, they put us in some high walled camps for a while. Then they were building the Quonset hut barracks after a fashion. We were being woken up at night, sometimes with the small aircraft flying over the runway, dropping hand grenades, which they call bed check Charlie. I never did figure out why they didn't go after that guy, but they just let him do it night after night, probably a couple of nights every week.\n\nBetween August 5th, 1964, and April 30th, 1975, three point four million military personnel served in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe minute that door opened and you started walking towards the tarmac, the heat was just beyond anything, I'd and I'm a Phenix, Arizona boy, and this was a heat like I've never experienced, the humidity was up 105 percent, was probably 108 degrees, and it was eight o'clock at night.\n\nI think there was one period of over three months that we weren't without any fresh meat or fresh vegetables. A typical breakfast was one spoonful of eggs. What are sort of green dehydrate would have been reconstituted out of powdered eggs at one spoonful of square dehydrated potatoes and possibly two little small Vienna sausages and one piece of bread without any butter or jam.\n\nRarely ever did you get to see the bad guy because his whole mission in life was to just Pick at you and run. They said we lost the war. We didn't lose the war. We fought it the best way we could. We were just as proud and dedicated to our own brothers as they were. We were just dealt a different kind of card.\n\nThe official end of America's direct involvement in Vietnam was April 30th, 1975.\n\nStep over to the farming and ranching display.\n\nJust as the United States is a melting pot of people from all parts of the world, so is this region. Sharing of education's travel experiences, agricultural knowledge and skills have created these diverse communities. \nWhere have you found Nettles growing? You knew it was the finest soil. And as you know, we have lots of wild metals in this country, and it was also an indicator of water.\n\nI had my first job when I was seven and Ray was nine. We delivered papers in the morning and milk in the afternoon and we got along fine. But I always wanted to ever do was be a cowboy.\n\nThe tractors gradually came in and replaced the horses in our area has a beautiful soil. Some of the best soil actually in the world.\n\nYou should now be standing in front of our current issues. This concludes the indoor segment of your audio tour.

Walk straight ahead to the tall guard tower.\n\nThe guard tower to see the pictures is straight up and down there. One of the 1943 after segregation, the one with the spread footing was the original old guard tower when the original camp was built. The guard towers, when you look at it, there's a flat door. As the guard goes up the towers, they get up the trapdoor. Then when they shut that, once they get up, shut the trap door and there's a hatch and lock it. So no one from the bottom comes from the same trap door. The soldiers protect themselves from people intruding from the bottom up. But still, the guard towers were outside of the fence. There's no way we can get through the guard tower anyway. That's how they were all built.\n\nNow walk to the large black tar paper building.\n\nPeer into the two windows, closest the museum building to see a Japanese American family. This is the living space they were given during their time at the Tulelake camp.\n\nThe barracks for Tule Lake and other campsall had staggerd 20 by 100 barracks. Tule Lake average barracks were five units apiece, 20 by 20 for five people. 20 by 16, it was four for four people.\n\nSo as far as that privacy and the girls didn't have any doors on the stalls there. And in fact, it was open for a while until they start putting separations between the bowls so that we had some privacy and then we would have our friends, hey, I got to go. You be my screen. You know, the dust and the sandstone is just terrible. You know, we'd open the window and then, of course, the flooring was too solid. So every time the sandstorm here comes in Rosharon and close the window and then but then the sand would come up between the wood on the floor and then all the sand would be on the blanket and table, what have you.\n\nNow move to the next window. Inside, you will see bachelor living quarters.\n\nSo the bachelors were living in the twenty by sixteen, four bachelors that moved in. They didn't know each other, so if they couldn't get along with each other, they had a hard time. I know they would ask me to sneak some material in there that will get a 16 foot by six foot rope will put a wall in between them. So the only eight foot by twenty two people was just a narrow slit like. Some people really was ingenious how they made the prove what they did. They would go to the canteen and buy rice and take the mess. They have the cook for them, but they could very well put it in the barracks or what they did. They cook the whole the floor and they put the little basement like a mini basement barracks and put two or three barrels down there and put the rice down there and start fermenting the rice and put the lid on it so nobody can see it. That can smell like the smell of the outside. But still there were there out of sight, out of mind type of deal. And eventually they'll make the saki.\n\nContinue to the third window. A homesteaders wife prepares a meal.\n\nAfter the camp closed in 1946, many barracks were cut in half and hauled to newly allotted homesteads. This barrack is that half sized.\n\nBarracks became homes for veterans trying to earn the right to own the land. The battle to keep dirt and cold out of the shack like buildings was a challenge for the homesteaders, just as it had been for the Japanese Americans who preceded them.\n\nContinue to the last window.\n\nLittle by little, improvements were made to the buildings to make them more comfortable. Today, as you travel through the basin, you may notice remodeled barracks in use as homes.\n\nThis barracks had moved in. It was vertex inside and underneath the floor and had boards just for the one  by twelve, for the boards on the floor. I covered it with tarpaper and put the tongue and groove and down and had a better floor.\n\nI think it was a lot harder on wives than it was on the man in general. And we'd get out, you know, work. wives are in the barrackswith little kids. When we got our barracks, they were given to us. And they were 100 hundred feet long, and we had to saw by my hand. They cut the electricity off the cap and then jack them up. Our house movers to move on our homesteads.\n\nI find that I did a lot of things like my mother did when we were young kids because we had no electricity when I was real young.\nThis concludes the tour of our Museum of Local History.\n\nWe invite you to continue viewing the outdoor displays within this fenced area.\n\nThank you for your interest in our history. Your generous donations and support will help us continue to share the rich history of our basin. Please come again.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Today, when you walk from North Bridge Visitor Center to the North Bridge battle site you are actually walking on a colonial road that is over three centuries old! This is the same route taken by the colonial soldiers during the battle at North Bridge on April 19, 1775.\n\nThe area today occupied by the North Bridge unit of Minute Man National Historical Park was once an Indigenous settlement known as Musketaquid. In 1635 the land was purchased by the English from the indigenous inhabitants and incorporated into the town of Concord. The area beyond the river became known as the North Quarter.\n\nIn 1654 the town laid out a road from the main village out to the North Quarter and constructed a bridge across Concord River. The route of this road follows much of modern-day Monument Street until you get to the entrance to the North Bridge site. At this point Monument Street continues straight north while the old road (now closed to vehicles) turns west to the North Bridge.\n\nAt this same time the town constructed a gravel and stone causeway which led west from the bridge for 400 feet along the riverbank. The purpose of the causeway was to improve passage across the wet land beside the river.\nIn 1699 the farm road beyond the causeway was extended and improved. The new road followed the causeway west from the bridge then turned north and east “up ye hill” (towards the current-day North Bridge Visitor Center) then turned west. This westerly turn is located at the top of the hill as you approach North Bridge Visitor Center.\n\nThere was also a west branch that split off at the western end of the causeway just before the east branch made the turn “up ye hill.\" The west branch followed the river past the Brown family house lot. Both the east and west branch rejoined further west and continued passed the Barrett Farm to Groton.\n\nIn 1750 the town to build a new causeway and also paid for the construction of a low stone wall along the northern edge to separate it off from Buttrick’s property.\nIn 1760 the North Bridge was rebuilt. This was the bridge in use at the time of the battle on April 19, 1775.\n\nOn April 19, 1775, the British arrived in Concord around 7:30 a.m. Approximately 225 British soldiers crossed the North Bridge. They left 96 men behind to guard the bridge and the road. The rest continued along the west branch of the Groton Road to Colonel Barrett’s farm to search for arms and supplies. The colonial soldiers, whose numbers grew to over 400 men watched and waited on high ground northwest of the bridge at a place now known as the Muster Field.\n\nSometime around 9:30 a.m. the colonial soldiers noticed smoke rising from Concord center. Colonel Barrett issued the order to march but not to fire first. The colonial soldiers marched down the east branch of the Groton Road, then onto the causeway leading to the North Bridge. As they approached, the British soldiers retreated across the bridge and prepared for action.\n\nIn the ensuing fight the minute men and militia were constrained by the narrowness of the old causeway. Their column was hemmed in by the river on their right and a stone wall on their left, beyond which was a wet meadow. A veteran of Captain David Brown’s Company, Amos Barrett, wrote that “we then was all ordered to fire and not kill our own men.” Thus constrained they could not form a proper line of battle. They remained in column, elevated their muskets and fired over each other’s heads and shoulders. \n\nIn 1793 the town of Concord moved the river crossing to its present location, further north on current-day Monument Street. At this same time a new road was constructed which is today Liberty Street. The old Groton Road, river crossing and causeway, which played such a key role in the battle on April 19, 1775 were abandoned and reverted to pasture and meadow.\n\nIn 1836 a granite obelisk was erected at the battle site on the east bank where the British soldiers stood. In 1874 a bridge was built on the site of the old North Bridge. A year later the Minute Man statue by Daniel Chester French was dedicated on the 100th anniversary of the battle. However, the land west of the North Bridge beyond the Minute Man statue remained privately owned and access blocked by an iron fence.\n\nIn 1959 the old Concord battleground became part of Minute Man National Historical Park. Eventually, the land west of the North Bridge, which had been closed off, was reopened. Historical research and archaeology were done to determine the route of the long-vanished roads. Parts of the causeway and the route of the eastern branch of the Groton Road were excavated. The route of the western branch was also studied. The eastern branch was then reopened as a walking trail from North Bridge Visitor Center to the North Bridge. Reopening the Groton Road allows you to more fully explore the North Bridge battle site and better understand its context within the historic landscape. As you do so you are walking in the footsteps of history!",

You are about to enter one of the most intact Creole Plantations in existence. Creole can mean different things to different people. Here in the Cane River area, Creoles are descended from Louisiana’s colonial settlers. This can be any combination of colonial French, Spanish, African, or Native American descent. The term Creole can also be used to label the contributions of the Creole Culture, including their language, food, and architecture.\n\nOakland Plantation was a thriving agricultural community for nearly 200 years. The workforce was originally comprised of enslaved laborers. Following emancipation, sharecroppers and tenant farmers worked the fields. Along with the people who worked the fields, you also had doctors, blacksmiths, carpenters, laundresses, and store clerks. All these people played key roles in ensuring the success of the plantation. Founded by Jean Pierre Emanuel Prud’homme around 1785, Oakland would remain in the family for the next two centuries. During that time span the family would endure the Civil War, outbreaks of the boll weevil, and the great depression. \n\nAs you tour the plantation today, you will gain an understanding of life on a cotton plantation and come away with a new appreciation for the contributions of the diverse group of people who lived and worked on this land.",

These buildings were home to generations of workers at Oakland Plantation--first enslaved families and later tenant farming families. Many of those later families and individuals were formerly enslaved or descendants of enslaved people, who continued to toil in the fields where their ancestors had labored.\n\nSharecropper and tenant farmer families lived in these quarters as late as the 1960s. The interior is historically furnished to the tenant farming era. Tenant farmers and sharecroppers did not own their own farms, and to work the land they had to turn over a share of the crop to the landowner. These people would shop for goods at the plantation store on a credit system. When the crop came in, they had to settle their debt with the landowner and the plantation store, and whatever was left over was their net profit. If it was a bad growing season, or if the boll weevil invaded the crop, the sharecroppers might be in debt at the end of the year. It was extremely difficult to get ahead under this labor system, so many farm workers from the south began migrating to large northern cities to find better jobs.",

The first overseer to occupy this home was Seneca Pace. Pace kept a journal of his activities at Oakland. His journal provides readers with a record of the planting cycle and numerous other labor activities. One of Pace’s most frequent topics was the weather, which of course was one factor that could make or break a growing season.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century this building was the home of the Metoyer family.

Corn was an essential part of the diet of the enslaved worker and used as feed for livestock. Today on Cane River, corn has surpassed cotton as the main agricultural product.\n\nBeside the corn crib, sits a brick cistern. The groundwater in this region was un-suitable for drinking, so the people built cisterns to collect rainwater. Cisterns can be made from brick and buried underground, or they can be constructed from wood and placed above ground or in attics. The brick cistern adjacent to the corn crib was sixteen feet deep and held almost 5,000 gallons of water.",

It was the marketplace, banking and credit source, recreational center, public forum, and news exchange.” Oakland’s store also served as a post office on and off during its existence, further enhancing its importance in the community.\n\nThe plantation store could also prove to be a financial burden to the sharecroppers. Quite often sharecroppers could not get out from under the mountain of debt that they accumulated at the stores. Historian Carol Breedlove noted, “Perhaps the Prud’hommes could have done more, or been more generous [with the sharecroppers]. On the other hand, they could certainly, in their environment and historical period, have done less, been less supportive and more selfish.” As the numbers of sharecroppers dwindled, so did the importance of the plantation stores. The Prud’hommes closed their store for good in 1982.\n\nThe Oakland Plantation Store is the park's main visitor contact station. Inside the store you will find historic exhibits, NPS passport stamps, Junior Ranger books, and a gift shop.",

Parterre gardens, with their low plantings and geometric patterns, were designed to be seen from the gallery of the raised house and were common to French landscape design. After a blight killed the boxwood hedges, the Prud’homme family used bottles from the wine cellar below the house to line the planting beds. The family maintained this tradition until the NPS acquired the property, replacing broken bottles with new ones or older ones from the wine cellar.\n\nToday, the roughly rectangular Bottle Garden contains beds in geometric shapes: rectangles, diamonds, hearts, waves, circles, clovers, and stars, laid out with sense of symmetry. The bottle edging includes wine bottles from Taylor Wine Company, ale and stout beer bottles, salt-glazed stoneware bottles, Anheuser-Busch beer bottles, mineral water bottles, soda water bottles, and bitters bottles. The oldest bottles date to around 1790, while the newest bottle dates to the late 1990s. The Bottle Garden is one of the more unique features at Oakland.",

                    "audioTranscript": "As Europeans began settling along the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley, they incorporated old world architectural styles to suit their new climate. Built by enslaved workers, the Main House at Oakland retains the pitched or sloping roof that is characteristic in French structures from Normandy to Quebec, but it also shows characteristics brought to North America from the West Indian Creoles including the elevated first floor, spacious porch, and multiple double doors. All these innovations helped cool the house during the humid summer months. One regional component of the main house and other structures along Cane River is bousillage. Bousillage is mud from the river mixed with Spanish moss or straw creating a brick like substance which is prevalent in the interior walls of the house.\n\nThe 1821 house consisted of only four rooms on the main level and has seen several additions through the years. Below the house, the ground floor has a room for an enslaved nanny, who accessed the bedrooms on the upper floor through a staircase and trapdoor in floor. Also below the house are a wine cellar, several storage rooms, and \"museum\" that was used by the Prud'homme family in the mid-20th century to display various objects to visitors.\n\nOakland’s Main House stands as an excellent example of French Creole architecture that utilizes old world and new world concepts mixed with regional techniques. The Main House is open to the public on weekends from 10 AM to 2 PM.",

During the difficult times of the Great Depression, the Prud’hommes moved this building to its current location and turned it into a cabin for recreational fishermen. To meet the needs of the fishermen the Prud’hommes also had boats for rent and bait for sale. Plantation workers made extra cash cleaning and cooking fish. During the Great Depression, the price of cotton dipped below the cost of production, making the income generated by the fishing camp especially important.\n\nThis building today, stands as an example of the ability to successfully adapt to and eventually overcome a difficult economic situation.

The setting pen was used to house nesting chickens; the fattening pen was for chickens they planned to eat. The wash house was where laundry was done.\n\nChickens were a common site on plantations. In historian, John Michael Vlach’s book Back of the Big House he cited the following advantages to raising chickens: “they provided both meat and eggs; they could be maintained on very small amounts of feed; and they could be killed on short notice, thus reducing the risk of spoilage.”\n\nLaundry was originally done by enslaved workers, and then by paid domestics. Louisiana lore contends that on laundry day, people would eat red beans and rice, since that meal required little attention giving folks time to concentrate on doing the laundry.",

A short walk down Lighthouse Road takes you to the boardwalk of the Ocracoke Lighthouse. It is a pleasant 9/10-mile walk from the Ocracoke Island Visitor Center, and a great way to experience the village.\n\nWalk along the boardwalk to the base of the Ocracoke Lighthouse and take in your surroundings. Have you noticed where the lighthouse keepers lived? If you have visited Bodie Island or Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, what differences can you see from those lighthouses and this one? Why do you think this is the case? Explore the Ocracoke Lighthouse site within this app to learn how this lighthouse is different.\n\nAs you move toward the base of the lighthouse, you might notice a couple of small buildings located near the lighthouse. What do you think they might have been used for? The answers can be found within this app.\n\nAfter visiting the lighthouse grounds, you can wander back to the Ocracoke Island Visitor Center by following a variety of different routes. You may continue on down Lighthouse Road, which turns into Loop Road (and loops back around to the Lighthouse Road.) This will allow you to visit The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust’s Springer’s Point Preserve where a nature trail loops around to Ocracoke Inlet. Heading back down Lighthouse Road toward North Carolina-12, gives you a chance to stroll down Howard Street, the oldest street in the village. Be sure to use care crossing North Carolina-12. The end of Howard Street merges back with North Carolina-12, which you can follow back to the Ocracoke Island Visitor Center. Along the way you might be interested in detours to visit the Working Waterman’s Exhibit, the British cemetery, or the Ocracoke Preservation Society Museum.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this tour and discovered something new along the way.",

The route follows the steep edge of Blue Mesa and offers views of badlands to the east and the broad grassy valleys to the north and south. The badlands’ blues, purples, grays, and whites seem to shift throughout the day and with the seasons. The summer monsoon adds a touch of green vegetation and wildflowers.",

Before heading out, here are a few safety notes: Be sure to take water. Bring along any other weather-related items: sunscreen, raincoats, gloves, etc. It can be windy, so cinch your hats and secure your items. Stop by the restroom before heading out. The only restroom available in the basin is a vault toilet near Morning Glory Pool. Stay on the boardwalks and established trails at all times. Superheated water flows just below a thin crust throughout the basin. Besides the high chance of breaking through the crust and causing bodily injury or death, leaving the trail can damage hydrothermal features—ruining the experience for everyone. Boardwalks can be slippery when wet or covered in snow. Watch for wildlife and maintain the minimum safe distance of 25 yards (23 meters or 2 bus-lengths) from any wildlife—and 100 yards (91 meters or 8 bus-lengths) from bears or wolves.\n\nReady?

It flows nearly 21 miles, passing by Lone Star Geyser and through the Upper, Midway, and Lower geyser basins on its way to the confluence with the Gibbon River, where the rivers combine to form the Madison River near Madison Junction. Because so many hydrothermal features drain into the Firehole River, its water is warmer and has a higher concentration of dissolved minerals than other rivers.

Pay particular attention to the sound these geysers make. Sound familiar? \n\nNow that you’ve seen a couple of geysers, what do you think are the ingredients needed to make a geyser?

The temperature drop altered the thermophilic community and color of the pool. Thousands of objects have been removed from the pool, yet the damage remains.

Even during the intervals between eruptions, Castle Geyser shows off the underlying heat, with steam rising from vents and the sound of water churning in its depths. \n\nAlso on display here is the separation of water systems in adjacent features. At the base of Castle Geyser’s cone is Tortoise Shell Spring. There appears to be no connection between the two features, as Castle Geyser’s eruptions have no noticeable effect on this spring. \n\nCastle Geyser is prominently on display in one of Thomas Moran’s sketches from the 1871 Hayden expedition.

The design of the hotel was also influential in the rustic design of other structures across the National Park Service. \n\nHotels were important to the early development of Yellowstone, as most visitors had to travel a great distance, often a journey of several days, to reach the park. \n\nMaking the natural and cultural wonders accessible to visitors has always been a priority of the National Park Service. Visitors are an integral part of national parks. The act that created the National Park Service states that the purpose of the agency is: \n\n… to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. \n\nWe hope you enjoyed experiencing the most hydrothermally active place on Earth and found many reasons to preserve and protect the resources of this park and this planet—from the geysers of Yellowstone to the wildlife near your home.",

Join me in exploring this place--and the people--who changed the social fabric of this nation. \n\nIn front of you is Old Slater Mill. Originally constructed in 1793, this was the first successful water-powered cotton spinning mill in North America. On this site, children worked machines that ran on waterpower to make thread. This location was ideal for running such a mill, though it took human engineering and plenty of hard work to turn this into a place for industry.  \n\nLet’s start by talking about some of those workers who ushered in the American age of industry. Moses Brown, a Providence merchant invested the capital to finance this venture. David Wilkinson and Sylvanus Brown, two local skilled craftsmen, provided the machine-making-know-how. Samuel Slater, an English immigrant, provided the knowledge of how English textile machines worked. John Bucklins, a free African-American man living in this area was among the carpenters who constructed this building. It was a small mill by modern standards – 43 feet long, 29 feet wide and 2 ½ stories tall. Nonetheless, the mill probably seemed quite large to children like 10-year-old Anne Arnold, who came here to work.  \n\nYou see the mill today much as it was in 1832, the first year the trademark belltower was added to the structure. This place tells the stories of people –like Ann, and John, and others -- at work in a changing world. After more than four decades of work in factories, Samuel Slater declared, “I gave out the psalm and they have been singing to the tune ever since.” As we explore this site, let us consider how that tune has changed, and how work has changed our lives, in this continually evolving world.",

What do you see? Inside, there is a spinning wheel, a handloom, and18th-century furniture.  \n\nThis house once belonged to Sylvanus Brown, a local mechanic who lived in the small village of Pawtucket. Originally built around 1758, the home was moved from its original location to this complex in the 1960s.  \n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, many objects were made by hand or with simple tools. In the colonial period, before the American Revolution, people like Sylvanus Brown grew a lot of their own food in gardens such as the one you see adjacent to the home. Brown was also part of a village, and many of his neighbors were craftspeople, skilled at their own trades. People in this area were part of a worldwide trade network, including the Atlantic Slave Trade and the China Trade. However, manufacturing on a large scale tended to happen out of sight, and far away from home. \n\nThe rise of factories such as Slater’s was a disruption in this way of life. These cottage-based processes would not change overnight, but as industrialization gained more traction throughout the nineteenth century, more objects began to be massed produced in factories and people’s lives began to change dramatically. At Slater’s mill, people experienced a new type of work. They were not paid for what they produced or even their skill but for their time.  \n\nFrom his home, Sylvanus Brown was witness to these changes, and his own skills were put to use in making some of these life-changing machines.",

This wheel powered a machine shop on the first floor, and cotton-spinning and weaving on the second and third floors.  \n\nIn the machine shop, David Wilkinson and his employees built and repaired machines. A great example of one of the machines Wilkinson invented was the screw-cutting lathe. Prior to this invention in 1798, all screws were hand-cut. With this invention, screws could now be massed produced with speed and precision. This allowed for screws to be used interchangeably. A huge step in making machine building and repair much faster and easier.  \n\nThe Wilkinsons and this mill are great examples of the ingenuity and enterprise that launched the American Industrial Revolution. \n\nBut how were these mills powered?

                    "audioTranscript": "This is not a natural waterfall, but a human-made dam. Constructed in 1792, this dam has undergone several restorations over its life, but it remains, much like the buildings we have seen, an important element of the historical and cultural landscape of this site. \n\nThis dam compounded a series of natural drops in the river to one single drop. This backed up a reservoir of water, known as a mill pond. Ideally, the mill pond was deep enough and contained enough water to still power the mills in times of drought and freezing. Water diverted from the mill pond went through a human-dug channel, called a raceway, just before it fell on the waterwheel. The weight of water pushed down on the wheel spinning it to motion. Then, this spinning motion was transferred to the multiple floors of these mills through a series of gears and driveshafts. On each floor, a series of wheels and belts would connect the machines to the drive shaft. This applied the spinning motion of the waterwheel to individual machines, allowing them to do work. Finally, water would continue to move through a second human-dug channel called the tailrace, which diverted the water back into the river. \n\nTake a moment to use some of your senses. What are you seeing or hearing?  \n\nConsider the workers who were in these buildings 200 years ago. They spent long hours listening to the roar of the river and the clatter of machines and belts. Have you ever worked or lived around loud, heavy machinery? Does water power anything in your life?   \n\nAs you make your way to the final stop, consider some of the changes that have occurred to the landscape around this dam.",

The second largest waterfall on the Blackstone River, this site has seen dramatic changes over the years. Thousands of years ago, it was covered by the massive glacier that created the Blackstone Valley during the last Ice Age. Once the ice melted, this site provided the only crossing point of Narragansett Bay that could be done on foot. As a result, it was used as a major trade route for the Narragansett and Wampanoag peoples for centuries.  \n\nEnglish colonizers made this area a center of early industry. Among the first English inhabitants was the Jencks family who set up their iron forging operation here. Just over a century later, Moses Brown chose this site for his experiment, for replicating an English textile mill.  \n\nAs industrialization took hold, the crossing point that became a small village evolved into a booming mill city. Both sides of the river were cluttered with mill buildings, storage houses, shops, dye houses, and other industrial buildings. Eventually entire families moved to industrial communities called Mill Villages. In many industrial communities, workers often earned steady wages, and enjoyed a sense of community, but they lived under the constant control and manipulation of their employers. \n\nThen by the twentieth century, the landscape started to change again. Old Slater Mill was purchased by the Old Slater Mill Association in 1921. Thus, began the process of turning the building into a museum. Over the next several decades, almost all the buildings which once stood here were demolished. Gone was the industrial landscape that Old Slater Mill had existed within for 150 years.  \n\nToday, this landscape is owned by the American people through the care and stewardship of the National Park Service. We invite you to continue to explore this historical landscape and contemplate how the fabric of this nation was woven, frayed, and mended.",

Grant that it seemed Confederate General Braxton Bragg would soon withdraw his forces from the surrounding heights of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. Grant and his subordinates had reason to believe the deserters as the US high command received reports of large numbers of Confederates leaving the siege lines that encircled the city. However, these forces, under command of General James Longstreet, were being dispatched to retake the Union-held city of Knoxville, Tennessee. Grant decided to undertake a “reconnaissance in force” to test Bragg and the strength of his army by attacking Confederate-held Orchard Knob from Fort Wood, the location of which is marked on this wayside. \n\nOn November 23, early in the afternoon, Confederates were aroused by the cacophony of bugles, the thundering beats of drums, and the general commotion which resulted from men being formed into line of battle. They watched as thousands of US soldiers poured from Fort Wood. A soldier in the 93rd Ohio recalled that the Union lines stretched “from the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, across the valley, to the woods that skirt Missionary Ridge.'' Another observer, watching from Fort Wood, noted, “Flags were flying, the quick earnest steps of thousands beat time. The sharp commands of hundreds of company officers, the sound of the drums, the ringing notes of the bugle, companies wheeling and countermarching, and regiments getting into line, the bright sun lighting up ten thousand polished bayonets till they glistened and flashed like...a shower of electric spirits – all looked like preparations for a peaceful pageant, rather than for the bloody work of death.” As the long blue lines lurched forward, the gray-clad men readied themselves to hold their ground.  \n \nNewton Davis, colonel of the 24th Alabama, realized the few hundred yards that separated his command and Lieutenant Colonel William Butler’s 28th Alabama was virtually impossible to hold against the overwhelming numbers which made up the blue wave surging toward them. Consequently, Davis joined his men as they raced back the 1,200 yards to the fortified Confederate line at Missionary Ridge’s base. On the other hand, Butler received word to hold his position, at all hazards, and that support was on its way. He had no idea that the 24th Alabama had vanished from his right flank atop Orchard Knob. General Hazen stated the Confederate positions were “carried at the point of the bayonet.” The Alabamians tried to hold on, but it was useless, and 146 of Butler’s men surrendered, while the regiment’s survivors dashed toward Missionary Ridge, following in the footsteps of their 24th Alabama comrades. Within an hour of the first forward movement by US soldiers, the assault was over. The two Alabama regiments suffered 186 casualties out of the original 634 who were present-for-duty that morning. Additionally, the 28th Alabama suffered the stinging loss of its colors, which had been presented to them by the ladies of Selma.   \n\nThat evening Union troops fashioned breastworks and fortifications atop and around Orchard Knob – now facing Missionary Ridge. Milton Barnes, Lieutenant Colonel of the 97th Ohio stated that his unit advanced 250 yards in front of Orchard Knob and picketed that evening. US General Gordon Granger wrote that Orchard knob was “a strong and important position” that “afforded points of observation upon movements that the enemy might make through the valley toward the scene of Major General Sherman’s operations.”  \n\nWith the loss of Orchard Knob, the Confederates lost an important point from which to observe the US troops in and around Chattanooga.",

                    "audioTranscript": "After Orchard Knob fell to US forces, General Grant and other commanders, such as General George Thomas, used Orchard Knob as an observation post to monitor attacks on November 24 and 25.  On November 24, Grant’s plan called for General William T. Sherman to attack the Confederate right flank on the north end of Missionary Ridge, while General Joseph Hooker conducted a demonstration, or distraction, against Lookout Mountain. This plan failed due to Sherman advancing on Billy Goat Hill, a separated hill north of Missionary Ridge. However, Generals Hooker and John Geary were successful in capturing Lookout Mountain during what would later be coined, “The Battle Above the Clouds.” The next day, November 25, Grant watched as the troops stationed near Orchard knob formed battle lines for the coming assault. The plan of attack was for Sherman to move against the Confederate right flank on Missionary Ridge and for Hooker to leave Lookout Mountain, march through Chattanooga Valley, and attack the Confederate left flank on the southern end of Missionary Ridge, near Rossville, Georgia. Thomas’ US troops were ordered to be a distraction by attacking Missionary Ridge’s center, hoping to draw Confederate focus away from their flanks. The men were to advance only to the first of three successive lines of Confederate rifle pits and halt. While the men of US General Philip Sheridan's and US General Thomas J. Wood’s divisions moved into line, General Granger focused on getting Bridges’ Battery ready atop Orchard Knob. This is the battery position at which you currently stand. The battery was unlimbered at midnight on November 23, and they were tasked to be the signal and support for the men assailing the base of the Missionary Ridge. While Sherman had trouble breaking through Confederate General Patrick Cleburne's lines on Tunnel Hill, at the north end of the ridge, Bridges’ guns fired six shots in rapid succession, signaling the start of the charge. At 4 pm, 35,000 US soldiers stretching along the valley, advanced toward the base of Missionary Ridge. They overpowered the Southerners in the first line of rifle pits at the ridge’s base. However, the veterans did not stop there, and they continued up the steep slopes, yelling “Chickamauga, Chickamauga!” At first, Grant was furious and asked Thomas and Granger if they ordered the continued assault. Both men denied any involvement, but Granger said, “When those fellows get started, all hell can't stop them.” The once defeated, demoralized, and besieged US soldiers proved that Chickamauga was not their undoing, but that they were still a force to be reckoned with in a fight. These men, overpowering the Confederates, took the remaining rifle pits as the dispirited Confederates fled Missionary Ridge. Once the smoke of battle cleared, the blue-clad soldiers solidly held Missionary Ridge and the “Gateway to the Confederacy” - Chattanooga. As one Confederate put it so succinctly after the war, “This was the death knell of the Confederacy.”  \n\nWe encourage you to spend some time atop Orchard Knob, contemplating what you have heard about the importance of this place to the overall success of the US forces during the Battles for Chattanooga. When you leave, please take the paved path back down to the gate and exit from there. You may notice, there are monuments dotting the perimeter of Orchard Knob as well. We invite you to walk to your right, around the corner, and back onto Ivey Street. Look at these amazingly carved monuments on this side and the western side of Orchard Knob. Veterans erected these regimental monuments specifically to organizations engaged in the Chattanooga Campaign, yet operated in areas where the national military park was unable to preserve land. One beautifully crafted example is the 1st Michigan Engineers’ monument, which is located near the corner of Ivey and Hawthorne Streets.",

These men were primarily tasked with building and repairing bridges and railroads. At Chattanooga, a portion of the regiment helped open the much-needed supply line, later dubbed “The Cracker Line” by preparing the needed materials and constructing the pontoon bridges across the Tennessee River at Brown’s Ferry, which was completed in an astounding 8 hours, and at South Chickamauga Creek, near the north end of Missionary Ridge. The amazingly intricate bronze relief on the monument’s face depicts the laying of a pontoon bridge across the river. At the same time, other members of the regiment were engaged in working along the railroad from Chattanooga to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.",

Mitchell Pass, located just beyond the replica wagons, represented the completion of 1/3 of their four to six month journey.  Today it takes 33 hours at 60 miles per hour to travel the 2,000 mile trail the emigrants walked.  Mitchell Pass often experienced bottleneck traffic as wagons funneled through the narrow passage.  Much like our replica wagons are lined up, wagons along the trail would have to wait their turn to continue west.  You may want to pick up the Wagons of the Overland Trails brochure located in the brochure rack for additional information.\n\nIf you’re here between Memorial Day and Labor Day you will see a Mormon handcart.  The Mormon handcart was used by recently converted Mormons just arriving to the United States who had little to no funds to purchase a wagon.  Most Mormons traveled from places like Council Bluffs but some traveled from St. Joseph or Kansas City.  Mormons generally used the Mormon Trail when heading to Utah, which was located north of the North Platte River.  If they happen to start their journey west on the south side of the river they tended to stay on that side following the Oregon Trail.  The Mormon handcart movement took place between 1856 and 1860.  These handcarts were significantly smaller than a wagon therefore the Mormon Church set restrictions on what converts were allowed to pack.\n\nA little further ahead, you will have a better view of the Studebaker and Murphy wagons.",

Many of these people were families hoping to make a better life in the West.  The wagons you see before you carried their livelihoods and their hopes and dreams across the country.  \n\nThe Studebaker wagon is blue while the Murphy has is stained a natural color.  Many emigrant families painted their wagons along with the canvas.  The Murphy is slightly larger of the two.  The Studebaker was mass produced by the Studebaker family who would eventually become leaders in the automotive industry.  \n\nGenerally speaking emigrant wagons were roughly 11 feet long by 4 feet wide and 10 feet tall.  They weighed about 1,300 pounds empty and 1,800 to 2,000 pounds loaded.  Oxen were the livestock of choice used to pull the wagons.  They were usually less expensive then mules and endured the long arduous journey better.  Contrary to Hollywood myth horses were seldom used to pull wagons.  Usually a wagon the size of the Murphy required four to six oxen. \n \nThe last wagon you seen is the Conestoga wagon, the semi tractor trailer of the trails.  This wagon is considerably larger than either of the family wagons.  It measures 17 feet long by 8 feet wide and 20 feet tall!  Depending on the load as few as ten oxen could be used but sometimes as many as 24 were needed.  Conestoga wagons supplied the western outposts with goods and supplies of all kinds. People traveling and living west of the Missouri River relied on freighters to haul a little of home and civilization to the frontier.  \nWhen looking at these wagons you might think to yourself, “Traveling 2,000 miles wouldn’t be so bad if I was riding in that.”  The sick, injured and infants rode in the wagon, everyone else walked.  There simply wasn’t room and this helped ease the burden on the livestock.  \n\nProceed to the next stop to learn about a major landmark on the trail and where you can walk in an authentic section of the Oregon Trail.",

In the early years there were few guide books or accurate maps available.  Emigrants used landmarks such as the rock formations Eagle and Sentinel Rocks you see towering above you.   These rocks frame Mitchell Pass and guided emigrants westward.  \n\nHere at the start of Mitchell Pass families lined up to take their turn through the bottleneck pass.  To the south is Sentinel Rock and to the North is Eagle Rock.   Prior to 1851, Robidoux Pass, located about eight miles to the South was favored.  Emigrants likely knew of Mitchell Pass, but found it rough and unimproved until approximately 1851.  It’s thought that soldiers from nearby Fort Laramie made improvements to Mitchell Pass the short their supply route.      \n\nAs you continue hiking you will notice the sidewalk has ended and the trail is now dirt.  The dirt section represents an original segment of the historic trails.  Besides the Oregon Trail, three other trails converged along what many historians refer to as the Great Platte River Road.  These are the California, Mormon, and the Pony Express trails.  Depending on the weather you may experience this segment much like an emigrant traveler did, under oppressive heat from the sun, against winds you must lean into to keep upright, or in ankle deep mud that threatens to engulf your shoes.  \n\nIn this segment many people expect to find two track wagon ruts.  You won’t see ruts at Scotts Bluff National Monument, but rather a swale, which is a large bowl shaped indention in the ground.  Here the trails were carved through sand and silt stone which erodes easily against wind and rain.  This bowl shape is wide at the beginning of this segment and narrows as you continue through the pass.  \n\nContinue along the trail to your next stop, the distance between these two stops is a little longer than what you have experienced along the trail so far.  When the trail surface becomes paved again you are just about to your next stop where you will be paralleling the historic trails.",

Can you imagine how difficult navigating a wagon through the pass would be in such conditions?\n\nTake a rest here and enjoy the view of Mitchell Pass behind you.  \nEmigrant travelers would now begin making their way back towards the banks of the North Platte River.  You might be asking yourself, “Why didn’t they just stay along the river to begin with?”  They were avoiding the geologic badlands formation found along the south side of the river which made travel along the banks impassable.  \n\nAs you continue along this trail look to your left, next to the paved trail in the grass you will see a shallow ditch.  Here the wagon trail curves to the left.  In the shallow ditch and you may be able to make out the remnants of two wagon wheel ruts.  If you are interested in viewing some of the deepest and best preserved ruts you may want to visit the Oregon Trail Ruts State Historic Site and National Historic Landmark located near Guernsey, Wyoming.  Though Scotts Bluff once had remarkable ruts they have all but eroded as the surrounding geology is primarily sand and silt stone, this is why we see the swale, the bowl shape indention you walked through at stop ten more often.\n\nContinue along the trail to stop twelve where we will discuss a treasured trail character.",

                    "audioTranscript": "At this location the famed 19th Century artist and photographer William Henry Jackson camped here in 1866 along with the freighting company he worked.  Earlier that year Jackson found himself in Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory – a jumping off point for freighting caravans headed west. Despite lacking any experience handling oxen or hauling freight, Jackson signed on as bullwhacker for an outfit bound for Montana. \n\nAlong the trail he sketched the sites he saw and the people he met.  Jackson was a gifted artist and found that his journey west was filled with new inspiration.   Jackson left the freight caravan near South Pass in present day Wyoming and headed south for Salt Lake City and eventually California.  His experiences in the West struck a chord in him, and he realized that documenting the settling of the frontier might become his life’s work.\n\nIt is through Jackson’s images of the frontier coupled with the first hand experiences found in emigrant dairies that we have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of what life truly was like along the Oregon Trail.  \n\nIf you would like to learn more about William Henry Jackson and his works please visit the park’s museum and tour the William Henry Jackson Room where you will find reprints of some of his watercolors and photographs.  \n\nFrom here the historic trails make their way north returning to the banks of the North Platte River and westward to the mountains.  We hope that you have enjoyed your walk and tour, and that we have given you a better understanding of the Oregon Trail and the people who traveled it.",

During the 1840s, the mission also served as a way-stop on the Oregon Trail, providing emigrants with food, medicine, and, if needed, a place to stay during the winter. The Whitmans were killed in an attack on November 29, 1847.",

The Green enters into deep canyons filled with rapids that challenged Major John Wesley Powell who passed through here in 1869 on his voyage down the Green and Colorado Rivers.",

During the Revolution, Pedrick commissioned privateers to capture British merchant vessels, storing captured cargo in his store house. \n\nIn 1809, the warehouse was purchased by Captain William Story, a relative of Thomas Pedrick. Unfortunately, he was not as successful in his mercantile efforts as Pedrick had been, and was forced to sell the warehouse and wharf in 1820. The building went through several owners until the National Park Service accepted it in 2003 and began several years of conservation on the original 18th century timbers.",

FRIENDSHIP was known as an East Indiaman, a vessel typically employed in the East Indies trade. In addition, FRIENDSHIP traded in the West Indies, South America, northern Europe, and the Mediterranean, making at least fifteen voyages.\n\nFRIENDSHIP left for its eighth voyage in June of 1802, on the way to Sumatra and then China. It returned twenty six months later, in August of 1804, with cargo including silk, coffee, tea, pepper, and china. The customs duties collected amounted to over 31 thousand dollars. During this voyage, Thomas Russell, the second mate, and Mr. Odell, the ship carpenter, constructed a large model of FRIENDSHIP. \n\nOn September 5th of 1812, when it was about two thirds of the way across the Atlantic, FRIENDSHIP was captured as a prize of war by the British vessel ROSAMOND. Unfortunately, little is known about its life afterwards.  \n\nToday, the replica FRIENDSHIP OF SALEM, is berthed at Derby Wharf. The hull construction and rig are based on Thomas Russell’s 1804 model, displayed today at the Peabody Essex Museum. The National Park Service used modern materials and construction methods while retaining the original appearance of this iconic, Salem ship.",

Over the next few years, he and his team unearthed outlines of the principle structures and the remains of the blast furnace, a 500-pound hammer head, a large section of a waterwheel and thousands of other artifacts.  \n\nBy 1951, a reconstruction project was under way. Workers, from civil engineers to leather craftsmen, relied on Robbins archeological finds, colonial documents and 17th century English descriptions of iron works to recreate the Saugus Iron Works.

The initial charging operation, which included drying out the sandstone lining of the furnace, could take as long as a week to be completed. \n\nA calcium rich flux, usually limestone or seashells, was needed to drive impurities out of the iron. At Saugus, it was determined that gabbro, an igneous rock found on the shoreline of the nearby Nahant peninsula, could be used as a flux. Founders carefully managed proportions of charcoal, bog ore, gabbro and air to separate the iron from its impurities.  \n\nAs molten iron and slag were tapped separately from the base of the furnace, more material was fed into the charge hole at the top. While in blast, the furnace was attended around the clock from 30-40 weeks until maintenance was needed.",

To fill the need, potters were employed to produce clay molds which were buried beneath the sand floor of the casting shed. A clay plug was knocked out of a dam at the bottom of the furnace, allowing molten iron to flow into a large ladle. The fiery liquid was then poured through a long hollow tube into the buried mold.  \n\nWorkers would carefully create a series of connected trenches in the sand, that when iron was tapped into these gutters, it froze into cast iron ingots, or sows.

This created new tensions between the iron works and the local community. These men had been captured at the Battle of Dunbar Scotland,  marched over 100 miles to Newcastle, then shipped across the Atlantic to ease the chronic shortage and high price of labor at the iron works. Many Scottish prisoners were trained at Saugus and they soon replaced local workers as carpenters, farmers, wood cutters and miners, with some becoming iron workers and blacksmiths. \n\nThese skilled iron workers brought specialized metallurgical knowledge to Saugus. The hammermen squeezed excess slag from the loop and forged the iron into merchant bars, the major product of the Saugus Iron Works. The long internal fibers of the bar made it less brittle than cast iron, making it ideal for horseshoes, shovels and other tools. Imported steel could be welded onto wrought iron axes and chisels to add a more durable cutting edge.",

Markets ranged from local blacksmiths to English merchants and even entrepreneurs in Barbados.  \n\nJust past the warehouse, the wood dock projects in the river. Red wing blackbirds, black crown night herons, ducks, Canada geese, kingfishers and goldfinches are among the more than 40 species of birds making a living along the waterfront.  \n\nDespite successful iron production, the iron works was plagued by financial difficulties beginning in the 1650s, resulting in bankruptcy.

There’s nothing unusual about towns erecting statues to their favorite sons and Independence is no exception.  It usually happens after they’re dead.  Harry Truman said, “A statesman is a politician who’s been dead 10 or 15 years.”  It must be tough being a politician.  No matter what they do, somebody’s not going to like it.  With all the criticism they get, you’d think that, sooner or later, they must ask themselves if it’s really all worth it.  That question—Is it worth it? —is a question everyone has to ask themselves once in a while.  At what point to we realize a price is too high to pay in order to get something we want?  Whatever we gain comes at a price, whether it’s the price of a new car, or how much time we’re willing to commit to getting an education.  Or, sometimes, the question is about an exchange of personal standards for what we consider to be a greater good.  That’s a tricky one.   This is the question Harry Truman had to ask himself when he decided to get into politics.  The 1920s and ‘30s, when Truman got into the job, were a time when machine bosses-controlled politics in all large cities.  In Jackson County, which included both Independence and Kansas City, Boss Tom Pendergast ran the Democratic machine, and one had to be associated with his organization in order to be in politics at all.  Harry Truman needed to be able to work with a corrupt machine without being corrupted by it himself.  Anybody hoping to do that was going to have to be both politically astute and realistic about human nature.  Harry Truman seemed to be both, and he showed a willingness to work within certain parameters in order to accomplish what he considered to be a greater good.  It is possible that Harry Truman’s success was due to his ability to balance an idealistic nature with pragmatic common sense.  Whatever it was, Harry Truman received a political education here in Independence that, when combined with his temperament and personality, and the right circumstances, of course, was enough to get him to the White House.  Fortunately, for those who are interested, there is tangible evidence of that education still in existence.  Although the uses have changed, almost all the buildings where important events happened are still standing, and this tour will take you to some of them.  Let’s start with the place where Harry Truman had his first job, the first place he learned his first lesson about politics.  It’s right across the street on the corner of Maple and Main.",

This is where Harry had his first job and it’s the place where he learned his first lesson about human nature.  This building is about growing up and wising up.  Harry worked here for a few months when he was about 14 years old. That would have been in 1898.  This is how Harry later described the place and his job:  My first paying job was opening up a drugstore in Independence for Mr. Jim Clinton at six-thirty in the morning, mopping the floors, sweeping the sidewalk, and having everything shipshape when Mr. Clinton came in.  When everything was in order, there were bottles to wipe off and shelves to dust.  There must have been a thousand bottles to dust and yards and yards of patent-medicine cases and shelves to clean.  At least it seemed that way, because I never finished the bottles and shelves by school time and had to start the next morning where I’d left off the day before.  By the time I got around them all, it was time to start over.  How I hated Latin-covered prescription bottles and patent-medicine shelves!  Now here’s the important part.  He wrote:  In a little closet under the prescription case, which faced the front and shut off the view of the back end of the store, was an assortment of whisky bottles.  Early in the morning, sometimes before Mr. Clinton arrived, the good church members and Anti-Saloon Leaguers would come in for their early-morning drink behind the prescription case at ten cents an ounce.  They would wipe their mouths, peep through the observation hole in the front of the case and depart.  This procedure gave a fourteen-year-old boy quite a viewpoint on the public front of leading citizens.  There were saloons aplenty around the square in Independence, and many leading men in town made no bones about going into them and buying a drink.  I learned to think more highly of them than I did of the prescription-counter drinkers. The lesson he learned:  Some people are not as honest as they would like you to think they are, but that doesn’t mean one has to be like them.  So, like most normal people, Truman gravitated towards friends who he believed shared his values and experiences.",

This building at 101 North Main Street is the old Farmers and Merchants Bank Building.  And this building is all about who you know.  This is where the Harpie Club met.  The Harpie Club was Harry Truman’s poker playing club.  It was formed around 1924 by him and some of his friends.  Most of them were veterans of World War I.  There were usually about 16 to 18 members, and they played every Monday night.  Its name, the Harpie Club, had something to do with a harmonica playing contest and was called the Harmonica Club for a time. The name gradually changed into the Harpie Club partly because they found out that sometimes the harmonica is called a French Harp.  That may have been something they picked up on during the time they spent in France during World War I.  Anyway, the club met here in this building in a back room on the third floor.  These were good-natured poker games. Harry Truman really loved poker, but he didn’t seem to take the game too seriously.   And it doesn’t sound like he was much of a bluffer, either—he was a pretty straightforward guy.  One of his friends recalled. \"You can tell when he's winning, because there's a kind of smile on his face.\"  These men, Truman’s friends, were prominent men in the community—business owners, public officials, government employees—and it was these friends that assisted Harry Truman in his political career.  So, Harry learned it’s good to have friends.  Before he settled completely into politics, though, Harry tried to be a businessman and chose friends of his for his business partners.  None of these business ventures worked out, but it wasn’t always his fault.",

Harry Truman was loyal to a fault, but the fact is that sometimes he was loyal to people who didn’t always deserve it.   This building, at 204 North Liberty Street, is where Harry Truman learned that, just because someone says they’re your friend, doesn’t always mean you can trust them.  And that was a hard lesson for him to learn.  In 1925, Harry Truman became involved in a company called Community Savings and Loan, the main office of which was located in this shop front.  He had two business partners, Spencer Salisbury and Arthur Metzger. Metzger was a member of the Harpie Club and Truman had known Salisbury in World War I.  His involvement with Salisbury was a sign that Harry was not always the best judge of character when it came to his friends.  Salisbury belonged to an old, well-to-do Independence family.  He was lively and talkative, but people also sometimes called him “a little slick.”  Lots of people called him “Snake-eye” Salisbury.  Even his own sister said he was “kind of a cold bird.”  Asked long afterward why Harry ever associated himself with the man, Edgar Hinde, another member of the Harpie Club replied, “Anybody who’s ever been a friend of his...they’ve got to hit him right in the face before he’ll drop them.”  It turned out that Salisbury was cheating Truman in the Savings and Loan business.  \"My private business has gone to pot,\" Truman wrote.  \"I'll be worse than a pauper when I'm done.\"  So, Harry got out, and he ended up making an enemy out of Salisbury.  Privately Truman wrote that Salisbury “used me for his own ends, robbed me, and laughed at me.  It nearly makes me a pessimist.”  And to top it all off, even though Truman never said anything publicly against Salisbury, Salisbury spoke critically of Truman both privately and in public.  So Truman was loyal, which was a good thing, because he would have to be loyal—and partisan—if he was going to make it with the Pendergast machine, but he also learned that loyalty had its risks.  The other thing he got from the Savings and Loan venture was a taste of what it’s like to have somebody talking bad about you.  Everybody hears rumors and stories about politicians.  Some are true and some aren’t, but the stories do get back to family members, and that had to bother Truman, because he didn’t want those, he cared about to be embarrassed by him in any way.  And there was no one he cared about more than his wife.  For this next stop, if you’re standing in front of the former Community Savings and Loan shop, look north on Liberty Street towards the Trinity Episcopal Church.  It’s 2 ½ blocks north on the east side of the street.  You can walk up there is you want, but you don’t have to, because you can see it from here.  If you look up there, you’ll notice a real tall, pointed steeple – that’s the Catholic Church.  The Episcopal Church is between you and the Catholic Church.  It’s a one-story church with the smaller steeple that has a little belfry tower at the peak.  See the water tower?  Look straight down from the water tower and you should see it.",

This building is about trying to be the kind of person that you know you ought to be.  Here’s the situation:  Harry Truman was a decent man who wanted to stay that way, but who decided to get involved with politics, along with all its moral challenges and temptations.  To really understand Truman’s commitment to do the right thing, it’s really important to know how much he wanted to look good to Bess.  The best evidence for this is in the letters he wrote to her over the years.  These are some of the things he wrote to her.  I’m horribly anxious for you to suffer from an excessively good opinion of me! Since I can’t rescue you from any monster or carry you from a burning building or save you from a sinking ship – simply because I’d be afraid of the monsters, couldn’t carry you, and can’t swim – I’ll have to go to work and make money enough to pay my debts and then get you to take me for what I am; just a common everyday man whose instincts are to be ornery, who’s anxious to be right. I’ve wanted so badly to make good…so you and my sweet baby [Margaret] wouldn’t be ashamed of me. I’ve never cared for social position or rank for myself except to see that those dear to me were not made to suffer for my shortcomings. Harry Truman spent his life trying to be the type of man he thought his wife deserved.  Independence was a small town, and everyone knew each other.  And also, everybody knew what was going on over in Kansas City; people knew who Pendergast was and people knew the type of people who associated with Pendergast.  So, what Truman learned here was, if he was to retain his good reputation and not embarrass his family, and yet succeed in a career as a politician, he would have to walk a fine line.

                    "audioTranscript": "This is the old Slack Grocery Building at 211 West Lexington.  The part of the building we’re interested in is down at the far end, where the drug store is. Upstairs above the drug store.  This upstairs section was where the Rural Jackson County Democratic Club used to meet.  It was here, in this building, in early 1922, that Mike Pendergast, who was Boss Tom’s brother, introduced Harry Truman and announced that Truman was the organization’s candidate for Eastern District Jackson County Judge. This was the first time Harry Truman’s name was mentioned in connection with a political office.  It was also when Harry Truman first started learning about the inner workings of a political machine.  Here’s how all this happened:  In late 1921, Harry Truman was running a clothing store—a haberdashery—over in Kansas City, which wasn’t doing too well.  In fact, they were going out of business.  A fellow named Jim Pendergast, who was an army buddy of Harry’s and the nephew of Boss Tom, brought his father, Mike Pendergast, into the haberdashery and asked Truman if he would be interested in running for Eastern District County judge.  The way the county was set up at the time was there three judges, who were really commissioners rather than judges in the judicial sense.  There was a presiding judge who was elected at large, and then there was an eastern district and a western district judge, each elected from their part of the county.  Tom Pendergast had control of the western part of the county, and he already had his men in place as the presiding judge and the western district judge.  But Tom didn’t control the whole county.  That’s because the Democratic party was split into two factions.  Tom ran the western faction, but the eastern faction was run by a guy named Joe Shannon, and Pendergast usually had to share the political spoils with him.  So, it’d be a real coup for Boss Tom to get a Pendergast man in office as the Eastern District judge, too, since that would give Pendergast control of the whole county.  The problem was these judges held a lot of power and once in a while, after they were in office, they’d try to take over Pendergast’s operation.  So, Pendergast needed a man who was a) from the east part of the county, b) who could be elected honestly (which was always easier than trying to rig the election), and c) who would be loyal to the machine after he was in office.  Harry Truman was perfect for the job.   Plus, Harry was a war hero, he had been a farmer so folks in the rural part of the county knew and liked him, he came from a good family and his father had been friends with Mike Pendergast…, and Harry needed a job anyway since the haberdashery was going out of business.  So, everybody got something out of this.  And it all started right here, upstairs at 211 West Maple Street.  After his nomination, he still had to campaign to get elected.  He set up campaign headquarters about a block to the east, right up Maple Street.  The address, though, 111 West Maple Street, is a little hard to find.  It would be between 109 and 113 West Maple.  Walk on up there and see what you find.",

                    "audioTranscript": "If you’re in the right place, you’re looking at an empty lot.  Out of all the buildings related to Truman’s early political years, this is the only one that’s gone now.  This vacant lot is where Truman's headquarters was during his 1922 campaign for eastern district judge.  This would have been the first political campaign he ever ran.  The building was torn down around 1973, and it’s really too bad, too, because this is where Harry Truman started on the path that led him to the White House.  Edgar Hinde, a member of the Harpie Club and later postmaster of Independence, recalled Harry Truman coming to him one day with kind of a little grin on his face, asking what Hinde would think if Truman decided to run for county judge.  Hinde told him he would think he was crazy.  “Well,” Truman responded, “I got to eat.”  See, Edgar Hinde knew what politics were like in Jackson County.  When Harry got involved in politics, he was worried about his reputation, but there was a lot more than his reputation in danger sometimes.  Politics in Kansas City during the 1920s could be a violent business.  Out in Independence, things weren’t so bad, but Kansas City was rough.  We’re talking about things like unlicensed cars filled with armed thugs cruising the streets looking for opposition targets.  One election day, a pack of hoodlums jumped an opposition candidate for city council, and his bodyguard, and a Kansas City Star reporter, and they beat all of them up.  The reporter got away and there was a big car chase all the way back to the front door of the newspaper building.  Another gang came in a voting place, apparently looking to beat up one of the election judges; another judge whipped out a revolver, so they shot and killed him instead.  Other thugs set out to kill a deputy sheriff who was on the other side.  There was a shootout, the deputy and one of the mobsters were mortally wounded, and an innocent bystander was killed instantly.  And, even though most of this was going on in over in Kansas City, Harry Truman and his family were sometimes personally in danger, too.  For example, when Margaret was in first grade, there was a kidnapping attempt on her.  The next day was election day, and Harry had Margaret and Bess locked up in a hotel room over in Kansas City with a couple of armed guards at the door.  In 1933, Harry wrote to Bess, “Please be careful about eating anything that comes in the mail.”  Not really sure what that was all about, but it sounds like he was worried someone might try to poison them.  This was a dangerous time to be in politics, and Truman knew that when he went into it.  But professionally, he had finally found his niche.  He found the kind of job that he was really good at.  He was 38 years old.  He didn’t know it then, but he was going to end up doing this for the rest of his life.  This kind of stuff was just the price that he had to pay.  Once he was elected, he moved into an office in the county courthouse.  Walk across the street to the south entrance door.  That’s the one directly across the street that’s facing Lexington Street.",

You can see the names of all the county judge's names who were in office every time the courthouse was remodeled. There’s been seven county courthouses in Independence, the last six of which have stood on this site.  But this one you’re standing in front of now, this is the building where Harry Truman’s political education was first put to practical use. He ended up serving ten years on the county court, two of them as the Eastern District Judge, and eight of them as the Presiding Judge. Doctor Andrew Dunar, in his book The Truman Scandals, talks about three main political lessons Truman learned during that time. Number one: Truman came to recognize corruption and he learned to dealt with it in a way that left him his reputation. But he also came to understand that there would always be people who would seek public positions for private gain. For instance, there was a guy named Barr, who Truman picked for eastern judge, only to find out Barr was no good.  Here’s what Truman wrote about Barr:“I picked a West Pointer, a son of an honorable father, a man who should have had Washington, Lee, Jackson, Gustavus Adolphus, for his ideals, to associate with me in carrying out a program and I got—a dud, a weakling, no ideals, no nothing. He’s use his office for his own enrichment, he’s not true to his wife (and a man not honorable in his marital relations is not usually honorable in any other). He’d sell me or anyone else he’s associated with out for his own gain.” Yet Truman also believed that one could survive in the midst of corruption, and sometimes, even stop some of it. So, Lesson number two: Truman learned to avoid corruption by working around people who were responsible for it. For instance, he was able to work around the other two judges on the court. He remembered, “When I wanted something done, I’d let Barr and Vrooman start a crap game and then introduce a long and technical order. Neither of them would have time to read it and over it would go. I got a lot of good legislation for Jackson Co. over while they shot craps. Both of them thought that public office is a means of personal enrichment.”And Lesson number three: Truman learned the need to take issues to the people, who would vindicate an honest and well-reasoned position even if ran counter to conventional political wisdom. For instance, when he sought a bond issue for the roads project, he recalled, “Pendergast told me that a county bond issue would not carry.  I told him that if I told the voters how I would handle it, it would carry. I went to the people…and [the] bond issue carried by a three-fourths majority instead of the required two-thirds.”  Now, just because Harry learned these things didn’t mean he always applied these lessons well, but he still seemed to get ahead.  And the office Truman used as county judge is still in this building and is open to the public if you’re interested.  Right outside his office door is the next stop on your cell phone tour. To get to his office, go through the courthouse doors here to the cross hall and turn right (that’d be East). His office is all the way down at the end of the hall.  If his office is open when you’re here, you can go in.",

                    "audioTranscript": "This is the office where Harry Truman had to make those hard decisions about paying the price. Overall, Truman gave Pendergast an honest county administration that allowed Pendergast to solidify machine control over rural Jackson County, and thereby, all of Jackson County. Pendergast in return gave Truman a lot of freedom to do what he wanted—and the assistance of the machine’s electoral power. Truman, then also gave Pendergast patronage, but not graft—or at least, not much. There was at least one time, however, that Truman forced to compromise. He wrote out his frustrations about it in kind of a diary-like memo to himself at the time. In part, he wrote, “I had to compromise in order to get the voted road system carried out.  I had to let a former saloonkeeper and murderer, a friend of the Boss’s, steal about $10,000 from the general revenues of the county to keep the crooks from getting a million or more out of the bond issue.  Was I right or did I compound a felony?  Anyway, I’ve got the $6,500,000 worth of roads on the ground and at a figure that makes the crooks tear their hair. Am I an administrator or not? Or am I just a crook to compromise in order to get the job done?” He wondered is he might be better off to just quit and run a gas station. He wrote, “All this gives me headaches….” He suffered from headaches and stomach trouble, apparently brought on by the stress of trying to adapt to a system with which he was not in full agreement.  He was willing to accept the “lesser evil” argument that sanctioned certain activities in order to keep the party in power, but it wasn’t easy for him. And it appears that Truman’s honesty eventually wore Pendergast’s patience kind of thin. It looks like Pendergast might have been ready to move Truman out when his terms as county judge were over. Pendergast didn’t seem to be too interested in getting Truman another job. It appears the only reason Truman was picked to run for the United States Senate is because Pendergast couldn’t find anyone else. Truman was his second or third choice; all the other guys had turned him down. Like all politicians, Truman had been criticized in the local press, but now that his power was potentially national in scope, he really learned how rough the press could be. For instance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran a cartoon that showed Truman as Edgar Bergen’s dummy Charlie McCarthy seated on the lap of Boss Pendergast. The caption read “Charlie McTruman does his stuff.” Another one said that Truman’s nomination for Senator would bring “shrill rejoicing among all the forces of evil in Missouri.” Truman learned to take it in stride, though. He said, “I don’t let these things bother me for the simple reason I know that I am trying to do the right thing, and eventually the facts will come out.” And I think it’s possible to point to the one moment, the one instance, that was probably more satisfying to him, professionally, than any other moment of his life. You can stand exactly where he stood when that moment happened. Try this:  Go back to the south entrance of the courthouse – that’s the door you came in – and stand right inside the door – don’t exit the building yet – just stand right inside the door.",

Earlier today here in Independence, just a minutes after 10:14 am (that’s when Thomas Dewey conceded the election), every bell, whistle, siren, car horn, seemed to go off at once. It seems nobody planned any kind of celebration, but Mayor Roger Sermon [of the Harpie Club] quickly declared a holiday.  Schools were let out and an impromptu parade started up, going around and around the courthouse square.

                    "audioTranscript": "Did you feel it back there?  It must have felt good to Harry Truman that night. Despite all the headaches and stomach aches, all the worries about his reputation and all the worries about his family – all the difficulties involved in maintaining political decency – his remaining true to himself and his standards paid off. The city of Independence erected this statue of Mr. Truman in 1976, right across the street from where he had his first job at Clinton’s. President Gerald Ford dedicated the statue.  He said he was Harry Truman’s “No. 1 fan.”Just goes to show how Truman’s reputation had transcended political boundaries. All kinds of political leaders who want to identify themselves with President Truman use this courthouse and statue as a backdrop. Lots American presidents have given speeches on the courthouse steps over the years, and it serves as kind of a focal point for visiting dignitaries and office-seekers. When it came to knowing how to balance out the cost and the gain of politics, Harry Truman, apparently, did okay. Tom Pendergast was convicted and sentenced to Leavenworth in 1939. But, despite his association with Pendergast, though, Truman wasn’t found guilty of anything.  And it’s not as if there wasn’t anybody looking for evidence against him, either. But even Maurice Milligan, the United States attorney who got the conviction for Pendergast said, “At no time did the finger of suspicion ever point in the direction of Senator Truman.”  In 1952, near the end of his 30-year career as a politician, Harry Truman wrote – and this pretty much sums the whole thing up – “Politics force men into contacts with all manner of people, but men of principle need never surrender them in order to gain or to hold political office.” It’s easy for Americans to be cynical about politics sometimes, but here on the town square in Independence, Missouri, is this collection of buildings that remind us that it is possible to wield enormous political power and still not be corrupted by it. Thanks for taking the tour. We hope you enjoyed it. Be careful, and good bye.",

Around her kitchen table, the farmer’s hopes and fears for the future were discussed, meals were served, and children did their schoolwork. \n\nThe woman of the farm kept gardens, raised chickens, gathered eggs, and tended bees. She carried out dozens of household chores without plumbing or electricity. She had a number of simple machines to help her, but every one of them had a lever or a crank or a treadle that she had to activate with her own power. \n\nHattie Olsen was one of the luckier wives. The house before you was one of the most modern and the first to have indoor plumbing. But even this modern convenience required manual labor: the Olsens had to pump water by hand into a tank in the attic to create the water pressure needed for the system. \n\nCharles and Hattie Olsen bought this farm from Fred Dechow in 1915; the house was built around 1918-19. This farm was one of the first Port Oneida farms designated a Class A dairy operation, and the Olsens were the first family to own a tractor. The Olsens also raised grain crops including wheat, oats, and corn, as well as green hay, potatoes and apples.\n\nThe reds, pinks, and purples of the gardens and flowers you see around the farmhouse evoke Hattie Olsen’s care, hard work and love of beauty. \n\nThe Olsen barn is one of the largest and best barns in Port Oneida. It is a hillside barn: the lower level was for livestock and the upper level for hay storage. \n\nYou’re welcome to tour the Olsen house and visit the Port Oneida Farms Heritage Center to learn more about Charles and Hattie Olsen’s family and farm.",

                    "audioTranscript": "From 1890 until World War II, Port Oneida was a closely-knit farming community. Early settlement in the area by German and Bohemian settlers helped create a strong and cohesive community—many of farms remained in the possession of the same families.\n\nAs Jack Barratt, a lifelong resident put it, “When you grow up in a community where everybody’s connected to somebody else, everybody takes care of everybody else.”\n\nThe cooperative nature of farming strengthened these community bonds:  jobs like filling silos, buzzing wood, and thrashing grains required many hands. Farmers came together to form crews that moved from farm to farm. According to Jack Barratt, when it came time to fill the silos, “You’d usually have four or five guys in the field cutting corn and loading the wagons, and you’d have two, three wagons—like Charlie Olsen would bring his two teams and wagons to Burfiends, and maybe we would put a team and wagon over there…If you had any kids around, you’d bring them too, to cut corn. . .[and] The women got to work too—cooking. \n\nThis crossroads where the schoolhouse stands was the center of the Port Oneida community. A church stood here along with the schoolhouse and the cemetery across the road.  A grocery store, telephone exchange, and post office was set up in the Kelderhouse home across the road. \n\nThe Port Oneida School was built in the 1890s. All of the children who grew up in Port Oneida attended school here. The school closed its doors in 1940 and is now owned and maintained by the Glen Lake Community School District so that today’s students can learn about local history and historical preservation.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The farmer had to do the work of dozens of specialists. He was a nurseryman, veterinarian, carpenter, mechanic, blacksmith, plumber, roofer, painter, hunter, trapper, butcher, leather crafter, teacher, cowboy, teamster, engineer, business manager, accountant, and entrepreneur. The most successful entrepreneur in Port Oneida, and Port Oneida’s most famous citizen, was Thomas Kelderhouse.\n\nThomas P. Kelderhouse arrived in the area in the early 1860s. He purchased the land that became the town of Port Oneida, built a dock, sold cordwood, built a sawmill, built a gristmill, and harvested elderberries from his inland swamp.\n\nThomas Kelderhouse became one of the prominent businessmen in Leelanau County. He owned more than half of the land north of the Crystal River in Glen Arbor Township, and parts of adjoining Cleveland Township. The Kelderhouse farm was second in size only to that of the Northern Transit Company farm at Glen Haven. Devoted primarily to general agriculture, Kelderhouse’s farm was productive and profitable.\n\nThe parcel of land you are standing on now was in the hands of the Kelderhouse family from 1863 until its acquisition by the National Park Service in 1970. In the late 1880s, Thomas’s son William built a log cabin here, and in 1910, the farmhouse. This 65-acre farm was a central gathering place for Port Oneida residents. The house has an arts and crafts interior with some extra decorative touches. It was used as a grocery store, telephone exchange, and post office—all run by William’s wife, Charlotte. \n\nThe sugar maple trees surrounding the house were planted by students from the school across the street. The Kelderhouses tapped the trees to make maple syrup. \n\nApple trees with heritage variety apples were planted by Rolland Kelderhouse around the early 1920’s. A remnant orchard of apple trees is currently being restored. You can see, near the house, a fenced-in tree nursery of about 250 heritage apple trees, representing about 30 varieties including Cortland, Russet, Wagener, Ben Davis, Wolf River, Rhode Island Greening, Champion, and Spy. There is also a pear tree between the house and the nearby cemetery.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The principle crops of the Port Oneida area included wheat, corn, oats, barley, buckwheat, vegetables, and potatoes. Although the land provided most farm families with an adequate income, farming in the area was not easy. The price of the main cash crop—potatoes—fluctuated continuously, providing both good and bad income years. The lakeshore’s sandy soils, good for potatoes, became easily exhausted after a few seasons of growing grains and other crops, often resulting in lowered yields when farmers used improper agricultural methods. \n\nThis farm—Frederick and Fredericka Dechow’s farm—had some of the best soil in Port Oneida and was one of the most productive farms. The Dechows purchased the farm in 1857 and built a log cabin. Their sons, John and Charles, built the barn around 1890. Grandson Frank Dechow built the new house—a showplace of modern style—about 1910. A few years later, he was able to add to his farm by purchasing the neighboring land. The Dechows raised apples and dairy cows, and sold milk, cream, and eggs to local resorts.  Standing in the shade of the old oak, you can look out toward the pasture barn and imagine the beautiful orchards that lined the path. \n\nThis farm is a good example of a working farm of the late 1940s where old structures were adapted for new methods. The concrete silo and milking parlor indicate a commitment to dairy production. The large granary building and the small corncrib are typical for farms this far north. These farmers grew less corn because of the short growing season. A large chicken coop for raising fryers for market and another coop for a laying flock round out the barn yard buildings.\n\n\nThe farms of the Port Oneida area are typical of turn of the century farms throughout the Midwest. It is rare, however, to find such a large collection of older farms that are free from modern development. This historic district brings alive the land use practices, architecture and evolution of agricultural technology common to subsistence farms of the upper Great Lakes region. Port Oneida was farmed for over 100 years; the houses and fields passed down from generation to generation, and now, through its preservation by the National Park Service to us.",

The USCC, a descendant of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), ministered to both the souls and bodies of Union soldiers during the war. Formed in November of 1861, this organization attained widespread support among religious, business, and political leaders.  \n\nDuring the war, the USCC sent over 5,000 delegates into hospitals, garrisons and battlefields to both preach and provide comfort articles and hospital stores.  In the permanent camps, free reading rooms were established. Writing materials, and postage, stamps were furnished to the soldiers, and the agents urged the men to both write and send a considerable part of their pay home.",

During the park’s Christmas 1864 presentation, the Roeder’s home is shown with a favorite Yuletide decoration: a Christmas tree. Embraced by many German families like the Roeders, not many other homes in Harpers Ferry would have had a tree. All through the Civil War years, this Harpers Ferry family was unusual in their support for Abraham Lincoln and his government.  \n\nPrior to the war, Frederick Roeder ran this confectionery that supported his large and growing family. Not just a business, this building was also home to Roeder, his wife, and their seven children. Shortly before the war, Mrs. Maria Roeder died of a disease. Mr. Roeder and his children ran both the house and business. Unfortunately, Mr. Roeder’s death at the start of the Civil War left his children orphans who had to learn to fend for themselves.",

Downey Street was the entrance into West Branch from the south. If you look up and down the road, you can still find scattered hitching posts in front of several of the homes. \n(music) In 1870, the U.S. census counted Iowa’s population at almost 1.2 million. The towns and farms that now covered the state had, within a single generation, replaced the traditional American Indian uses of the land. Herbert Hoover’s grandfather, Eli Hoover, was one of the first few settlers of West Branch, arriving by covered wagon in 1854. When the census takers came sixteen years later, the town’s population stood at about 200.  But the railroad’s arrival in West Branch that same year helped the town’s rapid expansion into a thriving agricultural and business centered community.  \nDuring Herbert Hoover’s childhood, the intersection of Downey and Main was the town crossroads. Although several of the streets that existed historically have been moved or no longer exist, you can still see the road trace of the original Downey Street as it runs past the little Birthplace Cottage. Because it wasn’t far, the Hoover family walked down this street into town to do their shopping.\n(sound effects: birds chirping) Did you notice how most of the homes along this street have either four-board or picket fencing in their front yards? For modern-day homeowners, what looks like a decorative choice was actually one of necessity for the folks living on Downey Street. When “Bertie” Hoover was a boy, he probably saw local farmers drive their livestock to market down the middle of this wide street - right past his front door.(sound effects: horse and buggy, cows, pigs) But if it weren’t for those fences, a stray pig or cow might have actually wound up eating the vegetables in his mother’s garden or stepping on the tulips in their front yard!\nIn the 1870’s, the streets of West Branch were either “dusty thoroughfares or muddy bogs.” (sound effects: rain, horse and buggy) When it rained Downey Street would turn sticky with mud and lots of wagon wheel ruts. It wasn’t unusual to see a team of oxen or even a horse and buggy get stuck. At the time of Hoover’s birth in 1874, West Branch didn’t have sidewalks. However, by 1885 the city had finished over three and a half miles of wood plank walkways. The sidewalks here today are representations of those late 19th century boardwalks; they may be slippery when wet, so please watch your step.",

Wheelchair access is through the back door. \nLike any couple just starting out, 21-year old Hulda Minthorn and 23-year old Jesse Hoover were eager to have a place to call their own. Shortly after their first wedding anniversary, and with the help of his father Eli, Jesse built this simple, but sturdy two-room cottage in the spring of 1871 on the corner of Downey and Penn Streets. Although the house only measured 14 x 20 feet, building it was a challenge. The home's large foundation stones had to be brought by wagon from the open prairie to the west, while the timber used for the board and batten cottage followed an amazing journey of its own. \nLook up at the rafters and see if you can find any that have holes drilled into them. (sound effects: rushing river, saw cutting wood)That's where the trees were lashed together into a giant raft, which was floated down the Mississippi River to a sawmill in Muscatine, about 40 miles southeast of West Branch. There they were turned into lumber, then hauled by ox teams to the home site. Some of the wood was used for the cottage's straight board doors, while more was used for the large vertical wallboards inside the home. Did you know that during the cottage's restoration, architects found strips of cotton fabric stuffed between the seams? (sound effects: winds whirling, blowing) Jesse Hoover installed these to be sure his family would be protected from the winter winds that swept across the Iowa prairie. The small twelve-paned windows also helped by preventing too much heat from escaping the cottage.\n(music) Hulda soon set about arranging the home to suit herself, both inside and out. A chicken coop provided fresh eggs. She grew her vegetable garden behind the cottage, while flower gardens of marigolds, peonies, and snapdragons filled the front and side yards. And just like today, seeds, cuttings and bulbs, were traded with family and friends.  The dark red double-petaled tulips that once grew here came from the bulbs Hulda's mother had brought with her from Canada.\nLooking around this house, you may think the Hoover family was poor. But their prudent spending, strong work ethic, and resourceful ways were actually a reflection of their Quaker beliefs. With that in mind, you can understand why Herbert Hoover was inspired to write these heartfelt words in his memoirs. \nHoover: (actor) \"This cottage where I was born is physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life. In no other land could a boy from a country village, without inheritance or influential friends, look forward with unbound hope.\"",

Students shared reading books, and practiced penmanship on slate chalkboards, like the ones sitting on these desktops. \nThe only source of heat in this schoolhouse came from a pot-bellied wood stove located at the back of the room.

When there seemed to be no more messages, the elders rose, shook hands, and the meeting ended.

Permanent galleries take you from President Hoover's boyhood in Iowa and continue on to a recreation of the Waldorf Towers apartment in New York where he spent the final years of his life.\nHerbert Hoover was proud of the modest museum here because it fit within the context of the other buildings on the site. Tim Walch: \"He was determined to locate it on a lower terrain than others had suggested; they wanted to locate it up on the top of Cook's Hill. And he said, \"No, no, I want it down with the other buildings. I don't want it any taller than any of the other buildings on the site. It should fit in, in a very modest way with the other buildings.\" \nPerhaps what Herbert Hoover didn't foresee back in 1962, was how this Library-Museum would be transformed into a nationally recognized center of study. Tim Walch: \"When the Hoover Presidential Library was opened, the expectation was that we would put a few trinkets, trophies, and so forth, on display for the public to see, and that we would have the documents available just for post-doctoral scholars. Well, now these institutions have schools of public service where young people begin to study the values of the president. There are research think-tanks where people prepare policy papers for future governmental administrations.\" \nTake some time and come inside for a visit. You'll learn the story of Hoover's fifty years of public service and gain a fuller understanding of the life and times of America's 31st President.",

The most formative years of my boyhood were spent here. My roots are in this soil.\" \n(music) Those words from his memoirs, illustrate Herbert Hoover's connection to history and place. When Hoover died on October 20, 1964 at the age of 90, the 31st President was laid to rest five days later in this quiet, grassy hillside. More than 100,000 people lined the funeral procession route from Cedar Rapids to West Branch on that warm fall day. \nIowa architect William Wagner designed the memorial while working closely with the Hoover family to commemorate his life. The tall stand of chestnut, hickory, and black walnut trees planted behind the gravesite were chosen because Hoover remembered them from his childhood. The two plainly inscribed ledger stones of Vermont white marble are in keeping with the Quaker ideal of simplicity. Across the curved walkway, the American flag waves in tribute. Did you know that it was Herbert Hoover who signed the congressional resolution making The Star Spangled Banner the national anthem during his Presidency?\nNow take a moment and look past the towering flagpole. There on the horizon, at the end of the two rows of trees, is a direct view of the white, wood-frame cottage where Herbert \"Bertie\" Hoover was born. As the first President born west of the Mississippi River, Hoover believed that anyone could start from simple beginnings and achieve great things.\nPete Hoover reflects on the qualities that not only made his grandfather so successful, but encouraged the success of others.\nPete Hoover: \"Granddad was an interesting guy to be around. There was not a subject that you could raise that he couldn't contribute something on. He never commandeered the conversation. He could contribute to it and do it in an unobtrusive way so that people would understand and learn a little maybe.\" \nThe second marble gravestone is for Lou Henry Hoover, the tireless and intelligent First Lady from Waterloo, Iowa. Following her death in 1944, she was buried in Palo Alto, California, but was moved to rest beside her husband in 1964. Partners in life for almost forty-five years, they had both come back to touch the Iowa soil.",

As the rain falls on the sidewalks, parking lots, and roads, it can create problems for our rivers and streams.  The water runs off the hard surfaces and collects debris and pollution from gas, oil, bits of copper from car brakes, and pesticides from local farms and lawns.  These pollutants are deadly to salmon and harmful to our estuaries. \n\nAnd what a rain garden does, is it takes and reproduces what a native landscape would do by capturing some of that moisture and allowing Mother Nature  in the form of the plants and the soil and the microorganisms and fungi  and all the things that live in the rain garden, to process those pollutants and  to recharge that water.  \nRob Emanuel, Water Resources and Community Development Specialist with OSU Sea Grant Extension Office.\n\nNarrator:\nAnd it’s a rather amazing process that we would spend millions of dollars to treat if we were to treat these kinds of things in treatment plants, and instead nature does a wonderful job all by herself. \n\nThat odd wooden trough in the middle of the garden is not a water slide for squirrels ride but a scupper, which delivers the rain water from the roof of the visitor center to the garden. When constructing a home or a building, Rob Emanual says it’s cheaper to create a rain garden than laying expensive drainage pipes.  Most rain gardens are designed to fit in urban settings next to city streets or in font yards with small plants. However, this rain garden mirrors the surrounding forests.\n\nOne of the important pieces of our landscape up here are nurse logs, and lots and lots of native forest plants that are growing in this rain garden.   And the nurse logs are really showing what a native forest would look like up here which is typically full of downed wood, and the downed wood is covered with moss. It’s also very absorptive of water and lots of plants will grow on it and as in sort of a nursery.\n\nColby Weathers, an award winning landscape design artist, who was one of the co-designers of this garden says if everyone started managing their storm water in their own backyards, it would change our rivers. \n\nWhen we see very large storm events, rain events, and you see the rivers and streams being clouded with muddy water, that’s erosion and sediment that’s being carried off by the truckload and everyone of these types of systems, a rain garden, can protect the property that you’ve actually purchased from being washed away into the watershed. \n\nTo continue to see more restoration projects, walk down the Netul River Trail about a 1/2 mile, and stop at the brown metal foot bridge next to Ft.

                    "audioTranscript": "Sounds of a running stream.\n\nBeneath you, in the dark waters, swim young salmon, coho, chum, and Chinook, as well as cutthroat trout and steelhead. They make their way up the Lewis and Clark River during various seasons of the year and spend time eating and adjusting to the salt water while they live in the wetland. One hundred years ago, just across the road, the area was diked, drained and filled with three feet of dredge spoils from the river to create pasture. \n\nSound of bulldozer and trucks.\n\nIn 2012, a crew with large earth moving vehicles was out here changing that. Hunter White, a contract  engineer through the National Park Service, explains the project. \n\nTo the extent that we can, we’re trying to turn back the clock on that disturbance and restore the site to as close was we can when Lewis and Clark would have seen when they arrived here.  \n\nBesides moving 12,000 cubic yards of soil, the construction crew even added fallen trees to the marsh. \n\nWe use wood in our restoration projects for several different reasons.  In particular, a lot of these logs you’ll notice, have large root wads attached to them. And those especially have so much more surface area than just the log itself to provide you know, hiding spaces for small fish.  And when the logs are in the streams they also form scour holes around them rather just having one consistent channel bottom. By adding logs in here you are creating  more complicated system with pools and  ripples. \n\nIn the first phase of restoration, the park service installed a bridge in front of you so the water and fish could flow freely with the tides. And that has made all the difference.\n\nInitially, before they put in the bridge. They found 10 salmon total. And then then when we came back the next year, we found 122 salmon.\n\nApril Cameron, a Biologist with the Columbia River Estuary Study Taskforce:\n\nSalmon in particular, they are an anadromous fish, and they are dependent on the fresh water and the salt water. So having these habitats here in the lower estuary in particular gives them a place for refuge  to rear and to feed on their way out to sea, and that can be very important. \n\nFX: Ducks\n\nNarrator:\n\nAs the wetland now floods with the daily tides, the number of water fowl has increased dramatically. More ducks and geese have returned to the marsh, as well as shore birds like rails, snipes, and heron.  The park service is planting native plants such as thimble berries and Wapato and the vegetation is becoming healthier on its own, with more native plants like cattails and bulrushes springing up. But the biggest surprise for Nancy Eid, a scientist for the National Park Service, came from some early morning visitors, a few days after the cattle were taken off the land. \n\nFX: ELK CALL\n\nNancy Eid\n\nSince that time we have noticed that pretty much every morning for certain periods of the year, we can see the elk herd out in the pasture and we see sign of the elk and we know that they spend a lot of their night time hours out here as well.   \nWhat’s fantastic about working out here in the field, especially here at Ft. Clatsop. We get an opportunity to see a lot of wildlife, and being here in the park, you really get to get up and close. We hear coyotes in the mornings. We have seen a lot of migratory birds. We saw a heron just when we pulled up.\nFX HERON\n\nNarrator:\n\nContinue to follow the river trail and keep your eyes peeled for wildlife as you hike.

From there they were shipped throughout the world. \n\nFX Ship horn",

The parking lot was built with a slant to help move rain water towards a bios swale, a man-made pond of plants which functions similar in design and concept to a rain garden. Again, Pete Field.\n\nSo the bios swale, which was actually a kind of nice feature, a natural accommodation feature, even though we made it. It lets water stand and naturally infiltrate into the ground at that point. So that bioslwale it has that, I guess sponge, it’s literally a delay tactic, to get more of the water sponged into the earth and naturally filtered back to the river. \n\nNarrator:\nAnother benefit, the plants clean the water before they release it into the river. \n\nSound of kayaker paddling\n\nPeople love water and it is evident by this site’s popularity. People kayak, fish, walk their dogs and run by this river on a regular basis. On your way back to Ft Clatsop, take your time. Observe and appreciate this abundant resource of the Pacific Northwest.

We spent a lot of time in this room in the evening. Mr. Kennedy was president of a bank and this was his one opportunity to read the newspaper or his favorite detective stories. He would sit in that red chair by the gate-leg table. We all read The Boston Transcript in the evenings in those days. Papers only cost a penny. Usually I would sit in the wing chair there by the table opposite him. I can't see that chair without remembering the holes in the children's stockings. They wore knickers then and the boys knee stockings always had holes in them. They had to be darned once or twice a week When the children were ready for bed and had said their prayers they would come to the living room and play for a little while before we put them to bed. Usually after the children were tucked in, Mr. Kennedy and I would take a long walk. It was an hour we both enjoyed. I spent a good deal of the time reading to the children from books carefully selected from a list submitted by the school twice a year or from the Women's Industrial Union. I remember that I would make no engagements outside in the evening so that I could be with the children to help them with their school work, to doctor their colds, or to find out what activities they had been interested in during the day. The piano was a wedding gift and at Christmas, with the tree over there by the south window, I would play and we would all sing Christmas carols. The children did not do too well with their piano lessons. Radio was a new thing then and they said that people wouldn't want to listen to them play when they could hear the same songs on the radio. The pictures are copies of famous paintings I had studied in the European galleries. It gave me great pleasure to have these copies in my home and I thought it an inspiration for the children to grow up with them.\nNow shall we go upstairs to the master bedroom? On the way you may want to take notice of the old-fashioned telephone in the hall.",

They always used the bed near the window so that if the baby were born in the daytime the light would be the best for the doctor. When you hold your baby in your arms for the first time and you think of all the things you can say and do to influence him its a tremendous responsibility. What you do with him and for him can influence not only him, but everyone he meets and not for a day or a month or a year but for time and eternity. Years later, when Jack was elected president, I thought how fortunate I was out of all the millions of mothers in the United States to be one to have her son inaugurated president on that cold, cold day. The pictures over the beds are copies of Italian paintings of the Madonna and Child I had seen and liked. My mother and father gave us Irish linen bedspreads, which were hand-embroidered with shamrocks, thistles and other Irish symbols and were great treasures. The photograph on Mr. Kennedys dresser is of his mother and father. On the far wall are the traditional six-month pictures of Joe Jr., Jack, Rosemary and Kathleen. Some people say that all babies look alike, but I can tell the difference even at that age. The nursery is just across the hall.",

The books were a favorite pastime. Probably Jacks favorite book was King Arthur and His Knights. I was very careful to select books which were recommended at school or by a children's bookshop. My children, however, were indifferent to these edifying selections, for one of Jacks book treasures was Billy Whiskers, a story about a goat, which my mother bought in a department store. The illustrations seemed to me to be crude and the colors harsh but the boys adored the stories and delighted in the whole series, pictures and all. The christening dress in the corner was given to me by my mother-in-law who had it made by the Franciscan nuns in East Boston where the family lived. All the children and John Jr., the presidents son, have worn this little dress. The little Irish bonnet, a gift, is profusely covered with shamrocks. The president was baptized at Saint Aidan's, the neighborhood church. Mothers were confined for three weeks then, and so the celebration was always a small, informal family gathering. I wanted the children christened as soon as possible so I was never present at the ceremony. There were more toys in here then of course. The president liked steam engines, teddy bears, and the usual boys toys, but especially books of adventure. You couldn't give a sick child a radio or television set then, to keep him occupied, because there were none in 1917. We spent a lot of time reading and entertaining the children here in this room, particularly when Jack had scarlet fever in 1920. The guest room and boudoir are down the hall.",

While they were small, the children had their meals at the table by the window. The silver napkin rings and the porringers were used by the president and his older brother and carry their monograms. We have been fortunate to have the same dining room table, buffet, serving table, and china cabinet through the years. When we moved from this house in 1921, we gave the furniture to friends of ours, the Robert Fishers. They kept it intact and gladly gave it back to be returned to the house. The china was also a gift from my sister-in-law, Margaret Kennedy Burke, who painted the gold border at Notre Dame Convent when she was a student. The children never knew which one would be called upon to say grace before meals, so they were all on their toes. On holidays I remember we would discuss the events which were being commemorated, such as the battle in Lexington and Concord on April 19th. On Sundays we would talk about the gospel at Mass. If they didn't pay attention one Sunday they would the next as they knew they would be questioned. We didn't do much formal entertaining here. We preferred to have informal dinners with a few friends. Cocktail parties were not customary in those days. A little wine or champagne was served at wedding and christenings.

On the way back we would usually stop for a visit at Saint Aidan's church. I wanted my children to realize that church was for every day and not just for Sunday. As you leave by the back door, imagine with me the laughter of these children as they played in the warm spring sun or built snowmen in the winter.

Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park was established in 1961 as a monument to the first Polynesian voyagers to cross Oceanic distances and make their home in this remote island world. Today our mission is to preserve unimpaired the cultural and historical heritage unique to this Hōnaunau region here on the island of Hawai’i. Throughout the region, many archeological sites paint a picture of life throughout 15th, 16th and 17th century Hawaiʻi.\n\nRealize that with your first steps onto the sands of the Royal Grounds, you are setting foot on what is revered by native Hawaiian’s as wahi kapu, a sacred place. These Royal Grounds encompass an area known as Kauwalomālie, a place traditionally reserved for the aliʻi or ruling chiefs and their guardians, stewards, and advisors. For the Makaʻāinana, who were the common folk, cultivators, and laborers, setting foot upon Royal Grounds was strictly forbidden. Indeed, casting so much as a shadow upon a wahi kapu such as Kauwalomālie was prohibited due to the law of the ʻaikapu – or kapu system. This system organized society and maintained a complex fabric of laws and responsibilities. Kapu were absolute, and so the penalty for breaking a kapu was severe and most often resulted in death for the offender.\n\nToday we are fortunate that these Royal Grounds can be made open for all to experience, while remembering the history and traditions that make this place a wahi kapu.",

In ancient Hawaiʻi there was no metal available, so native Hawaiians used their ingenuity and developed techniques for locking in cross beams while securely fastening together the setting of the house with cordage twisted from plant fibers such as pōhuehue or ʻieʻie.

It was not uncommon for wagering to accompany a game of kōnane, and at times the stakes could be incredibly steep, including rights to valued property such as canoes, and even land or water use privileges.\n\nKōnane is played on a flat surface called a papamū which is often smoothed out of stone or wood and sometimes set into the ground itself. On the surface of the papamū, small poho, or depressions, are made to hold alternating rows of black stone and white coral game pieces.

The intense heat and fire from the lava consumed the trees, leaving only hollow, circular impressions. If you look closely, you may notice the fine details of the surface of the tree within the mold.\n\nTree molds provide a unique snapshot in time, showing us what the landscape may have looked like in the past.

Today this wahi kapu remains an active place of worship.\n\nUnique to the island of Hawaiʻi, Hale o Keawe is one of two known examples of a hale poki or royal mausoleum. Hale o Keawe’s namesake chief reigned throughout the late 1600’s and early 1700’s and came to be celebrated for his prosperous and peaceful rule over the island of Hawai‘i. He is also a celebrated ancestor to many famous aliʻi including our first king, Kamehameha the Great. Today descendants of Keawe are known across the island chain, many of whom engage in leadership roles within their own communities. The legacy of Keawe’s dynasty was represented at Hale o Keawe by 23 prominent aliʻi who were laid to rest inside the mausoleum alongside its namesake. Today, the aliʻi i hala (or the royal dead) from within Hale o Keawe retire in their eternal slumber at Mauna ʻAla in the Nuʻuanu valley on the island of Oahu.\n\nAt one time suffering from deterioration, Hale o Keawe was restored and reconstructed in the 1960’s and continues to be maintained by the National Park Service and its native caretakers.\n\nAs your eyes fall upon the carved temple-images called kiʻi, remember that you are being offered an exclusive glimpse into a world once strictly reserved for those of the highest rank and that Hale o Keawe is still a wahi kapu where communities come to practice Ka Hoʻomana Kahiko or the cultivation of spirit. The kiʻi placed around the temple and throughout the grounds at Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau have been carved by the skilled hands of native craftsmen, and today a new generation of sculptors have taken up the ko‘i pāhoa, the carving-adze in an effort to retain this storied tradition.\n\nYou may notice hoʻokupu (offerings) left at the site, please refrain from entering past the gate or disturbing any offerings placed here.",

Therefore, we say a Puʻuhonua is a place of refuge, offering healing, peace, and enlightenment.\n\nDo you recall the system of law used in ancient Hawaiian civilization? The ʻAikapu – or kapu system – informed many aspects of society; most directly religion, government, and social conduct. Kapu, which shares linguistic roots with the word ‘taboo’, were considered absolute due to the manner in which these laws regard resources, or even systems of resources, necessary for collective health and abundance. For this reason, many kapu in old Hawaiʻi centered around the use and preservation of water, the maintenance of fisheries, and the authority of the aliʻi; who in turn carried the responsibility of maintaining and distributing these resources, as well as upholding all religious rites, rituals, and observations.\n\nBecause these kapu were considered sacred and upheld with the highest severity, the breaking of a kapu often resulted in death for the offender. If an individual condemned for violating a kapu could get within the bounds of a puʻuhonua, they would be spared this death sentence. After engaging in the holistic process of re-establishing themselves by the guidance of a kahuna pule (a priest) skilled in the healing arts, they could return to a community once more. During times of war, a pu’uhonua served as a safe haven for defeated warriors and those not able or eager to live by the spear.\n\nResearch has identified numerous sites across the islands that may have been used as puʻuhonua at one time or another, however this site at Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park is the most well-preserved. In our modern era, advances in science and academia have merged with cultural tradition, and the idea of pu‘uhonua has now become conceptualized around the contemporary needs of our communities. This has resulted in new pu‘uhonua becoming established in the islands once more.\n\nEngaging in cultural traditions and forms of knowledge is an important way to build healthy communities.

To this day, women of this quality are referred to demonstratively amongst native Hawaiian communities as Mana Wahine. Ka‘ahumanu was in fact a crucial player in the unification of the Hawaiian islands, in many ways the power behind the man who would come to be known as King Kamehameha the Great.\n\nFor the aliʻi of old, unions between men and women of status were not simply matters of love, with each paring often being arranged for political advantage.  Around the year 1794, when Kamehameha was still securing authority over the islands, a dispute between the two occurred when Kaʻiana – a prominent general in Kamehameha’s court – began displaying affection toward the young Ka‘ahumanu. It was not so much the idea of an affair that drove the passionate dispute, but rather the political consequences should Ka‘iana provide Ka‘ahumanu with a royal son, as a child of such a high rank could challenge the authority of Kamehameha himself.\n\nIn one telling of the story, Ka‘ahumanu, after abandoning her position at Kamehameha’s court, came to seek refuge here and reportedly hid behind this large stone for a time. Ka’iana, who once held a welcome position as a general and warrior-chief, would eventually defect, joining the O’ahu chiefs in defense against Kamehameha’s forces, only to fall in the fateful battle at Nu’uanu in 1795. And as history will tell, Ka‘ahumanu and Kamehameha did indeed reconcile, and their pairing would alas serve to unify the Kingdom of Hawaii in the year 1810.",

Lokoi’a function as enclosed, nutrient rich habitats for the farming of live fish such as ʻamaʻama and ʻawa. But remember, as is the case for all things kept within the Royal Grounds, the fish from these ponds were strictly reserved for the aliʻi.\n\nUnfortunatly, many of the fish populating Heleʻipalala today are invasive Tilapia—you may have noticed their circular nest structures. These fish were purposefully introduced decades ago for mosquito population control but are now considered an invasive species. Tilapia have a voracious appetite and easily out compete other species for food. These fish also create thick layers of sediment waste which is damagaing to partially enclosed ecosystems such as lokoiʻa. Their restoration is a priority for park scientists.\n\nOur partners at Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park outside of Kailua Kona maintain even larger, more impressive lokoiʻa along their shoreline. Places such as these are excellent examples of how traditional knowledge can offer insight into sustainable resource management.",

By the park’s stewardship, several traditional waʻa (canoes) have been fashioned or restored beneath the shade of this hālau, including the sailing-canoe Mauloa, which today has become a symbol of the revival of Polynesian Voyaging traditions.\n\nIn ancient Hawaiʻi, high levels of knowledge and skill in a specific craft such as carving, tool and implement making, and fine weaving and featherwork instilled high status and respect from one’s community. Practitioners kept the secrets of their craft closely guarded with strict protocols, not unlike the guilds or trade unions formed in many Western countries. Knowledge in crafts such as canoe making, dry-set masonry, weaving, and hula to name but a few, have been handed down from instructor to apprentice over countless generations.\n\nWhile advancements brought in by the industrial revolution of the last century have brought changes both fruitful and detrimental to this island world, we are thankful for the kupuna or respected elders who have dedicated their life’s work to the preservation of traditional knowledge and skill. With that in mind, these hālau continue to be places of learning and instruction, where today you may meet craftsmen preparing materials or working on their craft under the protective shelter of a pili grass roof.\n\nCultural demonstrators are an excellent source of knowledge and perspective, often learning and perfecting their craft over the entire course of their lives. Please engage respectfully with these priceless sources of manaʻo (thought) and ʻike (wisdom).",

This prairie is dominated by black-root sedge, and needle-and-thread grass, both cool season species which makes up about 80% of the groundcover. \n\nIf you look off to the west, beyond the Visitor Center you’ll see the geologic formation which led many emigrant travelers to renewed hope, Mitchell Pass.  It represented the completion of one-third of their total journey.  It also signified the end of the easy section, the level, monotonous great plains was completed and the difficult Rocky Mountains lay ahead.  The pass was continuously used beginning in 1851 as the main route through these bluffs.

                    "audioTranscript": "The creation of this land is millions of years in the making.   An ancient inland sea, referred to as the Cretaceous Sea, once covered this region and began to recede about 65 million years ago.  At the same time as the ancient sea’s recession major uplifting occurred creating the modern Rocky Mountains.  This uplifting would continue sporadically until recent geologic time.  The Rocky Mountains would supply much of the materials needed to create the Great Plains.  \n\nDeposits of sand and mud from wind and streams created the layers of sandstone and siltstone you see at the base of the bluffs.  Wind deposits of volcanic ash are seen represented in layers further up the bluff in contrasting colors.   Supersaturated groundwater rich in lime formed the limestone layers near the top of the bluff; these limestone deposits are often referred to as pipey concretions and act as a hard cap rock for the softer sand and siltstone below it.  We will have a close look at these various layers as we move along the trail.  \n\nBefore we move on take a look at the groundwater spring next to the trail, did you notice there is a lot more vegetation here than across the prairie?  Scotts Spring is the only natural spring within the Monument and provides much coveted water to animals and plant life alike.  \n\nThis spring represents a connection to the ancient past through water related geologic deposition and erosion.  It also represents a connection with the not so distant past of the emigrant traveler.  The spring was first recorded in pioneer diaries as a place to find clear drinking water as compared to the often muddy water of the North Platte River.  Many families would use the Scotts Bluff area as an overnight location and were very thankful for clear-clean drinking water.  \n\nAs you move towards stop number four you’ll notice that you are beginning to climb the fanned base of the bluff.  Take your time and watch as the sandstone and siltstone base begins to change slightly as you climb in elevation.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Go ahead and stop here before walking through the tunnel.  If you look to the left of the tunnel along the rock face you will see what is called “breakdown”.  This is a good example of the effects erosional forces have on the sand and siltstone which makes up the majority of the bluff.  Wind and water have over time sliced away a portion of the rock that was connecting this to the rest of the bluff.  Erosion of the bluff occurs slowly and is usually unseen by humans.  Wind, rain, and snow wears the bluff away.  It slowly washes away grains and particles of sand, silt and ash.  Most of the rock slides that occur in the park happen within this the Brule Formation.  The Brule Formation is large and makes up one third of the exposed rock of the bluffs.  \n\nNow look above the tunnel entrance.  Do you notice the thick band of volcanic ash?  It’s a whitish color on top and a brownish color on the bottom.  This layer is several feet thick in some places.  Between 28 to 32 million years ago, massive volcanic eruptions occurred in mountain ranges west of here, some as far away as present day Nevada.   Ash from these eruptions was carried eastward by winds.  It then fell as ashfall on what would one day be western Nebraska.  \n\nGo ahead and walk through the tunnel.  Try to imagine what it would have been like for the young men who built this trail and hand dug this tunnel.  Yep, I said hand dug.  The rock formations here are so fragile and so easily eroded that the decision was made to have the walking trail tunnel hand dug rather than dynamited.",

As you move further up the trail you will begin to see more changes in the rock types that you are seeing.  \n\nLook out at Saddle Rock; it’s a different perspective from up here.  Did you notice the breakdown in front of you?  Now turn around and look at the rock face.  It almost appears as if the sandstone was sheared off of the rock face.  In October of 2000 there was a major rock slide which resulted in a 1,200 ton block of sandstone sloughing off onto the Saddle Rock Trail.  \n\nUltimately the massive rock had to be broken down to smaller manageable sized boulders; this was accomplished by the use of dynamite the following May.  Several small charges were set to minimize the impact on the surrounding resources.  The blasting left the park with a 2,000 ton pile of debris.    The trail remained closed for nearly a year due to the slide.  \n\nAs you continue up the trail from here you will begin to notice a great deal of gray colored rock protruding from the cliff side.   Go ahead and reach out and touch some of it.  Now compare that feeling to the sandstone that it surrounds.  It’s much harder isn’t it?  These are limestone concretions.  Sometimes the concretions are referred to as pipey concretions indicating the way in which they were deposited.  The pipey concretions have not formed in one continuous layer but rather are found in different shapes and sizes.  Another name for the limestone is cap rock.  This refers to location of the deposition, near the top of the bluffs…capping it off.  The cap rock acts as a protective layer for the bottom portions of the bluff; much like the roof protects your house.  Since it is much harder it can withstand weathering a longer than the sand and siltstone below.  \n\nContinue walking, you are nearing the top of the bluff.  At the top you will be able to dial in for stop number six; your final stop along this tour.",

You are 800’ above the river from here and 435 feet above the Visitor Center.  Geologists believe that the top of the bluffs is approximately 22 million years old.  At the base of bluffs is where you would find the oldest exposed formations, dating back 33 million years.  Historically speaking the bluffs are very old, but in geologic time the bluffs are relatively young.  About 4 to 5 million years ago the rate of erosion exceeded that of sediment deposition leaving behind the landscape we know as the Great Plains today.   \n\nThe geology of Scotts Bluff is significant for scientific and historic reasons. Emigrants typically traveled along the Platte River Valley using both sides of the river.  At Scotts Bluff the geology of the badlands forced the emigrants out of the valley. The badlands presented a barrier to travel because they stretched from the base of the bluff to the river.  The bluff formations forced the travelers to look for a pass to allow them to move through the bluffs and continue on their westward journey.  To see the badlands and what the emigrants were trying to avoid, walk out to the North Over which adjoins with this trail.   \n\nThese bluffs hold the secrets of time and have witnessed the vast travels of man.  The bluffs are now witnessing your journey and the journey of all the visitors who come to this National Monument.

The main house consists of twenty-three rooms, which had grounds to the west and south maintained with lawns and ornamental plantings which compliment the sweeping views and approach of the driveway. To the rear of the house is the servants’ area, a drying yard for laundry, the ice house, and the back porch, where servants would work in warm weather and deliveries would be received. Beyond a screening hedge was a large stable building attached to a lodge where the male servants lived. As one moves away from the house toward the east, the character of the landscape changes to farmland. Under the windmill was a cornfield. What is today a parking lot, was pasture and grain fields. There was a cow barn and other smaller structures used for storage of equipment. There were work areas and outhouses. To the north of the barn and east of the stables were the gardens. Much of the food eaten at Sagamore Hill was grown here. Besides food, the garden also provided a multitude of flowers, which decorated the home. Beyond the farm and through the pasture is the apple orchard, which predates Theodore Roosevelt’s ownership of the property. As one moves down the hill towards Cold Spring Harbor, the cultured landscape gives way to forest, then to a salt marsh which merges with the bay.",

The Queen Anne or shingle style house has 23 rooms and sits atop the highest point on Cove Neck, affording the family a view of Oyster Bay harbor to the west (which today is blocked by trees across the road). Roosevelt was most concerned with comfort and function rather than style or grandeur when planning the house and wanted a large \"piazza\" or porch facing the water, a library and parlor, plenty of bedrooms for family and guests, and large fireplaces. The rooms of the home are filled with mementos of Roosevelt’s many hunting trips, gifts from around the world, and reminders of his major accomplishments as a soldier and statesman.",

                    "audioTranscript": "As you approach the house you are looking at the back of it. Architecturally, the house is an example of a shingle-style, Queen Anne design. The first floor is brick, with the upper floors covered in patterned wood shingles. TR contracted the architects, Lamb and Rich, to design his house. He sketched out the desired arrangement of rooms on the first floor and emphasized the large porch and a multitude of fireplaces. There were few changes made to the house over the years. The most dramatic change was the 1905 addition of the north room. This allowed TR to better accommodate the large groups that came to Sagamore Hill to meet with him. The iron pipes that frame the exterior of the room were used as trellis for wisteria, a climbing vine with fragrant purple flowers. This same vine covered the porte cochére at the front of the house. The front of the house is the most detailed and attractive side. Notice the colored glass panels over the windows and front door. The large terra cotta sunflower medallions are symbolic of happiness. Similar medallions appear on fireplaces inside the house. Notice the elk antlers at the peak of the house. This is TR’s own embellishment. In warm weather the porch, or “piazza” as the family called it, was used as a sitting area and dinner was sometimes served there. TR could often be found sitting in a rocking chair reading or engaged in conversation with visitors. Alice remembered that her father would sometimes rock so vigorously that he would move dangerously close to the edge of the porch. The arrangement of the piazza was changed once the north room was added. A stair was removed from the west side and the deck was extended. The rail was not replaced so that TR had a ready-made platform for addressing the groups that came to see him. It was on the piazza where he formally excepted the nomination for governor of New York State, and vice-president and president of the United States. Groups that came to hear him speak ranged from boy scouts to college students, from suffragettes, to the citizens of Nassau county.",

Theodore Roosevelt himself was an avid sportsman and led an active life.  As a young boy, his father once told him, “Theodore, you have the mind but not the body” and encouraged him to regularly exercise in order to build up his strength as a way to overcome his asthma. While at Harvard, Theodore Roosevelt, with the help of his friends, learned how to play tennis.  He admitted that although he was not very good at the game, he enjoyed the competitive nature of the sport.  As president, he insisted that no photographs be taken of him while playing tennis because he thought the game was an elitist sport played by the wealthy. The Roosevelt family had their own special rules for the game of tennis.  The boundary lines were what the family decided that day.  As you look at the area where the tennis court once was, you will notice that it’s a very wooded area.  If the ball hit a branch of a tree, it was still considered in play.  The Roosevelt’s tennis court was not smooth by today’s standards, and the ball would often go in various directions; not necessarily in the direction the player wanted it to go.  The Roosevelt children also enjoyed the game of tennis.  Ted Jr., the oldest son, even went on to play tennis competitively at Harvard.  The family’s tennis racquets were kept in the home’s entrance hall fireplace and the tennis balls were kept in two jars above the mantle.  The children would grab as many balls as they could fit into their pockets because many a ball went off into the woods, never to be found again.  They would frequently drag their father down to the court to play with them as often as they could. While living in Washington DC, Theodore Roosevelt would always try to get a couple of hours of daily exercise which might include a match of tennis with friends.  Many of the friends TR would play with at the White House were cabinet members, and became known as the “Tennis Cabinet.”",

The Roosevelt family had a wide variety of pets while living here at Sagamore hill. They ranged from dogs, horses, rabbits, guinea pigs and chickens, to a badger named Josiah, a bear cub named Jonathan Edwards and oldest daughter Alice’s green snake, known to the family as “Emily Spinach.” Adjacent to the arbor is a large stone inscribed with the names of special pets who are buried here. Of particular note is Jack, a Chesapeake Bay Terrier who was Edith Roosevelt’s favorite dog.  While living in Washington DC, Jack was tragically killed by a passing vehicle and was buried at the White House. At the end of TR’s presidency, Edith requested that Jack’s remains be returned here to Sagamore Hill where he was reburied along with other household pets. Also buried here is “Little Texas”, the horse that Theodore Roosevelt rode during the Spanish American war along with the Rough Riders. The total number of pets buried here is unknown, but the really special ones, usually the horses and dogs, received a full funeral precession, complete with a cart. All of the children would dress in their Sunday best, and say prayers for their dearly departed pets.  The smaller animals would be given private burials by the individual child who cared for the pet.  As Ted Junior once said in a letter: “One of Kermit’s guinea pigs died last night and he buried him in the pet cemetery this morning. It was a private affair.”",

It was simply rows of vegetables and berries used for the table, and flowers which provided decoration in the home. The crabapple trees and the boxwood shrub are historic. The boxwood was grown from a cutting that TR brought home from Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace. One reminder of the garden, is the gardener’s shed, located on the edge of the property. This was used to store tools, seeds, and everything else needed by the gardener. The building was also used to store firewood. There was an area of the garden set aside for children called “the baby’s walk.” Each child had a small plot where he or she learned to grow their favorite vegetables. TR’s wife Edith enjoyed flowers and there were roses and other cut flowers throughout the house. She liked to have floral centerpieces for the dining room table. Her husband did not. He would say, “I married you for your looks and I cannot see you through this mass of foliage.” The flowers came in many varieties, including bell flowers, sunflowers, larkspur, and cabbage roses. The garden provided most of the vegetables for the kitchen. Fruits cultivated included plums, peaches, gooseberries, cherries, a variety of grapes, strawberries, and raspberries. The garden produced corn, asparagus, cantaloupes, and watermelon. The berries were a favorite of the children and although they were not allowed to gorge freely, the temptation was sometimes too much. One of the gardeners was a man named Davis. He lived in the lodge, adjacent to the garden. When the children overstepped the boundaries of the garden, he would holler at them, “Leave it be!” After many such incidents, the admonishment became his nickname: “Old Leave-it-be.”",

The Georgian-style house was designed by Baltimore architect William G. McMillan Jr. “It had always been the family plan for Ted to inherit Sagamore Hill,” recalled Mrs. Roosevelt. “By 1937, we’d been married for 27 years and we were tired of living here and there.” The elegant home was filled with mementos of world travel, including Chinese furniture collected by Eleanor in the 1920s. Also prominent were reminders of Ted’s service in the infantry during the Great War and his varied public career. A successful soldier and leader, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt participated at the allied offensive at the Somme in 1918. He received the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Croix de Guerre for his valor. As the war wound down, he and other like-minded American soldiers formed the American Legion to carry forward the camaraderie and the spirit of the doughboys in civilian life. After the war, Ted launched his public career in 1919 as a member of the New York State Assembly. His career included the position of Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Governor of Puerto Rico, and Governor General of the Philippines. He wrote books about his experiences in the Great War, his expedition to China, and his family life. In addition to his stock investments, Ted worked as a publisher and as a chairman of the board of the American Express Company. A seasoned combat veteran, General Roosevelt played a critical role on Utah Beach during the D-Day invasion. Due to an unexpected current and the confusion of battle, the first troops ashore were landed nearly a mile away from the planned landing zone. By making the spot decision, “We’ll start the war from here!” and improvising the orders for all successive landing waves, Roosevelt made order from chaos. On July 12, 1944, Ted Jr. died of heart failure during the allied drive across France. He was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. A year before his death, Ted wrote home to Eleanor on the occasion of their wedding anniversary: “Nothing has happened as we imagined it would except our children. We never thought we’d roam the world. We never thought our occupations and interests would cover such a range. We never thought that our 33rd anniversary would find us deep in our second war and me again at the front. Well darling, we’ve lived up to the most.” Eleanor Roosevelt continued to live at Old Orchard until her death in May 1960.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The nature trail of Sagamore Hill was one of several paths used by the Roosevelts and was linked to an informal network of bridle paths that covered the north shore of Long Island. Paths such as this one would have been used by the Roosevelt family to access the beach at Cold Spring Harbor. The most important feature of this area for Theodore Roosevelt was the abundant wildlife, especially the birds. As a young man, his family rented a summer house approximately halfway between Cove Neck and the village of Oyster Bay. Always fascinated by the natural world, Theodore Roosevelt would often hunt birds and add the specimens to his extensive collection. Another reason that the young Theodore Roosevelt was attracted to Cove Neck was that it provided an abundance of opportunity for outdoor recreation, such as hiking, swimming, rowing, horseback riding, and chopping wood. These activities quickly became an important part of the young Theodore Roosevelt’s life. Aside from the disappearance of chestnut trees, the forest that surrounds the nature trail has been relatively undisturbed since Theodore Roosevelt’s time here at Sagamore Hill. The existing forest consists of larger tulip, oak, and hickory trees, while the smaller subcanopy trees are mostly sassafras, beech, dogwood, spicebush, and a variety of viburnum shrubs. About three-quarters of the way down the hill, you will encounter a small kettle pond, which is a geological feature associated with the glacial retreat that formed Long Island about 15,000 years ago. As the glacial ice receded, kettle-shaped depressions were left on the surface of the land. Theodore Roosevelt himself referred to this pond as “Heron Pond” because of the Night Herons that nested here. Used by many species of frogs and salamanders for breeding, there are no fish in this pond. On hot days however, keep an eye out for box turtles which may be wallowing in the mud.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The beach area at Sagamore Hill is protected by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Eel Creek salt marsh is a perfect example of the tidal marshes that were once a common feature of the Long Island coastline. At high tide the marsh fills with salt water, which then drains back into the harbor as the tide recedes. Many species of fish and mollusks utilize this salt marsh for spawning, as it will protect their young from predators. The tall grass is known as cordgrass, or spartina alterniflora, and is typical of local salt marshes. The roots of this tall grass will hold the fine sediment in place providing a valuable ecological service that helps prevent erosion. The beach is on the western shore of Cold Spring Harbor. To the north is the mouth of Oyster Bay Harbor which feeds into the Long Island Sound towards Connecticut. It is common to see gulls and kingfishers in all seasons, and in the summer you may see osprey, herons, and cormorants, while in the winter, rafts of ducks, loons, and the occasion snowy owl may be spotted. The only structures that the Roosevelts maintained on the beach were a footbridge over the salt marsh, a small shack for changing into swimming attire, and a shed for storing rowboats. There was also a swimming float anchored just offshore.",

They spend several months every summer and fall in our waters, so the health of the salmon population is critical to their survival and recovery. \n\n Southern Residents' mouth structure has evolved differently than other killer whales to facilitate salmon hunting; unlike Biggs Killer Whales, they do not hunt for or eat seals or sea lions. Their salmon consumption is so immense that scientists believe that killer whales consume more salmon than seals, sea lions, and commercial fisheries. While salmon populations have increased moderately in the past 50 years, the health of Southern Residents is a major factor that regulates the legal limit for salmon fishing in our island.",

Mama kissed me and her eyes had tears after dinner one noon when I walked out of the house with my hands free, no bag or bundle, wearing a black-sateen shirt, coat, vest, and pants, a slouch hat, good shoes and socks, no underwear, in my pockets a small bar of soap, a razor, a comb, a pocket mirror, two handkerchiefs, a piece of string, needles and thread, a Waterbury watch, a knife, a pipe and a sack of tobacco, three dollars and twenty-five cents in cash. A little west of the Santa Fe station stood a freight train. A conductor came out of the station and waved a yellow flimsy in his hand. As the train started I ran along and jumped into a boxcar. From then on I stood at the open side door, watched the running miles of young corn, reading such station names as Cameron and Stronghurst, names of villages and towns I had heard a thousand times and had never had sight of.",

He later remembered seeing the Mississippi River for the first time as one of the most awe-inspring sites on his whole journey. Crossing the long bridge over the Mississippi my eyes swept over it with a sharp hunger that the grand old river satisfied. A captain of a small steamboat offered the young Sandburg passage to Keokuk for work \"shouldering kegs of nails to the wharves.\" It was in Keokuk that Sandburg met his first fellow hobo. This man was a \"tramp,\" which meant he didn't work for money, but instead relied on the kindness of strangers to survive. He taught Sandburg that a \"lump\" meant food that was given as a handout, and \"sit down\" was a phrase used when someone would invite a tramp to the kitchen table to eat. Sandburg also found work in Keokuk that would provide some extra cash and meals. He spent a day going door-to-door with a can of asphaltum for blackening rusty stoves, and then: I saw a sign “Waiter Wanted” in a small lunch counter near the end of Main Street. He said I could make myself useful at 50 cents a day and meals. After a day working at the lunch counter, Sandburg slept that night in a boxcar that took him halfway across Missouri.",

He writes: My Irish boss, Fay Connors, hired me at a dollar and twenty-five cents a day and I was to pay him three dollars a week for board and room in his four-room one-story house thirty feet from the railroad tracks. I tamped ties several days from seven till noon, from one till six in the evening. On Sunday I washed my shirt and socks. At the end of two weeks, on a Sunday morning, I hopped a freight for Kansas City and left Boss Connors to collect for my board and room out of my paycheck. The rest of the pay was still owing and was never collected. If Connors did get it he couldn’t have sent it to me, as he didn’t know my address and I wasn’t expecting to have any address for weeks or months.",

It never went as low as a dollar and twenty-five cents a week nor a high as a dollar and seventy-five cents a week... The hotel was leased and run by a fancily dressed tall man who slid and slunk rather than walked around the place. He was known as Wink Taylor... At the end of the first week I didn't get my standard pay of a dollar and fifty cents nor likewise at the end of the second week. Then came the word that the Hotel Mercer was closed, gone, up the spout, foreclosed, and Wink Taylor vanished. In his writings about Omaha, Carl Sandburg reflected that during his travels he had considered joining the Army multiple times. He remembered walking past the recruiting offices in Kansas City, Denver, and Omaha, but each time he neglected to go inside. Sandburg would eventually go on to join and serve during the Spanish-American War.",

After punching Sandburg twice in the face the shack left him to ride the train.

An energetic visionary, Lamy started a school for girls in 1853; a school for boys in 1858; and a hospital and orphanage in 1865. About 2,000 people viewed the statue’s 1915 unveiling.",

I will be guiding you through the tour road with one of the Park Historians. \nAuthentic music of the Revolutionary War period will fill the spaces between points of interest. If you wish to remain at a tour stop for any length of time, feel free to do so, just turn off the tape until you are ready to proceed on to the tour road again. I will be giving you reminders along the way. Please proceed onto the tour road.\n\nThe Tour Road is a one-way closed loop for 9 miles. Once you get on you must continue to the end. There will be 10 stops of places of interest along the way. You may want to leave your car at these stops and walk the paths to the various wayside exhibits. Most of these contain audio with character voices explaining the significance of the area, along with maps and painting depicting the actions that took place there during the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. Should time, fatigue, or any disability limit you from getting out at any of these stops, this tape will point out important landmarks and describe the actions in each area well enough to make your tour meaningful. \nThe Park encompasses approximately 4 square miles and includes British and American Headquarters, camps, and the scenes of major fighting. The National Park Service has been managing the ground cover so that in most areas you will see woods in the forested places of October 1777, and clearings in those areas that were either cultivated fields or cut by the armies. As you pull into one of the parking spaces at Stop 1, you will be facing east. \n(Narrator)\nJust around the barrier of trees in front of you is an overlook for the Freeman Farm, the scene of the battle fought here on September 19, 1777. After the battle, the British remained on the field erecting fortifications and widening the clearings to their present size. Three weeks later, fighting would again sweep across these fields. The story will unfold in more detail as we move along the tour. \n(Guide)\nBenches, wayside exhibits, and maps are at the overlook. Many visitors choose to sit and reflect on the events of long ago, with the help of the exhibits. If you choose to do so, turn off the tape until you reach the overlook if not, let the tape continue.",

To your left, 8 miles up the river, is Saratoga, and the working estate of General Philip Schuyler. It’s Schuylerville today. \n\nFrom this direction, advancing from the north, is General John Burgoyne, in command of 7000 British, German, Canadian, and Tory soldiers, and their camp followers. The artillery train consisted of 41 guns and mortars of various calibers. \n\nHis advance from the north, down the Richelieu River, Lake Champlain, to Skenesboro, through Fort Ann and down the Hudson River, was part of Burgoyne’s grand strategy. The plan called for the advance of two armies from Montreal to New York to effect a juncture at Albany. Such a move would establish a chain of strongpoints from the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic, isolating New England, the stronghold of the rebellion, from the rest of the colonies. \n\nAs the main army advanced towards Crown Point and Ticonderoga, Colonel Barry St. Leger would lead an additional force of 1000 Loyalists, Regulars, and Indians down the St. Lawrence and through the Great Lakes to provide a diversion on the Mohawk River. \n\nTo your right is Bemis Heights, occupied by the Continental Army, 7000 strong under Major General Horatio Gates. General Gates took over command of the Northern Department of the American Army on August 19th. By early September, he had matured a strategy for defeating General Burgoyne. \n\nThe army had moved northward to the heights behind Jotham Bemis’s tavern, where a bend in the river forced the road to Albany against the base of the hills. Here, under the direction of the 31 year old Polish engineer, Colonel Taddeusz Kosciuszko, the Americans built entrenchments that blocked the road and fortified the bluffs. The main line of entrenchments stretched from a ravine behind the bluff to the John Neilson farm on the crest of the heights, then southwest for ¾ of a mile. \n\nTwenty two cannon were placed at strategic points. Pickets manned outposts north of the camp. Reinforcements arrived daily. The army would more than double in size over the next few weeks. The Americans were ready. The next step was up to Burgoyne. \n\nAs you leave the parking lot, make note of the ground cover and terrain along the sides of the tour road. The park lands today are managed according to a historic base map, and closely resemble their appearance of October 8th, 1777, the day after the Second Battle.",

The white posts with blue tops indicate the outline of the American fortifications erected in the fall of 1777.\n\nLooking up the ridge in front of you, imagine walls made of horizontal logs with earth packed against the outside, where you see the white stakes. Down the slope, about where we are parked, would have been an abatis of felled trees with their branches sharpened to form a kind of 18th-century barbed wire.\n\nThis was the left or western-most flank of the American camp on Bemis Heights. It was this flank, obscured by the heavy forest, that was General Burgoyne’s objective on both September 19th and October 7th, 1777. \n\nBurgoyne hoped that by moving inland from the river road, he could avoid the strong American works that would have made further movement down the river a bloody endeavor. It would be better, he determined, to sweep around the American left and on to Albany with little resistance. The heavy forest you have driven through and effective American patrols prevented any reconnaissance of this area by Burgoyne’s scouts. \n\nOn September 19th, 1777, the men who were encamped here advanced to intercept the British and their German allies, in the clearing 1 miles north of these works, at Freeman’s Farm. \n\nFrom the parking lot, looking up at the ridge, you can see the small red farmhouse of young John and Lydia Neilson, who established this farm in 1777. During the time of the battles, John, a sergeant in the local regiment of militia, was engaged in moving various officers’ baggage with a cart and a team of oxen. He had moved Lydia somewhere south of Stillwater to be out of harm’s way.\n\nThe house survived because of its occupation by Generals Benedict Arnold and Enoch Poor. It served as bedroom, dining room, and office for the generals, and that is how it is furnished today, with the personal effects of officers in the field.\n\nThe Neilsons returned after the battles and returned the land to farming, successfully raising 8 children here. Some of their descendants still live in the area. \n\nYou might enjoy a walk up the path, which is furnished, and opened most days in the summer. Wayside exhibits at the top give an idea of the layout of the American camp. On days the house is open, it is staffed by a park ranger who will be glad to explain, in depth, the people and the events that made this area significant. The rangers here are sometimes outfitted as Army of the United States soldiers and are pleased to explain what they can of the soldiers’ experience. \n\nThe furnishings of the Neilson House make an interesting contrast with those of the modern military headquarters. Officers tried to maintain a semblance of the lifestyle to which they were accustomed, and brought with them camp chests filled with the decanters and wine glasses that are seen on the tables. The cumbersome camp cots or rope beds can be seen in place of their more practical counterparts. The crudely drawn map on the table is a replica of one drawn by Colonel Rufus Putnam of the 5th Massachusetts Regiment while here in Saratoga. No elaborate communications devices can be seen. In their place is the duty drummer at the front door who would beat the proper commands when necessary.\n\nThis ridge was the scene of hectic activity during September and October 1777. More than 1200 men of General Poor’s brigade, consisting of 3 New Hampshire regiments, and 2 from New York, were encamped just south of the Neilson House, to your right. A few hundred yards further along this ridge to the south stood the headquarters of Major General Horatio Gates, the house belonging to Captain Ephraim Woodworth of the local militia. His barns housed the American field hospital.\n\nJust north of the Neilson House, in the apex of the American lines, was the camp of Colonel Daniel Morgan’s rifle corps, with the light infantry of Major Henry Dearborn. They would be the first to sally forth to meet the approaching enemy.\n\nThe granite monument at the head of the parking lot commemorates the services of Colonel Taddeusz Kosciuszko, the young Polish engineer who laid out the American line. The stone obelisk west of the parking lot is a memorial to the American dead, placed here by the Daughters of the American Revolution.",

These bluffs provide a fairly sheer drop of over 100 feet to the narrow flood plain and the river bed below. Earthworks on the plain below would block any movement south along the river or the road. \n\nThese works were manned by the Massachusetts troops of General John Glover’s brigade. Glover’s men were the most recent reinforcements to the American army, and were some of the steadiest veterans. \n\nFortifications and artillery placed on the heights, where you are now, protected the works below, and were in turn protected by works on another height just to the south. British scouts could see this formidable interlocking system, and persuaded General Burgoyne that testing them would be folly. \n\nThis is where Kosciuszko’s skill as a military engineer was first appreciated. This part of the American lines on top of the bluff was occupied by the Massachusetts men of General John Nixon’s brigade, and detachments of Major Ebenezer Stevens’ artillery. Stevens’ men manned a hodgepodge of 22 artillery pieces of varying sizes, both iron and bronze, and spread out all along the American works. \n\nYou may wish to leave your car and walk up to the gun platforms, in order to see the ground below from the point of view of the American gunners. The wayside exhibits will explain the layout of the American river fortifications in greater detail, with some artists’ concepts of what they may have looked like. The path leading to the south redan is about 200 yards long, with further exhibits about the fortifications.",

They played a supportive role in the action that occurred here. The monument was placed here by the Sons of the American Revolution. \n\nA short walk up the path to the wayside exhibit provides an excellent view of this farm field where critical fighting occurred. The exhibits have paintings which depict the fighting here. If you would like to walk up to the exhibit, please turn off you tape recorder now and turn it on again when you get to the stone circle if not, let the tape continue\n\nIn front of this small rise is a small field bisected by a road running east and west. The northern half of the field was ringed with a worm fence, and contained a small farmhouse, which the Germans referred to as the Weiser House. The southern part of the field was planted with corn, referred to by some Europeans as “Turkish wheat.” Further west was a small strip of brushy woods; then, another field can be seen. \n\nOn October 7th, General Burgoyne ordered a reconnaissance in force to probe the American position from the high ground west of the Neilson Farm. If conditions proved favorable, he would launch an all-out attack on the 8th. If not, he would retreat, and try to save his army. It was a gamble, but Burgoyne was proud, brave, and an old gamester. \n\nThe probing force was carefully chosen for mobility and shock power. From General Simon Fraser’s advanced corps came the British grenadiers and Light Infantry, Burgoyne’s elite units, and the 24th Regiment. Also, from the advanced corps came the German jaegers, chausseurs and grenadiers, men who would have been the pride of any European army. Men from the Hannau, Rhetz, von Riedesel, and Specht regiments were drafted from the German General Baron Frederick Adolph von Riedesel’s division. Brigadier General Hamilton’s division contributed men from the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd British Regiments. Ten cannons served by 107 artillerymen accompanied the column. \nOver 1700 officers and men, including General Burgoyne himself, marched out of the camp, leaving the remaining forces to man the fortifications and await the outcome of the probing action. When the advanced guard reached a point west of the Barber Farm, the column halted. While officers tried to scan the American works through the telescopes from the cabin’s roof and soldiers foraged for grain in the abandoned fields, the British forces dressed into lines behind the worm fence. \nThe British front, which extended from the woods west of the Barber Farm to the southern fringe of the Freeman Farm was mostly open, but the flanks rested in the woods. James Wilkinson, the American Deputy Adjutant General, reported the British position to General Gates saying, “They are foraging and endeavoring to reconnoiter your left, and I think, sir, they offer you battle.” \nGates asked, “What is the nature of the ground, and what’s your opinion?” Wilkinson replied, “Their front is open and their flanks rest on woods under cover of which they might be attacked. Their right is skirted by a lofty height. I would indulge them.” “Well then, order on Morgan to begin the game,” Gates answered. \nThe American attack opened between 2:30 and 3:30 PM. Colonel Morgan’s corps of riflemen and light infantry under Major Henry Dearborn struck the British right, composed of General Fraser’s light infantry and the 24th Regiment. \n(Drum beats and battlefield noises in the background)\nGeneral Enoch Poor’s brigade of New Hampshire men and New Yorkers moved up through the brushy woods behind him and attacked the British grenadiers and the units of General Hamilton’s division. \n\nGeneral Ebenezer Learned’s target was the Germans in the center of the column. Learned’s brigade was soon supported by Brigadier General Ten Broeck’s brigade of Albany militia and a regiment from Jonathan Warner’s brigade of Massachusetts militia.\n\nGeneral Poor’s men soon overwhelmed the greatly outnumbered British grenadiers whose commander, Major John Dyke Acland, fell badly wounded. Burgoyne’s aide, Lieutenant Sir Francis Clerke, was mortally wounded while trying to pass his general’s orders to retreat.\nCaptain George Pausch of the German artillery, while directing the service of his two 6-pound cannons in a desperate attempt to hold back the American onslaught with canister shot, as if they were two large shotguns, suddenly noticed that his supporting infantry had been driven off. After a gallant scuffle to save his guns, he and his artillerymen were forced to abandon them. \nGeneral Fraser’s veterans began to fall before the deadly accuracy of Morgan’s Pennsylvania and Virginia riflemen, who fired from the woods west of the Barber Farm. As the British right was rolled back, General",

                    "audioTranscript": "Long before it was known for its horse racing or spring waters, Saratoga gained international fame because of the extraordinary surrender of a British Army—an occurrence which had never happened before in the history of the world. There are many stories associated with this Revolutionary surrender, and a romanticized version of the event is visually preserved in John Trumbull’s monumental painting, Surrender of General Burgoyne, which hangs in the Rotunda of the United States Capital. Of the tens of thousands of eyewitnesses who saw the surrender take place, many recorded the day’s events in journals and letters, and by piecing these sources together, we are left with a narrative of the day’s events. Late in the morning of October 17, 1777, British General John Burgoyne and his staff left their camp, located in the present-day villages of Schuylerville and Victory, and rode south to meet their American conquerors. Because the bridge crossing Fish Creek was destroyed, they had to ford the stream near its outlet at the Hudson River. As they travelled past the charred remains of Philip Schuyler’s country plantation, General Horatio Gates and his military family left their headquarters, located about 1¼ miles south of here, and rode fast in order to intercept the British General. Both parties met on the road about ½ mile north of here, near the Dutch Reformed Church. According to a Continental soldier, Burgoyne then “came up to General Gates with his hat off to shake hands & then took the Left hand of General Gates.” While many stories tell us what supposedly passed between the two commanders upon meeting each other, only one observer, a Continental Army chaplain, wrote it down on the day it happened. Burgoyne went first, saying “The fate of war has put me into your hands,” to which Gates replied, “If enterprise, courage, and perseverance could have given you success, the victory would have been yours.” The entire party then retired here, to this very hill, for dinner, under the cover of awnings set up for the occasion. If you ever wondered what it was that the victors and vanquished ate that afternoon, one anonymous British officer wrote that the feast consisted of “a ham, a goose, some beef, and a boiled mutton. The liquor was New England rum, mixed with rum, without sugar.” Whilst dining, Gates “filled a bumper, and, in the most polite and liberal manner, drank to his Britannic Majesty’s health. General Burgoyne would not be outdone in politeness: he filled a bumper, and drank General Washington’s health.” In total, the American Northern Army was an impressive 17,000-man force, including United States Continental Army officers and soldiers from Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and even Canada. However, a majority of American military men present were from state militias drawn from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and New York. Even Vermont—a newly-declared independent republic, and not part of the United States—provided militia troops in order help bring Burgoyne to heel. These troops lined up on both sides of the road upon which the beaten enemy was to march. Burgoyne’s trounced troops marched out of their entrenchments and surrendered their weapons at a place now known as the Field of Grounded Arms. At about 3:00pm, the entire force of nearly 7,000 officers, soldiers, and women and children marched off. The British were in the lead, followed by the Germans from the Duchy of Braunschweig and the County of Hessen-Hanau, as well as the dwindled numbers of remaining American Royalists and French Canadiens—American Indian and First Nations people had all departed before the surrender. In the rear were hundreds of followers, mostly bare-footed women and children, some of the youngest having been “ty’d on horses & some in knapsacks & others in baskets on the women’s backs.” The long, snaking column forded Fish Creek and from there, advanced upon the road flanked by their conquerors. According to one surprised German officer, Gates’s troops “stood straight and in orderly lines…there was absolute silence in those regiments as can only be demanded from the best disciplined troops. Not a single man gave any evidence or the slightest impression of feeling hatered, mockery, malicious pleasure or pride for our miserable fate. Their modesty rather filled us with amazement.” Thankfully, we do not have to wonder what music the Americans played during this monumental occasion; many mentioned that the fifes and drums struck up the tune Yankee Doodle, and one American soldier quipped that it was “very Sutable for the times”. As the British forces marched past this very hill, Gates and Burgoyne rose to observe the unprecedented procession. It was then, and not upon their initial meeting as is usually believed, that “General Burgoin delivered up his sword to General Gates who gave it back to him as a present.”",

Horrified spectators witnessed the drowning of passengers and crew, helpless to do anything. In the same waves that smashed hulls and took lives of the unsuspecting, some heard a call to action. In 1890, the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) established a station at Point Reyes with a keeper and a crew of seven surfmen on a lonely stretch of the Point Reyes Beach, which was notorious for its pounding surf and bad weather. The surfmen patrolled the beaches of Point Reyes with an ever-vigilant eye, looking for shipwrecks and their desperate crews. They walked the beaches day and night, with the fog chilling them to the bone and the wind blasting sand at the unprotected skin of their faces. The surfmen's positions were poorly paid, difficult, and full of danger. In 1927, operations moved from the Point Reyes Beach to the protected waters of Drakes Bay",

Look for these ripple rocks at Stop 7 and remember to leave these irreplaceable treasures where you find them.

Capitol Reef protects a giant wrinkle in the Earth’s crust called the Waterpocket Fold. Deep under these layers of sedimentary rocks, imagine a massive crack in Earth’s crust, a fault line stretching north to south for 100 miles, parallel to the Scenic Drive. From about 75 to 35 million years ago the western side of the fault was pushed up about 7,000 feet higher than the eastern side. Above, the sedimentary rock layers folded, or draped over this gigantic rock stair step. Now worn by weathering and erosion, we see the tilted layers dip down toward the east. This monocline, a step-like fold or tilt, is one of the longest exposed monoclines in North America. The name “Waterpocket Fold” comes from the numerous potholes, tanks, or pockets in the rock that hold rainwater. Stops 3, 4, and 5 are along the Grand Wash spur road in a steep-walled canyon subject to dangerous flash floods that often arrive with little warning. Avoid this road and all other canyons and washes when storms threaten. Due to the tilt of the fold, as you drive east into Grand Wash, you’ll begin in the Moenkopi Formation, but it will soon disappear under the ground and you’ll be in the Chinle Formation. At the end of the road the Chinle too has disappeared, and you’ll be in the Wingate Sandstone.",

Where the land stayed dry, it does not. Scan this layer for several entrances to the Oyler Uranium Mine, used as early as 1904. Ultimately, little uranium was found here, but radiation can create health and safety hazards. Do not enter abandoned mines. Read the wayside panel for more information about uranium mining. Above the Shinarump Conglomerate is a gray-green layer within the Chinle Formation. The southwest is sometimes known as red rock country for good reason. Most of the rocks here are stained red because they were created in oxygen-rich environments and contain oxidized iron, or rust. What created that striking gray-green color? Imagine standing in a tropical swamp 215 million years ago, surrounded by primitive trees and giant ferns. The humid air is thick in your throat. The water is murky and contains ash from distant volcanoes. The stagnant bog lacks oxygen and results in today’s greenish color. As the Chinle Formation ascends to the base of the sheer cliff wall, it transitions in color to orange and burgundy, showing the return of oxygen-rich rivers.",

Rain, ice, and wind erode softer areas more quickly, creating cavities in the cliff face. These holes only form in areas exposed to weathering, there are no holes hidden within the rock, below the surface. High in the distant cliffs, you can see Cassidy Arch, named for Butch Cassidy. This train robbing, cattle rustling outlaw is thought to have used the nearby area as a hideout. Capitol Reef is home to natural bridges and arches. What is the difference? A natural bridge is formed by flowing water and an arch is formed by, well…anything else. In this case, Cassidy Arch formed at intersecting fractures in the rock.

Junipers and pinyon pines live side by side in the most common plant community on the Colorado Plateau: the pinyon-juniper woodland. Junipers have overlapping scale-like leaves and light blue berries, which are actually tiny cones covered in a waxy coating. Every juniper is unique. Some are bushy, others appear to be half dead with bare twisting branches. To conserve water, the tree self-prunes, cutting off nutrients to some branches to ensure the survival of the tree. How do they obtain enough water in this very dry desert? An immense root system can account for two thirds of a tree’s mass. The main taproot can extend up to 25 feet underground and lateral roots may stretch up to 100 feet from the trunk. With the help of these adaptations, a juniper can live to be 700 years old, providing delectable berries to generations of rabbits, coyotes, and birds over its lifespan.",

To either side of this hill, runoff from rain is channeled into Grand Wash to the north, and Capitol Gorge to the south. Capitol Reef receives only about 8 inches of rainfall each year, but when it rains, it pours. Heavy rain typically falls in July, August, and September. Expanses of bare rock and thin patches of sandy soil do little to absorb it. Only one half-inch of rain can cause a flash flood. Rain flows through washes and cascades over canyon walls, sometimes forming spectacular waterfalls that may only last for several minutes. Deep canyons fill with rushing muddy water carrying boulders and logs. These floods develop in a “flash” and can happen several times each year. Check the weather and do not enter a canyon if rain is in the forecast. Being trapped in a flash flood is a life-threatening situation. Alongside the paved pullout, you’ll see slabs of ripple rock. These stone relics preserve river bottoms and tidal mudflats of the Moenkopi Formation. Collecting is illegal in national parks; leave what you find for others to enjoy.",

Pinyon pines are known for the delicious and nutritious pine nuts nestled in their cones. Pine nuts aren’t just good in pesto; pinyon jays know they’re a treat eaten plain. Pinyon jays form noisy flocks of a few birds to a few hundred birds. They gorge themselves on pine nuts and store some for later in underground caches. An expandable esophagus allows them to carry 40 seeds at once! During a good crop year, a large flock can cache millions of seeds. Of course, not all are recovered, allowing some escapees to grow into new trees. One thousand years ago, the indigenous people known as the Fremont Culture harvested pine nuts as well. For many species, these little packets of fat and protein have been key to survival in this harsh environment.",

Today, the drive ends after 2.4 miles at a trailhead that leads hikers deeper into the historic route. The gorge is susceptible to dangerous flash floods that often arrive with little warning. Avoid this road and all other canyons and washes when storms threaten. Desert bighorn sheep inhabit the gorge, skillfully jumping along narrow ledges, sometimes only 2 inches wide. Males have large, coiled horns while female horns are short, narrow, and slightly curved. Within a herd, males fight for dominance by charging head on until one retreats. While bighorn sheep have lived in this area for thousands of years, they were locally extinct by the 1940’s due to over-hunting and disease from domestic sheep. Between 1996 and 1997, forty sheep were transferred from Canyonlands National Park to Capitol Reef and the population has been increasing. The loud crack of clashing horns echoing through the canyon is a ring of success both for the dominant male sheep and for the population as a whole.",

This “ledge-y, veggie” layer is the Kayenta Formation. Alternating layers of floodplain mudstones and river-channel sandstones form the stepped cliff band frequented by bighorn sheep. Above the Kayenta, the Navajo Sandstone forms rounded domes of white rock. Windblown dunes returned to the area to form this iconic layer, also visible in Zion, Arches, and Canyonlands national parks. The sandstone domes, reminiscent of the U.S. Capitol Building, inspired the “Capitol” portion of the park’s name. “Reef” references a barrier to travel, borrowed from the nautical term.

These animals are sensitive to lotion, sunscreen, and bug spray so keep your hands and feet out of the pools. What happens when waterpockets dry up? Fairy shrimp have a method of survival that’s almost magical. They lay incredibly durable eggs that can survive several years of drought until heavy rains return and awaken new life. Water has left its mark on Capitol Reef, from subtle ripples in the rock to towering sandstone cliffs. It has influenced tree roots and crustacean eggs. It has exposed nineteen sedimentary rock layers that have so much knowledge to impart if we learn to read them. National parks are nature’s libraries and art museums.

Its ability to carry traffic across the steep sided stream even at times of high water gave the Stone Bridge a key role during the Civil War.\n\nFollowing the defeat at Second Manassas, Union forces used the bridge as their primary line of retreat. In the early hours of August 31, as the last Union soldiers crossed it, the bridge was destroyed.  The current bridge was built in the mid-1880s with traffic diverted to a secondary bridge in the mid-1920s. \n\nFrom the parking lot, a 1.3 mile loop trail provides picturesque views of Bull Run and displays of wildflowers, including bluebells, in the spring and colorful foliage in the fall. This trail winds its way up to the heights above Bull Run. Along the way, you will pass interpretive panels at points of importance at First Manassas.",

Its architect, \nCaptain Thomas Swords, stated that his goal here was to build the Crack Post of the Frontier. To that end, he employed a variety of architectural styles, native building materials, and local water resources used in mixing mortar and plaster. He supervised the construction of a fort that was intended to be a permanent and safe home for soldiers whose mission was to patrol the Permanent Indian Frontier. They were to keep the frontier at peace by keeping Indians and white settlers separated. As you proceed, you will hear more about how each building or structure played a role in helping the army to fulfill its military mission.",

High ceilings on the second floor allowed for better ventilation and porches surrounding the building meant open air, where soldiers could convalesce and perhaps be restored to good health. A surgeon was in charge of the medical team that would provide treatment; however, the surgeon was the only one who received formal medical training. Despite the design of the hospital and the training of the surgeon, treatment here often impeded recovery rather than aiding it, due to the medical practices of the time.  \n\nConsider the case of Private Frederick Roderwald, who broke two bones in his left leg while attempting to leap over a garden fence. Since it was a compound fracture, amputation was required to avoid the onset of gangrene. Roderwald was lucky that he recovered, especially since the amputation was performed not by the surgeon (who was away from the post that day), but by the steward (a soldier who maintained the hospital supplies and had no formal medical training).",

Many were dismayed to learn upon arrival at Fort Scott that they were to be used as a glorified labor force. Using tools such as the adze and broadax, the infantry hand hewed the beams used to build this and other fort structures. Several complained they had not joined the army to build houses.  \n\nThis situation was not unique to Fort Scott however.

A window above each stall provided the horses with ventilation, giving the horse relief and comfort during the often blistering summers. Tack rooms stored the equipment that enabled the horse and soldier to function as one. Here soldiers groomed their horses for the task of patrolling and protecting the frontier.\n\nInfantry jokingly referred to the dragoons as nursemaids, because they spent so much time caring for their horses.

In the evening, soldiers could spend free time in the barracks playing cards or checkers, engaging in the sport of boxing, reading books, or writing letters home, although the latter two activities were limited to those soldiers who were literate.  \n\nWhile the barracks often contributed to the soldier’s discontent due to crowded conditions, regimentation, and strict discipline, others were content with life in the barracks.

One side is set up as the quartermaster’s office and storeroom. As the name implies, the quartermaster was in charge of providing the army with quarters or buildings in which to live. In the quartermaster storeroom are nails, paint, and other materials used in the construction and maintenance of the buildings, supplies that ultimately provided comfort to the soldiers.\n\nThe commissary or subsistence officer ran the other side of the building. He used it to store food rations and other supplies vital to the soldiers’ survival. Dry goods such as flour and bacon were stored in barrels and boxes, while goods that needed a cooler environment, candles and soap, for example, were stored in the downstairs basement. \n\nStrict accountability governed the management of these supplies. Supplies were regularly inventoried. Paperwork accompanied the issuance of these supplies. Even items that were spoiled could not just be thrown out; a board of survey had to declare them unfit for consumption and order their disposal.",

Punishments handed out ranged from reduction in rank, stoppage of pay, and confinement in the guardhouse for minor offenses to \"bucking and gagging,\" \"spread eagle,\" standing on a barrel, confinement in a choke box or the solitary cells, mounting the wooden horse, and even wearing iron collars or balls and chains.\n\nOne soldier at a different post wrote that the United States Army had \"acquired a very odious notoriety for the diabolically inhuman treatment of the enlisted men by their officers” Men were kicked, cuffed, cursed, and even mauled without cause, as suited \"the caprice or anger\" of the officers.

The National Park Service welcomes you to Oxon Cove Park where the story of this land is told through the lives and stories of centuries of human occupants. For thousands of years, diverse groups of human beings have lived here. On this tour you will learn some of their stories and see how they used this land. Together we will experience characters and events both familiar and unfamiliar. We will meet this land's native peoples and discover its early history under colonial owners. We'll hear the stories of how war touched these hills and listen to the muted voices of its enslaved people for whom freedom seemed forever elusive. Finally, we'll understand the pioneering way St. Elizabeth's Hospital used this land and see the origins of the National Park. On this tour, we'll explore how these individual threads make up the park's tapestry. All around you remain the clues and evidence of so many stories.

Twelve-thousand years ago, nomadic peoples walked this land, as did animals such as the woolly mammoth. The trees and plants you now see came to this area within the last three-thousand years, as did its first permanent residents. Nestled in the area around you sat a village of American Indians, this land's longest occupants. Using the land properly, they thrived here for many generations.  \n\n[Native man]: We return thanks to our mother, the earth, which sustains us. We return thanks to the rivers and streams which supply us with water. We return thanks to all herbs which furnished medicines for the cure of our diseases.  \n\n[Narrator]: By the time Europeans arrived in this area, the land on which you stand was the home of the Piscataway people. Changes soon came to this land whether wanted by the Piscataway or not. European expansion rarely considered the desires and needs of native peoples. The native aspects of the land began to disappear in the face of the European onslaught. In 1696, the whole area was named Prince George's County. Evidence of native life was rapidly disappearing. European settlers continued to expand through Maryland, moving into this land and as a result pushing out the Piscataways and other tribes. The earliest European owner of this property was Colonel John Addison. Upon his death in 1705, Colonel Addison owned some 6,500 acres of land, which is over 10 square miles. Members of Addison's family owned the property for several generations naming it Oxon Hill Manor. \n\nTobacco was among the earliest crops grown on this land. Tobacco farming was wildly popular in this part of Maryland. Tobacco leaves became so valuable that for a time, they could be traded and used as currency. Prince George's County was the leading producer of tobacco in Maryland by the mid 18th century. Alan Virta, a Prince George's county historian, observed  \n\n[Mr. Virta]: Tobacco created wealth for Prince George's County, wealth that built fine plantation homes, educated the children of the leading families and supported the work of our religious faiths. That one crop contributed more to Prince George's County than anything else.  \n\n[Narrator]: After generations of successful ownership, Walter Dulaney Addison, a descendant of the first owner, sold part of the land to Nicholas Lingan of Georgetown. It was this piece of property that is now Oxon Cove Park. Mr. Lingan improved the land but by the turn of the 19th century, he too sold it. The new owner was Dr. Samuel de Butts who, along with his wife Mary, are the next residents we shall meet.

Did you know this little plant can live for centuries? The boxwood next to you has grown on that spot for a very long time. It was here when Dr. and Mrs. De Butts lived on this land. These boxwoods truly are a doorway to the past. Born in 1756, Samuel De Butts was a native of Ireland. After finishing college, he moved to England and began a career as a doctor. In England, he met and courted Mary Welby.  Samuel De Butts of the parish of Grantham in the county of Lincoln and Mary Welby of this parish and married in his church by license the 17th day of October in the year of our Lord 1785 by me, W.M. Easton, Rector of Croxby. [Narrator]: Writing of the fine occasion, another commented on the mood of the local squire \n\n[Woman]: I am very glad to hear that the squire of Denton put on his best wig on your wedding day. \n\n[Narrator]: Soon afterward in 1786, Mary's relatives wrote \n\n[A relative of Mary De Butts]: Mrs. De Butts was brought to bed last Monday at five o'clock in the morning of a fine little girl which I have not yet seen, but hear it is very like the doctor. \n\n[Narrator]: The family began to take shape. Samuel and Mary had more children, however not all of them survived. Only two, Richard and Mary Anne, were living by 1791 when the De Butts faced a difficult decision. Since the doctors medical practice was struggling, should they move to America to try and find a better life? Samuels brother John was already in America. John encouraged the move across the treacherous ocean.  \n\n[John De Butts]: Sell every property in England and Ireland. Lodge your money as securely as possible in London, subject to your drafts at 30 days site. Perhaps it might besides bring you some interest there. Come out in a stout British merchant ship bound for either Baltimore or any other part within the Chesapeake Bay, but prefer Baltimore. Be at as little expense as an outfit as you can. I mean with regard to superfluous clothes and furniture. Sail either from London, Liverpool, Whitehaven, or Bristol and make as good a bargain with the captain of the ship as you can for your passage. Let him find sea stores except for small matters for yourselves and the children. If you find your own stores, the sailors will assuredly pillage you on the voyage. When at Baltimore, your family, self, and luggage may readily procure at Patuxent Boat to convey you to my house where the most hearty welcome will await you all. I will advise you to sail in May, June, or July when you do, these are the most agreeable months for young sailors. \n\n[Narrator]: The new world was a very different place from the old world. John De Butts, determined to get Samuel and Mary to emigrate, used vivid imagery to answer their every question in an attempt to convince them.  \n\n[John De Butts]: The crops of tobacco wheat, corn, flax, and cotton enables the beginning not only liberally to supply his family but to send considerable quantities to market. Almost every plantation abounds with apples, peaches, and cherries. Our woods and fields abound with partridges, squirrels, opossum, raccoon, and other game such as pheasants, woodcocks, snipes, and some wild turkeys. But the latter are now rarely to be met, besides a variety of other birds and beasts for us in entertainment. The water yields us plenty with various kinds of fish, oysters, crabs etc. and in the winter, great numbers of swan, wild geese, and ducks. In this description, I confined myself to my own neighborhood. The back country affords a variety of animals which I have not mentioned and there is venison is their cheapest meat. \n\n[Narrator]: Samuel, Mary, and their two children decided to move to America in 1791. The journey was fraught with peril. There were many disasters attendant on so rash a step as crossing the Atlantic especially with young children. They survived the trip and landed in America where another child, John Henry, was born in Maryland. Both Samuel and Mary inherited some wealth from their families and as such were in a better situation than others. After a few years, Dr. De Butts purchased the property on which you stand. Around this time, the white farmhouse ahead of you was built. The area and the home were named Mount Welby in honor of Mary's family, the Welbys. Samuel worked as a doctor but supplemented his income by farming this land. Everyday life was a challenge and for some tragedy struck without warning. \n\n[Woman]: A most dreadful epidemic has raged here during the whole winter. It is melancholy to see the devastation it has made in various counties. Whole families have been swept away. \n\n[Narrator]: Mount Welby was not immune. On December 11th, 1814, tragedy hit these hills. \n\n[Mary De Butts]: Your poor sister is a widow.

                    "audioTranscript": "[Narrator]: The house that you see before you was constructed around 1800, shortly after Nicholas Lingan purchased the land. Architecturally, the house was typical of the Maryland federal style at the beginning of the 19th century. The plan of the house consisted of a central hall with two rooms on each side, each room with its own fireplace. The house you are looking at today was altered from its original condition in the late 19th century. The roofline was flattened. It used to rise to a peak in the middle, typical of many modern roofing styles. Parts of the walls and windows were rebuilt, perhaps due to a fire. In the interior, the fire places on the east wall were removed although you can still see where the chimneys were along the roof line. Look out from Mount Welby towards the Potomac. The modern-day view is impressive enough, but imagine what this view must have looked like without the trees blocking the way. The house is perfectly located for a gorgeous view of the Potomac shipping traffic and Alexandria's buzzing docks. Washington City, America's young capital was just over the hill to the north. You may even be able to see the tip of the Washington Monument, depending on the time of year and weather. Imagine cruising down the Potomac. Glancing up on this towering hill is a glistening white farmhouse commanding the scene. This was a fine spot indeed. Other notable figures had similar home locations. George Washington lived at Mount Vernon a few miles to our south and later Robert E. Lee resided at Arlington House just up the river to the north. This was the Potomac highway, and you have a truly historic vantage point. \n\nThis same dramatic view provided the De Butts family with a first-hand view of the War of 1812. England and America were at war over many issues. America believed England had been taking sailors off her naval ships and forcing them to work on their own ships. Americans blamed the English for inciting the Native Americans against them. Many Americans also had a desire to conquer and seize Canada. America declared war on England to settle the issues. Wars are much easier to win on paper. The cost was terrible and the results were ultimately inconclusive. The war destroyed shipping. In 1812, Mary De Butts lamented its impact on their crops. \n\n[Mary De Butts]: We are just now in the midst of a harvest and have every prospect of plentiful crops, but if the war continues we shall have no market for a grain. Tis terrible times for the farmer but the poor merchants will be ruined. Money never was so scarce. There is scarce a dollar to be had. \n\n[Narrator]: War is painful and terrible. For the De Butts, this war was especially troubling. They now lived in America, but they were from and their family still lived in England. iIf they supported their home and neighbors, they opposed to their own family. War came very close to where you stand. Bladensburg, Maryland, only miles from where you are, was the scene of one of America's greatest defeats. \n\n[Mary De Butts]: I cannot express to you the distress it has occasioned. At the Battle of Bladensburg, we heard every fire, that place being not more than five or six miles from us. Our house was shook repeatedly by the firing upon forts and bridges. \n\n[Narrator]: After defeating the American forces at Bladensburg, British soldiers marched into Washington and on August twenty-fourth, 1814 they burned the White House, Capitol building and others structures. Much of Washington City was ablaze, some intentionally, much not. The walls of Mount Welby glowed ominously from the flame signifying the downfall of the American Capital. Days later a British naval fleet sailed up the Potomac directly in front of you. Alexandria Virginia surrendered to the fleet rather than fight it out. 454 United States soldiers were stationed on this hill to aid the defense of Fort Washington a few miles south of us. The fort evacuated in the face of the British advance, opening up the entirety of the Potomac to the world's strongest naval power. Soon fire ships, boats packed with explosives, were intentionally set ablaze by Americans and hurtled down the stretch of the river, hoping to damage the British fleet and force their withdrawal. Mary De Butts later called this time a day and night of horrors. \n\n[Mary De Butts]: We found three rockets on our hill, evidently pointed at our house but fortunately did not reach it. \n\n[Narrator]: The two quarreling nations signed a treaty soon afterward. By 1815, the war was over, but neither side emerged as clearly victorious and there was little to show for the carnage. Mary wrote to her brother in 1815 \n\n[Mary De Butts]: The termination of the war has cheered hearts of thousands, but its bitter consequences will long be severely felt. \n\n[A bell sounds] Proceed down the hill to the pathway and follow the road to your right.",

John De Butts. North American slavery predates the very existence of Maryland statehood. Enslaved persons were forced to work in this vicinity nearly 150 years before the American Revolution. For those with wealth, forcing others to do all the work and receive little to no pay seemed ideal. To modern-day audiences, slavery is a most unpleasant and uncomfortable topic, but it's tragic existence remains a crucial part of Maryland and national history. In 1790, 52% of the people in Prince George's County were enslaved individuals. This land had enslaved workers in the 1700s when Samuel and Mary De Butts purchased this land, they soon brought enslaved workers onto this land as well, continuing its tragic pattern of injustice. Most enslaved individuals worked the fields, while a select few worked in the main house. These human beings were considered property, no different than a plough or a horse. They were a tool to do work, nothing more in the eyes of those who held them. They could be given away as family heirlooms. I give and bequeath to my son John Henry De Butts all my slaves, stock, farming utensils, furniture, linens, and books. Enslaved people were counted as inventory on lists of supplies with given values. The law considered the enslaved to be personal property and as such they were often as valuable as the land itself. The same constitutional rights that were used to defend life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness did not apply to all peoples. Wealthy white men benefited most from these beliefs. Women too suffered. With few exceptions, the property of a woman became her husband's upon marriage. Women could neither vote nor hold office even though equality appeared to exist in the Constitution. Freedom has been and always will be a matter of perspective. No one who has always enjoyed the right of Liberty can realize the horrors of slavery. To be at the will of another, to be owned like a cow or horse, and liable at any moment to be sold to the highest bidder, to be transported to a distant part of the country, leaving the dearest relatives behind, to be ground down mentally and physically by the untold curses of slavery may be a very pretty thing to the Masters of the peculiar institution, but it is death to the slaves. Many enslaved people recognize the gross injustice of their situation. There were many ways to resist but they all saw a common theme- freedom. Like Nat Turner, they could turn and fight rallying their companions to turn the suffering onto their oppressors. Like Frederick Douglass, they could take their resistance to the masses through speeches, newspapers, and public opinion. Like Denmark Vesey, they could invoke a higher power or strength to emerge from the shattered lives in which they were bound. Others chose to just disappear and evade capture. An enslaved man kept on this land did just that. 200 reward Negro man Jacob Shaw, aged 35 years rather dark complexion, his hair's inclined to be bushy, a small scar over his left eye. He has a free brother in the city of Washington by the name of Sandy Shaw whose free pass he has probably attained and will try to get to Pennsylvania or New York. The unfortunate nature of slavery in America led to families often being split. When escaping, some chose to try and find their scattered family members then seek freedom together. $30 reward Barba B. Williams is about 50 years of age, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, slender built, stoops in her walk, black color a little gray and squints a little out of her right eye. She has relations living at Mr. Thomas E. Berry's Oxon Hill Farm on the Potomac River. Despite the heroic actions of many, enslaved individuals continued to comprise the majority of the labor force in Prince George's County for much of the 19th century. The District of Columbia abolished slavery in 1862 and the constitutional amendments following the Civil War abolished slavery nationwide, but this did not solve the problems of racial discrimination. Although slavery no longer existed by law, the social and economic fabric of the area was very different after the war. Many formerly enslaved people chose to move and find opportunities in new places such as Baltimore. Some chose to stay and work the same land but now for payment, meager as it may be. Compounding the tragedy of slavery is the lack of information that has been left to later generations. No first-person information about the lives of enslaved people here survives. Even their final resting places remain unknown. The location for the enslaved burial ground has been lost for now, but is in the vicinity of where you now stand. Oxon Cove's enslaved people share a voice unheard, but we must never allow them to be forgotten.",

Meanwhile, in 1852, with the encouragement of Dorothea Dix, the federal government opened St. Elizabeth's hospital to treat people with mental illnesses. The hospital, located only a few miles to our north, was the first large-scale, federally run psychiatric hospital. To support the hospital, the federal government purchased the land on which you stand in 1891. This farm produced food to sustain the hospital but also offered unique therapeutic options. It was decided to use farm work as a method of therapy for the patients. This offered a uniquely peaceful setting in which patients could work. Additionally, it gave them a tangible goal to accomplish. The work had a noticeable reward- food production, which was a value to the larger community. Some of the patients even lived in the building formerly known as Mount Welby, under the watchful eye of the farm caretaker. From the business perspective of the hospital's operation, it provided free farm labor too. This was a major improvement from previous standards of mental treatment. Dorothea Dix, noted advocate for better mental health treatment, described some observations of other types of care she had witnessed: \n\n[Dorothea Dix]: One subject chained and one in a closed stall for 17 years, one often doubly chained hand and foot, one man caged comfortable, one often closely confined now losing the use of his limbs from want of exercise. The insane are disadvantageously placed in the jail. In the almshouse, two females are in stalls in wooden bunks filled with straw, always shut up. One of these subjects is supposed curable. \n\n[Narrator]: Dorothea Dix knew there had to be a better way to treat people with mental illness. This land represented one of the great experiments to find that better way. Here, selected patients could work the land outside, unchained. They could accomplish important tasks and stimulate their minds and bodies. Their rooms had no bars or restraints and the hospital in many ways benefited at the same time. This farm was highly productive. It not only served as a home for horses, cattle, pigs, and chickens, but it also produced alfalfa, timothy hay, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, asparagus, eggplant, pumpkins, rutabaga, fruits, and honey, in addition to eggs and meat from the animals. Now as an operating government farm the De Butts' Mount Welby was renamed Godding Croft after St. Elizabeth's superintendent at the time Dr. William Godding. Dr. Godding stated his belief: \n\n[Dr. Godding]: There is no question about the value of labor in the treatment and care of the insane and the varied work of a farm and garden seems admirably suited for the employment of many whose disease is of the chronic type. \n\n[Narrator]: In 1893, Dr. Godding noted the transformation undergoing on this land as Mount Welby became Godding Croft. \n\n[Dr. Godding]: The old manor house and barn there have been renovated and occupied. A new shed has been built for the shelter of young stock and the fields are already taking on something of the aspect of a well-ordered farm. There is abundant road making, clearing, and grubbing up that will afford an opportunity for all the winter labor that can be made available for years to come. It will come more and more to depend on a labor of the inmates and in the end they will be found no more slightly or pleasant pastoral region, no fair outlooks, no spot better fitted to bring content to darkened mines, this new domain named Godding Croft. \n\n[Narrator]: New buildings were constructed including the hay barn at which you now stand. The patients worked two to three-hour shifts twice a day challenging and developing their mind in a home-like atmosphere. It was an exploration in justice for a class of people so long restricted to perpetual injustice. \n\n[A bell sounds] Walk now to your final stop outside the visitor barn.",

You are one more thread in the great tapestry that is Oxon Cove Park, a park where every thread is important and without it our great human tapestry will always be incomplete. Thank you for visiting and please come again to experience Oxon Cove Park.",

So the little star went to the earth looking for happiness. And the little star heard a strange sound. It had never heard that sound before. So upon arriving at a gentle flowing, shallow stream he saw giant trees, and he saw little children splashing and playing in the water. And they spoke kindly to each other and they were laughing he loved the sound of their laughter. And he said, \"This! This is where I want to live!\" So the star stayed there along the stream and he was happy, because he could always hear the laughter of the children. So whenever you find a broken branch from a cottonwood tree - because cottonwood trees grow along lakes and streams - cut it open on the little knuckle and you will find a star inside.

                    "audioTranscript": "he Union frontal assault at Pigeon Hill was one of two attempts to break the Confederate defenses along the Kennesaw line on June 27th, 1864. While there were not as many casualties here as there were at Cheatham Hill, the assault was still especially difficult. This was largely due to the steep and rocky terrain. The Confederates held the high ground, using the natural defenses to their advantage. It had been raining for nearly 3 weeks prior to the battle, so the Union forces also had the marshy, muddy ground at the foot of the hill to contend with. A portion of the force became lost and began climbing up the draw between Pigeon Hill and Little Kennesaw, right into the face of the cannon positioned there. If you look closely, you can still see the remains of the Confederate cannon positions on Pigeon Hill, appearing in the steep, craggy hill side.",

Originally the Kennesaw Memorial Association, a veteran’s association, tried to raise funds for the monument, but the state of Illinois would provide $20,000.00 to fund the construction of a monument and a gubernatorial appointed commission to oversee the project. The McNeel Marble Company of Marietta, Georgia erected the monument. The monument stands 25 feet high and is made of Georgia white marble. An American eagle sets atop the monument and life-size figures of a Union soldier at parade rest is flanked by two Grecian women. The monument was restored the fall of 2013 through spring of 2014. It was rededicated on June 27, 2014, as part of the 150th Anniversary of the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.",

As a prosperous yeoman farmer, Peter Valentine Kolb had seven children, 10 slaves, several outbuildings, in addition to his to 600 acres of farmland.\nOn the afternoon of June 22, 1864, Union soldiers repulsed Confederate General Hood’s ill-fated attack just north of Powder Spring Road. The Kolb house was used as headquarters for Union General Joseph Hooker and as a temporary field hospital. During the fighting, the home and farm suffered major damage. Although they did not immediately return to the area, the Kolb family would return to the location after the war. Today, the once large farm consists only of the original farmhouse and the Kolb family cemetery.",

Imagine you're seeking a homestead in the late 19th century, and you and your family are traveling west in a covered wagon, and you come upon a homestead. Most likely you would be welcomed warmly and invited to stay for a visit. Since neighbors usually weren't living in close proximity an unexpected visit was a pleasant surprise. Spotting an approaching wagon, children would run outside for a better look. The adults might prepare something to eat or drink for their guests. Despite the fact that homesteaders may have been isolated, they depended on their neighbors to survive, to build a school harvest their crops, care for the sick, birth a baby, and even prevent loneliness. homesteaders work together as a community to be successful. In fact, in order to prove up on your homestead claim and gain legal ownership, you needed two witnesses attesting to your presence and to your improvement of the land… \n\nTo document your travels, you may have written letters or kept a journal to remember those you met, you may have even asked them to sign or write a short note in your autograph book. To have your picture taken with something special was not a common occurrence. Today we encourage you to take photographs, perhaps next to this park entrance sign or out on the prairie, send a postcard to your family or friends. Write your name in the visitor guest book, or even post pictures and comments about your visit on the parks Facebook page. Although we live in the 21st century homestead remembers those people that traveled west, in the hopes of a better life and a place to call their own.

The furnishings depict life in the 1800s. It was constructed of mixed hardwoods including oak hackberry ash locust walnut and Elm and homemade brickset and lime mortar. It measures 14 by 16 feet. The cabin was built by George Washington Palmer. He was a native of Ohio and served as a private in Company B 23rd Wisconsin volunteers during the civil war…. upon his discharge he returned to his Ohio Home and made plans to sell his land and move to Nebraska to homestead…. from his wife's half brothers he heard of the rich soil, mild climate and excellent crops of southeastern Nebraska.\nDuring his first two winters in the area he lived in a dugout on the west bank of Bear Creek in Logan Township, about 14 miles northeast of here. In the spring of 1866. He planted his first crop of corn and pumpkins, and in the fall of the next year, built this cabin with the help of his neighbors.\nIn the spring of 1868 Palmer brought his wife and children to the homestead and they moved into the cabin. On May 26 1868 George W Palmer filed application number 2614 in the Brownville Land Office for the 160 acres and paid the $14 fee. By March 1875 he had plowed and planted an acre in forest trees, built a stable, a greenery, a cattle yard a corn crib and dug a well.. All of this was part of proving up. in order to receive title to the land, a homesteader had to build a home and make improvements on May 5 1875 Palmer paid the final $4 payment which entitled him to the deed for his 160 acres.\nDuring the five years after 1875 Palmer added a 10 by 12 foot lean to on the rear of their original cabin which served as their kitchen. in 1895 Palmer and his wife sold the farm to their nephews.\nThis log cabin is just one style of home built and lived-in by homesteaders.",

But Daniel Freeman saw this tall grass very differently than we do today. He thought it was a nuisance to be replaced as soon as possible with crops that would pay his way. Freeman filed his homestead claim on January 1 1863 In Brownville Nebraska and returned to his T shaped claim and began the process of homesteading. Over the next five years Freeman constructed a home and cultivated crops. He did this and received his deed on September 1 1869. The original 160 acre homestead claim was purchased by the United States Department of the Interior, in 1936 in order to create Homestead National historical park... This complex ecosystem is made up of flowers, birds, mammals, insects and micro organisms… tall grass prairie is so named because the component grasses.

                    "audioTranscript": "You are near the Osage orange hedgerow plan ted by Daniel Freeman, one of the first homesteaders. Once Freeman claimed his 160 acres, he needed to build a home and cultivate some crops. He also needed fencing to mark his property, and to keep his crop safe from livestock, which were allowed to roam freely, and since there was a limited amount of wood to build fences, Freeman chose to plant Osage orange trees. These were not the first trees used for fencing, but by the 1850s, it was considered the premier prairie hedge plant.  agricultural journals and state legislatures were praising Osage orange hedges and recommending their use.\n\nOsage orange has various qualities that made it ideal as a hedge plant for the prairies, it is a hardy tree that grows in different soil types, and can withstand drought, heat, and wind. It has thick set zigzag branchlets with thorns, and its branches touch the ground, if it is kept trimmed correctly, shearing bending and even cutting it off to the ground only encourages new shoes. \n\n Most importantly, many farmers found it cheaper to put in, and maintain then wood fences. Proponents of Osage orange trees were also quick to point out the aesthetic value of trees. Some even went so far as to claim that Osage orange would modify the climate by encouraging rain to come to otherwise dry areas. The fact that the trees would break the wind was also important. Despite its advantages, Osage orange hedge, met with some severe criticisms.\n\n Most of the criticism focused on the labor involved in making a row of Osage orange shrubs, into a good fence. They are painstakingly crafted over a number of years as young shoots are trained to grow horizontally and woven into neighboring plants until the hedge forms a continuous living fence. Daniel Freeman may have been one of those that found it too labor intensive. There are records of him planting the trees, but no record of him maintaining it as a hedge. a hedge had to be trimmed at least once every summer, or the fence would not resist stock correctly. In fact, one farmer from Kansas, had this to say about maintaining the hedge… working a hedge is just about the hardest and most disagreeable work any fellow ever engaged in. besides if great care is not exercised, you may get a thorn thrust into your eye, knee or other joints, thus getting maimed for life. \n\nAlthough it was difficult to maintain as a fence, the wood was durable. even after farmers were no longer using it as fencing, they used it to make fence post for the newly invented barbed wire. posts made from Osage orange could last 50 years or longer. Farmers joked that the Osage orange post would outlast two post holes. Its sturdiness can be seen in these trees. \n\nThe three fourths of a mile hedge were planted in the 1870s, and it's still going strong",

Many different plant families live here, including the milkweeds the goldenrods and the grasses, these plant families provided food, medicine, and raw materials to the American Indians and the homesteaders. Milkweed are easily recognized, look for the feathery parachutes, these are the odd shaped seed pods that form from the large pink flowers. Milkweed isn't always popular with the farmers but it is important to monarch butterflies, The goldenrod is another common plant of the restored prairie. It is an erect coarse looking perennial herb that is usually about two to three feet tall. The small flower heads, which are almost always yellow but sometimes cream colored or white rays are grouped in either elongated or flattish clusters, the flowers appear from July through October. It is Nebraska State flower. You can also find nebraska’s state grass here, it is little bluestem and is very ornamental bunchgrass that has fine textured foliage that forms, very dense mounds that reach 18 to 24 inches high. \nSlender, blue Greens stems appearing in August reach three foot by September, and become radiant mahogany red and white shining south in the fall. Another type of grass found in the park is prairie cord grass, it is found in the low wet areas and can grow up to eight feet tall. The leaf blades are coarse and very tough, the margins of the leaves are serrated and sharp. The stems are very stiff. Before homesteading the prairie nutrients were restored to it by burning, you might think that fire on the prairie is a bad thing, but really it is good for helping the plants to grow healthy and strong. After a burn the soil is enriched with nutrients.  The last plant family that we see in the park, is also one of the largest…. the Astra family. This includes the sunflowers and the golden rods, and many others. The stem of the flower can grow as high as three meters tall, the tallgrass prairie the first homesteaders encountered was beautiful and diverse in it’s makeup. In restoring the prairie at Homestead National Historical Park, we hope that you can get a glimpse of what those homesteaders saw when they arrived to the Tallgrass Prairie.",

The brick school was built on this land during 1871 and 1872. Thomas Freeman made the bricks for the schoolhouse, and it is even possible that the school is named after him. According to records he was paid $100 for them by the school district, Thomas Freeman was not related to Daniel. \nAfter opening, the Freeman school enjoyed steady growth over the next few years and in 1880 there were 33 students enrolled, both Daniel and his wife Agnes had served as director of the school. \n\nIn 1898 the school received national attention. Miss Edith Beecher was employed that year as the teacher. She asked and was granted permission by the school board to conduct religious exercises in the school. The exercises consisted of reading Bible passages, singing songs from a gospel hymn book, and offering prayers to a deity. Daniel Freeman strongly objected and when the school board and the superintendent supported Miss Beecher, Freeman filed suit in Gage County District Court, asking the school board be forced to discontinue using the Bible and the gospel handbook to conduct religious exercises.  \nWhen The district court judge sided with Miss Beecher and the school board, Freeman then appealed the decision to the Nebraska Supreme Court. In 1902 The court ruled in Freeman's favor saying the district was in violation of the state constitution, which forbids sectarian instruction in any school supported by public funds. However, the court did not find that Bible reading in the public schools was unconstitutional. The court said Bible reading was only unlawful when the teacher becomes a sectarian propagandist. The school operated until 1967 and held the honor of being the oldest continuously operated one room school in the state of Nebraska and the Freeman School became part of Homestead National Historical park in 1970.",

During the siege, upwards of 22 cannons on this ridge bombarded the Confederate defenders both day and night.\n\nCivil War artillery was organized into groups of up to six cannon called batteries which allowed Federal artillerymen to constantly bombard the nine major Confederate forts guarding the roads into the city.  Among the cannon mounted here are smoothbore and rifled models. By looking at the front of the cannon muzzle, you can tell them apart by looking at the interior of the barrel. Rifled guns will have a series or ridges that spiral toward the back of the barrel, while smoothbores are, well, smoothe. \n\nAnother major difference in the guns was the metal used to make the barrels.  All of the green guns you see in the park are made of bronze or iron.

Although the Shirleys were slave owners, they were not for disunion. When the Secession Crisis came, James supported the Union, as did the majority of Vicksburg voters who recognized that their fortunes were bound to the free flow of commerce on the Mississippi River.\n\nIn early spring 1863, the Shirley House boasted a manicured walkway, a beautiful garden, and fruit trees in the back yard; a pastoral scene that conflicted with the raw Confederate fortifications built the previous year just a few hundred down the Jackson Road leading toward Vicksburg.  \n\nIn May, the Shirley’s lives would change forever.  \n\nJames and daughter Alice found themselves trapped in Clinton, Mississippi, and separated from the rest of the family when Union soldiers cut the railroad running to Vicksburg.\n\nHome alone with son Quincy, Adeline found herself defending her house—literally.  \n\nFearing that the Shirley’s house would be used by Union sharpshooters, the Confederates ordered it burned down, and sent a soldier with a torch to complete the task.\n\nBut Adeline Shirley, unwilling to let her house go up without a fight, begged the soldier not to, delaying him so long that advancing Union soldiers shot the unfortunate man.\n\nAlthough she had saved her home, the shot and shell coming from both sides became too dangerous, and she and her son Quincy had to seek shelter in a cave in the Union lines.\n\nThey eventually ended up moving into one of their former slave cabins, but never lived in the white house again, the war had damaged it too much.  \n\nHer daughter Alice sold the house to the U. S. Government in May 1900, on the condition that her parents would be buried in the back yard, and that the home be fully restored - circumstances both met at the time.",

Struggling through the deep ravines on either side of the road, the blue-clad troops contended with manmade obstacles as well as the steep inclines.  \n\nPinned down, the Federals sought shelter wherever they could find it and remained until night provided cover for their retreat. The assault cost Sherman close to 1000 casualties.\n\nThree days later on May 22, Stockade Redan was again attacked as part of a general assault on all major Confederate positions along a three mile front. This time, Sherman sent his men straight down the old Graveyard Road. \n\nWhen the Union artillery ceased the bombardment that morning, the attackers were led by 150 volunteers who carried planks to bridge the ditch in front of the redan and ladders to scale the walls. \n\nThe Confederate defenders held their fire until the Federals had almost reached the redan. Then they rose from behind the walls and delivered a devastating volley of musket fire that nearly filled the road with dead and wounded.  \n\nOther unsupported assaults by parts of Sherman's corps were unsuccessful, and again, Sherman’s troops were forced to retreat after suffering terrible losses.",

It gets its name from the 2nd Texas Infantry that defended the fort through the entire siege.\n\nAt 6:00 a.m. on May 22, 1863, the still morning air was shattered by a four-hour artillery bombardment from the guns of Grant’s army.\n\nAt 10:00 a.m., the thunder of the cannon was replaced by rifle and musket fire of thousands of Union troops from Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Ohio as they marched forward through a Confederate rain of fire. \n\nMany of the blue-clad soldiers fell dead or wounded, while others took shelter behind what little protection they could find.\n\nA handful of Federals made it through the determined rebel resistance, most notably Corporal Thomas J. Higgins, the color bearer of the 99th Illinois Volunteer Infantry. \n\nThe courageous Corporal sprinted across the road and scaled the wall of the lunette only to find himself surrounded by the amazed Texans who had reached out to help the brave Federal over the wall, then shook his hand in amazement of his bravery and luck.\n\nThe battle continued throughout the day, but by 5:00 p.m. the Texans were reinforced, and the Federals were forced to retreat to the safety of the Union lines.\n\nThe cemetery occupying the site was established after the siege by the local Jewish congregation.",

Hovey’s division occupied the sector of the Union siege line directly across from the fort, but his division did not arrive on the line until after the general assaults of May 22, so Fort Garrott was not attacked that day. \n\nDuring the siege, Hovey’s men dug two approach trenches to within 50 feet of the outer slope of the fort in preparation for an attack, if the siege failed.\n\nAs in all Confederate forts, the soldiers here were continually harassed by the deadly, accurate fire of Union sharpshooters. \n\nOn June 17, Colonel Isham W. Garrott, the commander of the 20th Alabama Infantry manning this fort was angered at the suffering caused by the sharpshooters. \n\nCol. Garrott spied the location of a Union rifleman and he picked up a musket in hopes of silencing the sharpshooter and was instantly killed by a Federal bullet. That day a messenger was sent to notify Colonel Garrott that he had been promoted to brigadier general, but the brave colonel had died before the message reached him.\n\t\nThe clear field in front of the fort is typical of what you would have seen here in 1863. The trees that now cover the park were planted during the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. With the discovery that grasses are better at controlling erosion than trees in this region, the park hopes to selectively cut more trees so as to open more historic vistas.",

By the end of the siege, Union soldiers were close enough to hold conversations with the Confederates.\n\nIn all, General Grant’s men dug 13 different approaches at Vicksburg.  \n\nHovey’s approach, seen at the southeastern corner of Fort Garrott, was begun on June 23rd and nearly reached the fort by the time of the surrender on July 4th.",

The building was designed by National Park Service assistant architect James Swanson. The style is Art Deco and is designed to look like one of the clay pots discovered during the excavations.

That afternoon General Stoneman retreated from Macon, but the Rebels captured Stoneman at Sunshine Church north of Macon and sent his troops to the prison camp at Andersonville.

Each seat has a small oval depression in front of it, which may have been used to present ceremonial objects. The firepit in the center was likely used for ceremonies.\n\nThe Lodge was burned in the late 13th century; perhaps as a ritual for renewal or purification, or possibly because the building had deteriorated too much for any further use. Either way, as the roof caved in, it buried and preserved the clay floor for 800 years until it was rediscovered in 1934.

                    "significance": "The Cornfield Mound dates to the Mississippian period. The Mississippians were master farmers who grew corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, and tobacco. When archaeologists excavated this mound in the 1930s, they discovered cultivated rows and a charred corncob, leading them to believe that the Mississippians used the area as a cornfield before building the mound over it. The Mississippians farmed most of their crops near the Ocmulgee River, while this cornfield was likely used for ceremonies since it's near the Earth Lodge. Look at the prehistoric trenches on the right-side of the Cornfield mound with the Earth Lodge behind you. These trenches were partially excavated and left unfilled. The trenches are between 3 to 9 feet deep and 15 to 25 feet wide. The parallel trenches remain in sections as a series of oval depressions in semicircular bands. The purpose of these trenches is unknown; they may have been for irrigation or as a defensive barrier, but most likely they were borrow pits for building the mounds.",

The British competed with the Spanish operating in the area. The Indians preferred British trade items over Spanish because British goods were superior, their trading prices lower, and their demands on Indian culture were less. Indians traded deerskins for guns, beads, bells, and other European goods until around 1715, when the Indians were unable to produce enough deerskins to compensate for the European goods. Some traders, reacting to the London-based capitalist demands for payment, sold Indian women and children into slavery in the Caribbean. This led to the Yamasee War. The colonists defeated the Indian uprising in 1717, but by then the trading post here had been burned and abandoned. \n\nThe site was excavated in 1935-36. Artifacts collected include gun parts, flints, musket balls, glass shards, beads, kaolin pipes, axes, knives, and copper bracelets.",

The mound was built in seven stages with structures on top of each level, which were probably used to prepare the dead for burial and the accompanying ceremonies. Massive log tombs were contained in its lowest level and over a hundred burials were placed throughout the mound with elaborate copper and shell ornaments that suggest high-status burials. The 1870s railroad construction bisected the mound and left only the southern portion intact. Archaeologists later excavated this section in December of 1933. The mound’s current height is at the third level of the mound and is 20 feet high. When the mound had the seventh and final level during the Mississippian period, it would have been 280 feet long, 100 feet wide, and 25 feet high. Out of respect for those buried here, please do not walk on this mound.",

All of the mounds built by the Mississippians were built by hand using basketfuls of dirt. It’s estimated that 10 million baskets of dirt, weighing around 60 pounds each, were used to build the GTM! Imagine the organization and diligence required by the entire village to accomplish such a feat. The mounds were used by the elite of the society of building their houses and temples on top of them. The GTM was most likely where the Mississippian chief lived, while the Lesser Temple Mound (LTM) may have been where the second chief lived. \n\nThe LTM was partially destroyed by railroad construction in 1843 and is now a quarter of its original size. Excavation of the mound in 1934 revealed that the LTM had been built in four phases. A small village site with earth lodges and homes were also found between the GTM and the LTM.",

These lime stone bricks can viewed on the west side of the structure where the stucco has fallen away. Former Green Bay Packers player Veryl Switzer was raised in the residence in 1930s and 40s.

For his service to the Spanish Crown, he was awarded encomiendas, or land grants, in Guatemala, where he became a citizen.\n\nCabrillo and his expedition of over 100 men aboard three ships departed from the port of Navidad, Mexico on June 27, 1542 - over 1,200 miles (1,931 km) away, as the crow flies. Three months later he arrived at what he described in his captain's log as \"a very good enclosed port,\" which is known today as San Diego Bay. If you are facing the front of the statue, look to your left toward the bay. Historians believe that Cabrillo first anchored his flagship, the San Salvador here, on September 28, 1542. Cabrillo was in this area for about 6 days before sailing Northwest toward the Channel Islands.\n\nWhen the Cabrillo expedition landed here, they met the Kumeyaay people, who have lived in the San Diego area for thousands of years. The expedition's goal was to explore and make observations along the California Coast, not to conquer it, so interactions with the Kumeyaay were relatively peaceful. This stood in stark contrast to Cabrillo’s life in Guatemala where he lived as a colonizer. There he forced indigenous peoples (such as the Maya-Q’eqchi of Cobán) to work in his mines, farms, and shipyards.\n\nThere is controversy over how Cabrillo’s story is remembered due to the nature of his past as a conquistador and colonizer. Was he a legendary explorer? A ruthless soldier? An ambitious merchant? In any case, his legacy is prolific in the state of California – in fact, there are more places named after him than any other person in the state.\n\nTake a moment to imagine you are a member of the Cabrillo expedition. You are on a crowded, cold, and wet ship, exploring a world where everything is new to you, and wondering if you will ever return home to see your family again. Now, put yourself in the shoes of one of the Kumeyaay people at that first meeting with Cabrillo. You may have heard stories from desert tribes who encountered bearded Spaniards from the Coronado expedition along the Colorado River. You would be very aware of their acts of conquest. How would you react to meeting these strangers?\n\nAfter spending six days in San Diego, the Cabrillo expedition continued to explore the California coastline. In December of 1542, the expedition stopped in the Channel Islands to replenish drinking water supplies. While there, Cabrillo broke a bone while rushing from the ship to respond to a skirmish between his crew and native Chumash people. He died from a gangrene infection on January 3, 1543. His crew continued to explore without their captain, reaching as far north as the Rogue River in Oregon, but eventually turned back due to supply issues and bad weather. Despite the inglorious end of the expedition, Cabrillo and his crew successfully charted much of the west coast of North America. They were the first Europeans to explore the West Coast, and their records of the winds and currents unlocked the mystery of the Pacific Ocean for future explorers.\n\nHave you found anything during your time exploring the park that you did not expect?",

In Southern California, we experience a Mediterranean climate, just like the countries that border the Mediterranean Sea in Europe! We have hot dry summers with long periods of drought punctuated by cooler and wetter winters. The plants found in these habitats have adapted to survive in a place with little rain. We like to think of the plants here as survivors in a harsh, yet mild climate.\n\nAs you look around the trailhead you may be able to identify some plants. Lemonade Berry has green and rounded leaves, sometimes with red berries. Take a moment and see if you can find them! There are two species of sage nearby, California Sagebrush and Black Sage. California Sagebrush has a mint green color and is made up of lots of soft and skinny leaves. Black sage has leathery dark green leaves that are sticky. Both can be found flowering or dried out. If the wind is blowing just right, you might smell their strong aroma. Feel free to touch them! Gently rub the leaves between your fingers and then smell your hand. Remember that these plants are protected, so make sure not to pick them. Do you like or dislike this smell? Did you think it would have such a strong scent? Why might a plant smell like this?\n\nTake a moment to consider how all of these plants came to be. We can thank one group of critters for our wonderful plant life here at Cabrillo National Monument: the pollinators! Pollinators can come in a range of shapes and sizes. They include insects, birds, and bats, just to name a few. You may encounter bees buzzing around or hummingbirds flying about. Bats may come through in the evenings to snack on the insect life that is darting about. \n\nPlants at Cabrillo National Monument have a very hard life; they live on exposed windswept hillsides in a relatively dry climate. Please help them (and the pollinators that depend upon them) survive their stressful lives by leaving their flowers and leaves intact. This is their home, and with your help, will continue to be for generations to come!\n\nAs you travel through the park, try to think of ways you could use the plants and animals you see to survive, if you had to live in this harsh environment.",

As a result, the light keepers of Point Loma were early pioneers of working from home and being distant from society!\n\nLife here was isolated and challenging. Something as simple as going to school required the kids to take a boat across the bay! There was no fresh water readily available and the area was relatively barren. The lighthouse had a catchment built to catch rain water, but given that San Diego’s average rainfall is barely over 10 inches per year, that wasn’t nearly enough to get by. Water and food had to be shipped in from town along dirt roads by horse and buggy.\n\nMost of the actual work at the lighthouse was upkeep and managing supplies. All of this supported the one crucial task - keeping the lighthouse’s light lit all night to warn ships of the rocky coastline. On a clear night you could see the light for miles. On a night with high fog, you may not see it at all. The lighthouse’s high elevation was a double-edged sword – it often put the light above the fog line, where it was obscured. What would you do on a foggy night if you were the keeper? On more than one occasion, the last and longest keeper, Robert Israel, improvised. He grabbed a gun and fired off warning shots from the shore to alert nearby boats! \n\nWhat was family life like, living where the keeper worked? It was much like anywhere else, just more remote—the lighthouse was a home after all. The kids still went to school, the family tended a garden, and there were plenty of books for everyone to read – the Lighthouse Board provided a portable library. The family would also go down to the coast and gather shellfish like abalone, often turning leftover shells into arts and crafts. In one case, Robert Israel’s wife, Mary, even became the Assistant Keeper for a couple years! \n\nAs you wander the grounds, imagine what it would be like to live and work here. Do you think you could do it? What do you think would be the most fun? What do you think would be hardest? Now imagine trying to live here in the ocean. There’s a whole world here beneath the blue waves of the Pacific!",

                    "audioTranscript": "You are standing in front of the Kelp Forest and Whale Overlook, a short, paved walkway with magnificent views over the Pacific Ocean. These elevated cliffs are the perfect place to watch hawks flying, ships sailing, and whales migrating just below. That’s right! The Pacific Gray Whale travels through the water below during its annual migration. Bring your own binoculars to the park and you’ll have a better chance of seeing one (or many) along their approximately 10,000 mile (16,093 km) trip! Pacific Gray Whales have one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal on Earth. \n\nWhy do they make this trip, which puts them through great hardship and takes them away from their main food source? For the survival of their species! Gray whales spend the summer months feeding in the Arctic, where the nutrient-rich cold waters harbor their primary source of food. In the fall, they begin the long journey south down the coast. Calves are born during migration or in the shallow lagoons and bays off Baja California, Mexico. These shallow, protected bays act as a nursery for the calves; allowing them to put on weight and build muscles for their long journey back.  The prime time to see whales from Cabrillo is late December through mid-March. \n\nLook for the Blow or Spout - these spouts are created when warm, moist air exhaled from a whale’s lungs meets the cool air at the ocean’s surface. They can be up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) high and each one is visible for about 5 seconds! These can be seen from here even without binoculars. Also look for the tail! Gray whales typically spout 3-5 times before taking a big breath for a deep dive. Before their deepest dive, gray whales often display their 12-foot fan-shaped flukes, or tails. The weight of the tail above the whale’s body helps the whale dive deep. Finally, Look for a breach and splash. Sometimes gray whales hurl themselves out of the water and plunge back in with a huge splash. This is called breaching. Breaching is a rare occurrence, as these whales are trying to conserve as much energy as they can during their long migration.\n\nPro tip: Look for large white boats with a lot of people onboard. These are whale watching boats. Find one of these and you are almost guaranteed to see a whale spouting nearby.  \n\nFrom here, set your gaze about hundred yards off of shore where you will see discolored blotches of water – it may not look like much, but you are looking at an entire forest of kelp! During a good low tide you can also see the Rocky Intertidal area exposed at the shoreline. The tidepools become exposed during a low tide event and act as a window into the ocean, exposing plant and animals life normally covered by water!\n\nAs you walk along this loop trail, do you notice anything out of the ordinary? Perhaps you noticed the man-made bunker-like structures punctuating and blending into the hillside. Why are they here and what were they for? Let's take a look!",

                    "audioTranscript": "You are currently standing next to the fire control station for Battery Humphreys. The two bunkers that comprise it are part of a network of hillside buildings used to aim and fire two 6-inch guns that were located just south of here. These coastal artillery cannons were used to defend the southern approach to San Diego during World War II.\n\nThe lower bunker served as an observation post that was used to aim the battery’s guns while the top bunker was the command post where the firing order was given. This order was the “trigger” that told the actual guns at the main battery fire.\n\nThe guns of Battery Humphreys worked in concert with the other artillery emplacements in San Diego to cover each other’s gaps and provide coverage for the whole city. The other gun emplacements similarly needed networks of observation and fire-control stations, just like Battery Humphreys did. For example, the fire control station bunker for Battery Ashburn has a similar setup. The top bunker served as the command post, while the lower bunker served as one of its observation posts.\n\nThe soldiers here were the last line of defense against a full-scale invasion. The thought that San Diego could become the next Pearl Harbor weighed heavily on everyone's mind. Imagine knowing that an attack could come from the horizon at any minute, and that 400,000 San Diegans were depending on you with their lives. How would that effect your decision making on the job?\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of a duty officer, for a moment. It’s the middle of a foggy night and the radar operator detects a large object heading towards San Diego. You contact the navy and harbor control to see if any ships are expected off Point Loma – there aren’t. The ship is alone and isn’t responding to radio. What do you do? Do you risk firing on a non-responsive friendly ship? Maybe their radio is down. Or do you risk letting an enemy slip into the bay unchallenged?\n\nA scenario like this actually happened to duty officer George S. Prugh when a heavy cruiser involved in a classified mission sailed into San Diego but didn’t use any radio communications until it was exceptionally close. Fortunately, nothing happened. He later reflected, “I’ve often wondered about how near this came to being a disaster – and how close I came to making a bit of history.”\n\nThe coastal artillery of Point Loma and its soldiers gave San Diego a way to engage conventional enemy ships before they got in range of the city and its harbor. Any invaders had to deal with the window-rattling blasts of coastal artillery and the vigilant soldiers that watched the coast. As a local, the blasts may rattle your house, but how would they make you feel, knowing the canons were there to protect you?\n\nWhen you get a chance, take a moment to gaze across the city. What part of San Diego do you most want to protect?",

I hung the skirt set in my closet to wait for the big day.\n\nNARRATOR: Terrence Roberts\n  \nROBERTS: The conversations at home that night before did not include much speculation about what the next day might bring, just the usual banter typical of our household full of children. \n\nWALLS: That night Mrs. Bates had called again to tell my parents to drop me off at 8:30 a.m. at 13th and Park Street, about a block from the school. An interracial group of ministers would meet us there to escort us to school, she said. We wouldn’t have to walk alone.\n\nNARRATOR: Elizabeth Eckford\n\nECKFORD: The night before, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep.\n\nROBERTS: Perhaps the most significant thing said came from my parents. “Son,” they said, “we want you to know that if you are set on going through with this, we are behind you. But if you decide not to do it, you have our full support for that decision, too.”\n\nWALLS: Governor Faubus appeared on late-night television to make a speech about Central. My parents liked Faubus. They had voted for him twice before. He was a man of the people, I’d heard them say, not a strident segregationist. My parents and I had no clue that Faubus was moments away from announcing a bold, about-face move that would write Little Rock’s civil rights history.\n\nNARRATOR: Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus\n\nFAUBUS: Units of the National Guard have been mobilized with the mission to maintain the peace and good order of this community, and to act in every way possible to protect the lives and property of the citizens of Pulaski County.\n\nWALLS: I was a citizen of Pulaski County. My parents paid taxes; they were citizens, too. I honestly believed that I was included in those our governor was deploying the Guard to protect.

Already, my parents and I had witnessed the gathering crowds around the school as we tuned in to the morning TV news shows. We calculated, however, that the imagined threat was bigger by far than any real element of danger based on the fact that National Guardsmen were there. \n\nCARLOTTA WALLS: At the meeting spot, we noticed a small group of students; although I couldn’t see Elizabeth or Terrence or Melba, there were two black ministers whom Mother recognized. Three older white ministers and a young white man were there, too. We chatted anxiously until one of the ministers approached and said it was time to get moving. But first, he said, we needed to pray.\n\nNARRATOR: [Arkansas] Gazette Editor [Harry] Ashmore\n\nHARRY ASHMORE: At Second Presbyterian Church yesterday, the Reverend Marion A. Boggs offered a special prayer: \n\nREVEREND MARION A. BOGGS: We pray that all persons in authority be given wisdom, and we ask God to restrain the passions of violent men. We pray that we will not suffer the spirit of lawlessness to gain ascendancy in our community, and that all the persons have the patience to wait the due process of law.\n\n[BACKGROUND NOISE OF HOSTILE CROWD AT CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL]\n\nHARRY ASHMORE: These words speak for the great silent, mass of our people who abhor violence, respect the law, and would be ashamed for any child of any race to look upon the naked face of hatred.\n\n[BACKGROUND NOISE OF HOSTILE CROWD AT CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL]\n\nELIZABETH ECKFORD: And I got off a block from school.

I didn’t know what to do. So, I walked until I was right in front of the path to the front door.\n\nNARRATOR: Arkansas Gazette\n\nARKANSAS GAZETTE: She made an attempt in the middle of the line to cross onto the school grounds and again was stopped by Guardsmen, \n\nANGRY WOMAN IN THE CROWD: “Don’t let her in our school — that ‘nigger’.”\n\nELIZABETH ECKFORD: I stood looking at the school — it looked so big! Just then, the guards let some white students through. The crowd was quiet again, waiting to see what was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in.\n\nNARRATOR: Arkansas Democrat\n\nARKANSAS DEMOCRAT: As she walked along the Guard line in the street in front of the high school, the crowd followed, calling her names.\n\nANGRY WOMAN IN THE CROWD: “Go home nigger, you will never get into this school. We don’t want you here.”\n\nELIZABETH ECKFORD: They glared at me with a mean look, and I was very frightened but didn’t know what to do. I turned around, and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer.\n\nNARRATOR: [Arkansas] Democrat Photographer Will Counts\n\nWILL COUNTS: Her imperturbable walk through the mob has become a slow-motion cinema verité memory. I still find it difficult to believe that this display of racial hatred was happening in front of my old high school — and my camera.\n\nNARRATOR: [Arkansas] Gazette [Editor] Harry Ashmore\n\nHARRY ASHMORE: But the point is that the armed troops Governor Faubus placed around Central High School had orders to keep the Negro children out of school – and did so. Until last Thursday, the matter of gradual, limited integration in the Little Rock schools was a local problem. On that day, Mr. Faubus appeared in court on behalf of a small but militant minority and chose to make it a state problem. On Monday night, he called out the National Guard and made it a national problem.\n\nThis tour has retraced the walk of Elizabeth Eckford during the first attempt to integrate Central High School on September 4, 1957.

In 1976 Billy’s station became famous nationwide as journalists covering Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaign made it their headquarters. In 1981 Billy sold his station to his son-in-law, Mark Fuller.",

We would wake up each morning when the bell would ring, about 4 o’clock sun time, which was long before sunrise. We didn’t have any electricity and we didn’t have running water in the house; we got water from hand pumps for both livestock and our own use. It was quite a change for us when electricity came. My daddy believed in everyone on the farm doing their share. Here in the back yard we had chicken and ducks and guinea hens that we had to feed and of course we to sweep the yards all the time. We also had to cut wood and bring it in the house for Mama to use on the stove and also the fireplaces to keep us warm. The hardest work, though, was in the field: I had to carry water in two-and-a-half gallon buckets to workers in the field on hot days, and when I got older of course I helped milk the cows. But I also had a lot of fun as a child – I played with my playmates who lived nearby, particularly whenever it rained and we couldn’t work in the field or after the crops were plowed and before the harvest. We pushed steel barrel hoops with a wire pusher, and in the nearby streams we went fishing regularly, we built small dams, we went swimming in the creeks, so we had a lot of fun around the house and barns, and also in the distant fields",

One of the presents he sent me was a small model of a Chinese junk or ship, and of course it was one of my most cherished possessions. One of my fondest memories was of Christmas morning when I was a little boy. I had long wanted a pony, and was discouraged from expecting it but I woke up one Christmas – I was ill, I couldn’t get out of the house because I had measles, and my mother and father said that maybe Santa Claus had left me something outside in the yard so I raised the window in my bedroom, looked out, and there was a pony. I had never been more excited in my life; and then of course for years I rode my pony, whom I called Lady – she had colts that I cherished, and it really was a transforming moment of my boyhood. As a boy I was an avid reader, as was my mother. Whenever I was asked what I wanted for Christmas, for Santa Claus to bring me, I always said books. Reading was really my major contact with the outside world… what happened in Africa with Tarzan, what happened with Tom Swift and his adventures, and developments in scientific developments of those days. It was reading and the books that opened up my eyes to the world that I didn’t yet know as a boy. That reading habit stuck with me throughout my life and that’s one of the reasons I still like to read and write books of my own.",

It was placed in the living room and we would all sit and watch the radio while we listened to the exciting programs of a very limited nature. Daddy was very stingy about running the battery down so our time was limited. Most of our listening was in the evening and our course sometimes on the weekend when we were not working. We really enjoyed programs like Amos and Andy, Little Orphan Annie, and Fibber McGee and Mollie.\n(Radio program excerpt: well I must say…McGee, McGee, she’s here inside. Doorbell chimes)\nUsually we all watched and listened the radio at the same time but I had a special interest in Glenn Miller’s music which unfortunately came on quite late at night, like eight o’clock. Daddy would let me stay up after the other family went to bed. I would lie in front of the fireplace, we had a clock on the mantle in the living room, and when eight o’clock came I would turn on the radio and listen to Glenn Miller for fifteen minutes. \n(music plays) \nOne of my most vivid memories about the radio is when there was a heavyweight boxing match between Joe Lewis who was black and Max Schmeling a white German. \n(Announcer)\nHere is the biggest show on Earth. Joe Lewis the worlds heavyweight champion versus Max Schmeling, Germany’s contender.\n(Bell rings)\n(Announcer)\nWeighing one ninety-eight and three quarters, wearing black trunks, the famous Detroit Brown Bomber, world’s heavyweight champion, Joe Lewis. \n(President Jimmy Carter)\nThis was a rematch, and it was filled with heavy racial overtones I guess all over the world, but particularly in the deep south.  As the time for the math approached, our black neighbors, about thirty or forty of them asked my father if they could listen to the radio. Daddy approved of course and in the living room on the windowsill he put the radio so that you could hear it inside the house and outside under the mulberry tree. A large crowd assembled out there. In the first round Joe Lewis almost Killed Max Schmeling. \n\n(Announcer)\nFive, six, seven, eight …the men are in the ring. The fight is over on a technical knockout. Max Schmeling is beaten in one round. The first time in a world…\n(President Jimmy Carter)\nOur neighbors observing their southern proprieties didn’t make a sound. They very carefully walked out of the yard, crossed the railroad, and went to a distant house. They celebrated until the wee hours of the morning.",

                    "audioTranscript": "We had a store, or what we called a commissary, on the farm which was quite common in rural communities because they provided the basic necessities that had to be bought by the workers and by our family as well. What happened, usually, was that the purchases were on credit. And payment for the different items were made on payday, or sometimes even at the end of the season when the crops were harvested. The stores were convenient for three reasons: One, they were close by and most of the transportation was on foot. Secondly, the land owner, the larger ones, owned the store and wanted to make a profit on items sold. And third, the people who lived on the farm or nearby, quite often had no credit rating in town. Whereas a land owner, that owned the store, would know them and if they wanted to buy a pair of shoes or a shirt or some tobacco they didn’t have to worry about credit because they had ready credit, since the landowner knew them well and since the landowner knew that when he paid them for their work he could collect the bill. \n\nThis store was not kept open all the time but it was open all day Saturday, because that was a day for major purchases, that was the day when workers were paid and when they paid off what they owed. The rest of the week the store was closed except when anyone wanted to make any kind of purchase. Both we and they were out of the fields during mealtimes. So almost every time I ever sat down at a meal, someone knocked on the back door and wanted to make a purchase from the store, my daddy would throw the keys across the table to me, I would get up and miss part of the meal, walk out to the store, unlock it, sell five cents worth of chewing tobacco or a bottle of castor oil or two pounds of sugar, make a ticket showing that the person had bought something on credit, lock the store back up, then go back to our meal. I hardly ever remember going through an entire meal without having to be interrupted to go to the store and open it to make a sale.",

Here we shod mules and horses, we sharpened plow points, repaired machinery, made simple iron implements, and did woodwork also, with daddy providing overall supervision. This is one of the first places where I was able to work alongside my father. I would turn the hand crank of the forge blower fast enough to keep the charcoal fire ablaze and then would hold some of the red hot pieces on the anvil with tongs while my daddy shaped them with a hammer and then plunged them, hissing into the water or oil for tempering. I learned a lot of skills from my father in this very building, and also from Jack Clark, our farm supervisor, who did most of the shoeing of our mules and horses. Of course, I also learned farm techniques at school. There was certainly no assurance that I would ever go to the Naval Academy so I had to prepare for other future possibilities. And, the most natural would be as a farmer. So, along with more than half the other boys in my high school I joined the Future Farmers of America program. We took many agricultural classes and, in the workshop at school, we practiced carpentry and blacksmithing, welding, and furniture making. Our teacher worked closely with each of our fathers to ensure that our work at school was compatible with what was being done on the farm.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The barn was the center of our attention on the farm because all of our work was focused there. It was a very exciting place, as a matter of fact. We caught the mules and horses early in the morning, took them to the field hooked to wagons and plows. That’s where we brought them back at night for feed and for watering. We also had a good time around the barn. For instance, when daddy thrashed oats and wheat, we had a thrashing machine just behind the barn and we would have a big pile of loose hay. We used to get a running start in the loft of the barn and leap out of the window and land on the soft pile of hay. Throughout my young life I worked and played with my boyhood neighbors. My neighbors were African American. And we were equal to one another. But, when I was about fourteen years old, there was a profound experience that I had, that didn’t seem to be important at the time. But later in my life I realized it was one of the turning points in my life. I wrote a poem about it. \nThe pasture gate: This empty house, three miles from town was where I lived. Here I was back, and found most homes around were gone. The folks who stayed here now were black, like Johnny and A.D., my friends. As boys we worked in Daddy’s fields, hunted rabbits, squirrels, and quail, caught and cooked catfish and eels, searched the land for arrowheads, tried to fly the smallest kite, steered barrel hoops with strands of wire, and wrestled hard. At times we’d fight, without a thought of who might be boss, who was the smartest or the best; the leader for a few brief hours was who had won the last contest. But then – we were fourteen or so – as we approached the pasture gate, they went to open it, and then stood back. This made me hesitate, sure it must have been a joke, a tripwire, maybe, they had planned. I reckon they had to obey their parents’ prompting. Or command. We only saw it vaguely then, but we were transformed at that place. A silent line was drawn between friend and friend, race and race.",

                    "audioTranscript": "In addition to my mother and father, there were a few people that shaped my life. Two of them were Jack and Rachel Clark, who lived in this house. When my mother and father would go off on vacation, I would stay with Jack and Rachel and they provided me with information about the basic rudiments of life, the priorities that any human being should accrue, and also my entrée into understanding how the sharecroppers and day laborers lived in a strictly segregated society. Much later I wrote a poem about Rachel Clark titled “Rachel”: My young life, shaped by those I loved, felt the gentle touch of Rachel Clark, our neighbor on the farm, whose husband, Jack, cared for the barn and did the kind of work that we boys most admired. He tended mules, and rang the cast-iron bell that brought an end to sleep, and later told the time to rest. His wife was small and quiet. Her brown skin fixed her in our segregated world, yet Rachel had the aura of a queen that somehow wouldn’t let the white folks ask for her to do the chores around their place – like cooking, ironing clothes or tending babes. But she would volunteer with quiet grace any time she learned the need was real. For miles around, the farming folks would know what Rachel did while working in the field. I’d pick a hundred and fifty pounds or so of cotton if I never stopped to rest – no man could do much more – but Rachel Clark could pick near twice as much as second best. At sundown we would tie what we had got in burlap sheets, and watch the foreman weigh, see for ourselves that Rachel had the most, and if she had topped her own best mark that day. She’d put a lot more peanuts on the stacks, hoe more weeds, shuck more corn – no one, in fact, could equal anything she did. These kinds of deeds that may seem small to some were big events for use, in which we all competed, as our farm life would allow. When work was done, or when a heavy rain made the fields too wet to hoe or plow and open cotton bolls too damp to pick sometimes she’d smile at me and mention fish. Then she and I would leave the farm and walk six miles or so to reach a stream she knew. These journeys gave us ample time to talk – or rather, I would listen to her words, as she would think awhile, and then hold forth about God’s holy way: how, when we deal with nature, we are stewards of the earth, she’d say that blessings bring on debts to pay, describe the duties of a man and wife, and say that the brave and strongest need not fight. She’d tell how praying gave her life a lift, and how it made her act and not just talk – like staying up all night with someone sick. It wasn’t empty preaching, like in church: sometimes I wasn’t glad to reach the creek. Our bait was crawfish, lizards, crickets, worms or whatever she would recommend for perch, catfish, and bass – which we call trout, misnamed by our European kin, or mine at least’ I knew that Rachel’s folks were brought, themselves, to be my people’s slaves. The swamps and woodlands came alive for me. She taught the way every person craves to learn. Our creels were empty flour sacks that kept our catch in water, fresh and safe from water snakes and snapping turtles, that would have left us bones instead of fish. Rachel used exactly seven poles, for reasons I never could figure out. I asked her, “Why not eight or six?” She only smiled at me, then went ahead and caught, with luck or skill, five fish to one of mine. She made it seem a favor, heading home if some of hers would end up in my sack. Those might have been the best days I have known. With my folks gone, I’d stay with her and Jack. Newspapered walls all leaned, the sagging doors stayed open, letting flies and breezes in. I smelled the lye that cleaned the holy floors. Saving kerosene, we slept at dusk on lumpy corn shucks, not my feather bed. They always made me feel like I belonged, and knew what things were better left unsaid. Although the food was plain and seldom changed, I never thought our big house down the road was better. They all knew I liked to be with Rachel Clark. I guess my feelings showed. In later years, I’d visit Rachel’s home In public housing; sometimes I’d find her on the village street. Then, still a queen, her apron sagging with a can of beer, she’d laugh about what good times there had been, and tell me what she thought I ought to do in Washington, where I was working then.",

There was a closeness, almost an immersion in the sand, loam, and red clay that seemed both natural and constant. I remember how enjoyable it was to walk behind the plow, my bare feet caressed by the soft and cool freshly turned earth. The Great Depression really devastated our rural farming economy. The New Deal programs initiated under President Roosevelt’s administration helped to combat this economic downturn and were meant to help farmers conserve the precious topsoil making the land more productive. On our farm, we concentrated on minimizing erosion by terracing the fields and planting the rows on contour. We planted soil building crops like clover, legumes, and vetch; and we worked to enhance wildlife habitat. I learned early on that if we take care of the land, it will take care of us. It may or may not be my descendants who live on our land in the future, but I’m confident that the earth itself will basically remain the same, continuing to shape the lives of its owners for good or ill, as it has for generations. It’s good to realize that if love and peace can prevail on earth, and if we can teach our children to honor nature’s gifts, the joy and beauties of the outdoors will be here forever.",

As you drove into the park today you probably noticed a number of monuments and cannon. This park was established in 1894 and they were placed to mark the positions of military units during the battle of Shiloh. You may wonder how the terrain has changed since the time of the battle in April 1862. One major change, to keep in mind, is that in most places the wooded areas had much less undergrowth and were clearer than today. This was a farming community and the farmers let their livestock run loose, with the result that most of the undergrowth had been trampled or eaten. Where the cannon appear to be pointed at thick woods today, you would have been able to see several hundred yards in 1862.",

Col. Joseph Dana Webster, Grant's Chief of Staff was ordered to place infantry and artillery units in line here after they came off the battlefield and were resupplied. \n\nHe had men detailed to drag five 24-pounder iron siege guns, normally pulled by oxen, from the boats at the landing to take a key position in the defense. Around the nucleus of this artillery was placed a total of 50 cannon and about 20,000 infantry to hold back the Confederates. \n\nUnion forces were thrown into a temporary panic when Gage's Alabama Battery unlimbered on the other side of the ravine and started firing toward the landing. A cannonball took off the head of Capt. Irving Carson, a volunteer scout, who was accompanying Grant.\n\nGen. William \"Bull\" Nelson had arrived in Savannah at Grant's Headquarters the evening of April 5th and had been advised he could march to the bank opposite Pittsburg Landing to be ferried across. Hearing the noise of the battle, Nelson sent the message to his men struggling through a \"black mud swamp\". \"Col. Ammen, the General sends his compliments to hurry up or all will be lost; the enemy is driving our men.\" \n\nOn reaching the opposite bank, Nelson and his staff were ferried across the river. Nelson was appalled at the thousands of shirkers he witnessed cowering under the riverbank. ·When the gangplank dropped at Pittsburg Landing, Nelson shouted to his staff, \"Gentlemen, draw your sabers and trample these bastards into the mud!\"",

The original church, built about 1853, was a one-room, rough-hewn log building, simple in appearance, with no stained windows, no pulpit, and no carved decorations. It did have two doors and one. window but without glass. The reproduction wooden church you see across the parking lot is based on a drawing made by a soldier before the battle. Unfortunately, like most of the more than 70 log buildings present at Shiloh in 1862, the original church was damaged in the momentous battle that took its name. \n\nAt around 7:00 am on April 6, Gen. William T. Sherman, whose headquarters tent was in the woods behind the church, placed the three Ohio regiments of Col. Ralph Buckland' s Brigade on the hill to the right, across the road from the church, where you see the two cannons and monument for Barrett's Illinois Battery, and the two remaining Ohio, regiments of Col. Jesse Hildebrand's Brigade to the left supporting the guns of Waterhouse's Illinois Battery.\n\nThis was a good defensive position, since the Confederates would have to come up the hill in the face of concentrated musket and cannon fire, after making their way through the swampy ground of Shiloh Branch. Confederate units stalled as they met this obstacle and the intense fire from Sherman's men. By 10:00 AM, three Confederate Brigades had become entangled in the low ground of Shiloh Branch as they were stopped by Union resistance and tenain. Col. William B. Bate commanding the 2nd Tennessee, on the left flank General Cleburne's Brigade, tried to make an attack against the flank of the Federal position but his unit lost heavily when caught in a severe crossfire. After his brother Capt. Humphrey Bate was killed he ordered another attack against Barrett's Battery but was badly wounded in the left leg and his unit fell back. \n\nBate would later become a Major General and Senator and Governor from Tem1essee. He would raise the money to have a monument erected to his unit with the quote,\" Stranger, Go tell Tennessee that we died here fighting for her.\" This monument would be the first Confederate monument placed on the Shiloh Battlefield in 1905. If you would like to see the monument near the spot Bate was wounded follow the trail across the road in front of the cannon a short distance to the monument and that of their opponents, the 70th Ohio, commanded by Col. Joseph R. Cockerill. Col. Cockerill's son, John, a sixteen year old musician in the 24th Ohio had come to visit his father· s camp at Shiloh to recover from an illness. The young man would provide a recollection of his first action here.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Although Peabody's patrol provided some warning the Union Army would be surprised by the magnitude of the Confederate attack that hit them on the morning of April 6th. The majority of troops, approximately 65 percent, in both the western Union and Confederate armies were green, raw recruits who had never been in battle, \"seen the elephant' as they said in those days. Another factor was the belief by Union generals that General Johnston would not attack, but remain on defense in Corinth, fortify his position, and wait for the threatened Union offensive. Grant's instructions from his own superior, General Henry W. Halleck, headquartered in St. Louis, forbade him to advance until Buell an-ived on his overland march from Nashville and reinforced Grant with the Army of the Ohio. Grant wo1Tied more about training the inexperienced recruits and preparing for the planned offensive, than he did about the intentions Gen. Johnston. In obedience to Halleck's instructions not to engage the Confederates, each time Union pickets or patrols encountered enemy forces prior to the battle; they simply defended their positions and were forbidden to advance: As one Union recruit recalled decades later when the Rebel onslaught rolled into the Federal camps that Sabbath morning, the entire Federal army reacted as if it had been \"struck by an electric shock.\" \n\nGen. William T. Sherman was among those shocked by the Confederate onslaught. Here at Rhea Field, he first became aware of the Confederate attack. On April 4th a detachment of Sherman' s infantry and cavalry had encountered Confederates in strength, including cavalry, artillery, and infantry a short march from camp. When his officers expressed concern about the presence of a strong enemy force, Sherman said, \"Oh! Tut; tut. You militia officers get scared too easily.\" \n\nSherman concluded that the force was a Confederate brigade making a reconnaissance in force of the Union camps. \nCol. Jesse Appler had his 53rd Ohio Infantry camped in the field across the road in an isolated position cut off from the rest of his brigade by Shiloh Branch. On April St􀀴 Appler sent a detachment to investigate signs of enemy activity and when firing broke out he formed his regiment and sent his quartermaster to notify Sherman, who was camped near Shiloh Church. Sherman sent Appler the message: \"Take your damned regiment back to Ohio, There is no enemy nearer than Corinth.\" Sherman would send a letter to Grant on April 5th, stating: \"I will not be drawn out far unless with certainty of advantage, and I do not apprehend anything like an attack on our position.\" \n\nGrant would write his superior on the evening of April 5th: \"The main force of the enemy is at Corinth scarcely the faintest idea of an attack being made upon us, but will be prepared should such a thing take place.\" \n\nOn the morning of April 6th Jesse Appler, camped here at Rhea Field felt anything but secure as he heard the noise of action at Fraley Field, a short distance away. He sent messengers to warn his Division Commander, Sherman. The messenger to Sherman reported back, \"General Sherman says you must be badly scared over there.\" Appler would form his men in line facing south where you can see the monument for the 53rd Ohio. \nFinally, sometime after 7 am, Sherman appeared with his staff to examine the situation. While Sherman was looking to the southern end of the field, where Confederates had been spotted, Confederate skirmishers, advancing in front of Gen. Patrick Cleburne's Brigade, emerged from the woods on the west side of the field. Seeing the threat Adjutant Dawes of the 53rd Ohio, yelled out to Lt. Eustace Ball, of Company E: \"Ball, Sherman will be shot!\" Ball yelled out, \n\"General look to your right!\" As the Confederates fired, Sherman was hit in the hand by a piece of buckshot and his aide, next to him, Private Thomas D. Holliday, was hit and instantly killed. Sherman said, \"The shot that killed him was meant for me\". My God, we are attacked!\" Sherman's Division was under attack from Gen. Patrick Clebune's Brigade, part of the first line of the Confederate attack, over 6,700 men under Gen. William Hardee. Sherman told Col. Appler, \"Hold your position; I will support you\". Sherman moved back to the area of Shiloh Chuch to organize a defense of the hill above Shiloh Branch. \n\nWith Confederates coming into Rhea Field from the west and crossing to the south, Appler withdrew the 53rd Ohio to the wood line on the east side of the field and reformed facing the field. Gen. Patrick Cleburne led his brigade forward into the marshy ground along Shiloh Branch. As he urged his horse forward into the brush he was thrown off into the mud. His Brigade, hitting the same morass, split in two with two regiments the 6th Mississippi Infantry and 23rd Tennessee moving off to the east toward this Field. These two regiments would charge across the field across the road from you taking artillery fire on their left flank from Waterhouse's Batter",

                    "audioTranscript": "Grant and his generals believed that the Southerners did not possess the resolve, nor the ability, to attack them in the open field. The Northern generals all missed the motivation behind the Confederate concentration at Corinth. They viewed the deployment as having been made for the defense of the important railroads only, when in reality the Confederates had gathered together their scattered western forces for the purpose of mounting a major counter-offensive. \n\nOn the night of April 2, Albert Sidney Johnston received information that Buell, moving overland from Nashville with the Army of the Ohio was but a few days march from Savannah. On Beauregard's advice that \"now is the time to go,\" Johnston determined to move at once, assemble his troops and attack Grant at Pittsburg Landing. The surprise attack was planned to begin on April 4th, but there were several unfortunate delays.\n\nThat evening, April 5, after three days of delays, Johnston's army lay deployed within striking distance of the forward Union camps at Shiloh Church. In a meeting of the Confederate generals, Beauregard, who had helped plan the attack, voiced concern that the element of surprise had been lost. General Hardee's troops, who had led the advance, had fought a number of skirmishes with Union pickets and cavalry for the last two days. Both Beauregard and General Braxton Bragg pointed out that the Confederate troops were out of rations and completely exhausted from the muddy marching conditions. Furthermore, Beauregard believed that the alerted Yankees were now entrenched to the eyes! He felt they should cancel the attack and return to Corinth. Johnston decided otherwise: \"Gentlemen\" he said to his staff: \"We shall attack at daylight tomorrow. I would fight them if they were a million.\" Johnston's battle plan was to strike the Union left sweep through to Pittsburg Landing, denying Grant access to supplies and reinforcements, and trap the Union Army against the swampy ground along Snake and Owl Creeks. \n\nFraley Field, where the first shots were fired, is a two-minute walk down the path to the west. The field to the north- east is known as Seay :field. \nBy nightfall on April 5, Union soldiers in the forward camps had grown nervous and apprehensive. Many of the Federals reported having seen formations of enemy cavalry, or heard the sounds of drums and bugles, arid some claimed to have seen sunlight reflect off distant cannon barrels in the forest. The concerns of the Union pickets were passed up the line, but at division headquarters the warnings went unheeded. \n\nAlarmed by recent brushes with Confederate patrols, and by reports that strange sounds and movements could be heard in front of the picket lines, Union Colonel Everett Peabody, a Massachusetts graduate of Harvard and railroad construction engineer from Missouri, decided to act on his own judgment. Without advising his superior, General Benjamin Prentiss, of his action, the colonel ordered Maj. James Powell of the 25th Missouri Infantry, to take a patrol and reconnoiter forward of the army's pickets for potential enemy forces. Powell's small force of 250 men rolled out of their blankets at 3 a.m. Within the hour, the small patrol moved out and disappeared into the darkness, advancing southwest along an old wagon trace now called Reconnoitering Road. As the first streaks of dawn gathered on the eastern horizon, Powell's men discovered three Rebel horsemen on the Corinth Road. Warning shots rang out, as the mounted troopers fired on the advancing Federals at about 4:55 a.m. Powell deployed his anxious troops into a dispersed skirmish line and advanced westward towards the farm of J.C. Fraley. As they emerged frori1 the woods into Fraley :field, the Union troops encountered two Confederate picket posts and more scattered shots pierced the still morning air. On high ground to the west, across the old cotton :field, Powell's men saw shadowy forms scattered along a fence. Suddenly, the dark western horizon flashed yellow-bright with the blast of nearly 300 muskets as Confederate pickets from the 3rd Mississippi Battalion, under Maj. Aaron B. Hardcastle, fired into the Yankee patrol. Powell's men returned the fire. The battle of Shiloh had begun. The skirmish in Fraley field lasted about an hour with little change, except the steady exodus of wounded.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Throughout the morning, Sunday, April 6, Union soldiers assigned to the division of General Prentiss and that of Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman, holding ground at Shiloh church, stubbornly contested a number of defensive lines in an effort to halt the Confederate tide of battle. Here within its camp, Prentiss's division made a brief second stand. By then, the green Union troops were heavily outnumbered by massed Confederate brigades and flanked by advancing columns of southern troops on both ends of the camp. \n\nCol. Peabody, already bleeding from four wounds, rode among the tents of his command attempting to rally his troops, shouting, \"Stand to it Yet!\" He was suddenly hit in the head by a musket ball and instantly killed, next to his headquaiiers tent. His brigade began to break up and fall back as the Confederate attack continued. The monument to your right with an upright cannon surrounded by four small pyramids of cannonballs is a mortuary monument. You will see other places on the battlefield 'marked with these monuments where brigade commanders or higher ranking generals were killed or mortally wounded. \n\nOn Prentiss left flank about half a mile to the east, behind you, was Prentiss' other brigade commanded by Col. Madison Miller. Miller's green brigade was eating breakfast. The newly organized 61st Illinois was still in camp when a staff officer rushed over yelling,  \"My God! This regiment's not in line yet! They have been fighting on the right for over an hour!\" Col. Miller's Brigade would form in line and inflict heavy casualties on Gen. Adley Gladden's attacking Confederates, including Gladden who would be mortally wounded by exploding case shot from a Union artillery battery. The Union forces were soon outnumbered and outflanked by Gen. James Chalmers' Brigade.\n \nAt 9:00 a.m., Prentiss's front collapsed. The routed northern soldiers fled through their camp towards the Hamburg-Purdy road a half-mile to the north. Gen. Prentiss would manage to rally some of his men along a farm road, now known as the \"Sunken Road\", about a mile to the north. Many of the defeated troops would continue running though until they reached Pittsburg Landing where they formed a disorganized mob.\n\nMany of the Confederate soldiers had eaten their rations several clays before and were now hungry after their difficult march from Corinth. As they overran the Union camps they found fresh food and other items of interest in the abandoned camps.\n\nConfederates were leaving the ranks to loot the captured camps helping themselves to Union supplies and often straggling and becoming separated from their units.\n \nGen. Johnston riding forward on Fire Eater behind the victorious Confederates entered the camp of the 18th Wisconsin which had just been captured. When he saw an officer coming out of a Union tent with valuables he rebuked him, \"None of that, sir; we are not here for plunder!\" Seeing the shame of his subordinate, Johnston leaned from his horse and picked up a tin cup in the camp, stating, \"Let this be my share of the spoils to-clay.\" He then ordered the men to keep advancing toward the battle. Seeing wounded enemy soldiers in the same camp, Johnston instructed his personal physician, Dr. D. W. Yandell to give them medical assistance. \"These men were our enemies a moment ago, they are prisoners now; take care of them.\" \n\nScouting reports gathered by the Confederates before the battle had indicated to Gen. Johnston that Prentiss' Division was the left flank of the Union Army and that Shiloh Church was a mile closer to the landing than it was. Gen. Sherman's Division was still fighting the attacking Confederates near Shiloh Church and another line of camps, McClernand's Division, could be seen beyond them. Under the impression that he had turned the Union left, and unaware that there were still two Union divisions between him and the landing, Gen. Johnston committed the bulk of the army to driving northwest against the remaining Union opposition. Victory appeared at hand if the Confederates could push the remaining Union forces toward Owl Creek with ten of the sixteen Confederate infantry brigades.\n\nAs you look down the road just past the Arkansas Monument you will see a heavily wooded area to your left. This is one part of the battlefield which was thicker in 1862 than it is today. This was an area of second growth with brush, briars, and vines making it almost impassible which would become known as the Hornet's Nest. \n\nBy 9 AM, Gen Prentiss had managed to rally some of his troops a short distance to your left on a farm road which became known as the \"sunken road\".

Prentiss had managed to rally some of his troops a short distance to your left on a farm road which became known as the \"sunken road\". With fragments of the regiments that had fought earlier in the day, two artillery batteries and the newly arrived 23rd Missouri, Prentiss had approximately 1,100 men. Prentiss' soldiers had seen the elephant and were shaky, according to one officer from the 44th Indiana they \"acted like a flock of frightened sheep, ready to start in any direction.\" \n\nBy 10 a.m., parts of two Union brigades commanded by General William Wallace joined Prentiss to form a strong line of defense, facing west-southwest, along this old wagon road. Just to the east two Indiana Regiments from Gen. Stephen Hurlbut's Division would help hold the line until 2 PM. This made over 8,000 Union troops available in this area to hold the Union center. For the next six hours, while the bulk of the Confederate army engaged either the right or left flank of Grant's army, a succession of piecemeal brigade sized attacks were hurled through the dense oak thicket south of this area against the Federals. Legend states there were a total of eleven Southern assaults repulsed on this line. Actually, historical accounts document seven to nine failed Confederate charges. In no instance during these assaults through the thicket did the attacking Confederate force number more than 3,500 men, while the opposing Union force numbered 6,200 men and 27 cannon, with an additional 2,500 infantry held in reserve. \n\nAdvised by General Grant to hold this position at all hazards, the troops under Wallace, Prentiss, and Hurlbut stubbornly defended the center with a shower of musketry and cannon fire. By noon, few of the attacking Confederate troops had managed to advance any closer than 100 yards of the Union front. In each assault, the attacking rebel force was driven to ground inside the dense thicket along the Eastern Corinth Road, and ultimately forced to retire, with heavy loss, to seek shelter somewhere beyond musket range. \n\nOn the Confederate left, the corps commanders tried to organize the confused situation. When General Polk asked Gen. Bragg where he should have his command. \"He replied 'If you will take care of the center, I will go to the right.' It was understood that General Hardee was attending to the left.\" As Bragg moved to the area just to the south of here he observed Col. Randall Gibson's Brigade.\n\nAt noon General Braxton Bragg assumed command here, and immediately ordered Colonel Randall Lee Gibson's Louisiana and Arkansas brigade to attack the thicket. As they advanced into an almost impenetrable thicket, the 2,400-man brigade was \"raked by battery fire and steady thunderous volleys of musketry,\" which exploded across their front to consume the forest, ripping trees and underbrush to pieces. The whizzing sounds of the minie balls and shrapnel reminded the Confederate troops of a swarm of hornets and thus this area would ever after be known as the \"Hornets' Nest\". \n\nCol. Henry Allen commanding the 4th Louisiana described the attack: \"At the command to advance we charged up the hill into an almost impenetrable thicket. The enemy opened a deadly fire, which was quickly returned.\" \"The regiment retired, formed again and again charged. Here fell many of my bravest and best men in the thick brushwood without ever seeing the enemy.\" \n\nGeneral Bragg was upset when Gibson's men again retreated. Bragg probably did not fully understand the great difficulties his men faced in the thicket. Confronting General Bragg on the field, Col. Henry Watkins Allen of the 4th Louisiana Infantry, recently shot through the mouth during the previous charge, pleaded that they lacked the manpower to storm the position from the front and recommended they flank the thicket. Bragg desired the offensive to keep moving and he scolded the wounded colonel, stating, \"I want no faltering now.\" Holding the regimental colors aloft, Allen painfully called out to his volunteers, \"Here boys is as good a place as any on this battlefield to meet death!\" For a third time, the bloodied Confederate brigade charged into the face of almost certain death. \n\nThe artillery played a key role in repulsing the Confederate attacks. Capt. Andrew Hickenlooper's Ohio Battery fired rounds of canister into the attacking infantry inflicted heavy casualties on the Confederates. \n\nBy 4:00 PM the Union forces had repulsed a series of piecemeal attacks, but the withdrawal of Hurlbut on their left and Sherman on their right allowed over 20,000 Confederates to surround the Union center. Prentiss would soon surrender, and Wallace would be mortally wounded.",

Lew Wallace had arrived with his Division to reinforce Grant after dark on April 6th but had no contact with the General until the morning of the 7th when Grant arrived and pointed out the intended direction of attack. Wallace' s attack across Tilghman Branch Ravine was opposed by Col. Preston Pond's Brigade on the north end of the field, you are looking at, and supported by the 6 guns of Ketchum's Alabama Artillery Battery. Pond's was the only Confederate infantry unit that failed to get Beauregard's order to withdraw the previous evening and stayed in close contact with the enemy. \n\nThomas W. Durham of the 11th Indiana Infantry had been ordered to take command of the right wing of the skirmish line as they advanced across the ravine under fire. Gen. Wallace rode along the line asking, him: \n\n\"How are you feeling this morning Tom?\" He responded, \"I feel like I want to see my mother.\" Wallace said, \"That is right, go in and remember the old folks at home.\" \"As they advanced they came under fire from the enemy battery with shells bursting and tearing up the ground around them. Durham was watching their battery to get a chance for the skirmishers to jump over the fence and get into the ravine...He saw the chance to vault over but as he did a shell fragment hit him on the right hip ad lodged against the bone .... He started crawling back toward the regiment and some of the men saw him and carried him back to the surgeon.\" Durham would survive, the surgeon telling him he was too game to die. \n\nWallace's three brigades would advance across the ravine and outflank Pond's Brigade which was forced to withdraw before they could get any support. Wallace's Division would take a position in the north end of the field, expecting the rest of Grant's Army to come in from the east. \n\nAt the same time, Confederate forces were rushed forward from the Shiloh Church area by Braxton Bragg and thrown into a line on the south side of the field along the wood line in front of you. Gen. Ruggles ordered Col. Randall Gibson's and Gen. S.A.M. Wood's Brigades to counterattack Wallace's line. They advanced diagonally across this field placing most of them perpendicular to the Federal line of fire. The poorly coordinated attack crumbled under the withering fire and fell back. Col. William K. Patterson of the 8th Arkansas described it as \"a destructive enfilading fire...under which many of our men fell horribly mangled.\"\n\nFinally at about 10 AM Sherman and McClernand's men started to arrive after crossing Tilghman Branch. Wallace advanced with the newly arrived force to form a line facing south about half-way across the field. This line is marked by the closest line of tablets to the north in Jones Field. The Confederates fought desperately to hold back the Federal threat but by 11 :00 AM Wallace's Division made a left wheel extending Grant's line by half a mile to the west where the picnic area is today. This completely outflanked the Confederate line which was forced to withdraw south in the direction of Shiloh Church. As the Confederates withdrew  Wallace's Division continued to advance in the direction of the Hamburg-Purdy Road but would stop in line on a ridge when their left flank seemed threatened.",

Although achieving early success against Sherman and McClernand's Divisions, by noon, several Confederate units were physically exhausted having been in combat since dawn. Commands became comingled and suffered a high attrition of line officers: Some units were pillaging the newly captured Union camps, and others stopped to be resupplied with ammunition. \n\nThis pause gave Union forces here an opportunity to counter-attack. Sherman had recently reunited with McDowell's lost brigade and McClernand was reinforced by the addition of the 15th and 16th Iowa Infantry Regiments. With Sherman on the left, and McClernand on the right, they counter-attacked from Jones Field into Woolf Field. The advance was rapid, and the Confederates were driven back about½ a mile with severe losses. \n\nAlthough stunned, General PGT Beauregard countered by throwing his last reserve brigade, Trabue' s fresh Kentuckians and Tennesseans forward, joined by elements of Generals Hardee' s and Polk's Corps. By 2:00 pm, the Confederates regained the upper hand forcing Sherman and McClemand to fall back though Jones Field and across the rugged Tilghman Branch which formed a natural defensive position. \n\nA lack of ammunition caused another lull in the Confederate push. By the time of Confederates were resupplied, the roar of fighting to their right caused a shift in deployment of the Confederate line in that direction. One last assault on the Federals east of Jones Field occurred around 4:.00 pm, as Preston Pond's Louisiana Brigade and Wharton's Texas Cavalry led an assault that was soundly defeated by the larger Federal force.",

My position was critical, as isolation from the rest of the army seemed imminent.\" Rousseau's Brigade which had arrived at the edge of Woolf Field, on the wood line behind you, was out of ammunition. A gap had developed between McCook and Crittenden and the Confederates appeared to be massing troops to turn McCook's right flank. \n\nWallace's concerns were soon relieved by the arrival of the all-German 32nd Indiana Infantry which had moved ahead of its brigade. \"Fortunately, before the enemy could avail themselves of their advantage some fresh troops clashed against them, and drove them back. This was due to Col. August Willich and his famous German regiment.\" Sherman who had just arrived witnessed the attack and said \"Then arose the severest musketry fire I ever heard which lasted some twenty minutes, when this splendid regiment had to fall back.\" The attack gave time for Col. Edward Kirks Brigade from McCook's Division to deploy in line in this field where they soon came under fire from Confederate artillery near the crossroads. The 34th Illinois on the left were exposed to heavy fire and When their commander Major Charles Leavanway was killed by a round of canister in the throat, they might have panicked but Col. Kirk rallied them with the only unwounded member of the color guard. \n\nThe Confederates holding the crossroads were Rutledge's Tennessee Battery and Gen. S.AM. Wood's Brigade around which other Confederate units gathered. When the Confederate attacks faltered Major John Kelly of the 9th Arkansas battalion dashed through Water Oaks Pond, to your left, on his horse to rally them. The regiment to the left of Gen. Wood had fallen back, and he went over to steady them, but their colonel said his men were worn-out and could not be rallied. With the arrival of fresh union units across the field, and lacking support, Wood was forced to withdraw from the Crossroads. Beauregard at Shiloh Church was now in danger of losing the battle and would personally take charge of attacks to regain the lost grotmd. Before you move on to the last stop at Shiloh Church you may want to examine the Te1messee Monument which was placed here in 2005.

Southern soldiers across this battlefield, were shocked by the booming of the guns, and the rush of their own pickets streaming back under fire. The unexpected appearance of so many Federals confused the Confederates. Southern soldiers that were still recovering from the first day's fight were rushed into line. \nRagtag defensive lines were fonned by officers utilizing any and every individual or unit that could shoulder a musket. General Braxton Bragg complained: \"Our force was disorganized, demoralized, and exhausted ... they were mostly out of ammunition, and though millions of cartridges were around them, not one officer in ten supplied their men.\" \n\nBy 10:00 am, Confederate leaders had assembled a comingled and disjointed 3-mile front.

Smith of Bate's 2nd Tennessee Infantry remembered that: \"staff officers rode among the camps seizing all detached units and individual soldiers.\" Many southern field officers and their men had little to no idea who they were serving with or where they were fighting on this day. \nIn the Davis Wheat Field, Union Colonel William B. Hazen's three regiments pushed forward driving Confederate pickets from the woods. Hazen' s units overran the Confederate guns here of the 5th company of Louisiana's famed Washington Light Artillery. In the fight for one of the guns, Union Colonel Walter Whitaker, of the 6th Kentucky Infantry, cut down a cannoneer with a Bowie Knife he had taken from a Texas soldier. \n\nHowever, these Union regiments had advanced beyond their support and were pushed back by the Crescent Regiment which saved the guns.

Throughout the battle attempts were made by surgeons to provide medical assistance for the over 16,400 men wounded. Numerous operating stations were hastily thrown up by surgeons on both sides. On the first day of battle, April 6, many of the operating stations established by Union surgeons were repeatedly forced to move, as Grant's troops were forced to grudgingly give ground, fighting from a number of successive lines. \n\nThe field hospital established here, on Monday afternoon, April 7, as the Confederate army withdrew, was erected under the direction of Capt. Bernard J.D. Irwin, an Assistant Surgeon who served with Buell's Army of the Ohio. Dr. Irwin opened up his operating station, a large farmhouse that sat on this site. He ordered tents moved from nearby Federal camps and set up around the house. The next day he stripped neighboring Union camps of bedding, cooking utensils, medical supplies, and more tents to enlarge the hospital to 300 beds. Inside the house, Irwin set up an operating room dispensary, office, kitchen, and medical officers' dining room. More medical supplies reached him form Savam1ah, Tem1essee that evening. By nightfall all patients, Union and Confederate, were treated, fed and bedded. Experience gained at Shiloh demonstrated that the patients in this improvised tent hospital fared better than the wounded hastily loaded aboard steamboats at Pittsburg Landing. From such pioneering efforts the present ­day concept of mobile army field hospitals was later developed.",

                    "audioTranscript": "For five bitterly contested hours 'on April 6, from 10:00 am until 3 :00 pm, the majority of Johnston's Confederate brigades, under the immediate supervision of Generals Beauregard, Hardee, and Leonidas Polk, maintained a continuous assault on Grant's stubborn right flank north of Shiloh Church. During the same period, Albert Sidney Johnston, accompanied by Brig. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, directed one-third of his army eastward from Prentiss's captured camp to engage what Johnston apparently believed to be the exposed rear of the Union army, but in actuality proved to be the left of Grant's line under Gen. Hurlbut. The 9th Illinois took a position in the ravine in front of you which acted as a natural trench where they could duck clown to reload then stand up to fire at the enemy. Here astride the Hamburg­-Savannah road, the two opposing forces grappled for several hours into the early afternoon. Repeatedly, Southern troops pressed forward, only to be driven back by murderous Union musketry and cannon fire. \n\nGen. Breckenridge, commander of the Confederate Reserve Corp, was having problems getting his troops to move forward through the field in front of the Union line. The 45th Tennessee, a green unit had stopped at the mule lot of widow Sarah Bell's farm and had become disorganized. In frustration, Breckenridge reported to Johnston that he had \"a Tennessee regiment that won't fight\". The Confederate Governor Tennessee Isham Harris, who was accompanying Johnston as an aide, went to attempt to rally the troops from his state. The Confederate attack had stalled and Breckenridge expressed farther frustration at his unit's failure. Anxious to continue the advance, Johnston replied \"Then I will help you, we can get them to make the charge.\" Just prior to 2 p.m., Johnston rode forward to encourage his troops to mount another bayonet charge against the Union force blocking advance up the River Road. The Union front lay to the north and occupied a position that ran parallel with the southern edge of the Peach Orchard along the low rise you see marked by monuments across the field. Passing along the front, Johnston reached the 9th Arkansas of Bowen's Brigade and called out, \"Soldiers, get ready! Soldiers of the 9th Arkansas Regiment are you ready to drive the invaders of the country from our soil?\" As he rode along the line he touched their fixed bayonets with the tin cup he had picked up in a Union camp earlier in the clay and said, \"Men they are stubborn; we must use the bayonet.\" He turned and said, \"I will lead you.\" \n\nUnder Johnston's supervision, six Confederate brigades comprising a line of battle nearly a mile in width, pressed northward astride the road. This strong advance drove back the opposing Union line and permitted Southern troops to establish a new line of battle along the south edge of the peach orchard. \n\nThe charge Johnston had led was successful but there was still firing on the left and Governor Harris assisted Col. W. S. Statham in getting Tennessee units to charge in that direction leaving Johnston behind with Capt. W.L. Wickham. \n\nOn his return to this location, the governor noticed that something was extremely wrong with the Southern commander, who appeared flushed and faint. Suddenly, Johnston \"reeled in the saddle,\" and Harris grasped the general's shoulders to keep him from falling. Asked by Harris if he was wounded, Johnston, in a deliberate tone, replied, \"Yes, and I fear seriously.\" \n\nJohnston, now unconscious, was taken to the ravine just down the trail south of this monument. Hidden from plain view, the general had been hit behind the right knee with a  .58 cal. Minnie Ball which torn the popliteal artery. The extreme loss of blood had not been observed earlier, because it either collected internally or in Johnston's high boot, which reached to his knee. The Confederate commander apparently had been wounded for several minutes before Harris saw him reel in the saddle. \n\nShortly before 2:45, Albert Sidney Johnston died from an acute loss of blood. Ranked second only to Inspector General Samuel Cooper among the top general officers in the Confederate Army, Johnston would be the highest-ranking officer of either army killed in action during the Civil War. A tragic irony was that in his coat pocket was found a field tourniquet, which might have saved his life if used quickly and properly. Johnston's body was secretly escorted by his staff to Shiloh Church, while messengers carried word to Beauregard that he now commanded the Southern Army. \n\nBefore driving to the next stop you may want to take the short walk down to the ravine where Johnston died. His body would be removed to Corinth and then interred in New Orleans. After the war he would be reinterred in Austin, Texas. Although born in Kentucky, Johnston had adopted Texas as his native state and resigned from the U.S. Army to join the Confederacy when Texas seceded.",

The battlefield was the home to a number of farm families many of whom had fled when it became clear that a battle was about to start. As they fled they left behind their farms and livestock which suffered damage or destruction as the fighting swirled around their homesteads. During the fighting Sarah Bell's herd of goats came between the two lines of battle and were wiped out. The cabin you see as you look to your right belonged to Sarah Bell's son­-in-law, William Manse George. During the battle the cabin was destroyed but, George moved an undamaged cabin from another part of the battlefield to take its place. The cabin you see is the sole surviving structure from the Battle of Shiloh and is a reminder of the losses suffered by those who came into the path of conflict during the Civil War.\n\nHere astride the Hamburg-Savannah road, also called the River road, the left flank of Grant's army found a good position to make a stand. From 9 a.m. until 2 p.m., this front defended by Federal troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Stephen Hurlbut, supported by brigades under Brig. Gen. John McArthur and Col. David Stuart, was the scene of intense fighting. The Union line of battle marked by monuments and tablets on the south side of the Peach Orchard, extended from ridges and ravines three-quarters mile to the east, to the dense oak thicket of the Hornets' Nest position located one-quarter mile to the west-northwest. Located beyond the wood-line to the north behind you is the famous sunken road, at the time of the battle this wagon trace cut through the forest to link the River Road with the Corinth Road, located a half-mile to the northwest. Just \nbeyond that road is the Bloody Pond, Tour Stop 19. \n\nFiling into line to the left of the River Road two regiments from McArthur' s brigade, the 9th and the 12th, or Highland Guard, along with the 50th Illinois from Col. Thomas Sweeney's Brigade extended the line in the direction of Stuart's isolated regiments. As Stuart's men fell back around 2 p.m. these units come under flank attack by Confederate forces. The 50th Illinois under Col. Moses Bane became confused as forces across the ravine approached. The flag they saw looked similar to the U.S. flag and it was not until this Confederate force fired into their flank that they realized it was the Confederate First National Flag, or Stars and Bars. Col. Bane was wounded and the unit fell back in turn exposing the flanks of the 12th Illinois and then the 9th Illinois in the ravine just this side of the Johnston Monument. \n\nWhat had been a refuge for soldiers of the 9th Illinois became a trap as Confederates struck them from the front and flank from the neck of the ravine. \n\nAlthough the Federal line fell back, Gen. Hurlbut and his staff were able to rally the men and form another line just north of the Bloody Pond. They would hold there until 4 PM when that line was also outflanked by Confederate Infantry. An attempt to rally the men another time near Hurlbut's Headquarters would prove unsuccessful and they would fall back to Grant's last line near Pittsburg Landing.",

And as with all Civil War battlefields, wounded soldiers often migrated to water sources for a drink.

The large monument - three cannon barrels pointing upward - marks the battlefield headquarters of General Ulysses S. Grant, the Union Army commander on the evening of April 6th. \n\nMany people wonder why a major battle was fought here, seemingly miles from anywhere. For the answer to that you need to look no further than the river before you. With the capture of Fort Hemy, north of here, the Tennessee River provided a swift invasion route for Union forces into the Confederate heartland. By the beginning of April 1862, a strong Union army commanded by General Ulysses S. Grant had disembarked here, and at Crump's Landing, six miles down-river to the north, in preparation for an attack against the strategic railroad junction at Corinth, Mississippi, only 22 miles to the southwest. \n\nHowever, a Confederate army under the command of General Albert Sidney Johnston, struck first, delive1ing a surprise attack on Pittsburg Landing, where the bulk of General Grant's Federal troops lay encamped around a log church called Shiloh Meeting House. Named for the church, Shiloh exploded into one of the most decisive and vicious battles of the Civil War, and proved to be the deadliest combat Americans had experienced up to that time. Nearly 24,000 men were killed, wounded, or reported missing in two terrible days of fighting. \n\nUlysses. S.

The awful carnage deprived the South of ten thousand six hundred and ninety-nine men killed, wounded, and missing. Albert Sidney Johnston, Adley Gladden, and a host of subordinate officers would never fight again. Tennessee, with its vast reservoir of manpower and critical war resources, was virtually lost; a strengthened Union advance against Corinth, Mississippi, would only be a matter of time; and the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, the primary east-west line of communication and supply  with the Mississippi Valley, remained imperiled. Strategically and tactically, Shiloh must be regarded as a Union victory. Although the battle temporarily crippled Grant's army, supplied many of the Southern troops with new firearms, and revealed the merits and demerits of many western Confederate commanders, the vital objective of Albert Sidney Johnston's momentous western counterattack --- the destruction of Grant's army-was not realized.\n\nPerhaps the greatest impact of Shiloh was how the divided nation came to view the war. For the first time since April 186L citizens on both sides opened their eyes to the magnitude of the terrible conflict. There were more casualties here in two days, 23,746, than in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Mexican War combined. After Shiloh, the brutal realities of civil war began to be felt in every community, every home, and every family. Before the battle, Grant had believed that the Confederates in the West could be finished off in one last great combat. Now he \"gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest.\" The bitter legacy cast from the savage carnage that was Shiloh---would be that the war became an increasingly bloodier conflict.an immense ideological struggle that steadily consumed the irreplaceable resources of a divided people for three more years.\n \nAs the Union soldiers moved back into their camps it became their task to clean up the debris of battle and deal with the dead and wounded from both sides. \n\nJohn Bell of the 2nd Iowa Infantry said \"In places dead men lay so closely that a person could walk over two acres of ground and not step off the bodies.\"",

                    "audioTranscript": "Welcome to Slatersville, Rhode Island, one of six sites that make up Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.  \n\nWhat makes this place special? At first glance, Slatersville looks like a classic small town in New England. But Slatersville is more than a quaint village. Slatersville was once a blueprint for industrial America.  \n\nTo understand Slatersville’s evolution, we must start with water. You are now standing along the banks of the Branch River. The Branch River is a tributary of the Blackstone River, meaning it flows into the Blackstone. At the point where you are now standing, the river drops 40 feet in just a mile. That is a tremendous drop, and it makes this place ideal for building a water-powered mill.  \n\nIn fact, it was this drop, and the potential power it provided, that attracted industrialist John Slater to this site. John, the younger brother of his more famous brother Samuel, convinced his brother, and other business partners to purchase 1,200 acres of land and the rights to the water. \n\nAs you look at the river, you may notice two distinct waterfalls. These are not natural waterfalls but human-made dams. The dam off in the distance is the middle dam. The middle dam and its twenty-foot drop create a reservoir of water, known as a mill pond. This mill pond is over 170 acres in size. A mill pond is intended to provide a water-powered mill with an ample source of water that could power, at first, wooden waterwheels, and eventually mechanical turbines.  \n\nAlthough it might not be evident today, this human manipulation of the river stored enough water to eventually power 3 large textile mills on this site. One of those mills, the Western Mill, once stood on the hillside behind. We will see one of the two remaining structures from this complex at one of our next stops.",

But they soon faced a big problem: their new mill was essentially isolated. There was very little infrastructure around them, and there was only small cluster of buildings nearby. This meant that the Slaters and their partners needed to hire people to build everything that their newly arrived workers would need. This included a store where workers could purchase goods.  \n\nBy 1850, a larger store was needed and the brick building you see on the right was constructed. A second commercial building was added by 1870 (the one on the left). These structures housed the company store, a bank, barber shop, hardware store, and eventually a dance and movie hall. \n\nThe company store became an important part of a mill village. This was where employees went to purchase everything from dry goods to foodstuffs. Often, only company script could be used in the store and workers could pay off their debts against their paychecks. This indebted many workers to their employers through the guise of the company store.",

Known as the Center Mill or Mill number 1, this four-story building features a beautiful 5 story belltower. The belltower became an iconic feature in mill construction. It was the mill’s belltower that dictated daily life to the village’s inhabitants. A Providence-based poet writing in the 1830s critiqued this system: “Hark! Don’t you hear the factory bell? Of Wit and Learning ‘tis the knell. It rings them out it tolls them in. Where men they weave and girls they spin.” \n\nBy 1833, Slaterville Mills had 9,500 spindles and 225 looms in action. 66 men, 109 women, and 169 children operated these machines, either making thread or weaving that thread into cloth. The work was tedious and repetitive. While not as physically demanding as some other jobs, without safety regulations, conditions were often dangerous. Laborers were also expected to do this work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. All 344 worker’s wages combined totaled $57,000 annually. That’s only a little higher than the average annual wage earned by a single person in the United States today. \n\nIn 1843, a third mill was added in Slatersville. This mill still stands behind the 1826 mill. At its peak of water-powered operations, three mills were all powered by this section of the Branch River. In 1894, the large brick mill was constructed, and steam powered operations commenced at the site. The wooden building to your right, the last remaining structure from the original 1807 mill, served as the office building for the company.  \n\nIn 2007, this place that had once been for labor became a place of rest. The mills were converted to a new life as an apartment complex. The restored mill remains the center and heart of the village.",

The first church, built in 1808, is now a private residence located behind this structure. \n\nThe company church became an important part of a mill village. It was constructed to meet both the social and spiritual needs of the company’s employees. Church festivals, organizations, and prayer groups offered church members with a sense of community. This was one of the only places, outside of the mill, where workers could gather. It was also a place management and workers congregated together.  \n\nEven though the Slaters were raised in the Church of England, they decided to open a Congregationalist Church because most of their workers were Congregationalists. Their main concern was that workers were attending services. Preachers, selected and paid by mill owners, were sure to focus on the less radical teachings of Christianity. They preached on ideas of obedience to authority, timeliness, and thrift. The very ideals mill owners wanted to reinforce in their workers. Often the pulpit became a mouthpiece for the mill’s ownership – another example of how owners sought to manipulate and control their workers.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Would you want to live where you work? These are some of the earliest worker houses built here in Slatersville around 1810. Originally, these were very plain, multi-family worker homes. Four families inhabited each house: two families on the first floor and two families on second floor and attic space. On average, one of these Slatersville homes would have housed between 20 to 45 occupants. This would have made for cramped living conditions.  \n\nAlthough family units shared a house, each family had their own living space. For the most part, everyone in these homes worked for the Slaters. This system, known as the Rhode Island System of Manufacture, or the Slater System, used the entire family for employment in the mills. Fathers often worked on the company owned farm or as mechanics fixing the machines, while mothers and children worked in the mill. About 88% of the laborers in Slater-owned mills came from families employed by the company and living in company houses. \n\nChildren were the driving force behind this system. H. Humphrey, a noted 19th century author, wrote, “Our children must have employment – must be brought up in habits of industry. It is sinful, it is cruel to neglect this essential branch of their education.” Today, children in the United States are obligated to receive a different kind of education, one that does not involve a factory. Many would even view the Slaters’ use and manipulation of children in mills today as sinful or cruel. This marks a major change from how children lived in Slatersville throughout most of the nineteenth century. \n\nIn the 1920s, these mill houses you are now looking at were converted to single-family management homes, by the then owner of the mill, Henry Kendall. Kendall added ornamental touches like side porches, fancier doorways, and white picket fences as part of his efforts to restore Slatersville.",

This home was much like his employee housing. The major difference was that he shared his home with one other family, not two or three. Though he lived at a higher standard, John still lived and worked alongside his workers. While he oversaw a system which ensured his workers could be managed and controlled, he too was held accountable to his employees. There was a certain degree of respect between both employer and employee which came from the proximity in which they all lived. As future generations of Slaters moved further and further away from the community, they became increasingly disinterested in their employees. This would lead to even more labor unrest. \n\nJohn would remain personally and financially invested in the community until his death in 1843. After his death, the family moved the house to its current location and converted it into worker housing. The family moved to a large mansion home which once stood on the outskirts of the village. \n\nSlatersville served as the model for other mill villages  throughout the Blackstone Valley, and eventually in other parts of the Northeast. This type of industrially planned community was also replicated again and again in factory towns, mine towns, and mill villages across the country. In each of these communities, workers faced tradeoffs. Living and working together, laborers of all ages usually endured the tight supervision of a family or corporation. Yet some also experienced new freedoms and a chance to begin again in a new place or new country.  \n\nPerhaps the most enduring legacy of Slatersville is the fact that it is still here – a testament to the resiliency of a community and of the people who call it home.",

During this tour you will visit four sites of First State National Historical Park, each stop a link in the story of slavery in the First State. We will touch on a few different threads of this history. This tour is organized thematically, not chronologically, and will explore areas such as the status of enslaved Africans in New Sweden in the 1600s; the relationship of one of the most famous of the Founders, John Dickinson, to slavery; and  the efforts of brave individuals to help enslaved people emancipate themselves within the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. \n\nJohn Dickinson, often called the “penman of the American Revolution”, was one of the most prominent members of the generation of thinkers, writers, philosophers, politicians, and soldiers who made up the Founders, which shaped so much of the American Revolution. He was also an enslaver. \n\nThough rightly lauded for his literary accomplishments during the first part of the American Revolution, in those tumultuous years leading to the War of Independence, John Dickinson also kept people in bondage on his plantation. The uncompensated labor of these people provided a large part of Dickinson’s wealth, and was thus free to spend his days in scholarly and philosophical pursuits. This story was replicated throughout Colonial America. While not all of the Founders were enslavers, many were. To put thing into perspective, of the 56 men who put their signatures on the Declaration of Independence in 1776, representing all Thirteen Colonies then in rebellion against the British Empire, 41 either enslaved people at the time of the signing or had at some point before that. Those that did hold people in bondage often used the wealth and perhaps more importantly, free time, made possible by enslaved labor, to develop some of the most cherished ideas and institutions of the United States. \n\nHow we reconcile these two contradictory truths, that the very people who so fervently believed in freedom and liberty, were at the same time willing and able to keep people in bondage based on nothing but their skin color, informs much of how we view the American project as a whole. \n\nBefore continuing on with the rest of this tour, if you are able to, we ardently recommend that you spend time at the John Dickinson Plantation, and if possible take a guided tour or attend an interpretive program, so that you may gain a better understanding of how  all people, free and enslaved, lived and worked on the plantation landscape.

                    "audioTranscript": "The Green has served as a center of Dover since its founding in 1693. The Old State House stands at the east end of the Green and has been the setting for many historical events, including perhaps the most infamous auction of an enslaved person in Delaware history. \n\nSamuel Burris was a free Black man born in Delaware in 1813. He worked hard throughout his life, both in manual labor as well as a teacher. Details about his life are somewhat sparse, but we do know that by 1840, he had a family of his own and was living in Philadelphia, though he continued to teach in Wilmington, Delaware. The reason for re-locating his family to Pennsylvania was tied to the increasingly repressive laws aimed at Delaware’s free Black population. Through the first half of the 1800s, the numbers of enslaved people within the First State stagnated, however this was accompanied by ever harsher laws which deprived free Black Delawareans of their constitutional rights. By the 1830s, free Black people in Delaware were denied the right to vote, the right to free speech, to assemble, to bear arms, and by 1863 were even forbidden from re-entering Delaware if they had left the state for more than five days. \n\nGiven Delaware’s geographic position, it became a corridor for enslaved people seeking  freedom in Pennsylvania, which had begun to gradually abolish slavery in 1780. As such, the Underground Railroad, the name given in the mid-1800s to the secret network of abolitionists, safe houses, and escape routes, was quite active within Delaware. Burris became involved with the activities of the Underground Railroad by 1840, mainly through his membership in the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society. Burris was a “conductor” on the Underground Railroad, guiding  freedom seekers through Delaware, and arranging for safe houses and further passage on to other northern states or Canada. \n\nBurris often worked with two wealthy white abolitionists in his endeavors, John Hunn and Thomas Garret, and it was with these men that he would be caught trying to help Maria Matthews escape slavery by getting her onboard a steamship in 1847. They were unsuccessful, and all three were soon arrested and charged with violating the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. Hunn and Garret were found guilty and fined into financial oblivion, though they escaped prison time. Burris was not as fortunate, and after being found guilty, was sentenced to 14 months of imprisonment. At the conclusion of this portion of his sentence, he was then to be auctioned into 14 years of slavery. That auction took place in September of 1848, on the  front steps of the Old State House, which you are currently standing in front of. \n\nImagine the scene in 1848, as Burris, in chains and standing defiantly, was led in front of a crowd of men looking to purchase him like they would an animal. What do you think Burris was feeling at that moment, looking out over the crowd and realizing that he was almost certain to never see his family or his home again? What would you have done if you were in his place? (PAUSE)\nLuckily for Burris, such a dark fate was not to be his destiny. During the 14 months of his imprisonment, his fellow abolitionists had not been idle. While a campaign had unfortunately failed to sway politicians to intervene on Burris behalf, it thankfully caught the attention of an even wider audience.  Eventually the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society raised enough funds to rescue Burris.  They had a Quaker from Philadelphia, Isaac Flint, take $500 (equivalent to $15,000 in 2021) to the auction, and pretend to be interested in purchasing Burris. As William Still relates, Flint had to be canny to avoid being detected as an imposter, \n“The usual opportunity was given to traders and speculators to thoroughly examine the property on the block, and most skillfully was Burris examined from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head; legs, arms and body, being handled as horse-jockeys treat horses. Flint watched the ways of the traders and followed for effect their example.”\n\nHaving thus passed scrutiny, Flint and the others began the bidding process. The price for Burris was soon above $500, exceeding the funds the abolitionists had gathered. Thinking fast, Flint bribed the highest bidder into withdrawing, and then was declared the winner himself. Burris was led into a cart, which Flint proceeded to drive out of town. However, rather than heading South, as soon as was safe, Flint informed Burris \"not to fear, you have been purchased with abolitionist gold and I will spirit you away to Philadelphia.\"\n\nBurris was free, and though he never returned South, he continued to help freedom seekers when they arrived in Pennsylvania. In 1850, his family moved to San Francisco, and he followed a few years later. There he kept up his activism, focusing on education and job training for Black Americans. He also continued to lecture on the importance of abolition until his death in 1863.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The history of slavery in Delaware began with the colony of New Sweden, which was established here with the construction of Fort Christina, named after their 12-year-old Queen of Sweden, along Christina River in 1638. Though there was a previous attempt to set up a Dutch colony, called Zwannandael, in southern Delaware, it failed after less than a year. New Sweden’s colonists consisted of Swedish, Finnish, and Dutch settlers  and was more successful.  The colony lasted until 1655, when it was taken over by Dutch forces from a  much larger colony  further to the North. Dutch rule was ended  by English forces in 1664, paving the way for the creation of the colonies of Pennsylvania and Delaware. \n\nWhen the first wave of Europeans arrived to start the colony of New Sweden in 1638, they had no enslaved people with them. However, within a year, there would be at least one enslaved Black person we know by the name of Anthony Swart. Swart’s origins and much of his life is shrouded in mystery. We know that he was brought back to New Sweden aboard the Vogel Grip, which was a Dutch captained ship in the service of Sweden. The Vogel Grip had made an expedition down to the English colony of Virginia soon after the founding of New Sweden in an attempt to trade for an extremely lucrative commodity, tobacco. This was unsuccessful however, and so the Vogel Grip continued into the Caribbean, perhaps looking for easy profits in raiding Spanish treasure ships. Whatever the captain’s intentions, he was also largely unsuccessful in this endeavor, but he did bring back a Black man, who went by the name Anthony Swart, probably captured from a Spanish vessel and held because of his seafaring skills. Such skills would have been of immense value to the burgeoning colony of New Sweden, due to its orientation along the Delaware River Bay and the tributaries feeding into it, putting maritime expertise at a premium. Swart lived in the colony of New Sweden as an enslaved man almost until the colony’s take over by the Dutch in 1655. What happened to him after that, and details about his 15 years  in the colony, are essentially non-existent. Anthony was mentioned in only a few official records, the last of which was a bill of sale for supplies from a colony store, shortly before he disappears from the record. He may have travelled elsewhere after the Dutch takeover, perhaps even choosing to settle with the Lenape people, who he would have had contact with when he served as an agent for Johann Printz, who had been governor of New Sweden and the enslaver of Anthony during  1643-1653. Alternatively he may have ended up travelling back to the Caribbean,  or a worse fate may have befallen him. While slavery was present in the colony of New Sweden, it was never particularly wide spread or common. This would change as Dutch influence from the larger colony of New Amsterdam,  modern day New York, increased during the 1640s and 50s, and even more so after the Dutch takeover. \n\nThe Dutch in the 1600s were the masters of the Atlantic slave trade. Thousands of enslaved Black people from Africa were transported to Dutch colonies in the Caribbean and New Amsterdam. Many were then transported further on to the South River, which is what the Dutch called the colony of New Sweden. This occurred, even though there was resistance to the concept of slavery in Swedish culture, because constant labor shortages threatened the colony’s existence. Unable to convince enough Swedes and Finns to make the dangerous ocean crossing to the Americas, the colony imported enslaved Africans and Dutch settlers convicted of crimes and sentenced to hard labor into New Sweden in small but growing numbers over the 1640s. \n\nIt was from this small but significant beginning that the institution of slavery grew in what eventually became the State of Delaware. \nWe will now travel further north to the border between Delaware & Pennsylvania, in the Brandywine Valley, to explore the invisible line which separated so many humans held in bondage from freedom in the 1800s.",

While the marker itself was placed after slavery was abolished in the United States, the border it represents was established long before that, and for many thousands of enslaved people seeking freedom, this was the last barrier they had to cross before they were on free soil.",

                    "audioTranscript": "You are standing at one of the border markers along the unusual boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania. When Pennsylvania was created in 1681 as a proprietary colony of William Penn  the “Three Lower Counties of Pennsylvania” , which make up Delaware today, were to be administered from Philadelphia. By 1704 however the three counties had established their own colonial legislature, and in 1776 when Delaware declared independence from the British Empire, it simultaneously declared independence from Pennsylvania as well. \n\nThe border between Delaware and Pennsylvania is unique, being one of the few circular boundaries in the United States. When Pennsylvania was established, the area for 12 miles around New Castle was carved out as a separate territory. However exactly where to draw this 12-mile circle, and how to properly survey and demarcate it, proved to be exceptionally difficult for Colonial authorities. It wasn’t until the later 1800s  that the border was finally properly surveyed, and markers placed every half mile and mile along the arc of the 12-mile circle. You can learn more about the survey process on the First State NHP website. \n\nFor now though, examine this stone plinth, one of the ½ mile markers along the arc. It might not have stood here during the existence of legal slavery in the United States, but the line it marked did and still does. To the south is Delaware, to the north is Pennsylvania. Now imagine you are in the year 1855, and you are an enslaved person who has escaped from a plantation further south in Delaware or Maryland. You have braved the elements, hid from slave patrols, navigated through unfamiliar landscapes, and now you stand at the border between Delaware, a slave state, and Pennsylvania, a free state. The line that this marker represents is all the stands between you and freedom. What might you be feeling as you step over that invisible line? Think of how many enslaved people took that same step, what do you think they felt? \n\nThe history of slavery in Delaware, much like that of the nation, continues to have an impact on us even today. These are not events that can be simply relegated to dusty tomes in libraries, but are stories and legacies that shape our society, how we see our fellow Americans, and how we conceptualize America.

Because of this water, the area is a great place to find a variety of birds and other wildlife. Scrub jays, chipping sparrows, house finches, Say's phoebes, white-winged doves, and ladder-backed woodpeckers are year-round residents. In winter watch for pyrrhuloxia, phainopeplas, cedar waxwings, and western bluebirds. In spring and summer, look for summer and western tanagers, plumbeous vireos, Cassin's kingbird, blue grosbeak, and a variety of warblers.\n\nBefore starting out on the trail, take some time to explore around Frijole Ranch. Interpretive signs will tell you about the history of the Smith Family and later the Kincaid Family who called this place home. If the museum is open, there are exhibits inside that chronicle over 10,000 years of human history in the Guadalupe Mountains.",

Why would monument staff cut down these plants? Look around for the feathery leaves of tamarisk, also known as salt cedar. If it is blooming, it will have small, white to pink flowers. It is a non-native tree that grows in riparian areas. Brought to North America in the early 19th century for use as an ornamental wind break, and to fight erosion, it quickly spread and became an invasive weed, often outcompeting native plants. Its presence on the river banks of the Green and Yampa Rivers, and here in this intermittent stream, changes river flow and makes it difficult for deer, elk, and sheep to get to water. In 2006 and 2007, Dinosaur National Monument introduced 50,000 non-native northern tamarisk beetles to four locations in the monument. The most intensively studied biocontrol agent in North America, the beetle eats only tamarisk. While tamarisk will never be entirely eliminated, the beetles are helping to keep it under control and allow native vegetation to rebound.",

Look back across the Moenkopi Formation labyrinth you just traversed. In the distance you will see a swath of red rock known as “The Racetrack.” The “lanes” are made up of Triassic-aged Moenkopi and Chinle formations, seemingly wrapping around the corner. These rust colored rocks are rich in iron and are sometimes called the Triassic Red Beds. Iron is also responsible for many of the yellow, orange and greenish tints to the rock layers here. Obviously inspired by the colors and shapes from near this ridge, Ernest Untermann brought his paints and easel to this area in the mid-1900s. A German immigrant, he became known as “The Artist of the Uintas,” and Dinosaur’s dramatic landscapes spoke to him. The sedimentary rocks around you were originally flat, horizontal layers when they were deposited. Each layer represents its own story of a different past environment, different fauna and flora, a succession of time and life on our planet. For millions of years, these stories were buried deep underground. Thanks to uplift and erosion, they are once again free to tell colorful tales of change over time.",

Older trees, which may be 650-850 years old, have sculptural qualities. Even dead, a juniper may stand silent and strong for several hundred years. Like all of the plants at this 5,000 foot elevation, the juniper must survive on a sparse 10 inches of precipitation a year.\n\nAs you hike, check out the sky and you may see a Turkey Vulture or two, flying on silent wings high above you. Lightweight for such a wide wingspan, they teeter and totter on the breeze, rarely flapping their wings. An excellent sense of smell leads Turkey Vultures to carcasses where they feed cooperatively. Think of these silent birds not as purveyors of death, but rather as elegant birds who transform death into life on the wing. Look carefully at each soaring bird and you may be lucky to see a Golden Eagle, easily confused with a vulture at first glance. The Golden Eagle, at 10 pounds, is a much heavier bird, outweighing the vulture by 6 pounds. Eagles do not teeter and totter, and they hold their wings out flat, while vultures hold their wings in a slight V-shape. Both are dark birds, the vulture is here only during the summer, the eagle a year-round  bird. Perhaps a lizard has caught your attention during your hike, lending even more life to the desert. Six species of lizards are found here: sagebrush, plateau, western whiptail, shorthorned, side-blotched and tree lizard. Listen for lizards rushing about in the leaf litter, looking for spiders or insects to eat.",

Visitors are invited to explore the area with the established observation areas, waysides exhibits, and trails.

                    "audioTranscript": "Welcome to the driving tour of the Spotsylvania battlefield. Here at the Exhibit Shelter, there are wayside paneling that describe the armies’ movements towards Spotsylvania as well as maps that put the battle into context. From the Exhibit Shelter a walking trail crosses over Brock Road and climbs the ridgeline called Laurel Hill before returning here. The stop here serves as an orientation to the battle that began on May 8 as Federal soldiers marched south from the Wilderness and ran into Confederate troops blocking the road. As both sides began to dig a system of trenches, U.S. and Confederate commanders began to formulate plans to get at one another. If you take the short walk from the exhibit shelter to the park entrance, you will see a monument dedicated to Union Gen. John Sedgwick, killed on May 9. Erected in 1887, this is one of the earliest monuments put up on what became the Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military Park. \n\n\n\nAudio Text:\nAt the end of the two-week long battle of Spotsylvania Court House, a Federal officer said that “Antietam and Gettysburg were child’s play to this slaughter.”  A Confederate soldier agreed, writing to his parents, “All the men say that this has been the hardest fight, since the war [began].”  What happened at Spotsylvania Court House to make hardened veterans say such sweeping statements? The battle became an inferno of violence that engulfed not just the armies, but also local civilians who suddenly found themselves amid the carnage. This tour of the Spotsylvania battlefield seeks to tell the battle’s story, and its impact on the people who lived here. \nAfter the two-day long battle of the Wilderness on May fifth and sixth, that resulted in a combined 30,000 casualties, the United States Army of the Potomac continued moving. In the past, after a major battle, the two armies had the habit of separating for a period of time to regroup and replenish supplies.  But Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, overseeing the Army of the Potomac, realized to end the war quicker, they had to beat Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia into submission. There would be, as Grant promised President Lincoln, “no turning back.” Grant and Meade now targeted the important crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House.\nHaving maintained possession of the Brock Road during the battle of the Wilderness, the U.S. Army was able to easily turn south and begin marching towards Spotsylvania. If they could get to the crossroads before the Confederates, they could use the road network as a springboard towards the Confederate capital at Richmond. Throughout May seventh and eighth, the advance elements of the Federal army moved south. However, Confederate cavalry doggedly slowed the Federal approach, fighting behind nearly every bend of the winding Brock Road. From Todd’s Tavern, almost four miles from this location, all the way into Spotsylvania, the Confederate cavalry skirmished with the Federal troops and slowed down their advance.  Watching the slow progress, George Meade fumed at the Federal cavalry commander, Gen. Philip Sheridan. Sheridan, who had barely any experience commanding cavalry, had come east in the spring of 1864 as Grant’s personal pick to command the cavalry corps.  After his screaming match with Sheridan, Meade reported the encounter to Grant, and bristled when the general-in-chief sided with Sheridan, illustrating the tense command structure of the Army of the Potomac—an army that Meade commanded but was overshadowed by Grant’s presence.\nOn May seventh, Confederate infantry under Gen. Richard Anderson were ordered to march to Spotsylvania to block the Federal forces. Sometimes cutting paths through the unforgiving Wilderness to make their own roads, the Confederates pressed on to get away from the fires and suffocating smoke created by the battle of the Wilderness. By the early morning hours of May 8, Anderson’s tired soldiers were closing in and could hear the fighting along the Brock Road.\nAnderson’s arriving soldiers took up positions at the top of the long ridgeline across the street from the present-day exhibit shelter. Both sides soon came to call that ridge Laurel Hill.  For hours Union infantry, marching down the Brock Road, formed into lines of battle and advanced up Laurel Hill, only to be repelled and sent reeling back. Casualties mounted on the ridgeline, and one New Yorker wrote “it was a terrible fire and the boys fell thick and fast as the leaden hail poured in upon us.”  By nightfall, the battle lines were drawn and both armies resorted to pickaxes and shovels to start digging a labyrinth of trenches and fortifications.\nThe fighting continued May 9 at Laurel Hill and along the banks of the Po River to the west of the park today. On the morning of May 9, a sharpshooter’s bullet killed Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick—the highest-ranking United States Army officer killed during the Civil War. \nRealizing they could not break through at Laurel H",

                    "audioTranscript": "By May 10, Robert E. Lee’s Confederates were firmly dug into miles of trenches and breastworks. Soldiers cut down trees to make head-logs that sat atop their fortifications and provided more protection. By cutting down the trees the Confederates also created openings where they could see any oncoming Federal soldiers. Cannon were positioned throughout the line to support the infantry. However, though the positions seemed impregnable, they did have weaknesses.\nWith many of the trenches dug at night, the soldiers blindly followed the contours of the landscape, trying to stay on the high ground. This created points where the lines bulged out, creating what is known as “salients”—these positions were vulnerable to attack from three directions and were susceptible to crossfire. The Army of Northern Virginia’s largest salient came to be known as the Muleshoe Salient, named for its distinct upside-down U shape, which measured nearly 1,800 yards wide and 1,300 yards deep. The Muleshoe Salient in essence connected Lee’s left, at Laurel Hill, and his right, closer to the Fredericksburg Road, and had several smaller salients that jutted out towards the Federal lines. One of those salients, defended by Brig. Gen. George Doles, came to be named for the Georgian—Doles’s Salient. It was there, Doles’s Salient, that the Federal high command turned their attention to next. If the Federals could break through the salient, they could slice Lee’s army into two.\nFrom this spot, Doles’s Salient is about half a mile to the right (or, south), through the woods. Attacking it fell to the Army of the Potomac’s Sixth Corps, now under the command of Horatio Wright, who replaced John Sedgwick. Meeting with some of his subordinate officers, Wright picked 12 regiments of Federal infantry, totaling nearly 5,000 men. Rather than attack in a standard line, however, a formation was chosen that put the 12 regiments in a thick block that could cover ground faster and get to the enemy’s line in better cohesion. Three regiments wide and four regiments deep, the column could bludgeon its way through the Confederate defenses. \nColonel Emory Upton, from Batavia, New York, was chosen to command the column of 12 regiments. Not yet 25 years old, Upton had graduated from West Point and was a rising star in the United States Army. When told which regiments he would be commanding on May 10, he told a friend, “They are the best men in the army,” and added that the Confederates “cannot repulse those regiments.”  \nThroughout the early afternoon of May 10, Federal officers scouted the area and found a dirt road that Upton’s regiments could take to get close to the enemy lines. Confederate pickets were pushed backwards, allowing the 12 Federal regiments to form in these woods largely undetected. The park trail runs parallel to the path Upton’s regiments used and can be seen by taking the one-mile-round-trip walking trail that leads to Doles’s Salient and back to this parking area. \nFor about an hour, Federal artillery bombarded the Confederate trenches to soften up the position. Through a mix-up in communication, another Federal column, intended to support Upton, went against the Mule Shoe before Upton began his attack, and was quickly repulsed. That left Upton to go in alone. Shortly after 6:00 p.m., Upton gave the order to go forward. The 5,000 U.S. soldiers stepped off.\nEmerging from the tree line about 200 yards away, Upton’s men charged forward with “the most unearthly shouts and yells ever heard,” one soldier recollected.  The column advanced through the musketry and cannon fire that sliced through it, knocking dozens of Federal soldiers out of line.\nThe block of Union regiments slammed into the salient and broke through the defenses of the approximately 1,100 Georgians holding the line. Regiments began peeling to the north and south to make the breach bigger as Confederates reeled backwards. A Pennsylvanian wrote, “They were very stubborn, and the bayonets and clubbed muskets were used freely before the pit was fully in our possession.”  One of the Georgians wrote, “They poured through and turning to the right & left commenced pouring a fire right down the line and also passing in our rear.”  \nUpton’s men doggedly fought on, widening the breach. Realizing the dire situation that the fall of Doles’s Salient presented, Confederate commanders began to organize counterattacks. Robert E. Lee tried to personally lead soldiers into combat, something he had also tried to do just four days earlier at the Wilderness, but was talked out of it by staff members. As Confederate brigades converged on the salient, the lack of support for Upton’s soldiers doomed any further success. Upton’s 5,000 men had pushed aside Doles’s small brigade, but now became entangled with thousands of other Confederates who rushed forward.\nRunning low on ammunition and having sustained heavy losses, Upton’s soldiers began to retreat. They returned to their own lines having captured some 1,",

                    "audioTranscript": "For the last seven days, the armies had been engaged in constant combat. May 11, by comparison, brought a lull in the action. Besides the opposing skirmish lines firing at each other, there were no major attacks at Spotsylvania. But that did not mean the armies were idle. \n“I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,” Grant wrote to the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, on the morning of May 11.  To that end, Grant planned a new assault, building on the success of Upton’s attack from May 10.\nFor the new offensive, Grant planned to use the entire Second Army Corps, almost 20,000 men, with plenty of support to reinforce any breakthrough. This dwarfed the 5,000 men Upton had used. Throughout May 11, the soldiers of Winfield S. Hancock’s Second Corps marched behind the lines to get into position. In the afternoon, a steady rain began to fall. \nThe defense of the Muleshoe Salient depended on nearly 30 Confederate cannon that were positioned throughout the line, and on May 11 Robert E. Lee made a fatal decision regarding those pieces of artillery. Getting reports of Federal movement, Lee was unsure of Grant’s intentions: were the Federals retreating? Or were they marching towards the Fredericksburg Road to make an attack on the Confederate right? Trying to anticipate Grant’s next move, Lee ordered the cannon along the Muleshoe relocated to Spotsylvania Court House. The removal of the cannon left the nearly 4,200 Confederate soldiers in the Muleshoe to defend the position by themselves.\nThrough the pitch black and falling rain, the Federals continued to get into position. Though they tried to retain secrecy, moving 20,000 soldiers inevitably made noise heard by Confederates in the Muleshoe. General Edward Johnson, commanding the Confederates at the tip of the salient, nervously asked for the return of the cannons. \nThe Union attack began around 4:30 in the morning on May 12. Moving quietly at first, the 20,000 soldiers reached the Landrum Lane, about 300 yards from the Confederate works at the Muleshoe. Thinking they had reached the main enemy works, the Federal soldiers let out a loud cheer before their officers could keep them moving towards the salient. Realizing now what was coming towards them, the Confederates inside the salient reached for their muskets. One Confederate called out, “Look out boys! We will have blood for supper.” \nLike a broken dam, the Federal soldiers crashed into the Muleshoe, pouring over the top and into the Confederate defenses. In a matter of moments nearly the entirety of Edward Johnson’s Confederate division, including himself, were captured. Also captured were 22 of the 30 returning Confederate cannon, which arrived back at their defenses just in time to be swept up by the U.S. attack. A Pennsylvanian, climbing the earthworks, swung his sword over his head and called out, “The last day of the Rebellion is here.” \nLike two days earlier, Confederates realized the danger of losing the salient. Thousands of Confederates began to converge on this spot, attempting to seal the breach. Robert E. Lee ordered the construction of a new line, about a mile from here, that would neutralize the Muleshoe, but it would take time to build. To buy that badly needed time, Confederate brigades were thrown forward to stave off the Federal soldiers. What followed was almost 24 hours of constant combat in some of the Civil War’s most infamous fighting. With mere feet sometimes the only distance separating the two sides, both Federal and Confederate soldiers fought along the Muleshoe. The bend in the works here became forever known as the Bloody Angle. \nSoldiers fought with whatever they had. The driving rain made gunpowder wet, forcing soldiers to resort to bayonets, or the butts of their rifles. Others used camp hatchets like battle axes. Cannon were brought up by Federal forces and fired at devastatingly close range. In this intense fight for survival, rank did not matter; Confederate generals Abner Perrin and Junius Daniel were both killed here. \n“All around that salient was a seething, bubbling roaring hell of hate and murder,” Mainer John Haley wrote. “In that baleful glare men didn’t look like men.”  South Carolinian Comillus McCreary recalled, “I was splashed over with brains and blood. In stooping down or squatting to load, the mud, blood and brains mingled, would reach up to my waist, and my head and face were covered or spotted with the horrid paint.” \nThe fighting continued, unabated. Nearly twenty hours into the combat, a 22-inch wide Oak tree was cut down, sawed into a jagged stump by the bullets flying through the air. It is on display today at the Smithsonian Institute. As soldiers from both sides continued throwing themselves at each other, Lee continued overseeing the construction of the new line. The question that remained was if the Confederates could hold on long enough and survive the day.",

                    "audioTranscript": "At the top of the hill sit foundation stones, all that remain of the homestead of Edgar Harrison and his wife Ann. Built by 1860, the Harrison House, called La Villa, sat amid 190 acres, where the 11 enslaved people he owned grew oats, corn, tobacco, and churned butter. Edgar, who had joined the Confederate army, was with the cavalry and fought near his home throughout the battle.  Joseph Walker, one of those enslaved by Harrison, was only nine years old in the spring of 1864. Years later, Walker wrote, “My mistress, Miss Harrison, and my mother began gathering up her silver to leave.” Ushered to the rear, Walker and the others fled as the battle of Spotsylvania began in earnest, sounding to Walker “like a thunderstorm.” Walker continued: “My mother’s house was pulled down to make breast works, and the yard and garden were used as a burying ground.” Freed by the end of the war, Walker lived until 1943.  \nThe vacant Harrison House was utilized by Gen. Richard Ewell, commanding the Confederate army’s Second Corps, as his headquarters. Robert E. Lee was also camped nearby on the morning of May 12. As fighting began in earnest at the Muleshoe, both generals rode towards the front. \nLee found Ewell screaming and swearing at his soldiers, and beating them with the flat of his sword. With a stern voice, Lee reproached his subordinate and said, “How can you expect to control these men when you have lost control of yourself?”  The first two weeks of May 1864 had all but destroyed the Army of Northern Virginia’s upper command and the Confederates were in dire straits. James Longstreet, commanding the army’s First Corps, had been perilously wounded at the Wilderness. Richard Ewell was screaming obscenities at his soldiers and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. A.P. Hill, commanding Lee’s Third Corps, was onset by a debilitating sickness that left him no choice but to turn command over to a subordinate. And unknown to Lee, at that very moment the cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart was slowly dying in Richmond as a result of wounds sustained the day before outside of the Confederate capital. Something needed to be done to save the Confederate army from utter annihilation. \nFor the third time in six days, Lee decided to personally lead soldiers into battle. Seeing General John Gordon and his men marching to the front, Lee went to direct them forward. Gordon and his men demanded he turn back to safety before they resumed their advance. “These men behind you are Georgians, Virginians, and Carolinians,” John Gordon told Lee. “They have never failed you on any field. They will not fail you here.”  With cries of “Lee to the rear!” Gordon’s men turned Lee back towards safety before they plunged forward towards the Bloody Angle. \nAs thousands of Confederates went forward into the maelstrom by the Muleshoe, Lee turned his attention to digging a new line that would connect his two flanks. Erected behind the slope of the Harrison House, the trenches and fortifications became known as Lee’s Last Line. The stunned survivors of Edward Johnson’s division, or what was left of it, were put to work digging. They were joined by the army’s small contingent of engineers. With the rest of the army actively engaged, the bulk of the digging and entrenching was likely done by enslaved laborers, pressed into service by a Confederate law passed in January 1864 that forced even free Black men between the ages of 18-50 to assist “in the way of work upon fortifications.” \nHour after hour the digging continued as the fighting roared just a mile away at the Bloody Angle. Both commanders understood the importance of the Muleshoe and either capturing it or holding on long enough for the last line to be finished. Grant, understanding why the Confederates held on so tenaciously, wrote to his wife, “To lose this battle they lose their cause.”  Working on the trenches, a Confederate soldier wrote “Generals Lee and Ewell walked up and down the line all night encouraging the men to work, and telling us that ‘the fate of the army depended on having that line done by daylight,’ and I knew by the way they acted that it was a critical time.” \nAs U.S. and Confederate soldiers continued dying a mile away into the early morning hours of May 13, the digging continued.",

His house, built in 1846, stood here until it burned down in 1920. McCoull, too old to serve in the army, was nonetheless an ardent supporter of the Confederacy. During the battle, members of the McCoull family hid in the basement while the rest of the house served as headquarters for Confederate general Edward Johnson, until his capture on May 12.\nAs dawn slowly began to creep across the horizon on May 13, 1864, the surviving Confederate forces were pulled out of the Bloody Angle and ordered back to Lee’s Last Line, which had been completed over the course of the night. Mississippian David Holt, who had fought through most of the battle’s worst carnage, provided a visceral testimony to the Bloody Angle’s aftermath. “We halted in a pasture and broke ranks,” he wrote. “Then came the reaction. All moved by the same impulse, we sat down on the wet ground and wept. Not silently, but vociferously and long. . . . We were covered with bloody mud from head to foot. Soon we got rations of corndodger and fried bacon, but not a man could eat.” \n\nBack at the Bloody Angle, the U.S. forces realized their Confederate foe had retreated. Weary and cautiously, the Union soldiers peered over the trenches that had been the dividing line for the last 24 hours. Realizing the salient was theirs, the Union soldiers slowly began to creep forward. They found the horrors of the Bloody Angle fully illuminated by the day’s new lights. One Massachusetts officer wrote, “the dead were piled in heaps upon heaps and the wounded men were intermixed with them, held fast by their dead companions who fell upon them continually adding to the ghastly pile.” \nBoth armies, as if shocked by the horror that had just unfolded, remained in their positions throughout May 13. Besides some light skirmishing, there were no major attacks. Grant wrote to his wife on May 13, “The world has never seen so bloody or so protracted a battle as the one being fought and I hope never will again.” \n\nThe fighting resumed on May 14. Looking to the south, Grant and Meade tried to catch Lee off guard by shifting troops to the Confederates’ right, but the Federals were rebuffed. Constant rain stalled both armies and frustrated Grant’s attempts at getting around Lee. As Lee continued to slide soldiers over to face the Federal movements, Grant figured Lee’s center was now weak and open to attack. He determined to attack Lee’s Last Line by attacking from the Bloody Angle and covering this ground, advancing towards the Harrison House in the distance. On May 17, the tired Union soldiers tramped once again into position.\nBy the morning of May 18, nearly 12,000 Federal soldiers from three corps had arranged themselves to attack Lee’s position. It required the Federals to assemble near the Bloody Angle, where, after almost a week since the fighting on May 12, many of the dead remained unburied. Some Union soldiers stuffed leaves into their noses to protect themselves from the overwhelming stench. It was not enough, for some, though. “The stench which arose from them was so sickening and terrible that many of the men and officers became deathly sick from it,” one U.S. soldier wrote. \nFederal cannon opened fire on the distant Confederate trenches before the U.S. infantry swept forward. This time, though, there would be no breach in Lee’s lines or desperate hand-to-hand combat. Studded with almost 30 cannon, the Confederate trenches were nearly impregnable. The artillery blasted away at the Federal lines, cutting great gaps away as the blue-coated soldiers crossed this ground trying to get to the Harrison House and beyond. One Confederate artillerist recollected that, “Vainly do they endeavor to press forward—again and again we break them, and their officers uselessly dash up and down their lines, endeavoring to hurl them upon our works. . .. They are but food for our gunpowder.”  Before the Federal infantry even got within musket range, the attack was turned back, and the survivors retreated. \nWith the failure of the attack on May 18, Grant and Meade reached the conclusion that they had done everything they could do at Spotsylvania. It had been ten days since the battle began, and they were no closer to breaking through Lee’s lines than they had been on May 8.  Similarly to how Grant outflanked Lee to the south following the battle of the Wilderness, Grant once more began to look for ways to get around Lee.",

On May 12, they were targeted by Federal soldiers under the command of Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Much of the fighting that occurred here has been discussed at Stop 3, the Bloody Angle. Throughout the day, Union and Confederate brigades thrown towards the Muleshoe spilled over the Bloody Angle and into this section of works. \nToday, the trenches along the East Face represent some of the best-preserved fortifications anywhere on the Spotsylvania battlefield. Though they look little more than just mounds and holes in the ground today, they tell a complex story of the evolution of warfare. The days of two opposing armies standing in open fields and blasting away at one another were largely over, replaced by near constant digging and fortifying. Theodore Lyman, one of George Meade’s staff officers, left behind one of the best written descriptions of the creation of these trenches. Impressed by the Confederates’ quick work, he wrote, “It is a rule that, when the Rebels halt, the first day gives them a good rifle-pit; the second, a regular infantry parapet with artillery in position; and the third a parapet with an abattis in front and entrenched batteries behind. Sometimes they put this three days’ work into the first twenty-four hours. . . You would be amazed to see how this country is intersected with field-works, extending for miles and miles in different directions.”  Confederate general James Walker echoed the sentiments when he wrote, “As soon as night put an end to the combat, axes, picks and shovels were sent for, and along the whole line through the night the men worked like beavers, and the crash of falling trees, the ring of axes, and the sound of the spade and shovel were heard.” \nThe trench warfare here brought harbingers of the future; stagnant conflict for years in the First World War immediately come to mind. Though slow, methodical, and at a high loss of life, Federal commanders realized that trench warfare was just as taxing on the Confederates’ ability to wage war. By keeping pressure on the Confederate forces, Grant took away Robert E. Lee’s initiative and forced Lee into defensive positions. The usually aggressive Lee, who had utilized counterattacks to devastating effect throughout the war, could now only react to Grant’s movements.\nWhile the trenches here at the Muleshoe fell to Federal attacks on May 12, the Confederate works at the next stop repelled every attack thrown at it during the entire battle of Spotsylvania.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The Confederate trenches off to the right and into the woods were defended by a division of soldiers commanded by Gen. Henry Heth. From here, they protected the Confederate right flank and guarded the approaches to Spotsylvania along the Fredericksburg Road. Though Heth’s line was also a salient, it had plenty of artillery to protect the position’s vulnerabilities. \nOpposing Heth on the morning of May 12 was Gen. Ambrose Burnside’s 9th Army Corps. Burnside, who had commanded the U.S. Army at Fredericksburg, was in a unique position. After serving well in Ohio and Tennessee, Burnside returned to Virginia at the head of the 9th Corps, but he technically outranked the army’s commander, George Meade. Rather than deal with the bureaucratic confusion of figuring how Burnside fit into the army’s command structure, Grant kept the 9th Corps separate from the rest of the Army of the Potomac. For the time being, Burnside reported directly to Grant. This though, led to unintended consequences of breakdowns in communication and coordination. The unwieldy setup first proved its setbacks at the Wilderness, when the 9th Corps floundered through the woods and were repulsed. Here at Spotsylvania, Burnside’s orders were to attack in conjunction with the assaults against the Muleshoe Salient, but there was little connecting his lines with Winfield Hancock’s to his right. Nonetheless, around 4:30 a.m. on May 12, Burnside sent his men forward to Heth’s Salient.\nThe Union soldiers soon ran into Confederate opposition.  “Our well-directed fire told on their ranks,” one of Heth’s soldiers wrote. He went on, “Though the two assaults had lasted hardly an hour. . . the Federal dead and wounded lay as thick on the ground as if a battle had raged for a day.” \nOne of the attacking regiments in Burnside’s corps was the 17th Michigan, whose monument sits in front of you. Going into action, the 17th Michigan quickly hit the Confederate lines. “The young fresh leaves of the forest made it impossible for us to see very far in any direction,” one Michigander wrote. Confederate musketry and artillery crashed into the regiment, knocking dozens down. Before the regiment could recover, a Confederate counterattack of North Carolinians surged into the Michiganders, making dozens more prisoners of war, and even capturing the 17th Michigan’s flag. In its brief attack, the 17th Michigan suffered 189 casualties of 225 men going into action—a loss of 84%.\nFighting see-sawed back and forth near Heth’s Salient over the course of May 12, but ultimately no Federals were able to break through. Heth’s Confederates held firm, and six days later again repelled the Union attacks on May 18. \nGrant and Meade had been stopped in their last attacks at Spotsylvania. Realizing they would not be able to break through, both commanders looked for ways to get their army around Lee’s right once more. To do so, they would need the Fredericksburg Road.",

                    "audioTranscript": "In front of you runs the Courthouse Road, known during the Civil War as the Fredericksburg Road. The first courthouse in Spotsylvania was constructed in 1778 and in the near century between then and the breaking out of the Civil War, the road became a major route for commerce and politics between Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania. What had been important for farmers carrying their goods to market now became vital to generals planning how to move tens of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of cannon. Whomever controlled the road, controlled how the rest of the campaign would unfold.\nUlysses S. Grant, knowing he had done what could be done at Spotsylvania, decided it was time to leave after the May 18 attacks. “I immediately gave orders for a movement by the left flank, on towards Richmond,” Grant wrote in his memoirs.  Federal soldiers began the long march in the rain and mud to swing around and get into position. The Fredericksburg Road played a monumentally important role in this march; not just as a causeway for soldiers, but as a re-supply route for provisions coming down from Fredericksburg.\nRobert E. Lee recognized this. If he could attack and sever the road, he could cut Grant off from supplies, reinforcements, and possibly even leave the Army of the Potomac stranded with no where to go. He ordered assaults to go forward and strike the road. The last fighting to occur at Spotsylvania took place in the evening hours of May 19 when those attacks hit about a mile and a half to your left on ground outside of the park today. Centered around the home of Clement Harris, the fighting left thousands more dead or wounded before the combat finally ceased. As the gun smoke cleared, the Fredericksburg Road remained in Federal hands; Lee’s attempt at cutting the road had failed.\nGrant’s men began to leave Spotsylvania the next day. They marched south, towards the North Anna River. Lee’s army had no choice but to follow, staying between the Federals and the city of Richmond. More fighting lay in the immediate future along the banks of the North Anna River and at an intersection of roads called Cold Harbor.\nThe armies left behind the debris and carnage of warfare. Over the 13-day battle of Spotsylvania Court House, nearly 32,000 U.S. and Confederate soldiers had been killed, wounded, or captured. Close to 17,000—over half of the entire battle’s casualties—were lost on May 12 alone during the fighting around the Bloody Angle. Combining the losses at the Wilderness, both armies lost 61,000 people in sixteen days.\nWounded soldiers were evacuated; Confederates towards Richmond, Federals to Fredericksburg before they could be sent further north. A Union surgeon recalled “The road, if road it may be called, was wretched indeed, the horses often sinking in mud. … through this ambulances and wagons were floundering along, carrying the wounded to Fredericksburg.” A Fredericksburg civilian, watching in horror as the steady train of wagons kept coming into the town, wrote, “The road near the fair grounds seems to be literally covered.” \nThe dead were left where they lay. Some had been hastily buried, but the constant rain washed much of the dirt and mud away, leaving the corpses exposed. A year later, Federal soldiers returned to the area on their way towards Washington at the end of the war. They came across the ghastly sites still uncovered. “The ground is covered with the remains of our soldiers who had never been buried,” one soldier wrote in May 1865. “I saw hundreds of skeletons lying as they fell with clothes and accoutrements on.”  In time, many of the dead were moved to cemeteries. Federal dead were transported to the National Cemetery in Fredericksburg; Confederate dead were brought to several local cemeteries, including one nearby in Spotsylvania. Others were not moved at all. Having died in the trenches of the Bloody Angle, many soldiers there were buried by simply pushing the trenches over the top of them. “These unfortunate victims had unwittingly dug their own graves,” one soldier wrote. They are likely still there, nearly 160 years later. \nLike so many other times during the war, it fell to the civilians to pick up the pieces. Katherine Couse, who lived near where the battle started at Laurel Hill, wrote, “Dilapidation and decay mark the course of every thing. . . there is no peace in living in this God forsaken country.” For some civilians, the battle destroyed everything they had. Sarah Spindle and her family lived near Laurel Hill when artillery shells set their home afire on May 8. Fleeing the flames, they never returned.\nAnd so, the armies left Spotsylvania behind. Fighting continued for another 11 months before finally ending at Appomattox Court House. Some veterans came back after the war, to place monuments and remember fallen comrades. Others preserved land and lobbied for the establishment of a park, which was accomplished with the creation of the Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military Park in 19",

President Lincoln demanded that Rosecrans move on the Confederates. So Rosecrans marched on to Murfreesboro to win the victory for Lincoln.  \n\nRosecrans planned his attack for New Year’s Eve of 1862.  General Bragg also planned to attack on New Years Eve.  Both armies spent the day before the battle developing their battle plans and forming their battle lines.  As nightfall approached, the men on both sides tried to settle in for the night.  \n\nNo campfires were allowed that night on either side, in order to conceal positions.  Union soldiers camped on a cold, damp ground where you stand now. Anxieties and fears were as prevalent in the soldiers’ dreams as were the memories of loved ones back at home.\nPrivate P.R. Jones from Texas described how he spent his night before the battle: “When nightfall came (we) were in a lane with rail fences on each side, about four hundred yards from the enemy.  [Our] orders were to speak only in a whisper, as the enemy’s pickets were not more than one hundred yards in front, the plan of battle being to take them by surprise the next morning.”   Soldiers anxiously waited through the freezing night, anticipating the battle that would be fought the next day.  For many soldiers that camped that night, it would be their last.",

General James Negley’s Division of the Union army fell back into these rocks which provided a natural defensive position when General Rosecrans ordered them to hold on and delay the Confederate onslaught. \n \nWith General Philip Sheridan’s division covering their rear, Negley’s men withstood several attacks between 10:00am and 11:30am.  At noon, a massive Confederate attack, organized by General A.P. Stewart and four other Confederate commanders shattered Sheridan’s lines leaving Negley’s division surrounded on three sides.  \nNegley’s men continued to fight but mounting casualties and the danger of being surrounded finally forced them to retreat.  As they tried to run from the rocks, Confederate fire piled the dead and wounded in heaps. The rocks were covered in blood and gore. Red rivulets ran down through the cracks and pooled in low spots. Soldiers who survived this bloody fight aptly named this place, “The Slaughter Pen.”\n\nForty percent of Negley’s and Sheridan’s Divisions had become casualties.  Their adversaries did not fare much better. The cost of this delaying action was high, but for the Union it was worth it. More than one third of the Confederate army had been halted for two hours buying General Rosecrans time to build a new defensive position along the Nashville Pike that would turn the tide of battle.",

Across these fields, they could see their objective, the Nashville Pike. If they could reach that road, they could cut the Federals off from their last remaining route of supply or escape.\n\nBetween the Confederates and the road, stood long lines of soldiers in blue with muskets at the ready. Union cannons covered the slope between the road and railroad waiting to unleash their deadly contents. General Rosecrans had used the time that Negley and Sheridan had bought him in the Slaughter Pen well. This two mile long line shaped like a horseshoe would force the Confederates to make frontal assaults against massed infantry and artillery to sever the Union lifeline.\n\nRains’s men were tired, hungry, and out of ammunition, but they were ready for one last charge. Within seconds of leaving the trees, Rains was dead. His men were pummeled from all directions and gave way in a matter of minutes. More and more Confederate units arrived as the day wore on, and ever larger attacks surged towards the pike. Each time, the Union artillery beat back the gray tide.\n\nA lieutenant from Texas recalled, “The Artillery opened on us and cut the timber over our heads, and it seemed that the heavens and the earth were coming together.” Without support from their cannons, every Confederate attack failed. The Union lifeline remained open, and the chances for complete Confederate victory faded along with the last rays of the setting sun.",

These men had not trained together, nor had they ever worked together. Yet, so desperate was the situation that General Rosecrans had to rely on these engineers to stop the Rebel tide.\n\nMid-day of December 31st, 1862, the Confederates attacked the Union troops here three times. The Confederates even reached within 50 yards of the Union line before being repulsed.  A  Union counter-charge was ordered and the line moved forward about a quarter of a mile to a small ridge which was lost earlier in the day.  The Chicago Board of Trade Battery fired nearly thirteen hundred rounds into their attackers during the afternoon. A Union sergeant of the Pioneer Brigade recalled seeing through the woods “the rebel flag, seen dimly through the smoke and trees, wavered, started forward, and then surged back. Yes! There was no mistake about it! It was going back!”\n  \nThe Chicago Board of Trade Battery and the Pioneer Brigade were tested and proved their worth while keeping the Nashville Pike in Federal hands.",

If the Federals placed cannons on that hill, they could threaten Confederate positions along the Nashville Pike.\nBragg ordered General John C. Breckinridge to use his 4,400 man division to reclaim the hill. Breckinridge protested, having seen dozens of Union cannons massing on the west bank of the river that could cut his men to pieces, but Bragg’s decision was final. Breckinridge relayed the order to his subordinates. Soon they were restraining General Roger Hanson, commander of the Orphan Brigade, who vowed to kill Bragg for issuing such a murderous command.\n\nBreckinridge ordered his men to load one round and fix bayonets. At 4 o’clock in the afternoon they moved forward hoping the failing light would interfere with the Union cannoneers’ aim.  As they get closer, their pace quickened and the “Rebel Yell” echoed over the field. \nThe initial charge appeared successful. Breckinridge’s men pushed the Federals off the hill and pursued them towards McFadden’s Ford. Then the ground shook as fifty-seven Union cannon fired their deadly missiles into the mass of Confederates. The cannon fire was non-stop for 25 minutes. In that short time, more than 1,800 Confederates were wounded or killed. Breckinridge’s men retreated as fresh Union troops surged across the river to retake the high ground. \n\nThis proved to be final action of the battle. Bragg ordered a withdrawal, and the Union gained a hard-earned victory that shaped the political and military course of the war.",

Recognizing the need for education, the Freedmen's Bureau, the Freewill Baptists of New England, and John Storer, came together and Storer College was born. The school survived for 88 years, enriching the lives of hundreds of students. Today you can walk the grounds of this former college campus. The route below starts at the Lockwood House but you can follow it in any order you prefer.",

Please do not stop your vehicle in the road and block traffic. Thank you, and we hope you enjoy the Sunrise Geology Audio Tour. \n\nThe road from White River up to Sunrise is a journey through the geologic history of Mount Rainier. The road carves through the slopes of a lava ridge that was shaped by ancient glaciers, leading to impressive views of not only Mount Rainier but also the surrounding region. Volcanoes and glaciers have dramatically shaped the landscape. As you travel up the mountain to Sunrise, discover geologic evidence left behind by these two forces that have molded Mount Rainier and still do so today. \n\nWhen you reach the junction of the road to the White River Campground and the Sunrise Road, set your odometer to zero before beginning the climb up to Sunrise. Mileage will be used to mark the location of some stops. As you begin your journey to Sunrise, note the exposed hillsides on the left side of the road created by the road cut. There are several pull offs along the lower part of the road, but a particularly good example of an exposed hillside is at the pull off 1.6 miles from the gate. Or, you may play the next section of the audio tour while driving. Please drive safely.",

Some of these events, such as the Osceola Mudflow, form visible layers of different types of material in the hillside road cuts. Here’s a description of what to look for along the road from Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist from the United States Geologic Survey:\n\n“As you’re traveling up the road, especially in the lower part of the valley, you’re going to see some outcrops of very loose rock unsorted. It has big boulders set into a fine matrix and much of that is from the Osceola Mudflow, the big mudflow that formed 5600 years ago when we had an eruption of Mount Rainier... So we’re looking at this landslide from just the base of the mountain, and you’ll see as you travel that it did travel a fair ways up the valley wall... It hardened here in place and you can see it’s a very unstable slope and we get a lot of small rock falls off this slope over the years.” \n\nYour next stop will be at a pull off with a low profile exhibit sign that is 2.3 miles from the gate. Across the road from the pull off is a rock formation that looks like dark grey columns embedded in the hillside. These columns are remnants of an old lava flow that helped form Sunrise Ridge. Stop at the pull off and play the next section of the tour.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The lava that formed the columnar rock formations you see at this stop flowed here during an eruption approximately 496 thousand years ago, making it one of the oldest lava flows from Mount Rainier.\n\nCarolyn Driedger: “We’re very high up here and you have to ask the question, how did the lava flow get here? Why did it perch up here so high? And the reason is because... when the eruption occurred, the valley of the White River was filled with a thousand feet or so of glacier ice at least to the surface that we are at today.”\n\nThese lava columns are evidence that the valley was once filled with glacial ice. As the lava cools it crystallizes into columns pointing in the direction of cooling. Normally, one would expect them to be vertical, assuming that the coldest direction would be the air above the lava flow. These columns however lay horizontally, indicating that the cooling surface was to the edge of the lava flow. Geologists think that this lava flow actually erupted while the White River valley was filled with a very thick Ice Age glacier. The lava flow skirted the edges of the glacier, cooling as it came into contact with the ice along its flank.

                    "audioTranscript": "If you stood at this point 5,600 years ago just before the occurrence of several major volcanic events, the volcano would have looked very different. Instead of the smooth sweep of the Emmons Glacier from the summit down to the valley floor, the northeast face of the volcano would have been broken up with craggy buttresses and ridges, much as the other sides of the volcano appear today. However, 5,600 years ago the summit and northeast flank of Mount Rainier collapsed in a gigantic avalanche during an eruption, forming a fast-moving slurry of mud and debris called the Osceola Mudflow, which washed up as high as the present site of the Sunrise Visitor Center. You may remember seeing some of the loose Osceola sediment in the hillside road cuts as you drove up the road. The eruption that created the Osceola Mudflow left a large horseshoe-shaped crater in the northeast flank of the volcano, much like the crater left on the north flank of Mount St. Helens after the 1980 eruption. The enormous Osceola Mudflow had a total volume of about a cubic mile. The mudflow filled the valleys of the White River system to depths of 300 feet or more and flowed more than sixty miles to the Puget Sound. Again, Carolyn Driedger, with the United States Geologic Survey.\n\nCarolyn Driedger: “Mount Rainier has an east-west fracture zone across its summit and that’s where magma has risen in the past and as it has risen in there it has baked the surrounding rocks... The surrounding rocks were bathed in a weakly acidic solution of sulfuric acid and that actually transformed the chemistry of the rocks, transforming the rocks from a hard rock to a soft clay... The fact that it was hydrothermally altered made the slide much more extensive than it would have been otherwise, and it slid much further down valley. Most of the hydrothermally altered rock on the east side of Mount Rainier was carried down in that mighty Osceola mudflow. The west side of the mountain and the summit still contain a fair amount of hydrothermally altered rock and that creates a hazard for people who live on the Puyallup river valley on the west side of the volcano because the rock remains and will fall some day.”\n\nSubsequent lava eruptions filled-in the horseshoe-shaped crater left by the Osceola mudflow, forming the smooth summit cone of the volcano that you see today. Glaciers reformed on the peak, but have not yet had time to carve the volcano into the craggy forms visible on other sides of the mountain. Instead, the expanse of the Emmons Glacier smoothly wraps around the northeast side of Mount Rainier.\n\nContinue along the trail to the second Emmons Vista overlook.

                    "audioTranscript": "In front of you is the Emmons Glacier. It covers 4.3 square miles and is the largest glacier by area not only on Mount Rainier but also in the contiguous United States. The present terminus of the Emmons Glacier is not where the white snow and ice ends, but rather is where the river becomes visible emerging from the dark colored, rock-covered ice front. From here you can see the uppermost Winthrop Glacier, which flows northward from the triangular-shaped Steamboat Prow to form the headwaters of the West Fork of the White River.\n\nCarolyn Driedger: “Much of the appearance of the glacier that we see today has been determined by an event that happened in 1963... Rock fell off Little Tahoma peak on the left side of the glacier, rolled down onto the surface, completely covered the lower glacier, and came part way down the valley... Because of that 1963 rock fall that brought so much rock onto the lower portion of the Emmons glacier, the Emmons glacier has a lot more rock on it, a lot more rock within it, and so the moraines here are a little bit higher than they might have been otherwise.”\n\nMoraines are piles of rock, sand, and silt left behind by glaciers as they carve the landscape. There are several different types of moraines visible from the Emmons overlooks. The terminal moraine forms at the end, or terminus, of the glacier where rocks and other materials picked up by the glacier during times of glacier advance are left behind when the glacier ice melts away, or retreats. Lateral moraines accumulate similarly along the sides of glaciers. A few hundred years ago, the Emmons Glacier extended much farther down the White River Valley than it does today. As it melted and retreated up valley, it left terminal and lateral moraines that you can see below. The small milky-green ponds visible at the bottom of the valley are formed from melt water from ice that broke off from the retreating glacier and was left behind in the core of older terminal moraines. The large, steep lateral moraines skirting the edges of the White River valley were actually left by Little Ice Age glaciers 200–500 years ago.\n\nCarolyn Driedger: “I like to say to people that the Mount Rainier your grandparents see is a little bit different from what you will see and what your grandchildren will see because we have rock fall and changes in the glaciers and sometimes we have volcanic eruptions.”\n\nThese modern-day moraines will eventually erode away or perhaps be buried by lavas or other volcanic deposits from Mount Rainier, just like the moraine layers left behind by ancestral glaciers. Future volcanic eruptions and lahars will reshape the mountain and its surrounding valleys. For thousands of years, the mountain has been built up and torn down by volcanic forces, and sculpted and molded by glaciers. These processes leave a mark, and the evidence is visible on a grand scale throughout Mount Rainier National Park.\n\nThis concludes the Sunrise Geology Audio Tour.

This tour explores the inspiring history of the free African American community of Beacon Hill in the 19th century, a community that led the city and the nation in the fight against slavery and racial injustice.  \nWe will be stopping at historic homes, churches, schools, and other important sites as we discuss the lives and legacies of these leaders and activists.  \nTogether with those that found common cause with them, this community helped turn Boston into a crucial center of the Abolition Movement, the Underground Railroad, and the early struggle for civil rights and equality.  \nFacing powerful opposition both within the city and throughout the country, this community persevered, and in doing so, helped further Boston’s reputation as a \"Cradle of Liberty\" in the ongoing American Revolution.  \nOur first stop is The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial, which commemorates one of the first African American regiments of the Civil War. Following his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, President Lincoln called for the raising of Black regiments.  Massachusetts Governor John Andrew soon created the Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry and chose Robert Gould Shaw, the son of prominent abolitionists, to serve as its colonel.  \nNotable abolitionists including Frederick Douglass and local leaders such as Lewis Hayden recruited men for the 54th Regiment. Men enlisted from every region of the country, and from as far away as Canada and the Caribbean.\nThrough their heroic, yet tragic, assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina on July 18, 1863, in which Shaw and many of his men died, the 54th helped erode Northern public opposition to the use of Black soldiers and inspired the enlistment of more than 180,000 Black men into the United States forces. \nSergeant William H. Carney, severely injured in the battle, saved the regiment’s flag. For this act of bravery, he became the first African American recipient of the Medal of Honor. \nTo commemorate this brave Black regiment, Bostonians chose Augustus St. Gaudens to create this high relief bronze monument, which sits prominently on Beacon Street across from the Massachusetts State House. Saint-Gaudens took nearly fourteen years to complete his masterpiece. \nUnveiled on May 31st, 1897, this monument depicts the 54th as they marched down Beacon Street off for war in 1863.\nIt stands as a powerful testament to the cost of freedom and to the true meaning of the Civil War.",

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had declared slavery “inconsistent” with our State Constitution a few years earlier in 1783.  While Black families had begun settling this north slope of Beacon Hill about a generation before, in the mid-1760s, Middleton’s arrival to this emerging neighborhood signaled a new beginning as he and others in that Revolutionary generation staked their claim in Boston and laid the foundation for the larger abolition and equal rights movements to come.  \nGeorge Middleton and Louis Glapion began constructing this two-family residence at 5 Pinckney Street in 1786. Finished a year later, this building is believed to be the oldest standing home on Beacon Hill. \nLouis Glapion worked as a hairdresser and may have been from the French West Indies. Glapion lived and ran his business here until his death in 1813. His wife, Lucy, continued to live here until 1832.\nWe know a little bit more about George Middleton.  During the Revolution, he led a Black militia company called the Bucks of America. While little evidence of this group has survived, they likely guarded the property of Boston merchants during the Revolution and may have also been known as the \"Protectors.\" Near the close of the Revolution, Governor John Hancock presented Middleton and the Bucks of America with a company flag. According to the historian William Cooper Nell, this banner, now preserved in the collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, served “as a tribute to their courage and devotion through the struggle.”\nA horse breaker and livery man by profession, Middleton also served in several Black community organizations. He became the third Grand Master of the African Lodge, later known as the Prince Hall Masons. In 1796, Middleton and others organized the African Society, a charitable organization dedicated to community service, uplift, and education. He became a licensed teacher in that organization as well.\nMiddleton married Elsey Marsh in 1781 at Trinity Church and died in 1815, apparently not survived by his wife or children.\nAs a leader concerned with education, the abolition of slavery, and the needs of his community, George Middleton helped build some of the early institutions and organizations in the long history of Black activism on Beacon Hill.",

In the 1840s, the Haydens escaped slavery in Kentucky and eventually settled here. They lived in this house by 1850, operated as a boardinghouse, and turned it into one of the most documented safe houses in the area. A long-time colleague of the Hayden, Henry Bowditch recalled that their house served as “the temple of refuge for any hunted refugee from Southern slavery.”  \nFollowing the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Bostonians created their third and final Vigilance Committee, an organization dedicated to fugitive assistance. As one of the most active members of this committee, Lewis sheltered and assisted scores of freedom seekers. The Haydens provided shelter, clothing, carriages, and fare to get people out of the city and further North to freedom. \nIn 1850, the Haydens sheltered the famous couple William and Ellen Craft who had escaped from slavery in Georgia through an elaborate disguise and story. The light-skinned Ellen dressed in men’s clothing and “passed” as a white male slaveholder traveling North by train and ship with her trusted “slave” William. In October 1850, slave catchers came looking for the couple in Boston’s first test of the new Fugitive Slave Law.  According to William Craft, “Lewis Hayden and I had a keg of gunpowder under his house ...with a fuse attached ready to light it should any attempt be made to capture us.” Given all of the abolitionist hostility and threats to their safety, the slave catchers abandoned their pursuit of the Crafts.  A journalist later wrote that the slave catcher called off  his pursuit because he “knew that the road to hell lay over Lewis Hayden’s threshold; and the cost to him would be rather more than the Slave Power would be ready to make up to him.” \nIn addition to protecting the Crafts, Lewis also played a crucial role in other high-profile Fugitive Slave Law cases in the city.  On February 15, 1851, slave catchers arrested Shadrach Minkins who had escaped from Virginia months earlier. Within three hours of the arrest, Hayden led a group of Black men in a daring courthouse rescue, freed Minkins from his captors, and successfully got him out of the city and further on the Underground Railroad network to Canada. In 1854, Hayden and others attempted to rescue Anthony Burns from federal custody at the same courthouse. Unfortunately, they failed, and authorities soon returned Burns to the South under heavy martial guard.  \nIn addition to his Underground Railroad work, Lewis played other prominent roles in his community. He served as Grand Master of the Prince Hall Masons, presided over numerous community meetings and participated in the Equal Schools movement. In the late 1850s, he began serving as Messenger to the Secretary of State, a politically appointed position, likely making him one of the first Black state employees.\nDuring the Civil War, he recruited Black soldiers for the Massachusetts civil war regiments. Following the War, Hayden served as one of the first Black members of the state legislature and lent his support in the fight for women’s suffrage.\nHarriet outlived her husband by four years.  When she passed away in 1893, she left her estate, valued at $5000, to Harvard University to establish the Lewis and Harriet Hayden Scholarship for Black students wishing to attend the Medical School.",

In addition to his clothing shop, limited evidence suggests that Coburn may have ran a gaming house for wealthy Bostonians in his house. However, his community activism is far better documented.\nCoburn served as the treasurer of the New England Freedom Association, an organization dedicated to assisting freedom seekers who escaped slavery and came to Boston on the Underground Railroad. Formed in the early 1840s, this group sought “to extend a helping hand to all who may bid adieu to whips and chains, and by the welcome light of the North Star, reach a haven where they can be protected from the grasp of the man-stealer.” \nIn 1851, authorities arrested, though later acquitted, Coburn for his alleged role in aiding in the courthouse rescue of Shadrach Minkins. Witness reported seeing him at the courthouse “’making inflammatory remarks shortly before the rescue began.’” \nAlong with other community leaders in the 1850s, Coburn founded the Massasoit Guards, an unsanctioned Black militia. Though state officials ignored their requests for official recognition and support, the Massasoit Guards continued to operate as a force for community self-defense. Militia groups such the Massasoit Guards can be considered precursors to the Black Civil War regiments, including the famous 54th Massachusetts.\nCoburn died in 1873 and his home passed to his son Wendell, whose widow, Mary, lived in the house until the turn of the twentieth century.",

The residences along Smith Court also provide a valuable window into the lives of the African Americans who called this neighborhood home.\nFor example, 3 Smith Court has a long association of African American occupants as well as significant activists in Boston. James Scott, the longest resident of 3 Smith Court, lived here for nearly 50 years. Born in Virginia, Scott worked as a clothing dealer in Boston. In 1851, local authorities arrested, though later acquitted, Scott for his alleged role in the rescue of freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins from the Boston courthouse. Though his involvement in the Shadrach rescue is unclear, Scott did assist other freedom seekers at his home, including Henry Jackson and his family as they made their way to freedom on the Underground Railroad in 1856. For most of the 1850s, William Cooper Nell also resided at 3 Smith Court. One of the most prominent community activists, Nell provided crucial leadership in the abolition movement and the struggle for equal education. With the publication of his book \"Colored Patriots of the American Revolution,\" Nell became one of the first published African American historians.  Like Scott, he also sheltered freedom seekers at his home on Smith Court. \nIn 1849, George Washington purchased 5 Smith Court. Born in Massachusetts in 1795, Washington worked as a bootblack and waiter.  He also served as deacon at the First Independent Baptist Church at the African Meeting House. Washington and his wife Rachel had ten children. Although he died in 1871, this house remained in the family until 1917. \n7 Smith Court served as rental property for Joseph Scarlett, an African American chimneysweep and clothing dealer.  He mainly rented to other African Americans including laborers and mariners that rarely stayed longer than three years at this property. \nBuilt in 1799, 7A Smith Court is the only surviving example of the early homes that lined Holmes Alley. This became another rental property for Scarlett in 1858.  \n2 Smith Court, built in 1853, served as the home and investment property for Scarlett as well. Prior to its construction, an earlier home stood on this site owned by William Henry, an African American tailor. Henry, his family, as well as some tenants lived here. Scarlett purchased the property in 1852, built this home, and lived here for most of the 1860s. By the time of his death in 1898, Scarlett owned fifteen different properties in Boston, Cambridge, and Charlestown. In his will, Scarlett left bequests to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and to the Home for Aged Colored Women.",

This is where you joined with William Cooper Nell as he advocated for Equal School Rights. This is where Lewis Hayden, John Smith, John Coburn, and others protested the Fugitive Slave Law and planned how to assist freedom seekers that came to Boston on the Underground Railroad. This is where you came in the early 1830s to hear Maria Stewart call for the end of slavery and for equal rights for women. This is where the Massachusetts General Colored Association came together to fight for the end of slavery and discrimination throughout the country. It is where William Lloyd Garrison formed the New England Antislavery Society, whose principles he said would quote “shake the nation by their mighty power.” It also served as a recruitment center for the 54th Regiment.\nIn his recruitment speech for the 54th, Frederick Douglass said \"... We can get at the throat of treason and slavery through the State of Massachusetts. She was first in the War of Independence; first to break the chains of her slaves; first to make the black man equal before the law; first to admit colored children to her common schools, and she was first to answer with her blood the alarm cry of the nation, when its capital was menaced by rebels. You know her patriotic governor, and you know Charles Summer. I need not add more. Massachusetts now welcomes you to arms as soldiers.\"\nThis is such a ringing endorsement of the central role played by Boston in the fight against slavery and racial injustice...so much of which emanated from this neighborhood, from this community, and from within the walls of the African Meeting House.\nThe Meeting House continued to serve as a Black church and community center until the end of the 1800s. It became a synagogue in 1904. In 1972, the Meeting House was purchased by the Museum of African American History, who continues to own and operate it today.  \nIn 1980, Boston African American National Historic Site was created as a partner with the Museum to keep these important sites preserved and protected, and to keep these crucial stories of our ongoing American Revolution alive.  \nThank you for joining us for this tour of the Black Heritage Trail.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Philadelphia’s population nearly doubled once the bulk of the British army arrived to occupy the city in late September 1777. Here at Carpenters’ Hall—where the First Continental Congress met in 1774—British soldiers were treated for their wounds. Local residents worked tirelessly in the building’s basement, weaving blankets and stitching clothes for the poor. For six weeks, conditions were difficult. City residents and the British army lacked food, clothing, firewood and other necessities because supply ships could not reach the city. The American garrison at Ft. Mifflin on the Delaware River posed one obstacle for the ships. The Americans had also placed chevaux de frise, devices used to impale ships’ hulls, in the Delaware River.  Aiding the British was Philadelphian Abraham Carlisle, a member of the Carpenters’ Company.  He informed the British where these devices were hidden. The American garrison finally fell, and using the information provided by Carlisle, the British were able to bring their supply ships into the city. Carlisle was later tried and hanged for treason.",

A demand for these and other products, like tobacco, coffee, and cacao, created the system of slavery.  \n\nRichard Derby’s sailing vessel, Schooner Pembrock, travelled from Salem to Dominica with twelve barrels of fish in 1764. The cargo also included eleven horses, sold at 20 pounds each, and nine feet of boards, lumber used to fuel fires and construct buildings and barrels.   \n\nThe Pembrock returned to Salem with barrels, known as hogsheads, filled with the products of enslaved labor.

The slave economy stretched across the Atlantic, but in Salem, the center of trade was the harbor. For this reason, the Derby House was built directly across from the busy wharves. In 1762, Richard Derby gifted this house to his son, Elias Hasket Derby. Elias joined his father’s business and went on to make his own fortune, becoming one of the region’s wealthiest merchants, often recognized as the nation’s first millionaire.   \n\nBut the business of slavery reached far beyond the wealthy merchant-class. Small-scale farmers and fishermen supplied the food products exported to feed enslaved people in the West Indies. As this trade steadily increased through the 17th and 18th centuries, shipbuilding became a major industry in port cities like Salem. It employed ironworkers, ship builders, carpenters, sailmakers, and various other skilled positions. Fishing vessels and larger trading vessels included crews of ship boys, sailors, and captains. Shopkeepers sold the various goods produced in forced labor camps. Rum distillers used molasses to produce rum, which was widely purchased and consumed throughout New England.  \n\nBy the outbreak of the American Revolution, almost 80% of New England’s exports were traded in the West Indies, where colonists depended on New England for supplies to operate the forced labor camps–mainly fish, lumber, and livestock. Today, a four-foot sculpture of an Atlantic cod fish hangs in the Massachusetts’ state capitol as a tribute to the trade that built the colony—the business of slavery.",

The backbreaking work lasted as long as the mills were running, usually from about 4 PM to 10 AM, though some accounts describe mills running 24 hours straight. At the mill, enslaved workers fed the cane through huge rollers to extract juice. At the boiling house, enslaved workers strained syrup under suffocating heat.  \n\nAt every stage the labor was dangerous, especially with little to no rest. One visitor to a Brazilian sugar plantation described the scene as, “People the color of the very night, working briskly and moaning at the same time without a moment of peace or rest, whoever sees all the confused and noisy machinery...will say that this indeed is the image of Hell.”  \n\nThe Atlantic slave economy resulted in the kidnapping, murder, and enslavement of millions of Africans. The same economic system generated privilege, power, and wealth for others across the Atlantic world as sugar became known as the “white gold.” ",

British colonists from New England easily smuggled foreign trade-goods, ignoring tax regulations and generating significant profit. By the mid-18th century, the business of slavery had transformed Salem from a rural fishing village to a thriving market town of five thousand. But from Great Britain’s point of view, the illegal trade was a threat to the empire’s power and prosperity. The solution was a stricter enforcement of tax regulations, authorized in the 1764 Sugar Act.  \n\nMerchants saw the act as a threat to their freedom—their right to conduct trade in the West Indies in the most profitable way possible. The solution was to discourage British Customs agents from enforcing regulations by punishing those that dared to. \n\nIn September of 1768, a British customs agent in Salem was dragged to the Common and attacked by a mob of outraged men, including Richard Derby. The agent, Thomas Row, became a target after reporting a group of colonists secretly removing molasses from a ship without paying taxes. The angry mob waxed the hair from his head, covered him with tar and feathers, and beat him, before parading him on a cart through town for all to see.  \n\nThe business of slavery was so fundamental to New England, that similar protests erupted into riots in other port cities. Almost ten years before the Boston Tea Party, sugar and its by-product molasses were fueling a fire that would lead to revolution.",

Major General Benjamin Cheatham (for whom this location is named) planned his defense very strategically. As early as June 24th, Cheatham would order the batteries \"to be closely masked with brush and under no circumstances to reply to the artillery of the enemy'. This strategy would be effective in essentially keeping the Federals in the dark as to where the Confederate artillery was and what kind of artillery they had. As a result, when the thickly amassed column of Union infantry approached during the battle on the 27th, they made it to within 60 yards of this position without knowing any cannons were there at all. Cheatham writes \"The advance was nearly all swept down by the first volley, the remainder being driven in confusion into the ranks of the assaulting mass\". Also, this and the batteries on the right and left of it created a deadly crossfire for the upcoming infantry, creating chaos. This 2 gun section was commanded by John W. Mebane, under Lieutenant J.

The name comes from not only the bloodshed, but also the 'dead space' offered by the angle, meaning that anyone in this position would not be visible to those in the earthworks above. Still visible today, this bulge or 'salient' in the Confederate defenses was where roughly 8 regiments (over 1,000) of Union soldiers concentrated their attack. Making it past the various field fortifications, the Federals make it to the top of the 8 foot tall earthen works and the fighting dissolves into hand to hand combat, with men using their muskets as clubs. Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry writes \"My pen is unable to describe the scene of carnage and death that ensued in the next two hours...talk about other battles, victories, shouts, cheers, and triumphs, but in comparison with this day's fight, all other dwarf into insignificance.\"\n\nDespite the 'carnage', the Confederate line held. Lieutenant Thomas Maney of the 1st Tennessee writes 'the word passed down to us to hold the works at all hazards, and it did look as if we would be pushed back by sheer force. But stand we must, and stand we did.\" The Union soldiers attacking both sides of the angle would fall back, but the ones assaulting the angle itself would dig in directly below the works, taking advantage of the 'dead space'. Today, the Illinois Monument marks that position.",

While many of the other soldiers who perished here were reinterred in soldier's cemeteries, this young man's remains were missed. They were discovered in the trenches near this location in early 1934 by the Work's Progress Administration (WPA) as part of a trail building project. His remains were moved to this current location in order to be closer to the trail. A ceremony was held to honor his service and memory on July 1st, 1934 and his casket was lowered into the grave draped in both a U.S and Confederate flag. His grave sits directly in between in what was both the Union and Confederate lines.\n\nFrom an excerpt reflecting on the 'Unknown' by Walt Whitman: \"And everywhere among these countless graves - everywhere in the many Soldiers Cemeteries of the Nation ... - as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories of slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles - not only where the scathing trail pass'd those years, but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land - we see, and see, and ages yet may see, on monuments and gravestones, singly or in massess, to thousands or tens of thousands, the significant word..

As you visit the six stops on our tour today, consider the question: How are the stories of the American Revolution remembered and re-told? Together, these tour stops reveal how our society’s collective memory is constantly evolving.\nThe house you stand in front of right now was the headquarters of General George Washington for nine months, from July 1775 until April 1776. A few months after the Revolutionary War began in April 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, Washington was appointed to take charge of the Continental Army, which required him to relocate to Boston.\nWhen Washington arrived, the home had been only recently vacated by the Vassalls, a wealthy family who had gained their fortune by owning sugar plantations in Jamaica and were loyal to the British crown. When the Vassalls fled, first to Boston, and eventually back to Britain, they left the people they enslaved at this house.  When Washington first moved into the place, he met one of them, 6-year-old Darby Vassall, swinging on the gate outside, and Washington began to order Darby Vassall around. As the story goes, rather than obeying his commands, Vassall inquired about wages, much to Washington’s surprise. Years later, Vassall often recounted the story of how he had met Washington as a child in the front yard of this very house and he recalled that Washington was “no gentleman” for expecting a boy to work without wages.\nOnce Washington settled into his new temporary home, he convened a war council which met regularly in this house to shape his military strategy. During one of the first meetings in the summer of 1775, the council decided to ban the recruitment of Black soldiers, a choice which perhaps reflected Washington’s personal views as a Virginian, who together with his wife Martha Washington, enslaved over 300 people at their Mount Vernon plantation. As one of Washington’s aides recorded in his meeting notes, the generals “Agreed unanimously to reject all Slaves” and they had, “by a great Majority,” rejected the enlistment of any Black soldiers, whether free or enslaved. However, in the winter of 1775, when the Continental Army was facing a re-enlistment crisis, Washington decided to reverse this decision and allow Black soldiers to join. His choice eventually enabled the Continental Army to become the most racially integrated army of the United States until the Vietnam War in the 1970s.\nWashington’s nine months here came to a close when he finally succeeded in his mission of driving the British army out of Boston in March 1776. To achieve this victory, he instructed the Continental Army to fortify Dorchester Heights with cannons that could reach the British forces who were located in the Boston harbor, and within two weeks on March 17th, the British troops permanently withdrew, on what is celebrated today in Boston as Evacuation Day.\nIt seems that the stories of Washington’s encounter with Darby Vassall and his initial enlistment ban of Black soldiers clash with the American Revolution’s ideals of liberty and justice for all. How do you think you can reconcile these stories and ideals, if at all?",

During the Revolutionary War, soldiers of the Continental Army used this area to practice military drills and set up camps. The various memorials and monuments you see here allude to the long history of this park. In addition to memorials related to the Civil War and the Irish Potato Famine, there are several monuments here related to the American Revolution. In particular, there are three notable monuments clustered in a circle directly off of Garden Street as you walk from the direction of the Longfellow House, our previous stop.\nFirst, the three cannons you see were installed in 1875 as part of the state’s centennial celebrations of the American Revolution. Contrary to a myth popular at the time of their installation, these cannons were not brought to Boston by General Henry Knox all the way from Fort Ticonderoga, which was 300 miles away in upstate New York. While this feat did in fact occur and was crucial in securing the key victory of Dorchester Heights described during our previous stop, these particular cannons which you see here were abandoned by the British army when they evacuated Boston in 1776.\nLocated near these cannons are two markers which commemorate the elm tree under which Washington supposedly first took command of the Continental Army in July 1776.  This myth was perpetuated by the fictitious Diary of Dorothy Dudley which was published in 1875, also as part of the American Revolution centennial celebrations. The fictional diary entries were written by author Mary Williams Greeley and were intended to evoke what living in Cambridge might have been like a century earlier.  However, after its publication, some writers treated the diary as a factual primary source, leading people to believe stories such as this one about the Washington elm tree. While this legend was finally debunked decades later by the Cambridge Historical Commission, the organization reports that “the image of the tree still remains a symbol of patriotism in Cambridge.”\nFinally, the most recent addition to this set of monuments is a memorial to Prince Hall, a leader in Boston’s free Black community during this period, which was dedicated in 2010. It is very likely, according to the historical record, that Hall fought in the Revolutionary War. He was also a vocal supporter of integrating the army. Following the war, Hall founded the first Black masonic lodge in America, whose purpose was to provide mutual aid, support, and advocacy. Throughout his life, he submitted various petitions to the Massachusetts legislature advocating for causes in which he believed. In 2008, the Cambridge City Council voted to name Hall a founding father, as someone who “challenged the principles of democracy, civil rights, and equality... and who embod[ies] the ‘we’ in ‘we the people.’”\nWhich monument speaks to you the most?

                    "audioTranscript": "The Old Burial Ground was established in around 1635, only five years after the settlement of Newtowne, known today as Cambridge, was founded. Since this was the only cemetery in Cambridge for almost 200 years, the townspeople buried here came from many different walks of life. For example, elite families such as the Vassalls who paid for the construction of our first tour stop the Longfellow House, are buried here. At least nineteen soldiers from the Revolutionary War were also buried here, including two Black soldiers named Cato Freeman and Neptune Frost.\nCato Freeman, born as Cato Stedman, was enslaved by Ebenezer Stedman, a militia captain in Cambridge. Sometime in 1775, he obtained freedom from his enslaver, changed his last name to Freeman, and joined the Continental Army.\nDespite his newfound freedom, it is likely that Freeman, like other Black soldiers in the Continental Army, would have had to take care of menial tasks similar to those which he had performed when he was enslaved. Freeman spent more than six years in service, though sources differ on what regiments and battles he joined. One record indicates that he survived the brutal and infamous winter of 1777-78 at Valley Forge with General Washington. Following the war, Freeman relocated to the city of Providence in Rhode Island, got married, and had several children. Freeman was sent back to Cambridge in 1790 by the Providence council when his family faced financial difficulties. As historian Ruth Herndon writes, Freeman’s story “underscores the economic vulnerability of former slaves” because they lacked the start-up resources necessary to move west or cultivate large plots of land.\nFreeman does not have a headstone in this Old Burial Ground. While there are 1,218 marked graves, there are likely hundreds more buried here, because during the colonial period, burial spaces were reused. Nevertheless, it is almost certain that he is buried here, although there is not enough evidence to determine where exactly his plot is located.\nFreeman’s story illustrates the tension between liberty and enslavement in the American Revolution. The story of Freeman as a man who was emancipated on the eve of the Revolution illustrates the tension between the ideal of liberty which patriots espoused and the institution of slavery which they continued to uphold.\nWhat does the story of Cato Freeman reveal about the American Revolution and about New England as the so-called “cradle of liberty”?",

Congress had arranged that Washington would have command of the entire residence, except for a single room that would continue to be occupied by Harvard’s president. Washington spent about two weeks here before moving into the Vassall estate on July 15th.\nAlthough Washington’s time here at Wadsworth House was short, he certainly kept busy during his stay. The day after arriving in Cambridge, Washington rode from here to Cambridge Common to officially take command of the troops. At the end of his first week here, on July 9th, Washington convened the first Council of War, and they are believed to have met right here in this building.\nThat said, Washington’s days here at Wadsworth House were limited, and we aren’t exactly sure why. Within four days of arriving, Washington requested that Congress find a “more agreeable” house in Cambridge for his headquarters. The very next day, Congress identified the Vassall estate. There are a number of theories as to why Washington made this request. Could he have wanted his headquarters to be in a more secluded location? Was he not a fan of having to share space with the president of Harvard? Did he want his headquarters to be located further away from his troops’ barracks? We aren’t sure. But as we’ve seen throughout this tour, the story of history isn’t always complete.\nI mentioned a moment ago that Washington may have wanted to be further away from his troops’ barracks. Now, you may be asking yourself just how close is the Wadsworth House to the Continental Army’s barracks? Well, you’ll have the chance to see for yourself, since the location of those barracks is the next stop on our tour - Massachusetts Hall.",

When Washington first took command of the troops, he was underwhelmed to say the least. Not only was he disappointed to discover that the size of the army was far smaller than he had expected, but he was also disturbed by the dynamics he witnessed among the troops.\nWashington felt strongly that there ought to be clear distinctions between officers and enlisted men. And evidently he worked quickly to make these delineations a reality. Just five days after arriving in Cambridge, it was written of Washington’s troops that there were “great Distinctions made between Officers and Soldiers,” and “everyone is made to know his Place and keep in it.” During his first month in Cambridge, Washington took steps to make the hierarchy of his troops tangible and visible. In the absence of standardized uniforms, Washington asked Congress for “Badges of Distinction” to give status an unmistakable physical presence.\nIn addition to this, Washington -- along with many other high-ranking military men of the day -- felt that social status outside of a military context played an important role in shaping the dynamics between officers and soldiers. In fact, he wrote to John Hancock in 1776 that unless officers were drawn from the higher ranks of society “soldiers would regard them ‘no more than a broomstick.’”\nIn some ways, Washington's emphasis on hierarchy clashes with the central role of equality in the language of the Revolution.

Since historic preservation was not on the minds of many during the early years of the United States, all of the other fortifications built during the war were lost to farmers and developers. We’ll be getting into more details about the history of Fort Washington once you arrive, but on your way, consider the role of historic preservation. Are there any historical landmarks in your town that you’re glad have been preserved? Is there anything you know of that you wish had been preserved?\nWe now recommend pausing this audio until you arrive at Fort Washington.\n\nYou’ve just arrived at Fort Washington, the last remaining physical remnant of the many fortifications built by the Continental Army. During the siege of Boston, the Continental Army was very fearful of attacks from the British, so practically as soon as Washington arrived in Cambridge, they set out to build a number of fortifications throughout the area. Small earthwork fortifications, such as the one you see here, “were built to prevent the movement of British troops up the Charles River.”\nSome of the most important fortifications, however, were the ones built on Dorchester Heights, just south of Cambridge. Beginning on March 2, 1776, the Continental Army used gunfire from some of its other fortifications for cover as it marched into position in Dorchester Heights. Once they arrived, the troops helped finish the job of fortifying the hills, which was no easy task given that the ground was practically frozen solid. Less than two weeks later, not wanting to face an attack from above, British forces began their evacuation, thereby bringing an official end to the siege of Boston.\nAlthough this three-gun battery may not have been as crucial to the troops as the fortifications in Dorchester Heights, it's important to us today because it gives a sense of what it meant in 1775 to fight a war. And it is thanks to a local family’s efforts to carefully preserve it that we are able to have this small window into the past. Recognizing this, in 1858, this place was restored to the condition you see it in today by the collaborative efforts of the City of Cambridge and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nWe hope you’ve enjoyed exploring the history of the Continental Army in Cambridge. As you go on your way, we invite you to once again consider the question we posed to you at the start of this tour in light of everything you’ve seen and heard today -- How are the stories of the American Revolution remembered and re-told?\nWe'd like to give special thanks to the Boston Camerata and their artistic director Anne Azéma for providing permission for us to use a selection of their music for this tour.

To this day, members of the Massachusett return every year to the Common to rebuild a fishing weir on the same ground.  \n\nSeafaring Europeans began to interact with indigenous communities in the 1500s. They brought with them European diseases to which the indigenous people had no resistance. By the time English Puritans arrived to permanently settle the area in 1630, native communities had been decimated by those diseases. While indigenous people suffered significant losses and destruction at the hands of European invaders from early interactions, they have gone and continue to go to great lengths to try to preserve their land, history, and culture in the face of oppression. \n\nWhile occupying the land, the English established the Common as a public space—an area held in common by the Puritan settlers. The Common served a combination of public, military, agricultural, and recreational purposes. The most celebratory functions typically occurred on training days, during which militia companies from Boston and surrounding communities trained and drilled on the Common, followed by a carnival-like atmosphere of food and entertainment. Yet the space also held public executions, including those of religious dissenters like Mary Dyer, a banished Quaker who returned to Boston, as well as at least 50 indigenous people of the Narragansett, Pocumtuck, Nipmuc, and Wampanoag tribes following King Phillip’s War. \n\nActivity on the Common continued during the Revolutionary era. In the 1760s and 70s, protests against British policies took the form of mass meetings as well as public acts of destruction. In 1768 and again in 1774, British soldiers encamped and trained on the Common. When war broke out in 1775, the British dug artillery entrenchments here.  \n\nFollowing the war, George Washington, John Adams, and the Marquis de Lafayette celebrated the nation’s independence in this space. In the 1800s, abolitionists used the Common to voice support for the end of slavery and the United States Army recruited soldiers to fight in the Civil War. During the fight for the 19th Amendment, suffragists drew crowds at open-air meetings and rallies here. In the 20th century, Charles Lindbergh spoke to an audience on the Common about the future of commercial aviation. Numerous Anti-Vietnam War and Civil Rights rallies, including one led by Martin Luther King Jr., took place on the Common. The first Boston Pride marches held a rally at Parkman Bandstand.

Following his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, President Lincoln called for the raising of Black regiments. Massachusetts Governor John Andrew soon created the Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry and chose Robert Gould Shaw, the son of prominent abolitionists, to serve as its colonel. Through their heroic, yet tragic, assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina on July 18, 1863, in which Shaw and many of his men died, the 54th helped erode Northern public opposition to the use of Black soldiers and inspired the enlistment of more than 180,000 Black men into the U.S. forces. To commemorate this brave Black regiment, Bostonians chose Augustus St. Gaudens to create this high relief bronze monument, which sits prominently on Beacon St. across from the Massachusetts State House. Unveiled in 1897, this monument depicts the 54th as they marched down Beacon St. off to war in 1863.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Crowds lined Beacon Street on the morning of May 31, 1897. They awaited a military parade that had been organized for the unveiling of the Robert Gould Shaw/Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial, a memorial recognizing the brave Black regiment and its fallen leader.  \n\nSurviving members of Massachusetts’ Black regiments—the 54th and 55th Regiments and the 5th Cavalry—paraded amongst a flurry of flags and cheers, bringing to mind similar images of much younger soldiers of the 54th who marched off to battle in May 1863, ready to shed their blood for the cause of liberty. Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens captured this first march in his bronze relief of the steady Colonel Shaw on horseback marching alongside his determined soldiers.  \n\nAs the veterans met their past when they arrived at the Massachusetts State House, Saint-Gaudens recalled a remarkable moment: \n\n\"There stood before the relief 65 of these veterans… Many of them were bent and crippled, many with white heads, some with bouquets.  The impression of those old soldiers, passing the spot where they left for war so many years before, thrills me even as I write these words…They seemed as if returning from the war, the troops of bronze marching the opposite direction...the young men there represented now showing these veterans the vigor and hope of youth.  It was a consecration.\" \n\nThe Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial commemorates one of the first Black regiments from the North to serve in the Civil War. After President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in early 1863, the administration allowed the enlistment of Black soldiers. Massachusetts Governor John Andrew quickly organized the formation of the state’s Black regiment—the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. Largely due to the support of Black abolitionists, recruitment for the regiment exceeded expectations. African Americans from Massachusetts and beyond lined up to serve. Andrews enlisted Robert Gould Shaw, a Bostonian from a notable abolitionist family, to command the regiment.  \n\nThough willing to serve their country, the Black regiment faced both public opposition and internal discrimination. As these men fought for the United States, they also argued for equal pay and treatment from their own government.  \n\nThe 54th challenged this discrimination through their service, bravely jumping into the fray. The regiment is most remembered for leading the futile assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina in July 1863, resulting in the death of Colonel Shaw and the wounding, capture, or killing of over 250 of his men. This heroic, yet tragic, assault showed the public that African Americans were willing to die for their country and for the liberty of others.  \n\nThe actions of the 54th helped inspire the enlistment of more than 180,000 Black men…a boost in morale and manpower that Lincoln recognized as essential to the victory of the United States and the destruction of slavery throughout the country. \n\nFollowing the Civil War, a committee of Bostonians commissioned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to produce a work memorializing the regiment and Colonel Shaw. After over ten years, Saint-Gaudens completed the relief and the memorial found its permanent home on Boston Common facing the main staircase to the Massachusetts State House. \n\nIn his keynote speech at the 1897 dedication, Booker T. Washington said the monument stands “for effort, not victory complete.” He called on people to continued action by saying, “What these heroic souls of the 54th Regiment began, we must complete.” Generations of Bostonians have since answered this call. Numerous activist groups and organizations have used the Memorial as a site of public protest,  pushing for the expansion of civil rights and daring their country to more truly fulfill its founding principles.   \n\nTake a moment to admire the detail in the memorial. The back of the memorial, facing the Common contains an inscription and sits above a fountain.  \n\nThe Robert Gould Shaw/Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial is also the first stop of the Black Heritage Trail. This Trail explores the inspiring history of the free African American community of Beacon Hill in the 19th century, a community that led the city and the nation in the fight against slavery and racial injustice.

That afternoon, Angelina Grimke, the first woman to ever address a sitting U.S. legislative body, took the podium on behalf of 20,000 women who petitioned for the end of slavery in Washington D.C.: \n\n\"These petitions relate to the great and solemn subject of American slavery-a subject fraught with the deepest interest to this republic, whether we regard it in its political, moral, or religious \taspects.

                    "audioTranscript": "On July 4, 1829, a young William Lloyd Garrison stood in the nave of Park Street Church, preparing to give the first of many antislavery lectures here. Just 23 years old, the future famed abolitionist joined an event run by the American Colonization Society, which throughout the 1820s had been hosting lectures and church services every July to promote their goal of re-colonizing West Africa with freed enslaved people of African descent. Many White supporters saw this as a way to rid the country of Black people, though given the growing population of millions of enslaved people of African descent in the South, it would never feasibly bring an outright end to slavery. Believing this tactic was neither moral nor practical, Garrison forcefully addressed the crowd: \n\n\"I have said that the claims of the slaves for redress are as strong as those of any Americans could be, in a similar condition. Does any man deny the position? The proof, then, is found in the fact that a very large proportion of our colored population were born on our soil, and are therefore entitled to all the privileges of American citizens. This is their country by birth, not by adoption. Their children possess the same inherent and unalienable rights as ours, and it is a crime of the blackest dye to load them with fetters.\" \n\nPark Street Church has stood on this corner, opposite Boston Common, since 1809. The elegant spire of this church and its carillon, or church bells, which sounds twice daily from its steeple, have long been landmarks in downtown Boston. The first members of Park Street Church organized as a reaction to the theology of Unitarianism, a doctrine that began to dominate many old Orthodox Congregational churches in the early 1800s. The church organized with a strict adherence to the Trinity—a firm belief in one God who exists in three persons: God the Father, God the son—who is Jesus Christ, and God the Holy Spirit. \n\nThe church also operated in a very evangelical fashion, which differentiated it from old-line Congregationalism. This evangelicalism gave rise to this intersection being nicknamed “Brimstone Corner.” The church’s evangelical mission also meant it organized and supported some of the earliest missionaries sent out of the United States. The most notable, and perhaps most consequential missionaries, went to Hawaii beginning in 1819. The missionary work from Park Street established the first permanent White settlements on the islands. The work proved quite successful in establishing Christianity on the Islands, but from a standpoint of the native Hawaiian peoples it marked permanent change and erasure of their heritage. Just generations later, many descendants of these missionaries were directly involved in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and eventual annexation of the islands by the United States in the 1890s. In many ways, the annexation and eventual statehood of Hawaii began here. \n\nWhile founded after the Revolutionary War, it remained a space of discussion for the founding principles, serving as an auditorium for lectures, speeches, and performances. During the 1800s, abolitionist organizations held events here that made the argument to expand liberty to all, and in 1902, Filipina activist Clemencia Lopez called for the independence of her country to a crowd of women, declaring: “After all, you ought to understand that we are only contending for the liberty of our country, just as you once fought for the same liberty of yours.” \n\nToday, Park Street Church maintains an active evangelical congregation with weekly services.",

They called attention to the historic sites of the Revolutionary era, drawing contrasts between the country’s early beliefs in independence and liberty and its current actions against the Vietnamese and other nations. Making their way along the Trail, protestors stopped at the Granary Burying Ground. The Boston Globe reported: \n\n\"The group moved on to the Old Granary Burying Ground where signs posting the number of American, South and North Vietnamese casualties were planted beside the tombstone of David Townsend, a surgeon in the Battle of Bunker Hill, who died in 1829.\" \n\nOne of Boston’s earliest burying grounds, the Granary Burying Ground serves as the resting place of early victims to British tyranny as well as Revolutionary heroes. When Boston’s first burying ground, now known as the King’s Chapel Burying Ground, began to run out of adequate burial space in the late 1650s, the community established two additional burying grounds: the North End’s Copp’s Hill in 1659 and the Granary Burying Ground in 1660.  The Burying Ground acquired its present name from a granary, a grain storage building, built next door in 1737 where the Park Street Church stands today. Despite its proximity to the Park Street Church, Granary Burying Ground predates it by 150 years.  \n\nWalk through any of Boston’s burying grounds and you can find examples of the iconic New England gravestone art, including such images as: skulls with wings (known as death heads), cherubs, hourglasses, scythes, willow trees, and Classical urns. Though there are over 2,000 burial markers throughout the Granary, it is estimated that more than 5,000 people lay buried here. These include some of the most famous residents of colonial Boston, such as John Hancock, Paul Revere, James Otis, Samuel Adams, Robert Treat Paine, as well as Crispus Attucks and the victims of the Boston Massacre. But buried in the Granary are also far less famous figures, such as victims of fire and plague, Frank, a man enslaved to John Hancock and whose relatively simple headstone rests in the shadow of Hancock’s monument, and generations of common people.  \n\nGranary Burying Ground remains a popular stop on the Freedom Trail where visitors can pay tribute to the named and unnamed revolutionaries of colonial Boston.",

                    "audioTranscript": "On March 10th, 1776, as the Continental Army bore down on Boston from Dorchester Heights just south of town, Rev. Henry Caner of King’s Chapel took out the church’s Register of Marriages and wrote one final entry: \n\n\"An unnatural rebellion of the colonies against His Majesty’s government obliged the loyal part of his subjects to evacuate their dwellings and substance, and take refuge in Halifax, London, and \telsewhere; by which means the public worship at King’s Chapel became suspended, and is likely to remain so until it pleases God…to change the hearts of the rebels, or give success to His \tMajesty’s arms for suppressing the rebellion.\"\t \n\nAs the British army evacuated Boston a week later on March 17, most of those loyal to the crown fled to Nova Scotia, including about a third of the King’s Chapel congregation and Rev. Caner, who never returned to Boston. \n\nKing’s Chapel, founded in 1686 as Boston’s first Anglican church, held services in several temporary locations around town until 1688 when a wooden chapel was constructed on the corner of the town’s first burying ground, now known as the King’s Chapel Burying Ground.  The current stone chapel, designed by architect Peter Harrison in 1749 and completed in 1754, possesses one of the most elegant Georgian church interiors of the colonial era. The sanctuary features two rows of double Corinthian columns, a large pipe organ, and box pews, which were originally privately owned. In the years leading up to the American Revolution, many in the congregation remained loyal to the crown, including Charles Paxton, the Collector of Customs in Boston in 1767, and estate owner Isaac Royall Jr. Charles Paxton infamously called for troops to occupy Boston in order to enforce the controversial taxes laid out by Parliament in the Townshend Acts. Isaac Royall Jr., a wealthy land owner, enslaved dozens of people on his Medford estate which today houses one of the only surviving slave quarters in Massachusetts. \n\nAfter the evacuation of Rev. Caner and the Loyalist members of the congregation in 1776, it took years for the remaining congregation to hold services at King’s Chapel. In the mean time, the neighboring Old South Church used the Chapel for their services due to the damage their building had sustained during the Siege of Boston. During this period, the Chapel hosted the funeral for Dr. Joseph Warren, killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill, when he could be properly buried nearly a year later in April 1776. In 1782, the remaining congregation, led by prominent congregants Thomas Bulfinch and Joseph May, finally returned to the stone chapel. Lacking a minister, the congregation invited James Freeman to act as a lay reader, or non clergy member, to lead Sunday services. Under Freeman’s leadership the chapel edited the Anglican Book of Common Prayer to reflect a Unitarian theology and in 1787 the congregation officially declared themselves Unitarian and independent, making King’s Chapel the first Unitarian church in the United States. The congregation still meets in the 1754 building and remains an active Christian Unitarian church today. In addition to hosting services, King’s Chapel is open for general visitation.",

                    "audioTranscript": "\"The sweet Remembrance of [the] just/Shall flourish while they sleep in dust\" - Tomb of Elizabeth Salter, King’s Chapel Burying Ground \n\nThe King’s Chapel Burying Ground is the oldest European burial space in the city of Boston, dating back to 1630 and the earliest days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Serving as the primary burial space for the town until around 1660, the earliest colonists of Boston, including many of the early governors, clergy, and regular folks are buried here. Among the headstones are some of the best examples of New England gravestone art, notably the 1678 Joseph Tapping headstone featuring a carved skeleton snuffing out a candle while Father Time with his scythe stands behind it, trying to hold the skeleton back. Another notable headstone is that of Elizabeth Pain, whose inscription includes a crest that resembles the letter A, which may have inspired author Nathaniel Hawthorne when writing The Scarlet Letter, which references the burying ground.   \n\nThough the burying ground is known today as the King’s Chapel Burying Ground, it actually has no official connection to King’s Chapel and predates the founding of the chapel by almost fifty years. The burying grounds of Boston are Puritan burial spaces, which means they are unconsecrated, or in other words they are not sacred or holy spaces and are owned and administered by the town, not the church. Even today the burying grounds are owned and administered by the city. The burying ground’s status as a town-owned and unconsecrated burial space led the founding congregation of King’s Chapel to build the original wooden chapel on top of the burying ground in 1688. \n\nIn 1686, King James II reorganized the government of Massachusetts Bay to exercise more direct control on the colony, sending a Royal Governor for the first time. Around the same time, the Church of England sent a minister to Boston to gather Boston’s Anglicans into a congregation. Despite Anglicanism being the official state religion, there were no Anglican churches in Boston or anywhere in Massachusetts prior to 1686 because religious dissenters, the Puritans, had established the colony as a way to seek distance from the established Church of England. Though the Puritans freely practiced their religion in Massachusetts, they actively prevented the establishment of other churches. As a result, after the founding of King’s Chapel in the summer of 1686, no Boston landowner would sell land to construct a permanent church. After nearly two years of meeting in temporary locations and still unable to purchase private land, the town allowed a permanent structure to be built right on the burying ground, moving the graves on that site to another portion of the grounds. The current stone chapel still sits on this same plot, on the corner of Tremont and School Streets. Exhuming graves to build the Chapel may appear extreme, but the construction received little pushback from those in Boston due to Puritan belief and the nature of the burying grounds as explicitly non-sacred spaces. By the time of King’s Chapel’s construction the burying ground no longer stood as the main burial space for Boston, as by that time the Granary and Copp’s Hill Burying Grounds had been established to provide additional burial space. \n\nThe King’s Chapel Burying Ground remains open for visitors to walk amongst the gravestones of colonial Bostonians.",

Known as the Boston Latin School, this school became an institution that prepared boys for entry into Harvard. The first headmasters held classes in their homes until the completion of the school building at this site. The wooden structure remained for the next 100 years, and then it moved across the street to a new location. A mosaic in the sidewalk commemorates this original site of the school. Today, Boston Latin is near the Longwood Medical area of Boston, and it remains one of the highest rated schools in the entire country. \n\nIn the 1700s, several of Boston's well-known revolutionary figures, such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock, studied here before attending Harvard. A statue of Benjamin Franklin remembers the school’s most famous dropout. In fact, the majority of male students in Boston did not attend this or the North Latin School in Boston. Paul Revere, and many others who did not have the social standing or the marks for Latin school, instead attended one of Boston's writing schools. Rather than learning the classics, writing schools taught boys the handwriting skills needed for business: contracts, letters, and account ledgers. Many more, however, simply did not, or could not, afford the time spent at school, and any children who were not White and not male were simply not allowed to access the publicly funded schools. \n\nBy the 1800s, public schools opened to some girls, and Boston’s Public School Committee eventually funded segregated schools for the local African American community after Black community leaders had run their own school for several years. The disparity in funding, however, became painfully stark: The Abiel Smith School on nearby Beacon Hill had far fewer resources for its Black students. It took decades of community activism—petition writing, court cases, and lobbying—to integrate Boston schools in 1855. Girls and young women also faced educational barriers. By 1854, only one public high school for girls existed, located in the neighborhood of Roxbury. Access to publicly funded secondary schools became one of the demands of women’s rights advocates in the area. \n\nStruggles for equal access to quality education continued into the 20th century. By midcentury it became painfully obvious once again to Black Bostonians that the school system, though it legally could not segregate, effectively segregated Black students into under-resourced schools. Activists led by women, such as Melnea Cass, organized protests and demanded public inquiries into the de facto segregationist policies of Boston Public Schools. In the mid-1970s, a court ordered busing plan came into effect to attempt to mitigate the racial disparities in the school system. Bringing children from Black neighborhoods like Roxbury to White neighborhoods like South Boston and Charlestown, Boston found itself rocked with vicious protests and violence as White Bostonians vehemently protested and attempted to resist the busing plan. \n\nThe legacy of the Boston Latin School is one that highlights the complicated challenge that faces all communities: How to best educate the next generation so it can effectively lead society into an unknown future.",

And there sat Benjamin discoursing loudly, and having for auditors on this occasion Felton; Captain Sumner; Perley Poore, the editor; Giovanni Thompson, the artist; myself; and hovering far and near, Fields, listening, laughing, and despatching parcels.\" - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow \n\nBy walking down School Street towards Washington Street in the mid-1800s, as the famed American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow walked regularly to meet his printers, Ticknor and Fields, you were entering the literary center of the city. With the subtle smell of ink and paper in the air, this area served as the home of approximately 40 booksellers. Beginning in 1829, booksellers occupied the gambrel-roof building on the corner of School and Washington streets. This building became known as the Old Corner Bookstore. The bookstore gained its prominence in the literary world under the ownership of William D. Ticknor and James T. Fields. From the 1830s to the 1860s, these two men helped shape the literary scene of Boston.  \n\nOn the shelves of their bookstore customers found books written by New England writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Louisa May Alcott, as well as British writers Alfred Lord Tennyson and Charles Dickens. Ticknor and Fields largely supported the Transcendentalist movement, taking a chance on publishing Henry David Thoreau’s Walden after encouragement from other authors. Their combined interest in growing their firm as well as publishing intellectually provocative literature guided their business decisions.  \n\nTicknor, the senior partner, had long established himself as a respectable judge of literature. It was Ticknor who made the decision to sell Tennyson’s Poems, likely one of the first American publishers to pay an international copyright to a British author. Ticknor also became close friends with the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. In Ticknor’s office at the back of the store sat a chair for the popular American author. Ticknor’s son later recalled: \n\n\"I have seen [Hawthorne] seated in the ‘Old Corner Bookstore’ beside my father’s desk, and when he asked a question, if my father looked up suddenly, as was his habit, Hawthorne’s face would flush like a bashful girl’s – then laughing he would resume the conversation.\"  \n\nIn the later years of the firm, Ticknor focused mostly on the business side of the publishing firm, trusting Fields’ refined taste for literature. Fields used his charm to sway authors to hand over their manuscripts, expanding the firm’s reach. As a New York journalist wrote:  \n\n\"Fields, the publisher, is the hub in which every spoke of the radiating wheel of Boston intellect has a socket – the central newsgiver, listener, sympathizer, gossip, and adviser...\" \n\nWhile this site has a long history of being a bookselling hub in the 19th century, the history of the site goes back much further. In the 1630s, Anne Hutchinson held secret, unorthodox religious meetings. Her belief that individuals could form their own relationships with God resulted in her being tried for heresy and subsequently exiled from the colony. \n\nBuilt in 1718, this building was an apothecary for druggist Thomas Crease. In the 1800s and early 1900s it served as a bookstore and other commercial stores. In 1960, this building was threatened to be demolished and replaced by a new parking structure. However, a group of citizens jumped into action to save the Old Corner Bookstore, one of the oldest brick buildings in Boston.

Celestial muse, my arduous flight sustain, And Raise my mind to a seraphic strain!\" \n\nPhillis Wheatley, kidnapped as a young girl in West Africa and enslaved in Boston by the Wheatley family, wrote those opening lines to a poem entitled Thoughts on the Works of Providence sometime in the early 1770s. Her words were undoubtedly inspired in part by the sermons she heard from the balcony of her spiritual home: the Old South Meeting House. \n \nOld South was the third congregational church in Boston. Dissenters established the congregation in 1669 following a disagreement with the leadership of the First Church of Boston over congregational membership and voting rights. In 1729 this dissenting congregation built their new Meetinghouse that still stands today: the Old South Meeting House. The structure remains a brick and wood expression of their Puritan beliefs and worship style. The interior is a soaring and light-filled but severely plain open square. All attention is directed toward the elevated pulpit. Phillis Wheatley became a member of the congregation in 1771, joining a congregation that proved supportive of the Patriot cause led by Old South member Samuel Adams. Even though she was a member, Wheatley likely sat in the balcony while prominent White families sat in rented pew boxes on the floor. Inspired by her faith, Wheatley wrote on many subjects. Most notably, she published challenges to the institution of slavery. All the while, the Revolution grew in intensity. \n\nThough Boston had a town meeting hall just a few blocks away in Faneuil Hall, mass meetings of townspeople met at Old South Meeting House during particularly fraught crises. In 1770, only Old South could contain the thousands who demanded justice in the aftermath of the Boston Massacre. Three years later in 1773, meetings adjourned again from Faneuil Hall to Old South Meeting House, but this time in response to a standoff over the enforcement of Parliament’s Tea Act. On December 16, 1773, the most significant of these meetings at Old South convened. When word arrived that the royal governor would not allow the tea to leave Boston Harbor, the meeting was interrupted by whooping and yelling from young men loosely disguised as Indigenous people. Someone reportedly shouted: “Boston harbor a tea-pot tonight!” \nHundreds followed to the harbor and witnessed those who were under disguise dump 92,000 pounds of tea into the harbor. Less than two years later, war exploded in Boston. During Boston’s occupation, British forces tore out the pews and turned Old South into a riding stable. \n \nWhen the British forces evacuated Boston in March, 1776, it took roughly seven years to refurnish Old South. Challenges to slavery and injustice did not end with the Revolution. In 1847 Old South’s senior minister George Blagden told his congregation: \n\"[In] condemning the sins of men, and calling them to repentance and to Christ, we are to let the outward relations of society...alone, and faithfully condemn the sins committed [to] those relations...let all outward distinctions, recognized and established by human law, whether that of [kings] and subject, or master and slave, alone.\" \n\nOld South served as a recruiting station for the Union Army during the Civil War. In 1862, Reverend Manning and Old South helped create the New England Freedman’s Aid Society, dedicated to providing teachers and other aid for \"the industrial, social, intellectual, moral, and religious improvement\" of the formerly enslaved. \n\nDespite narrowly escaping destruction during the Great Fire of 1872, the congregation moved to a new church in the Back Bay neighborhood and the Old South Meeting House risked demolition. Preservationists rallied to save the building, and Old South became a place for commemoration, education, and public speech. Now operated by the non-profit Revolutionary Spaces, Old South Meeting House remains a place for free speech, educational programs, and reenactments or theatrical performances, offering opportunities to learn and contemplate the past.  ",

The seeds of Patriots & Heroes...were then & there sown...Then and there was the first scene of the first Act of opposition to the Arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the Child Independence was born...\"\t \n\nWriting to his friend, William Tudor Senior, in 1817, John Adams reflected on the Revolution that created a nation he spent nearly his entire adult life serving. Looking back fondly to when he was a young lawyer, Adams recalled hearing his mentor and friend James Otis forcefully argue a case before the Superior Court inside the Town House, better known today as the Old State House. In 1761, Otis presented the first legal arguments that challenged the reach of British law in British North America. In this particular case, Otis argued against what were known as “Writs of Assistance.” Such writs gave royal custom officials the complete freedom to search homes, ships, and warehouses if they were suspected of having smuggled contraband. It empowered them to seize such goods without having to obtain a specific warrant. Standing before the Superior Court justices at the Old State House, James Otis made a four-hour speech opposing the writs, declaring, “This writ is against the fundamental principles of law...the privilege of house. A man is as secure in his house as a prince in his castle.” Though the courts ultimately upheld the writs, James Otis ignited a legal movement that asserted certain rights of men could not be violated. \n\nThe royal British government constructed the Old State House in 1713 to serve as the Massachusetts colonial seat of government. Three chambers on the second floor housed the three branches of the colonial government: The royal governor and his council, the Superior Court, and the Massachusetts legislature. It was on that second floor where the political arguments of the coming Revolution raged. Boston’s radical wing, led by men like Samuel Adams, Thomas Cushing, and James Otis, dominated control of the legislature. Meanwhile, those friendly to the British government controlled the crown-appointed positions in the executive office of the governor and in the courts. The intrigue and rhetoric of the Massachusetts legislature played a significant role in unifying other colonial governments in resisting certain acts of Parliament, but it also encouraged acts of political violence and even bloodshed in the streets outside. Letters and petitions passed by the legislature further refined and espoused James Otis’ notion of the rights of Englishmen. After repeated attempts by royal officials to reign in the legislature by closing it or even moving it to less radical towns, the colonial legislature ultimately dissolved in 1774, and war began the following year. After a year of being under siege, the last officials of British government fled Boston.  \n\nOn July 18, 1776, a huge crowd stood below the balcony of the Old State House, the same site as the Boston Massacre, which had happened six years before. But instead of gunfire in anger, sounds of celebration filled the air as Bostonians heard the newly written Declaration of Independence for the first time. At last they heard the ideas of James Otis, not as rights of Englishmen, but, “that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” \n\nHowever among the throngs of people hearing this claim that the nation’s fight for independence would be built on the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, were people like Lancaster Hill. Hill spent half of his lifetime under enslavement, and he still had a family who were enslaved. Six months later, he and other men of color submitted a petition to the revolutionary Massachusetts government, now meeting at the Old State House, demanding that they make good on the claims of the declaration: \"The petition of a great number of blacks detained in a state of slavery in the bowels of a free and Christian country humbly shows that your petitioners apprehend that they have in common with all other men a natural and unalienable right to that freedom which the Great Parent of the Universe has bestowed equally on all mankind...\"  \n\nThe petition inspired a draft bill to end slavery in Massachusetts, but it never passed into law. Instead, later court cases in the 1780s ruled slavery unconstitutional under the Massachusetts State Constitution. \n\nThe building served many different purposes long after the Massachusetts state government moved to the current State House on Beacon Hill, including a period as Boston’s City Hall in the 1830s.  \n\nRevolutionary Spaces, formerly the Bostonian Society, stewards the building.

After two years of occupation by the British Army, tensions in Boston reached an all time high in 1770. While some Bostonians welcomed the soldiers, others saw them as invaders. As the winter dragged on, protests and street fights began to break out in different parts of Boston. A clash on March 5 had deadly consequences. That evening, a wigmaker’s apprentice named Edward Gerrish got into a fight with Private Hugh White of the 29th Regiment over a dispute of a barber bill. Losing his temper, Private White assaulted the teenaged Gerrish with his musket. Gerrish cried out for help and the townspeople soon arrived on the scene. Around nine o’clock that night, church bells began to ring out into the darkness. Usually an indication that a fire was consuming part of the town, Bostonians started to pour out of their homes carrying their fire buckets to assist in the fight. Others, though, came to the intersection of King and Queen Streets armed with weapons: snowballs, oyster shells, bricks, and sticks and converged upon Private White. Though estimates varied, the crowd ranged from 30 to 90 angry men. Captain Thomas Preston, the officer on duty that night, led seven soldiers across the intersection to reinforce Private White. They formed in front of the Customs House with their muskets loaded, bayonets affixed. Confusion and fear ruled the scene as the sounds of taunts, screams, and church bells combined, making communication almost impossible. Suddenly, one of the soldiers was struck with an object and fell to the ground. As he stood up, he lowered his musket towards the crowd and fired. Though no order was given, several other soldiers opened fire. Captain Preston ordered the men to cease firing, but as the balls flew through the street, men fell dead and wounded. The first bloodshed of the American Revolution in Boston fell onto the ice and snow in front of the Old State House. As the smoke cleared, three individuals lay dead in the street: a sailor James Caldwell, a ropemaker Samuel Gray, and a sailor named Crispus Attucks. Attucks, who was a self-emancipated man of African and Indigenous descent, is often referred to the first victim of the American Revolution. Two more men later died from their wounds: Samuel Maverick, an ivory carving apprentice, and Patrick Carr, an Irish born breeches maker. In the days following the Massacre the town was in mourning and also in panic. Mass meetings met at Faneuil Hall, and then the Old South Meeting House, demanding justice for the innocent lives lost at the hands of British soldiers. Crispus Attucks, a stranger in town, was lain in state at Faneuil Hall, and then his body joined the other victims in an immense parade that marched throughout Boston. Some estimates claim as many as ten thousand people joined or witnessed the event. The victims of the Massacre were ultimately buried in the Granary Burying Ground, where their graves are still marked to this day. The patriots did not forget or forgive what happened on King Street on March 5 for years to come, holding commemorations on the anniversary of this massacre. The Boston Massacre is now noted as one of the sparks of the American War for Independence, with Crispus Attucks as its first martyr. While Boston played a significant role in the American Revolution, this city also served as a hub in subsequent revolutions, particularly in the fight against slavery. In fact, the site of the Boston Massacre once again witnessed a flash-point. In 1854, freedom seeker Anthony Burns was captured and sentenced to be returned to slavery. After abolitionists failed to rescue him from his Boston Courthouse jail cell, Anthony Burns was marched down State Street in shackles, under a guard of federal marshals, marines, local police, and deputy agents. 50,000 Bostonians watched in protest, and abolitionists recognized the tragic irony of a Black man in chains being forced back into slavery over the same spot Crispus Attucks fell in the fight for Liberty. As they passed over the site of the Boston Massacre, Burns and the armed procession walked under a black coffin with the word “Liberty” written on it. This event became a turning point for many Bostonians in the fight over slavery. As philanthropist Amos Lawrence wrote in a letter to his uncle, “We went to bed one night old-fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs and waked up stark mad Abolitionists.” In an effort to remember the event and the lives lost, the Boston Massacre was commemorated in stone in 1886. You can still see this marker, about 10 feet wide, in front of the Old State House in front of the intersection of Devonshire, State, and Congress Streets.",

The Woman Suffrage movement has been often spoken of as a new movement. It is, but it is based on old principles—the principles that were fought for and maintained on the field of battle nearly a hundred years ago. It is simply a carrying out of the principles further than our fathers carried them a hundred years ago.\"  \n\nIn December 1873, suffragist Mary Livermore, along with other men and women suffragists, recognized the one hundredth anniversary of the Boston Tea Party by hosting their own event inside Faneuil Hall’s Great Hall-the  very same place where the first Tea Party meetings began in 1773. During this New England Women’s Tea Party, speakers referenced the rights and liberties that early colonists fought for and declared. Yet, though the war for independence had been won, the struggle for representation, equal rights, and liberty continued for every generation. \n\nConstruction of this original building completed in 1742, and it served as a town meeting hall and marketplace.

Though most known for its Revolutionary-era protests, Faneuil Hall has served as a gathering space for successive generations to discuss and debate the meaning and legacy of American liberty. Abolitionists called meetings in response to arrests of fugitive slaves in the city, sometimes facing the attacks of anti-abolitionists who also held meetings here. Women's suffragists and anti-suffragists each held rallies throughout the decades-long struggle for the 19th Amendment. Labor activists hosted union meetings here where they rallied for better wages and working conditions. Anti-communists helped perpetuate the Red Scare in Boston and called for the defense of American liberty against Communism. And in the 1970s through the 1990s, Boston's LGBTQ+ community took inspiration from the old Boston town meetings, holding their own open forums in Faneuil Hall to voice their concerns and fight for their right to exist in the world as their truest selves.  \n\nToday, Bostonians continue to use Faneuil Hall for political, social, and cultural events. The Hall has also been host for naturalization ceremonies since the 1980s, welcoming new citizens at the “Cradle of Liberty.”  \n\nIn 2008, journalist Yvonne Abraham wrote of her experience becoming a citizen in Faneuil Hall: “We are sitting together on hard wooden benches in Faneuil Hall, waiting for the judge…We have waited years, even decades, for this day. ... We are doctors, clerks, students, factory workers. We live in Hyde Park, Randolph, Lowell, Chicopee. We are from Angola, Poland, El Salvador, South Korea. There are 417 of us in all, from 75 countries...US District Judge William Young stands beneath the giant painting of Daniel Webster defending the Union, and tells us we are special. ‘It’s my privilege to welcome you to citizenship...You, make no mistake, are what makes this country great. ... This is a short ceremony, but you have walked long roads to get here. I want to thank you...on behalf of all citizens.’  \nAsk us how we feel on this day and many of us will say we are the ones who are grateful, for the immense opportunities this country has given us, for the rights and responsibilities that will be ours. But here is a federal judge in his black robes thanking us. We entered Faneuil Hall proud to become US citizens at last. Young makes us proud to be immigrants, too.”  \n\nThe ground floor of Faneuil Hall serves as a marketplace and a visitor center for the National Parks of Boston.

Paul Revere became the symbol of Longfellow’s romantic vision of the Revolution: a time of unity and patriotism that Americans must remember. Within a decade of the poem’s publication in 1861, Longfellow made Paul Revere an American folk hero, but it took decades before the Boston community preserved his home in the North End.  \n\nBuilt around 1680, the Paul Revere House replaced the parsonage of the Second Church of Boston, which had been destroyed in the Great Fire of 1676. The first owner of the house, Robert Howard, was a wealthy merchant and slaveowner. With its leaded casement windows and second-story overhang, it is the only remaining seventeenth-century house in Boston. Paul Revere owned the home from 1770 to 1800, renting it out during the 1780s. \n\nWhen Revere bought the property, it became home to a master silversmith, “a man of middling rank,” as he later described himself. By then, the front roof line had been raised to create more attic space, likely providing more sleeping space for his children. Revere’s first wife, Sarah, had eight children, dying five months after the birth of her eighth. His second wife, Rachel, also had eight children. Generally, between five to nine children lived here at any one time. \n\nBy the time Paul Revere bought his North Square home, he had completed military service during the Seven Year’s War, started a family, and established a thriving silversmith business. When Parliament began taxing the American colonies in the 1760s, Revere’s income, like many of his artisan and mariner neighbors, began to drop. Revere joined “the cause of liberty,” first as an engraver of political cartoons, then as a member of political organizations, and finally as a courier and spy.  \n\nAs a member of an intelligence network of thirty “mechanics,” Revere spent months spying on British soldiers and Tories. When news came that the British Army planned an expedition into the countryside to either arrest Revolutionary leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams in Lexington or seize munitions in nearby Concord, Revere and a network of individuals effectively spread a timely warning to supporters in the area. Although he had completed several other rides throughout April, Revere himself did not complete the “Midnight Ride,” getting captured by British soldiers just outside Lexington. \n\nShortly after Revere sold the house, it became a sailors’ boarding house. By the 1840s, the North End became home to Irish immigrants escaping the Potato Famine. By the late nineteenth century, Eastern European Jews and Southern Italians in search of religious freedom and economic opportunity settled in the neighborhood. Paul Revere’s house became a tenement with such businesses as a candy store, cigar factory, and vegetable and fruit store with apartments upstairs.  \n\nIn 1902, Paul Revere’s great-grandson, John Phillips Reynolds, Jr., purchased the house to prevent it from being demolished. In 1905, the Paul Revere Memorial Association began restoring the house, which opened to the public in April 1908. The Paul Revere House remains open to the public today, giving visitors a glimpse of the long-lost seventeenth century Boston and sharing what it was like for Paul Revere and his family to live through the American Revolution.",

I left Dr. Warrens, called upon a friend, and desired him to make the Signals. I then went Home, took my Boots and Surtout, and went to the \tNorth part of ...Town...\" -Paul Revere 1798, from a letter to Jeremy Belknap describing the events of April 18, 1775. \n\nBuilt in 1723, The Old North Church, known officially as Christ Church, is the oldest standing church building in Boston today. By the 1720s, the original wooden King’s Chapel had become too small, which necessitated the construction of a new, larger, Anglican Church. The new church would be built in the North End, which by this time housed many of the wealthy merchants who made up the Anglican congregation. Built in the style of London architect Christopher Wren, Old North stands as one of the earliest examples of Georgian architecture in North America, and originally it would have been lusciously painted and each individual box pew would have been ostentatiously decorated to the liking of its private owners.  \n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, Christ Church found itself politically split over the issue of loyalty to the Crown. Many in the congregation had been affected financially by Parliament’s policies on taxation and importation, and the forced closure of the port of Boston in 1774 financially damaged those in the congregation whose business relied on shipping. Political and financial disputes so plagued the church that on April 18, 1775, the church's minister and vocal loyalist Rev. Mather Byles Jr. resigned.  \n\nThat very evening, William Dawes and Paul Revere rode out to warn the Massachusetts countryside that a detachment of the British Army had left Boston by crossing the Charles River and headed west to the towns of Lexington and Concord. Fearing that neither he nor Dawes would be able to safely leave Boston and spread the message, Revere supplemented their rides with a signal from the tallest building in town, the steeple of the Old North Church, to Charlestown to indicate whether the army crossed the Charles River or took the longer land route down Boston Neck. Revere tasked a friend with this job, likely church member John Pulling Jr, who probably enlisted the church’s caretaker Robert Newman to assist. The two carefully climbed to the top of the church's steeple and briefly held out two lanterns toward Charlestown before quickly making their escape. By the time Revere arrived in Charlestown an hour or so later the signal had been seen and preparations were already being made. The story of these signal lanterns would be immortalized in Longfellow’s 1861 poem Paul Revere’s Ride, famously coining the phrase “One if by land, and two if by sea.” This alert gave the militias around Boston time to prepare for the army’s advance, and the skirmishes across Lexington and Concord the following day are considered the opening battles of the American Revolution.  \n\nThe Old North Church has remained a fixture in the North End community of Boston, witnessing the changing of the neighborhood over the following centuries.

A true son of liberty a friend to the public an enemy to oppression and one of the foremost in opposing the Revenue Acts on America.\" -Inscription on the headstone of Daniel Malcolm, Copp’s Hill Burying Ground. \n\nAfter Boston’s first burying ground, now known as the King’s Chapel Burying Ground, began to fill in the late 1650s, the town set up a second burying ground in the North End on a hill that partially belonged to shoemaker William Copp. Established in 1660, Copp’s Hill Burying Ground became the resting place of thousands of people who lived, worked, and died in the North End. Among those interred on the hill are merchant John Pulling Jr. and Old North Church sexton, or caretaker, Robert Newman, the two men believed to have held the signal lanterns on the night of April 18, 1775 to warn of the British advance on Lexington and Concord. Also buried here are Increase, Samuel, and Cotton Mather, all three influential and infamous theologians of Boston.  \n\nCopp’s Hill also is the final resting place for many early Bostonians of African descent. Many enslaved and free African Americans are buried on this hill, including Black educator, community leader, and Masonic Grand Master Prince Hall. Existing White lodges, such as Joseph Warren's St. Andrew's lodge, refused to allow Prince Hall and other men of color to become members. In response, Hall and several other men of color established their own Masonic lodge after being initiated into freemasonry by occupying British soldiers in 1775. In Boston, Prince Hall and his fellow masons led their community as activists for the abolition of enslavement and for the recognition of their rights as equal citizens in Massachusetts. Later Grand Masters of the Prince Hall Masons became significant leaders in the Black community of Boston’s Beacon Hill, including George Middleton and Lewis Hayden, whose homes are on the Black Heritage Trail. The African Lodge that Prince Hall organized and led laid the foundation of a fraternal organization of Black men that grew with the United States, and it still thrives today. Hall’s modern brothers erected the monument that currently stands next to his original, modest headstone. \n\nThough blocked by the nineteenth century houses that now fill the North End, Copp’s Hill still offers a beautiful view of the Charles River and Charlestown.

I cannot compose myself to write any further at present.\" \n\nAbigail Adams wrote these words to her husband John Adams as she heard the cannon fire in Braintree, 10 miles south of the battlefield here in Charlestown. Though there was so much uncertainty about the outcome of the battle, one fact was clear to all observers: War had come to the Colonies. \n\nOn the evening of June 16, 1775, colonial militia units marched here to Charlestown and fortified what’s known today as Breed’s Hill. By morning, British cannon in Boston and in the harbor opened fire as British forces assembled to land and attack the hill. As the British forces began their assault, units from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire hastily formed a line of defense. Among those on the battlefield were also over one hundred patriots of color, indigenous men and men of African descent.  \n\nNeither the colonial forces nor the British forces were ready for the chaos and carnage that awaited them. As the British forces climbed Breed’s Hill toward the fortification, colonial forces shot down upon them. While the militias initially held them back, British units continued to march forward as British cannon fired upon the surrounding land, setting nearby buildings on fire. British soldiers continued to put pressure on New England regiments, forcing them to retreat. This bloody battle lasted no longer than two hours but was devastating to both sides.  \n\n300 to 500 men of the New England militia were killed, wounded, or captured during the chaos. One of the most prominent losses was patriot leader Doctor Joseph Warren. The toll of the British Army and Marines was much greater - over 1,000 British soldiers were killed or wounded, including Major John Pitcairn. While ultimately a loss for the New England forces, the Battle of Bunker Hill became symbolic of the tenacity and spirit of those fighting for ideas of liberty.  \n\nEstablished in 2008 by the National Park Service, the Bunker Hill Museum shares the full story of the Battle of Bunker Hill through its exhibit spaces and dioramas.

This structure, having its foundations in soil which drank deep of early revolutionary blood, has at length reached its destined height, and now lifts its summit to the skies...We have assembled to celebrate the accomplishment of this undertaking, and to indulge, afresh, in the recollection of the great event which it is designed to commemorate.\"\n\nWith these words, Daniel Webster commemorated the opening of the Bunker Hill Monument in 1843. \n\nDaniel Webster was a well-known political figure, and he served as a member of the Bunker Hill Monument Association, a private group that oversaw the construction of the monument and lodge, one of the earliest monuments dedicated to a Revolutionary War battle. \n\nThe Monument Association had two goals: they wanted to memorialize the location of the battle and they wanted to make the battle a unifying, shared story for Americans. As Americans faced national divisive issues, Webster and others wanted the monument to represent Americans’ common purpose. \n\nThe monument resembles an Egyptian obelisk. It’s made of granite blocks, some over 8 tons each, and it has a 294-step granite staircase to the top. The monument is an engineering marvel; it stood as the tallest structure in the United States until the completion of the Washington Monument in 1884. \n\nThe Monument Association underestimated the cost of building the Bunker Hill Monument, resulting in the project taking 15 years to complete due to funding shortfalls. To prevent the project from stalling, writer-editor Sarah Josepha Hale and a group of Boston-area women held a successful Ladies Fair that raised part of the funds to complete the monument at 221 feet. \n\nThe people of Charlestown have embraced the Battle of Bunker Hill and later the Monument with celebrations and parades every June 17. Bunker Hill Day became a city-sponsored event with patriotic speeches and songs on the grounds of the Monument when Charlestown became part of Boston in 1874. \n\nCitizens of Charlestown and Boston alike have referenced the Monument and what it represents to them in the decades that followed its completion. Suffragist Lucy Stone once remarked, “We are still battling for the principle it stands for. My spirit kindles whenever I see that monument. It is our monument.” Activists and artists have activated the Monument through the 20th and 21st centuries. \n\nAdjacent to the monument is the Bunker Hill Lodge, built in 1903; this Greek Revival granite building replaced an earlier wooden structure built to house the Doctor Joseph Warren statue. The Lodge also held artifacts and dioramic scenes from the battle.

Here visitors can explore exhibits and dioramas that share the stories of the Battle of Bunker Hill, the construction of the Monument, and the history of the Charlestown Neighborhood. \n\nJust blocks away from the monument at Winthrop Square are four bronze tablets listing the Provincial militia that died in the Battle of Bunker Hill, installed by the City of Boston in 1889. These names remind us of the diversity of the Provincials who fought, not just at Bunker Hill, but throughout the Revolutionary War, as many Native Americans and freed and enslaved African Americans were among those who fought.",

Over half of these ships were constructed during World War II, the most productive years of the Charlestown Navy Yard.

Long before the United States established the Charlestown Navy Yard, the tidal flats of this area provided seasonal sustenance to local indigenous communities for thousands of years. These communities, whose descendants are the Massachusett, called the land Mishawum or “Great Springs.” \n\nWhen colonists took over this land, it became one of the first colonial ports in North America. Years later, during the Revolutionary War in 1775, these tidal flats acted as a landing area in the Battle of Bunker Hill. \n\nEstablished in 1800 by the United States Navy, the Charlestown Navy Yard served as an active naval shipyard for 174 years. Buildings at the Yard, such as Dry Dock 1, the Ropewalk, and the Chain Forge, proved to be revolutionary, either because of their uniqueness or the technological advancements made within their walls. Due to these innovations, workers at the Charlestown Navy Yard built over 200 ships and repaired thousands more.  \n\nThe most productive years of the Charlestown Navy Yard was during World War II. To meet the needs of the United States Navy, the Navy Yard increased its workforce from 17,000 civilian workers to a peak of over 50,000 workers working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  \n\nFor generations the workforce had almost entirely been White men, but during this time of crisis the Navy Yard opened its doors to women and people of color. For the first time, this created the opportunity to make livable wages for thousands of people. While these workers provided critical labor and many excelled in their positions, some experienced racism, sexual harassment, and discrimination.  \n\nThis industrial workplace had harsh conditions that pushed the limits of endurance and even the health of workers. Virginia Wilder Parker, a welder at the Charlestown Navy Yard, recalled working in both the cold and the heat: \"When I first came to the yard they said women would never work below decks...uh-huh, we did...lot of it was rough like I just mentioned about the ... dry dock! ... we used to go down there … icy days, everything, it was quite dangerous. And uh, sitting on cold steel, wasn’t the best either but we all had pads that we made ... we printed our name on it and sometimes uh, it would be so hot that you couldn’t put your hand down on the steel, you’d get burned...\" \n\nAt the end of World War II, production and employment decreased as the armed forces returned home. During the Cold War, the Yard continued to be a valuable site of innovation and modernization, specializing in refitting destroyers like the USS CASSIN YOUNG.   \n\nAfter 174 years of constant operation, the Yard closed in 1973. One year later, Boston National Historical Park was established, with the Charlestown Navy Yard as a unit of the park.  \n\nTo learn more about the history of the Yard and its workers, visit the Charlestown Navy Yard Visitor Center or check out digital experiences on the Boston National Historical Park’s website and the National Park Service App.",

The USS CONSTITUTION was constructed along with five other warships that comprised the new Navy for the United States after the Revolutionary War. Launched in 1797, the USS CONSTITUTION is the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world today and was constructed right here in Boston.  \n\nThe USS CONSTITUTION spent the first few years in the Quasi-War with France and later fighting off pirates on the Barbary Coast. It was during the War of 1812 that the ship gained fame and prowess. The USS CONSTITUTION gained its name “Old Ironsides” after its first big battle of the war, against the British ship HMS GUERRIERE. During the encounter, sailors observed how well the hardwood sides of the ship repelled the cannonballs. Not only were the sides strong, with 55 guns on board it was a mighty force to face  upon the open seas. “Old Ironsides” went on to defeat four other British warships during the war and evaded capture. During this time, 450 to 500 sailors served onboard to keep the ship under way. \n\nAfter the War of 1812 the UUSS CONSTITUTION, served in a number of squadrons in different locations around the world. From 1844 to 1846 the ship sailed around the world on a world cruise. During its service as the flagship of the African Squadron, while on patrol for slave traders headed to America off the coast of West Africa, the USS Constitution seized its last ship, the H.N. GAMBRILL, in November of 1853. When stopped and examined, this American schooner was prepared to take on enslaved Africans as cargo.  \n\nOver the following years, the USS CONSTITUTION became a training vessel.

Today, over 350,000 people visit the Museum each year to learn, explore, and research, making it one of Boston’s most visited museums.",

The ship was active in the Pacific Theater during WWII, serving in seven separate campaigns. It had a crew of 325 men. Commissioned in December 31, 1943, the ship engaged in combat in April 1944. Following the April 1, 1945 assault on Okinawa, CASSIN YOUNG took up the duties of radar picket ship, where it was struck by kamikazes twice. It was decommissioned in May 1946 but was recalled at the outbreak of the Korean Conflict in September 1951. The ship was decommissioned again on April 29, 1960 and moved to a reserve fleet in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia. It has been a part of the Boston National Historical Park since June 1981, opening to the public as a museum ship at the Charlestown Navy Yard.",

                    "audioTranscript": "\"One thing I liked about being on a destroyer was, they were small. Oh, I don't think I would have liked the Navy as much if I had been on a bigger ship, you know. It might have been an easier life, but ... [y]ou'd look at these other, bigger ships just waddling along you know, and you'd—We'd knife down through them—boy that was a good feeling. And then about the time you were, you know, in a heavy sea why you [chuckles] ... they [destroyers] weren't that great, but, you felt like you were really living…you’d turn into the wind and get a little bit of spray in your face and, you’d taste the salt…then you’d feel those propellers turning…and you could feel the power in that thing, you know. Felt good.\" \n\nBuilt in 1943 in San Pedro, California, the USS CASSIN YOUNG is one of the 175 Fletcher-class destroyers built during World War II. Here in Charlestown, the Navy Yard built dozens of similar ships during the war. In the 1950s, the USS CASSIN YOUNG and many other destroyers received regular repairs and modernization in Charlestown. CASSIN YOUNG is therefore a testament to not only the sailors who served aboard the ship, but also to the workers in Navy Yards across the country who served and sacrificed for their country. \n\nThe ship’s namesake was Captain Cassin Young, a U.S. Navy service member who earned a Medal of Honor for heroics at Pearl Harbor. He was later killed in action at the Naval Battle at Guadalcanal, where he served as a captain of a heavy cruiser.  \n\nDuring World War II, the USS CASSIN YOUNG served in seven campaigns in the Pacific Theater. Destroyers such as the USS CASSIN YOUNG were true to their name, ready to fight off attacks from the air, the surface, and under the surface with a substantial weapons system and handling a variety of duties. The ship had a crew of 325 men during World War II. \n\nFollowing the ship’s commissioning on December 31, 1943, the USS CASSIN YOUNG initially engaged in combat in April 1944, attacking Japanese strongholds in the Caroline Islands. Throughout 1944, it escorted U.S. forces throughout the Pacific, experiencing kamikaze aircraft for the first time towards the end of the year.  \n\nAfter the April 1, 1945 assault on Okinawa, in which the USS CASSIN YOUNG escorted assault craft to the beaches in addition to providing shore bombardment, the ship took up the role of serving in a radar picket station. This hazardous responsibility provided early warning of impending air attacks to the main fleet. The USS CASSIN YOUNG’s time on radar picket stations included two instances of being struck by kamikazes, once on April 12 and again on July 30. Although six kamikazes were shot down on April 12 during a massive attack, one hit the mast and exploded fifty feet above the ship. One sailor, Torpedoman 3rd Class Robert Moore, was killed and 59 were wounded. After repairs, the USS CASSIN YOUNG returned to Okinawa in July. Again the ship came under assault on July 30, approximately two weeks before the end of World War II. Shortly after 3 AM, a single kamikaze crashed into the starboard side of the main deck near the forward smoke stack, causing a large fire. The crew contained the damage, restored power in one engine and got the ship underway within the hour. The casualties from this attack numbered 22 men dead and 45 wounded. For determined service and gallantry on the Okinawa radar picket line, the USS CASSIN YOUNG was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. \n\nRepaired upon returning to California, the USS CASSIN YOUNG was decommissioned for the first time in May of 1946 before being recalled to service at the outbreak of the Korean Conflict. Recommissioned in September of 1951 with initial tours in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, the ship was retrofitted in the Charlestown Navy Yard, and subsequently served as a patroller of the seas outside of Korea and in the Mediterranean during the 1950s with a crew complement of 250 men. Among the highlights of these later years included the ship’s receipt of the ‘E’ for Battle Efficiency in 1959. On April 29, 1960, the USS CASSIN YOUNG was again decommissioned and put into mothballs (part of a reserve fleet) in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia. \n\nThe USS CASSIN YOUNG has been a part of the Boston National Historical Park since 1981 when it opened to the public as a museum ship in the Charlestown Navy Yard. The ship is in the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark since 1986.",

All aspects of daily life would be subject to transformation—food, language, clothing, agriculture, and religion. In the mission model you can see adobe buildings for residences and workshops, agricultural lands, cattle, and the main irrigation ditch. A mission community could be considered a residential training academy where indigenous people learned and adopted a new way of life. The plan was for the missionary priest to move on after ten years, when the community could sustain itself. In fact, more than 100 years would pass before the turn of the 19th century, when the first bricks would be laid for the mission church you see today.\n\nTumacácori went from being an O’odham village to a frontier visita (satellite mission) to a cabecera (headquarters mission) in a matter of decades. Its people changed as well. The O’odham became known as the “Pima” and the “Papago,” and their lands the Pimería Alta (land of the upper Pima). They were baptized with Spanish names, given Spanish-style clothing, and assigned Spanish jobs. They tended to domestic livestock rather than hunting wild game, and irrigated fruit trees that came from oceans away.\n\nToday, the O’odham people still carry with them the legacy of colonization. Because they did not record their stories in a written language, exploring their history requires empathy, inference, and respect for O’odham oral tradition. The descendants of mission-era communities are still living all around us.",

People walked from here to attend church services, engage in work in the convento, or to go into the fields, gardens, and orchards between the plaza and the river.\n\nThe long, low mound to the left of the sidewalk protects what remains of adobe residences connected in a line running north to south. The ramada to the right resembles a mission family’s outdoor cooking and living area. Take a moment to imagine the mission community as it once was—the sounds of animals, children running and playing in the plaza, oxen and carts coming and going. Here is a village at work.\n\nMany different languages could be heard in the plaza. Some priests came from Spain, but others from Austria, Switzerland, Italy, or Bavaria. The O’odham had many dialects. The Yoeme, now referred to as the Yaqui, spoke a totally separate language. The Nde, now called the Apache, shared linguistic roots with the Navajo.\n\nThe proximity of neighbors in the mission core differs from traditional O’odham villages. There, family households might be generally clustered together, but did not share walls, enclosed spaces, or other facilities. The density of the closely packed mission community likely contributed to the spread of European diseases such as measles, smallpox, and typhus.",

Before the arrival of adobe construction from Spain, the O’odham built rounded homes using mud applied over a wood and brush framework. When rain washed away some of the mud, a new coating was always close at hand. Over time, the O’odham adopted the square rooms favored by the Spanish.\n\nThe home would also include a wa:ato (“WAH-ah-toe”), or mesquite ramada, and a brush enclosure for cooking. While the inside of the ki provided shelter on cold nights, many activities in the home took place under or around the wa:ato.\n\nAlthough many mission residents lived in the Spanish-style adobe rooms around the plaza in front of the church, some may have continued to live in traditional homes.\n\nThe O’odham still build and use structures like this, made of mesquite timbers, ocotillo sticks, saguaro ribs, and mud. This one was built in 1997 by O’odham from the San Xavier community using traditional hand tools. When completed, it was dedicated by them to San Francisco Xavier, Father Kino’s patron saint.",

As the monsoon season approached, families would move to locations where shallow irrigation channels delivered rainwater to their fields.\n\nThe O’odham living along streams channeled river water directly into rich fields of corn, beans, squash, agave, and melons.\n\nWith the Spanish came European ideas of irrigation. The fired adobe structure before you is part of the acequia madre, the main irrigation channel that brought water to the mission from the Santa Cruz River a mile or more to the south. The narrowed end could be closed, raising the elevation of the water to serve various functions. As a compuerta, or diversion box, it turned water from the ditch into the orchard to the east. As a holding tank, it was convenient for filling ollas, earthen jars, to carry water back to the houses for drinking and cooking. Because it had a polished, red surface, it was probably also used as a lavandería, or place for washing clothes and dishes, and possibly even bathing.",

The saguaro harvest was celebrated with dancing, singing, and storytelling, and the making and drinking of saguaro wine, essential for the calling of the clouds that would bring the summer rains.\n\nThe establishment of a mission brought new fruits, imported from Europe and considered essential to a “civilized” life by the priests and settlers. As farmers, the O’odham welcomed these new crops. Wheat, grown over the winter, provided a harvest during an otherwise lean season. Horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and chickens provided transportation, labor, fiber, and convenient sources of protein.\n\nThe mission complex included a walled garden and orchard, the contents protected from deer and cattle. Native trees, including hackberries, now grow along the foundations of those adobe walls. Within the original 4.6 acre enclosure the community grew vegetables and fruit trees. Favorite trees brought from Europe included peach, pomegranate, quince, and fig. As recently as 1938, peach trees lined the mission acequia, stabilizing its banks and making use of moisture which seeped through its mud walls.\n\nThe fruit trees that you see here today were grown from seeds and cuttings of old cultivar fruit trees—the oldest trees that could be found in historic orchards and yards throughout southern Arizona. The replanted orchard was dedicated in 2007.",

It provided the O’odham, and later the Spanish, with wood, medicine, and food.\n\nMesquite flowers provide important pollen and nectar for wildlife. The flowers are crowded into long spikes called catkins. When fertilized, the flowers form long green fruits that resemble string beans. They grow and mature through the summer, turning tan or streaked with red.\n\nThe beans can be eaten at all stages of their growth. The O’odham ate them as a vegetable when green, and ground the pods into a sweet, nutty flour when ripe. They are favored by many animals, including hares, pocket mice, kangaroo rats, pack rats, and javelinas.\n\nAlthough honey mesquite can be found in the region, the velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) dominates the landscape of Tumacácori.

The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail was designated to commemorate this massive and important movement of settlers across the land.\n\nToday the Anza Trail preserves this important history while also providing valuable outdoor recreational space.

The river creates essential habitat and a wildlife corridor for threatened and endangered species.\n\nWhere underlying bedrock slopes up, the water is forced to the surface. The O’odham situated their villages in these locations, known as “gaining reaches,” to take advantage of the reliable water source. Later settlers followed suit.\n\nThe river provided not only water for drinking and irrigation, but habitat for the complex web of life that supported human settlement. It contributed to every basket, meal, article of clothing, medicine, and cultural practice. Literally every item a person touched over the course of a lifetime connected back to the Santa Cruz River corridor.\n\nToday, the cottonwood-willow environment along the Santa Cruz is one of the most rare and endangered habitats in the United States. The river’s plant and animal communities and water quality are threatened by climate change and modern land use. The stretch of river that flows through Tumacácori is now composed almost entirely of treated effluent, released from the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Facility in Rio Rico, Arizona.

This efficient style of earthen technology goes back thousands of years, but requires constant maintenance. Moisture, either from the ground or from precipitation, will erode sun-dried adobe bricks, rendering the structure unstable.\n\nThe Spanish favored limestone plaster as a protective coating on their adobe buildings. Many tons of limestone rocks were gathered and carted to the mission’s lime kilns. A fire was built under a metal grill and high temperatures “cooked” the limestone over several days until it could be hammered into a fine powder. That powder was then made into a paste using water and sand, which was later troweled onto on the exposed adobe brick walls.\n\nGathering stone, mixing plaster, and coating the large structures required the labor of many workers. For the O’odham, the kiln probably represented a significant change in their lifestyle. Previously, they lived with a changing landscape, in buildings that changed with it. The European worldview prioritized permanence and defiance of natural weathering. This shift would shape the way that people across the region live and think for centuries to come.",

The convento was the operational part of the mission. It functioned as a shared, community workspace and governmental center. It would have been alive with the sounds of people talking, working, and moving about. \n\nThe rooms aligned in a U-shape around a central courtyard. Along the north wing, where a long raised mound is still visible today, archeological evidence suggests a kitchen, ironworker’s shop, carpentry shop, weaving room, leather shop, and grain grinding mill. The storeroom is all that remains of the west row of the convento. The south wing included the priest’s quarters, other office spaces, and an arched entrance to the interior courtyard. The central courtyard was likely planted with trees, ornamental flowers, and medicinal and edible plants. An arcade—a covered walkway lined with arches and built-in benches—ran in front of the rooms. It would have been a shady, inviting, and pleasant place to meet and greet one’s neighbors. The arcade and courtyard garden of the visitor center were built to replicate this experience.\n \nFor its O’odham residents, the mission’s convento may have been a place where tradition and change clashed. A host of new tools, technologies, and food sources had become available. Instead of yucca or cotton fibers, a weaver could use wool. Instead of bone or stone, one could craft tools from metal. But adopting these changes came at a social and cultural cost.",

At that time, the village was located on the other side of the Santa Cruz River. Although he chose Guevavi to be the cabecera (headquarters) where the priest would live, he and other priests continued to visit Tumacácori, sing the Mass, and tend to mission business. There is no record of an adobe church having been built while the village was on the east side of the river.\n\nIn November of 1751, a group of O’odham led by Captain General Luis Oacpicagigua (“Ahk-pee- ah-CUK-ya”) rebelled against the Spanish and Yoeme who had moved into their land. The resulting conflict caused the abandonment of mission communities for over a year.\n\nThe Spanish began construction of a presidio, a military outpost, at Tubac. When everyone returned, the village of Tumacácori was moved to the present location nearer to and on the same side of the river as the new presidio.\n\nThe outline that you see before you marks the footprint of the community’s first church, begun in the spring of 1753. The date of its completion is uncertain, but it is known to have been in use by the summer of 1757.\n \nThis small church remained under the management of Jesuit priests until they were expelled in 1767. A year later the Franciscans arrived to carry on the mission project in the Pimería Alta. They continued to use this building until the new church was ready for use in 1822.",

The O’odham would sometimes burn items that had belonged to a person who died, and would ask the dead to remain at peace, not come back to disturb the living. A blend of traditional and Catholic beliefs and ceremonies continues among the O’odham today.\n\nThe fourteen niches in the walls surrounding the cemetery would have held paintings or sculptures of the Catholic “Stations of the Cross.” In the center lies the round mortuary chapel. The plan may have been to cover the round building with a dome. A family might spend time with their deceased loved one in this room before burial.\n\nAlthough burial records exist for Tumacácori from 1755 to 1825, the first burial in this cemetery took place in 1822. The previous cemetery was next to the Jesuit-era church.Many of the dead were victims of the terrible epidemics of smallpox, measles, and typhus that swept through the missions. A few were killed during Apache raids. The majority of Tumacácori’s burials were of children under the age of five.\n\nWhile records describe nearly 600 burials at Tumacácori, any evidence of mission-era graves was destroyed long ago by weather, cattle, and vandals. Families who moved into the area after the O’odham residents left continued to use this cemetery to bury their dead. Little Juanita Alegria, who died of influenza at the age of nine months in 1916, was the last person buried at Tumacácori.",

Personal details, especially from the perspective of women, O’odham, Yoeme, and Nde community members, are difficult to extract.\n\nAfter the mission residents left Tumacácori for the last time in 1848, the church became a refuge and the sacristy its primary lodging. The protection of its thick walls offered welcome shelter for gold-seekers on their way to California, and for Mexican and U.S. soldiers and cowboys. These tired travelers recorded their stays not in mission record books, but on the walls. The darkened ceiling and many names are proof of the numerous fires made, dinners cooked, and stories told in this space.",

Scriptures were read from the pulpit, reconstructed on the east wall beside the sanctuary. The service was conducted in a combination of Latin, Spanish, and O’odham.\n \nStanding under the high dome, you might imagine the brightly painted decorations on the walls and ceilings, flickering candles, the congregants kneeling in the nave, the sound of chants, prayers, and song reverberating through the room. The combination of these things was meant to create a mental distance from the day’s hard work happening just outside the doors.\n\nThe O’odham and Yoeme people of the mission might have found the rituals of the Mass strange upon first introduction to the Catholic faith. The practice of kneeling, standing, and then kneeling again, during a ceremony conducted in primarily foreign tongues, was no doubt confusing for some. Eventually, however, these strange customs became familiar and blended with the spiritual and religious beliefs of the indigenous communities. Today, many O’odham and Yoeme people practice this uniquely intertwined religious tradition.",

In the walls above are niches where ornate statues of saints once stood.\n\nAlong the interior walls, weathering has exposed the sun-dried adobe bricks made by mission residents. The once brightly-painted walls were decorated by the steady hands of artisans both indigenous and Spanish.\n\nWith the rising sun, families and individuals living in the mission would make their way to the nave to gather and start the day. It is likely that men and women were separated by sex, as was the colonial manner. Here, indigenous people learned and practiced new religious traditions in new languages. They adopted new deities and established a new worldview under the direction of the padres. In this space, there were tears, both happy and sad. There was loss, celebration, learning, and change.\n\nShortly after the residents left in 1848, the roof timbers were taken by local settlers for construction elsewhere. For the next seventy years, the nave was exposed and heavily damaged by weather. Looters, seeking Jesuit treasure that never existed, dug holes in the walls and floors.",

There were also musicians who played instruments such as oboe, flute, and zither (guitar), adding flourish to the sound of the Masses and other religious ceremonies held here.\n\nSingers needed to memorize up to twenty-five songs for the community’s Masses, services, and processions.

Even the bell tower niche scallop shell motif, a nod to Spain’s patron saint, has Roman origins.\n\nSpain’s influences made their way to Tumacácori in color, as well. The columns on the front of the church were painted red, the capitals yellow with black markings. Statues stood against a blue background in their niches. The plaster of the doorway was carved and painted to resemble blocks of orange marble. You can still see original paint in the doorway and under the cornice below the window.\n\nThe monumental building with its bright color scheme and decorative elements would have been unlike anything in O’odham tradition.

With imagination, you can see young O’odham boys and girls standing on the ground below, pulling on ropes dangling from the tower, signaling for Mass to begin. Forty-niners, en route to the California gold rush, recalled the haunting sound of the bells ringing through the river valley as they approached. The whereabouts of those original bells remains a mystery. They have since been replaced.\n\nThe bells rang many times each day, instructing mission residents when to eat, work, and pray. Yet the tower was never completed; round holes mark where construction scaffolding still supported the work in progress. Although the bell tower appears to be in ruin, it has changed little since the last residents left in 1848. The fired bricks of the bell arches never received their finishing coats of plaster.

It wasn’t until 1768 that Tumacácori became a cabecera—a mission that housed a resident priest. This likely caused a significant disturbance for the O’odham of Tumacácori. With only occasional visits from the priest, they could openly continue their traditional religious and social practices. Now, under the watchful eye of a resident priest, they had to conceal those practices in order to model Spanish and Catholic values.\n\nThis structure continued to serve the Tumacácori community long after the mission era. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, this remaining section of the convento served as a residence, a school, and later housed the museum of the fledgling Tumacácori National Monument.

Priests born in Spain were deported, including Tumacácori’s last resident priest in 1828. The mission families stayed on for another twenty years. For reasons that they did not record, in 1848 the residents of Tumacácori moved away, the women carrying their precious santos (saint statues) on their backs in burden baskets to San Xavier del Bac. They left behind their church, cemetery, fields, and homes.\n\nWith the Gadsden Purchase in 1854, Tumacácori became part of the United States. The U.S. reservation system eventually limited the legal territory of the O’odham to five sister\nreservations: the San Xavier and Tohono (desert) O’odham, and Gila River, Salt River, and Ak-Chin Pima (river) nations.\n\nToday, the Tohono O’odham and Pima are known for their beautiful basketry, woven using materials collected from the deserts and rivers of their homeland. The Yoeme (Yaqui) are famous for their carvings and religious dance, the Apache for their beadwork. Many still speak the languages of their ancestors.\n\nAfter hundreds of years of mixing, marrying, creating new families, and blending traditions, a new people emerged: the mestizaje of Mexico. Flavors like chiles, carne asada, and tortillas reflect this mixing of origins. Sharing traditional foods—made fresh in kitchens such as this one—connects us to each other and to our shared heritage.",

They were each valuable in their own way—for cultural, religious, or symbolic importance, medicinal or food value, shade, or aesthetics. The tranquility of these natural spaces brought the Spanish and indigenous communities together to savor common cultural values: beauty and utility.\n\nThe courtyard garden at Tumacácori was built in 1939 as part of the visitor center’s “New Deal” era construction. Its design, like that of the adjacent visitor center, was inspired by other missions in the Pimería Alta. Several agencies were involved, but the original plantings were carried out by sixteen young men employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Three native mesquite trees were left in place and continue to grow in the garden. The olive, ornamental pomegranate, and monk’s pepper trees survive to this day.

The tour then follows the path toward the fort’s entrance, into the fort, and then around the Black River Boulevard side of the fort, and concludes on the trail near the St. Peter's Church. If you have any questions or comments about this tour, or the park in general, please visit the park's visitor. This tour and admission to Fort Stanwix National Monument are free. For more information about Fort Stanwix National Monument, please visit our web page at www.nps.gov/fost\nWe hope you enjoy your visit to park.\n\nFort Stanwix was declared a national monument on August 21st, 1935. At that time, no remains of the fort were visible above ground. You are standing at the intersection of James and Dominick Streets, locally known as the “American Corners.” This was the downtown of the City of Rome, New York. The city’s top of Commerce. From here you would have seen banks, stores businesses, a theatre, a hotel, and apartments on the upper floors of the three to four story buildings lining the streets. After the national monument was established, small plaques were installed to identify the site of the fort. The fort and surrounding grounds were not reconstructed until the 1970s, with the fort opening to the public in 1976 for the nation’s bicentennial. The trail you are you were standing on represents the Oneida Caring Place; a portage between the Mohawk River to the east and Wood Creek to the west. This was a major route for trade and the movement of armies during the 1700s. Fort Stanwix was built to protect this portage, the trade the that crossed the portage, and the movement of armies travelling east and west during the French & Indian and American Revolutionary Wars. In many respects the portage is just as important to us today. The location of Fort Stanwix National Monument has active partnerships with the City of Rome, Oneida County, the State of New York Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and other private and public sites surrounding the fort and in areas to the east and west.",

During the French & Indian War (also known as the Seven Years War), the King’s Colors flew over the fort. The King’s Colors represented the United Kingdom, also known as Great Britain. The British Army and American colonial provincial soldiers garrisoned the fort, and kept the French army in Canada from invading the Colony of New York. Over the course of the American Revolutionary War different flags flew from the flagpole. On August 3rd 1777, during the British siege of the American occupied fort, a red, white, and blue flag was hoisted over the fort. We do not know what that flag looked like because there are three descriptions of the flag. One description is of 13 alternating red, white, and blue stripes. Another source describes 13 alternating red-and-white stripes with the King’s Colors at the canton; the top left-hand corner. That flag is also known as the Grand Union or the Continental Army flag. The third description is of the “Stars and Stripes,” but with the 13 white stars in the blue canton. Today, our nation’s “Stars and Stripes” flies over the fort most of the time. During special park events that commemorate the forts historic events, you may also see other flags that may have flown from 1758 to 1781.",

Five structures have not been reconstructed. Two of them inside and three outside the fort. One of the structures inside the fort was the headquarters that stood between the whipping post and the north casemate. The other structure inside the fort was the guardhouse, which was located between the public restrooms and the Gregg Barracks.

During the 1700s, the area in front of you was a swamp with a stream running through it. The fort was built on a bluff overlooking the swamp, which extended to the Mohawk River. The swamp and river were natural barriers, or protective features, that protected the fort. To the right, the fort's necessary, or outhouse, extended from the fort over the stream, which washed the human waste downstream. Men, women, and children obtain fresh water for the fort from the stream in the area in front of you. During the British siege of the American held fort, in August of 1777, British engineers dug a channel and built a dam to redirect the fresh stream water to the Mohawk River and away from the fort. The men and women inside the fort were forced to drink water from wells that had been built inside the fort. The water was stagnant swamp water and unhealthy for the people drinking it. Where is the swamp today? During the 1800s the swamp was covered over with a landfill where trash and fill were dumped. Buildings were later constructed on the landfill during the fort’s reconstruction a representative stream bed was dug to show where that stream may been located.",

With the approach of Continental Soldiers commanded by American General Benedict Arnold the siege was ended. The Americans won a key victory. When combined with American victories in the Hudson and Lake Champlain Valleys, the Americans were able to defeat British General John Burgoyne and his army after the Battles of Saratoga. This series of battles combined are considered the turning point of the American Revolutionary War. Fort Stanwix continued to protect New York from the British in Canada until 1781, when it was finally abandoned. After the American Revolutionary War, the Oneida Carrying Place remained important for trade and the movement of armies travelling east and west. The Portage was replaced by roads, canals, and then railroads. Lynchville, later renamed Rome, was built around then over the site of Fort Stanwix and has enjoyed years of innovation and prosperity because of the commerce that passes through it. Truly, all roads do lead to Rome. Across the parking lot stands the city of Rome former post office. After the new post office was opened, the Rome Historical Society moved into the building. We encourage you to visit the Rome Historical Society Tuesdays to Fridays 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to learn more about the development of Rome and the city's innovations and prosperity.",

It would not be until the end of the 1960’s, however that the land where the original fort sat could be donated to the federal government. Along with being part of downtown Rome’s urban renewal efforts, Fort Stanwix was also rebuilt to help celebrate the Bicentennial of the United States in 1976. The National Park Service undertook three years of archeological work between 1970 and 1973, followed by three years of reconstruction from 1973 to 1976. Fort Stanwix National Monument officially opened to the public on May 20, 1976. \n\nBefore you is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers of the American Revolution. In 1972, during excavations for utility lines in conjunction with the rebuilding of Fort Stanwix, the remains of eight men were uncovered. They were laid out in a haphazard fashion and were not part of a larger cemetery. Study of the remains led to the determination that they were soldiers from the American Revolution. As part of the local celebrations for the country’s bicentennial in 1976, it was decided to create a tomb memorial for these men. This became the Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers of the American Revolution. The tomb was the last architectural project undertaken by Lorimar Rich. Rich was a Rome area native who also designed the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Arlington National Cemetery. On July 4th, 1976, the remains of the eight soldiers were reinterred in their final resting place at the tomb.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Hello, and thank you for taking this walking tour of historic downtown Anniston! First, a bit about Freedom Riders National Monument. The Freedom Riders were a group of diverse, non-violent, and mostly young activists who traveled through the South in small interracial groups during the summer of 1961. In total, more than 400 riders participated in more than 50 rides, challenging discriminatory state laws and local customs; testing if bus station facilities were complying with US Supreme Court decisions that ruled segregation during interstate travel was unconstitutional.  For these simple acts, riders faced violence and imprisonment.\n\n\n\nOn May 14, 1961, ten days after the rides began in Washington, D.C., the first group of Freedom Riders were ambushed, chased, and badly beaten by a white mob. The attack started here, at the Anniston Greyhound Bus Depot, and ended near a burning bus out on Highway 202. Media coverage of the violence, broadcast worldwide, forced Federal involvement, and inspired others to join the Freedom Rides. Freedom Riders National Monument was established in 2017 to tell this story.\n\n\n\nThe story of Anniston doesn’t start in 1961.  The story of Anniston begins almost 100 hundred years prior. Called the “Model City”, Anniston experienced four distinct eras between 1870 and 1970: Company Town, Segregated Commercial Center, New South “Model City,” and Civil Rights Battleground. Key tensions – between tradition and progress, between white and black, between civic pride and civic pessimism – shaped a century of change that created the modern “Model City.”  \n\n\n\nRemember those tensions – progress, race, and civic identity – because you will find them interwoven into the stories we will encounter along Anniston’s story.\n\n\n\nDiscussion Question: Think about a time when your home changed. How did you react?",

                    "audioTranscript": "Did you know that Anniston was a company before it was a town? In 1872, Samuel Noble and his business partner Alfred Noble founded the Woodstock Iron Company. During the Reconstruction Era (1863-1877) after the end of the Civil War, businessmen like Noble and Tyler rushed to develop Southern states’ mineral resources.\n\nThe Woodstock Company produced iron via charcoal furnaces that required a lot of fuel and manpower. The company recruited skilled European ironmakers as well as black and white laborers from surrounding areas. In 1873, the new enterprise and its employees formed the town of Anniston, named after Annie Tyler of the Tyler family.\n\nPrior to 1883, Anniston was a company town, which meant it operated and developed differently from other towns. The Woodstock Company owned virtually all stores and homes in Anniston. Workers paved the streets, laid sewers, built homes and industrial buildings, raised food on company farms, and purchased everything at the company store using company-issued “scrip” currency. The company built and staffed churches, schools, a doctor’s office, and emergency services.\n\nThe Woodstock Company oversaw the design and construction of downtown Anniston, and the area’s careful grid pattern included the land where you are standing. Much of the area surrounding Gurnee Avenue was occupied by Woodstock facilities, and the plot of land where the Greyhound Depot now stands used to be housing for Anniston’s industrial workers and their families.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWould you have liked living in a company town? What aspects of life would have been nice? What aspects would have been difficult? \n\nHow would life have been different in Anniston then in other surrounding communities?",

                    "audioTranscript": "Anniston “opened” as a public community with the arrival of the Georgia Pacific railroad in 1883. A construction boom followed: churches, the railway depot, The Anniston Inn, a renowned opera house, the Noble Brothers Car Wheel Works, a textile factory, and dozens of new homes and businesses sprang up quickly. Growth led to an 1883 designation of Anniston as the “Model City of the New South.”\n\nWhile Anniston’s industrial outlook was progressive, its leaders and power structures worked to establish segregation (both legally and in practice) in the years after the city opened to the public. Massive population growth, combined with visible racial violence between Anniston residents, white soldiers, and black soldiers of the Third Alabama Regiment stationed at Camp Shipp, contributed to white investment in segregation.\n\nAs Reconstruction faded, legal segregation rose, solidified by the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision. This “separate but equal” standard paved the way for sweeping changes to Alabama state law. In 1901, Anniston attorney John B. Knox chaired the Alabama Constitutional Convention and opened the proceedings by stating the convention’s purpose, which was to rewrite Alabama’s constitution “to establish white supremacy in this state.” Legal segregation was soon codified in both law and custom in the “Model City” around the turn of the 20th century.\n\nDespite segregation’s inhumanity, African American residents of Anniston carved out “A City Within A City” for themselves in the city’s commercial landscape. 15th street was the epicenter for African American commercial and social life between 1898 and 1950. Shops, services, restaurants, and entertainment could all be found here. These businesses and social spaces supported a distinctive community that thrived because of both community investment and necessity.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhy did the railroad have such a significant impact on Anniston? \n\nHow would integration have affected businesses in an African American business district? \n\nWhy was it necessary for Anniston’s leaders to change segregation by custom into segregation by law? \n\nIn what ways was Anniston a “model” city? Are there ways in which Anniston failed to live up to its “model” identity?",

In 1898, Camp Shipp was established on a hill above Anniston as a base for Army reserves. Laid out to house 10,000 men, the arrival of Camp Shipp led to a brief revitalization and construction boom between 1898 and 1899.  \n\nFollowing the Spanish-American war, attracting military investment became a political priority. Camp McClellan was established during World War I and by 1917, hosted 27,000 National Guardsmen. In 1929, Camp McClellan became Fort McClellan, a permanent Army installation.

In 1961, events unfolded at the Greyhound Bus Depot in Anniston that reflected these tensions. Two groups of Freedom Riders, on Greyhound and Trailways buses, arrived in Anniston on a quiet Sunday afternoon in May of 1961. Riders on the Greyhound bus were met by an angry mob of more than 100 white segregationists led by members of the Ku Klux Klan. The mob threw rocks at the bus, broke windows, and slashed tires, leaving the Freedom riders stranded. \n\nThe Freedom Riders’ bus eventually escaped the depot ambush, but damage to the bus’s tires forced it to the shoulder outside the city, near the Forsyth and Son Grocery Store. The mob followed and tossed a firebomb through the rear window. Freedom Riders struggled as members of the mob trapped them inside, escaping only when an explosion temporarily drove the crowd away. As the Freedom Riders poured off the burning bus, they displayed courage, resilience, and a commitment to non-violence as they were attacked and beaten by the mob. \n\nDuring the attack, twelve-year-old Janie Forsyth was standing in front of her father’s grocery store. Upon witnessing people in pain, Janie sprang into action, giving water and aid to the riders because, in Janie’s own words, “That’s something I can do.” Janie faced challenges growing up in Anniston because of her decision on that day but was recognized later in life for her courageous act of civility. Due to the courage and determination of Janie and the Freedom Riders, Anniston’s story was forever changed.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat makes a good citizen? \n\nAs a citizen, how do you respond when your community lets you down? \n\nKnowing the troubles that the Freedom Riders faced, could you have gotten on the bus like so many that followed them?",

Birmingham authorities gave the mob time to attack the Freedom Riders before the police arrived. \n\nThe Trailways bus carried the youngest Freedom Rider, Charles Person, who at nineteen-years-old made the decision to leave Morehouse College to contribute to the Civil Rights Movement. Mr. Person was severely beaten but met this brutality with dedicated non-violence. \n\nThough the Freedom Riders endured violence, the movement did not end in Alabama. Over 400 Freedom Riders joined during the summer of 1961, and most faced violence, arrests, and prison sentences in places like Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Prison.

African American residents organized the Calhoun County Improvement Association to lobby for integration but received little encouragement. Business and government leaders resisted changes while simultaneously worrying about Anniston’s negative national reputation. \n\nMinisters became leading voices in the fight for integration. In 1962, Reverend William B. McClain (a black Methodist) and Reverend Nimrod Reynolds (a black Baptist) began meeting with Reverend Phil Noble (a white Presbyterian). Emotional bonds formed at these meetings grew into the integrated Anniston Ministerial Association. Discussions on faith, duty, and the current state of Anniston’s segregated community among these ministers planted the seeds that became the Anniston Bi-Racial Human Relations Council. \n\nFormed in 1963, the Anniston Bi-Racial Human Relations Council created lines of communication between faith, business, and political leaders. African American members of the Council set the agenda and integration efforts began soon after the council’s creation. The first barriers to fall were segregated public accommodations at national chain “dime stores” in Anniston, including Kress’s on Noble Street. Small victories accumulated in the years that followed. \n\nIntegration efforts continued to encounter violent resistance, most notably during the September 1963 attack on Revs. McClain and Reynolds while they attempted to integrate the downtown Anniston Public Library. However, the communication and trust created by the Council’s efforts set a positive tone for Anniston’s integration and earned the city praise from President Kennedy, who hoped Anniston’s approach would allow it to serve as a “model for other communities.” Once again, Anniston was recognized as a “Model City.”\n\nDiscussion Questions: \n\nHow did Anniston’s “model” identity change throughout its history? \n\nThink about the story of Anniston’s traditions and the city’s history of progress. If you were telling the story to a friend, what parts of the story would you include? Is there anything you would leave out? \n\nWhy was the Anniston Bi-Racial Human Relations Council successful? What can we learn from its example?",

Until the 1770s, that is.  \n\n In March of 1770, the Boston Massacre occurred between colonists and British soldiers occupying the city. Five people were killed by the soldiers and became martyrs for a budding anti-British cause. In December 1773, during the Boston Tea Party, colonists took to the streets in protest, throwing 342 chests of tea into the harbor. Additionally, Boston colonists destroyed the governor's home, marched with effigies of government officials, and deployed intimidation tactics against merchants selling British goods.

The acts closed the port of Boston to trade, its main lifeline and limited colonists’ right to self-govern, ultimately replacing their governor with British General Gage. Instead of subduing colonists, it provoked outrage. Local Patriots saw the Powder Alarm as another tyrannical grab for power.

As a Virginian, and an outsider, he harbored negative views of the soldiers and was challenged by the fact that the army was racially integrated. He eventually earned their respect, though, by forcing the British to evacuated Boston on March 17th, 1776. Washington knew that his success depended on the loyalty of his soldiers, and he made a bid for that loyalty in his first General Orders on July 14th, 1775. That text is immortalized on the back of this monument.\n\nWhat does loyalty mean to you?",

Two years later Parliament passed the Stamp Act, a direct tax on paper used in the colonies to help pay for stationing British soldiers in North America. Believing that Benjamin Franklin had endorsed the Stamp Act, some Philadelphians declared that Franklin’s home should be destroyed. Franklin’s family fled, except for his wife Deborah, who with the help of friends stayed to defend the home. They prevailed, and the mob was convinced to leave.

Protests to Parliamentary action at times boiled over, as witnessed here in Franklin Court in October of 1765. Benjamin Franklin chose this quiet garden courtyard to build a home for himself and his family, but left during construction to act as Pennsylvania’s colonial spokesman in London in 1763.  Two years later Parliament passed the Stamp Act, a direct tax on legal documents, newspapers and other types of paper used throughout the colonies to help pay for stationing British soldiers in North America. Believing that Benjamin Franklin himself had endorsed the Stamp Act, impassioned Philadelphians meeting nearby declared that Franklin’s home, as well as that of the Stamp Collector, John Hughes should be, “leveled with the street.” Franklin’s family fled, except for his wife Deborah, who with the help of friends stayed to defend the home. Cooler heads prevailed however, and the mob was convinced to leave. Though Franklin later helped to convince Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act, Parliament continued to insist it was their right to legislate over the colonies. The road to revolution had begun.",

The site where you are standing is known as Pray’s Wading or Landing because it offers access to a naturally shallow river crossing.  Well before colonists settled here, Indigenous people would cross the river from this location. It was just one point in a complex system of trade. Archaeological evidence also indicates that this site was used by Indigenous people for fishing. \nWhen English colonizers arrived in the region during the 1600s, they relied on  trade routes established by their Indigenous neighbors. People continued to cross the river by foot for hundreds of years. On both sides of the river, more and more farms dotted the landscape. \nThen, in 1810, local farmers and merchants had another idea. With mills opening around New England, they imagined different uses for this rapidly moving segment of the river.  More on that story at our next stop.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Although there isn’t much left to see here, this is the location of the original textile mill in the area. George Olney and other investors chose this location to construct their own textile mill in 1810. This decision was likely influenced by the early success of Slatersville, a mill village in northern Rhode Island. These investors were also responding to government sanctions on international trade, which quickened industrialization throughout the Blackstone Valley.\nBy 1815, Olney’s crew had built a 30x60 foot mill known as the Smithfield Woolen and Cotton Manufacturing Company.  They also built a dam, a grist mill, and worker housing. But the mill ran for only a short time and was not successful. One of the issues was the cost of transporting the raw materials and finished products in and out of the mill. This could have been the end of industry on this site, but that chapter was far from finished. \nAround 1823, Captain Wilbur Kelly decided to purchase the failing mill. While working for the firm of Brown and Ives, Kelly had made a small fortune in the China Trade. Back on land, Kelly believed that a canal, or human-made waterway, would alleviate the transportation problems.  \nWhen the Blackstone Canal was finished in 1828, Kelly reaped the rewards of cheaper transportation costs. The Mill began to prosper. Kelly decided to sell the mill to the Lonsdale Company (which was also owned by Brown and Ives), but he stayed on as the mill’s manager.  In 1845, the mill doubled in size. It  remained in operation until the mid-1860s.\nLearn more about the Blackstone Canal and its role in local industry at the next stop.",

                    "audioTranscript": "In the early 1800s, many perceived the slow transportation of goods as a major obstacle to the growth of industry in the Blackstone River Valley. Due to rocks, rapids, and dams, barges could not navigate the entire length of the Blackstone River. Nearby roads were often poorly maintained and expensive to use. After the success of the Erie Canal, local industrialists  decided that a canal connecting Providence, Rhode Island to Worcester, Massachusetts could solve their  transportation problems.  \nWork on the Blackstone Canal began in 1825. Crews mostly made up of  Irish immigrants dug the canal with shovels, pickaxes, and spades. They spent years of their lives performing backbreaking, highly skilled work. Then, finally, in 1828, the first barges made the voyage up the 46-mile canal, giving many mill villages along the Blackstone River access to more reliable transportation.\nThis is one of the best views of the Blackstone Canal you can get without getting on the water. This long straight channel is not natural; it’s a feat of human engineering. About 40 feet across the top and tapering down to 18 – 25 feet on the bottom, the canal is about 4 feet deep. Two horses towed canal barges while walking on the towpath. The towpath, an elevated walkway about 5 feet above the waterline provided a safe place for the horses to walk. It would take 2 days to complete the journey from Worcester to Providence. \nThe canal remained in operation for only 20 years. Learn why at the next stop.",

By the late 1960s , Beta Cloth was used as the external layer of the Apollo Mission Space suits, covered the electronic panels in the space capsules, and was used to make bags in which astronauts could keep personal items. Fiberglass textiles produced by people in this mill literally went to the moon. \nThe story of transportation at this site shows us just how much the world has rapidly evolved and changed in the wake of the industrial revolution. But the more some things change, the more other aspects of life stay te same. Today, folks still make crossings at this site, in ways old and new. People bike, walk, run, and paddle across the landscape. They might dream of going to space or get lost staring at the rush of the river. Perhaps, in some ways we have come full circle. \nAs you continue to explore this site, take some time to ponder how forms of transportation effect your life today. What new forms of transportation will future visitors to this site use? How will future generations continue to interact with this landscape?",

                    "audioTranscript": "It may seem odd to start a tour of the forest here at the ocean beach, but in order to understand what makes the Sunken Forest so special it helps to understand where the forest came from.\n\nFor humans, the ocean beach is a relaxing and hospitable place, but for many plant species, the ocean beach is incredibly challenging. Survival here is not easy. Consider, for example, the forces of ocean tides, winds, waves, salt water and storms and you start to see why most plants avoid growing here. Sand is a particular challenge for many plant species, as it lacks the nutrients of soil, and as it shifts and moves too easily for most plants to adequately settle.\n\nAtop the dune you may notice a small variety of hardy plants, from amaranth to beach pea, growing on the sands below. Perhaps the easiest plant on Fire Island to overlook is also, perhaps, its most important. Gaze from the ocean to the toe of the Dune and you’ll notice the very first plant occupying this exposed, ever changing, and nutrient-poor environment. American Beach Grass is Fire Island’s first pioneer.\n\nAmerican beach grass is tougher than most plants. Over millions of years it has evolved to survive where other plants cannot. There are many adaptations which make American Beach Grass suitable to this environment. \n\nOne such adaptation is the unique structure of American Beach grasses' vast system of underground roots. These roots are interconnected, running from plant to plant. They enable beach grass to move water throughout its system from one plant to another while holding the grass together, keeping it grounded in the face of shifting sands and strong ocean storms.\n\nAs the roots run underneath the beach they help to hold the dunes together. In the same way that pioneers might begin settling in a new place, making it habitable for other people, pioneer species such as American beach grass shapes the island, making it habitable for everything which grows behind the protective barrier of the primary dunes.",

Look around and you’ll notice the stout gray and green patches of Beach Heather, lush bushes of Beach Plum, or even the scrubby form of Pines and Cedars.\n\nThe “swale”, as this area is called, is the open space between the primary and secondary dune line. Swale’s on Fire Island host a variety of plant species which are often associated with Long Island’s coastal environments. Many of these plants are not as well adapted to the harsh conditions of the ocean beach as American Beach Grass, but they are still quite hardy. As the American Beach Grass primes the environment by constructing protective dunes and forming soil through decomposition, they are succeeded by the plants we see here. \n\n“Succession” refers to the gradual process of change in an ecosystem brought about as one community of plants is replaced progressively by another. On Fire Island we can travel through time through different stages of succession as we move from the ocean to forest. \n\nMost of the plants which call the swale home are well-adapted to its unique conditions. Swales can be hot spots. Situated between the two dune lines, swales often lack a comfortable breeze. Swales are also sunnier environments, as the white sandy faces of the two dunes refract light into the swale like a sun reflector one might use to tan on the beach. Because of this, swales are arid and desert-like habitats, sometimes even supporting cacti and other desert-like species.\n\nOne iconic swale plant is Bayberry. Bayberry bushes have several unique adaptations designed to help them survive in the sunny swale. They are easily identified by the presence of the small whitish berries to which they owe their name. Observe the berries closely and you will see a thin coat of wax which helps the berry to retain moisture. As wax is hydrophobic, water is unable to escape the berry, preventing them from shriveling up in the hot sun. This wax has been used traditionally in the production of special “bayberry candles” often associated with good fortune when burnt on cusp of the new year.",

It is one of just two forests of its kind on the entire planet. \n\nThe process of succession which led to this climax community likely began over 300 years ago, when a large set of both primary and secondary dunes made this environment habitable to the trees which make it unique. The Sunken Forest is, more specifically, a maritime holly forest meaning that it is an ocean-side forest predominantly made up of American Holly trees. It’s sister forest is also preserved by the National Park Service, and is located in Sandy Hook New Jersey at Gateway National Recreational Area.\n\nFirst protected from development in the early 1950s by a concerned group of private citizens, a roughly 50-acre tract of beach, dunes and ancient holly forest just east of Point O'Woods was gradually cobbled together through a fundraising campaign spearheaded in 1952 by the Wildlife Preserves, Inc, and The Nature Conservancy. The Sunken Forest Sanctuary was officially dedicated as the Sunken Forest Preserve in 1960. The entrance plaque can still be seen along the western trail entrance.\n\nIn May 1966, the Sunken Forest Preserve, Inc. donated the property to the recently established Fire Island National Seashore, under the condition that the property shall always be maintained in its natural state and operated as a sanctuary, and that no public road or highway shall be built through it.\n\nAs a globally rare ecosystem, the Sunken Forest is an astounding example of biodiversity. As you walk through the forest take care to listen for migrating songbirds, stoic box turtles, slithering black racer snakes, and grazing deer. These are just some of the creatures that make their home in this sanctuary.",

From Beach Grass to Bayberry, Pitch Pine to Black Berry Cherry, each plant that has grown on Fire Island has helped to pave the way for what you see here. Look above at the flat canopy overhead and you may start to understand why this place is so unique. Where else on Long Island can you listen to the crashing of ocean waves beneath a canopy of towering trees?\n\nThis forest exists in a delicate state of balance. As waves on the beach crash, they toss salt into the air forming what is commonly referred to as “Salt Spray.” To humans salt spray can be quite pleasant, it’s what gives the beach that familiar summer smell, but salt spray can have a harsh effect on plants, sapping their leaves of precious water. \n\nAs that salt spray travels across Fire Island, carried across by the ocean breeze, it sweeps through the swale and other plant communities. Most of these communities are somewhat adapted to that constant exposure to salt spray, but here in the Sunken Forest the trees are not. \n\nSo then, how do these trees manage to grow in an environment which is normally so inhospitable to them? The answer lies in the set of ancient dunes you see before you. Here at Sailors Haven we are lucky to have not only a robust and healthy set of primary dunes, those tall hills of sand you saw when you began on the beach, but also a vast system of secondary dunes. It’s this double dune system which acts as a shield, protecting the forest from the effects of salt spray exposure. \n\nThough the dunes work to protect the forest from most of the salt spray, containing it upon the beach and within the swale, some of that salt spray continues to sweep above the canopy of trees you see overhead. As it does it actively trims or “prunes” the trees in an effect we call “salt spray pruning.” Pay attention to the height of the trees as you walk through the Sunken Forest. You will notice that as you rise closer to the top of the dunes, the trees will shrink, and as you sink below the dunes the trees will grow. It is as if a “salt spray ceiling” sits above the forest preventing its upward growth. This creates the “Sunken” effect to which this forest owes its name, as the trees appear to have sunk into the dunes they grow upon.\n\nWhen it comes to salt spray, however, it is not all destruction. Even as the salt trims the tree tops, potentially killing the forest if the dunes were to suddenly vanish, that same salt spray is what enables this forest to grow here at all. You see, Fire Island and the Sunken Forest are young ecosystems. Their soil is sandy and thin. Even still, were you to investigate the soil of the Sunken Forest you would find it packed with minerals and nutrients brought in by that same salt spray. Those minerals and nutrients act as food for the trees. Without this delicate balance, this forest would not be here for us to enjoy.",

Around here it often referred to as “Juneberry”, though you may also hear it identified as “Serviceberry”, “Shadblow”, “Shadbush”, or “Shadtree.”\n\nThe first name, Juneberry, is likely the easiest to remember and to identify. “Juneberry” comes from the fact that its berries, quite tasty though containing large seeds, often appear and rippen throughout the month of June. \n\nThe name “Shadblow” is often tied to a fish called shad which, like salmon in the pacific, travel from the ocean up rivers like the Hudson in order to lay their eggs. Fishermen would use the appearance of flowers on “Shadblow” in early spring to know when the shad run had begun. \n\nThe last name “Serviceberry” is among the more interesting names for this tree. Various accounts suggest that the appearance of its flowers in the early spring are often associated with the thawing of winter ice in the ground. This is important, especially up north, when ground ice can prevent the digging of holes. As a result of this tree's timing, it is often planted in front of funeral homes and in graveyards to help indicate the time of year when thawing ground ice allowed for the digging of graves and hosting of funeral “services”. This, of course, is just one of several stories associated with the name “serviceberry.”. \n\nYou may notice the odd little holes in this tree. These holes were created by a small woodpecker called a “yellow-bellied sapsucker.” Sapsuckers, as their name implies, poke holes into the side of trees in order to drink their sap.",

While there is plenty of water to the south in the Atlantic Ocean, that water is too salty to drink. The same is true of the brackish water north in the Great South Bay. In light of this, the location in front of you is a critical site for wild animals, as this is part of Fire Island where the island itself dips low enough for fresh rain water to collect. Because of this, this site is an excellent place to observe wild animals such as birds, butterflies, turtles and other creatures.You may also see an interesting assortment of plants such as blueberry and cranberry. \n\nWhile these small wetlands are critical to the ecosystem of the Sunken Forest, there are some indications of trouble ahead. Over the last sixty years many of these small bogs have appeared to be growing, spreading throughout the forest as the “vadose zone”, the dry space between the water table and the surface of the ground, appears to thin. This thinning has already impacted the ecology of the Sunken Forest, killing some trees and spreading species that were once uncommon here. The tall bushes of groundsel in front of you were once much less prevalent then they are today. Now, as more water appears throughout the forest, groundsel is a more common sight. \n\nFire Island is always changing, and this dynamic nature is part of what makes it so unique. The Sunken Forest, however, is among Fire Island’s more stable systems. It exists within a delicate state of balance that has persisted for centuries, allowing for the growth of an assortment of trees and other plants that make this such a rare habitat.

The location where you now stand exists largely on the outskirts of the Sunken Forest, where fresh water bogs give way to freshwater and saltwater marshes. These marshes are dominated not by trees, but by an assortment of species which are well adapted to growth within habitats which feature consistently wet soil. Native species you may spot from here include swamp rose mallow, blueberry, and some strains of native phragmites. However, most of what you see growing here, these tall cornstalk-like grasses, are of a non-native and potentially invasive variety of phragmites.\n\nPhragmites Australis, or common reed, is a tall and hardy wetland grass broadly distributed and found throughout many parts of the world. Though it’s status is a subject of debate, in many places throughout North America it is considered non-native and even invasive. In the same way that an invader takes over the territory of another group of people, an invasive species aggressively takes over the habitat of a native species. In the case of Phragmites Australis, this takeover is the result of its aggressive root system, its tall overcrowding stalks, and the release of a corroding substance called “gallic acid” by the plant as it decays. \n\nMost of this Phragmites Australis is itself something of a colonial artifact, likely introduced by Europeans during the early to mid-stages of expansion into North America throughout the late 17 and early 1800s. It was often used within the hulls of ships as ballast material, or alternatively as thatching on the roofs of houses. Everywhere European ships landed, Phragmites Australis followed. \n\nToday Phragmites Australis is closely observed and maintained by the National Park Service, especially in areas where it appears to be expanding. Here in the Sunken Forest Phragmites Australis is considered somewhat naturalized, having replaced native stains of Phramites Australis that came before. Recent DNA evidence suggests that some strains of Phragmites Australis actually predate European colonization, though these strains are usually less common and less aggressive.",

Able to survive in muddy and wet soil, cattail is often among the first plant species to take root in newly moistened habitats. The fluffy dandelion-like seeds of its decaying punks are easily spread with the wind. While cattail is considered native to this region it is considered invasive in some places.\n\nThroughout the world, species of cattail have been made useful to people in many aspects of life, from agriculture, to building material, and even as biofuel! Native Americans, who were the first to visit Fire Island, had many uses for this plant. The seeds from its punks can be used as tinder to start fires and as insulation. Its stalk, roots and rhizomes can be eaten outright, or used to produce flour for making bread and other baked goods.\n\nThe abundance of cattail, as well as oysters, clams, and even seals on Fire Island meant that Native American Tribes such as the Unkechaug of Poospatuck often visited and made use of the island and it’s resources. The Unkechaug were famously skilled whalers who launched their boats from these shores. Since long before the arrival of European colonists, this land has been a home and haven to many.",

It’s pointed leaves, and the bright red berries of the female plants are often associated with the holiday season. Look closely at the bark and you may also notice its slight greenish hue, and the odd eye-like knots that adorn its surface. Those eyes are, or course, not eyes at all, but the remnants of old branches shed from the tree in a process called “self-pruning.” \n\nIlex Opaca, or American Holly is a broadleaved evergreen native to the Northeastern United States. Though it is hardy, it is not a particularly salt-tolerant plant and so, rarely occurs in this density as close to the ocean as we are now. Protected from the salt spray by the tall set of primary and secondary dunes, these trees have beaten the odds and grown in a most unlikely spot.\n\nThere are, unfortunately, signs of trouble in regard to this rare stand of holly trees. Look out to the ground and you may notice almost no young saplings or adolescent holly. Over the last sixty or so years the Sunken Forest has undergone a dramatic transformation. What was once a thick understory is now relatively barren, a worrying sign for future generations. But, what happened to all of the young holly?\n\nYou may be surprised to hear this, but holly saplings are popular food items for herbivores such as deer on Fire Island. Though it’s leaves are sharp and painful in mature holly, young saplings feature soft and juicy leaves. As a result of overgrazing, due in no small part to the exceedingly large population of deer on Fire Island, an entire generation of holly trees is missing from the forest. This means that if and when an adult holly tree dies or is knocked over, its children are no longer there to replace it.\n\nBut how can the deer be having this impact on the Sunken Forest only now? The unfortunate answer lies in our hands. There are estimated to be as many as three to four times as many deer on Fire Island then can survive here on their own based on the island's acreage. This unusually dense population appears to be the result of illegal or accidental feeding. Whether they are rummaging through garbage pails, or taking food from the hands of visitors, deer often become sickly or unhealthy from this process. Even still, many survive and reproduce at much higher rates than you would expect in a wild space. As a result of their proliferation, the Sunken Forest and many other habitats on Fire Island have been placed in jeopardy.\n\nWhat can you do to help both the deer and the Sunken Forest? Above all it our goal to ensure that we keep wildlife wild. This means that under no circumstances should we feed or interact with wild animals such as deer. We must also take care to secure our food and garbage away from deer. With this in mind we can all do our part to take care of this environment holistically, ensuring the health and safety of the deer, the holly, and all of the other plants and animals which make this place unique.",

Looking closely to brush before you and you may see its decaying trunk and skyward roots. The holly tree that once stood here came down during Superstorm Sandy in October of 2012. It’s collapse is a troubling sign.\n\nTree’s falling in forests, of course, is not uncommon. In fact, trees collapsing due to illness or other factors is an important part of the natural life of forests. Decaying trees, branches and leaves enrich the soil of the forest, providing food for the plants which would grow up in its place. As trees fall they open up holes in the canopy overhead, allowing light to reach down to plants where it could not before. This allows young trees and saplings to grow in its place. \n\nThe natural replacement of one tree with another is part of the process that fuels the succession we talked about before. In stable “climax communities” when an adult tree dies it is replaced by its own young. For reasons we outlined at our last stop this process is being interrupted. You may notice, for example, sapling Black Cherry trees growing in this holly’s place. Black cherries, though tasty to us, are not particularly popular with deer. Their leaves are packed with cyanide and likely to upset their stomachs when eaten. This results in what is called “selective grazing” where herbivores actively shape an ecosystem by eating some things and avoiding others. \n\nBlack cherries, while native to this area, are common on Fire Island, thus the rare maritime holly forest is slowly being replaced by a more common habitat, representing a loss of global biodiversity.\n\nBut why did this tree fall in the first place? Recall when we discussed the rising water table, and thinning “vadose  zone” while visiting the freshwater bog. Look below the boardwalk and you may see standing water beneath the holly tree’s roots. For many years this tree grew up in dry soil. By the time the tree collapsed, it’s soil was inundated with water which likely contributed to “root rot” and it’s eventual fall.\n\nAll around the Sunken Forest water is appearing in places where it did not before. Scientists in the park have been observing this phenomenon, monitoring the water table and testing it for salinity from sea water. It appears as though the water table on Fire Island is rising in concert with sea-level rise, one very troubling symptom of anthropogenic, or human-cause, climate change.",

This spot is not just “the heart” because of the trails convergence. It is also one part of Fire Island where the holly trees which make the forest so special grow the tallest. Many of these trees are a hundred to two hundred years old. They exist here within a delicate balance, one managed by each and every plant and animal which calls this forest home. \n\nThe forces of wind, waves, and water are constantly reshaping Fire Island, but here an unusual degree of stability has fostered a globally rare ecosystem, and a profound example of  biodiversity. As stewards of this forest, you are part of this delicate balance, responsible for its continued survival and enjoyment for yourself and for future generations. \n\nIt is up to us to find solutions to these monumental problems. Concerning the deer, it is easy to avoid feeding them. In addition to artificial reduction and other related management policies we believe it is possible to restore balance between the deer and this environment, but only if we are careful to respect wildlife and keep it wild. \n\nAs to climate change it is important to remember that human produced greenhouse gases like CO2 are contributing most to the planet's warming, producing a “heat trapping blanket” which envelopes the earth's atmosphere. By reducing carbon emissions from greenhouse gases, and by maintaining and even cultivating habitats like this we could work to offset these effects. It may feel like an overwhelming task, but the future remains unwritten. \n\nThough there are concerning signs of decline due to climate change and due to human interaction with the island’s deer, our scientists are actually quite hopeful.

From atop the secondary dune we can see clearly the desert-like swale, the primary dune, and the vast Atlantic Ocean. To the west you can see Point ’O Woods and other Fire Island communities. To your east stands a short but remarkable little American holly tree.\n\nCompare this holly to the ones you saw in the heart of the forest and you may recognize the effects of salt spray pruning. Where before the trees stood tall, now they are short and stubby. You may even notice their windswept or hedge-like appearance, as though someone came here and trimmed its top off. \n\nFor over three-hundred years the Sunken Forest has stood as a profound and unique example of the resilience and adaptability of life on a constantly shifting barrier island. There are lessons to learn from this everywhere we look. You need only to keep your eyes open.\n\nProceeding from here visitors may choose to go back the way they came, or to proceed forward into the swale. Be warned that the swale can be quite hot on sunny summer days. Once you are in the swale you will notice a concrete walkway. You may head left to return to the bathrooms near where we began, right to head back towards the heart of the forest down the longer loop, or straight out onto the ocean beach. Wherever you go we hope you will take time to listen to and enjoy this marvelous place. We also encourage you to visit the Sailors Haven Visitor Center to speak to a ranger, or even join one on a public tour!\n\nRemember, Fire Island National Seashore is your national park. Thank you for joining us as we explored it together. \n\nThe Sunken Forest Self-Guided Audio Tour was written, recorded, edited, and produced by Kelsey Sucena of the National Park Service and Fire Island National Seashore. \n\nAll photographs by Kelsey Sucena of the National Park Service.\n\nSpecial thanks to Chris Olijnyk, and Kristin Santos for editing and guidance. Thank you also to Dave Raymond and to Jordan Raphael for your wealth of knowledge on the Sunken Forest.\n\nThis audio tour is provided for free by Fire Island National Seashore, the National Park Service , and the United States Department of the Interior.\n\nThank you for joining us today.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Up the walk ahead of you is the Truman farm home.  It was originally called the Young farm, since it belonged to Harriet Louisa Young, Harry Truman’s maternal grandmother.  Harry Truman grew up in Independence and moved to Kansas City after he graduated from high school in 1901.  His father suffered some serious financial setbacks that year due to some bad investments, which resulted in the rest of the Truman family (that would be Harry’s mother, his father, his brother, and his sister) moving here to Grandview to live with Harry’s Grandmother, in 1905.  The next year, 1906, his father decided he needed Harry’s help to run the farm, so Harry left Kansas City, where he’d been working as a bank clerk, and came here to live here with the rest of his family in this farm house—with no running water, no heat, no electricity—he’d had all those things—he was 22 years old, grown up in town, and he’d never farmed a day in his life.  He learned, though, and ended up spending the next eleven years here.  By 1917, World War I had begun, and Harry enlisted in the military.  He came back from the war two years later, in 1919, and married Bess Wallace, who was living in her maternal grandmother’s home up in Independence.  That Independence home is what is now called the Truman home.  Harry moved in with Bess and her extended family in Independence and lived there the rest of his life—before, during, and after his time in the White House.  Mr. Truman never returned to farming, but he later referred to this property as “the finest place in the world.”  Most of the farm is gone now, but the old house still stands, as well as a couple of outbuildings that were here when Harry Truman lived here.  Take this short tour to learn about some of the experiences on this farm that helped shape a young man that grew up to be President of the United States.",

The original house, built in 1867 by Harry Truman’s grandparents, Solomon and Harriet Young, sat on the same site as the current farmhouse.  That first house was a big, stately mansion with large rooms and long porches stretching along the north and south sides.  Harry’s grandparents, the Youngs, were wealthy people and their house reflected their status.  Unfortunately, however, that original house burned down in 1894.  Harry grandfather, Solomon, was dead by that time, and his grandmother had this smaller house in front of you constructed later that same year—1894—with the intention of turning it into a tenant house after she got around to rebuilding the big one.  But unexpected things happen sometimes, and, as it turned out, she never did get around to rebuilding the big one, so it’s this house you’re looking at that Harry Truman moved into in 1906.",

                    "audioTranscript": "At the time Harry Truman moved here to his grandmother’s property, the farm was one of the largest in the state of Missouri—about four times the average Missouri farm, in fact.  Most farms in Missouri around 1910 were about 125 acres.  The Young farm was 600 acres.  If you look across Blue Ridge Boulevard to the west—that’s away from the farm house—you can see two stone pillars on the far side of the parking lot across the street.  Those pillars were there when Harry Truman lived here, and they mark the original entrance to the Young’s property.  The driveway came towards you, curved off to your left, and then pretty much followed the driveway you drove in on today.  It’s hard to imagine how much land was here at the time Harry lived here, but you can get a little bit of an idea just by seeing that their front yard used to be at least twice as long as it is now.  This was a lot of land, and it was worth a lot of money.  It also required a lot of work to keep a farm that size going, especially in the days when farmers still had to use horses and mules rather than tractors or combines.  Harry’s grandmother appreciated the Trumans coming to help her run the farm, and when she died in 1911—three years after the Trumans had been living here helping her—she left them all the land and all her money.  The Trumans should have been set, but unfortunately, other relatives tried to break the will.  The resulting lawsuit lasted about three years.  The Trumans got to keep the land but had to pay the other relatives $9,500.  The lawyers got $3,000.  Today, all that money—$12,500—would be worth over a quarter of a million dollars.  The resulting financial pinch caused the Trumans to have to mortgage the farm.  The mortgage meant that the Trumans, despite their best efforts and the fact that the farm made a ton of money, were never debt-free again for as long as they lived here.  “We always owed the bank something,” Mr. Truman later wrote, “sometimes more, sometimes less—but we always owed the bank.”",

The outhouse and the shed to the right of the chicken coop were brought in later, but the chicken coop is original.  Farming has never been easy work, especially when one has to deal with animals.  One time Harry wrote to Bess in Independence that he’d been trying to get 29 pigs into the barn.  He got 15 of them in and then decided to put corn in the barn to entice in the rest of them.  All of them went in except what he called “the extra smart one,” who ran in, grabbed an ear of corn, and ran out right between Harry legs.  He fell down in the mud, the barn door came open, and all the pigs got back out.  Harry said that whenever the barn door was open and he didn’t want the pigs in there, of course, every one of them would go right in.  Chickens, however, when it came to farm animals, seemed the least offensive.  They’re mainly just dumb, but they don’t get into that much trouble.  Truman’s chickens did however, get lice, and Harry wrote Bess about his mother’s special recipe for chicken dip.  And it doesn’t sound like something the lice would enjoy.  He said his mother would get some chewing tobacco and steep it in hot water as if she was making tea.  He said she would use four twists per bucket.  Then she would put in enough cold water to cover up the chicken and cool down the water so the chicken didn’t get burned.  Next, she would put in a tablespoonful of melted grease.  Lastly, she would put her hand over the chicken’s eyes and bill (hold his nose, so to speak), and, as Harry wrote, “souse him good.”  “Young and old alike can go through the process without harm,” he told Bess.  He said it was a good idea to pick a warm day if you’re going to be dipping chickens.  For a young man who had grown up in town, life of this farm—chickens, chicken lice, extra smart hogs—it all must have taken some getting used to.",

If you walk up to them, you can see the remains of the gates and the hinges.  Fences ran down the length between the sets of posts and enclosed a big barnyard.  It looks like a lawn now, but when Harry lived here it was probably a big muddy mess.  Six hundred acres is almost a square mile, but this property wasn’t in a square.  It was more of a dog leg shape and extended straight back for over a mile.  It was good land, but farming was—and still is—an unpredictable profession.  Everything depends on something no one can control:  the weather.  “It rained within a quarter mile of our field and never a drop in it,” Harry wrote to Bess.  “There’s always something the matter with a crop. It’s either too dry or too wet or too short or too long or too much or not enough,” he wrote her in 1913. “If is the largest word in a farmer’s language.”  Certain things are just out of our control sometimes, and Harry Truman seems to have learned that here on this farm.  There was no time to sit around feeling sorry for himself or wishing things were different.  Harry had to learn to make decisions and deal with situations as they were, rather than as he would like them to be.  He later wrote, “Once I had made [a] decision, I didn’t worry over it.  If I made a wrong decision, I made another one to correct it.”  Of course, he had no idea about some of the decisions he was going to have to make in the future.",

I dislocated my specs and gave myself a black eye.  For this reason, I decided to paint it white.

In less than a month, he reported to Bess, “I have been endeavoring to learn to push an auto.”  His brother told him he should sell the car and use the money to buy cows.  He got the hang of it, though.  The Stafford gave him a freedom he’d never known before.  Most specifically, it allowed him to drive to Independence and see Bess much more often than he’d ever been able to do by taking the train.  It wasn’t long before he wrote her, “I am getting so I don’t object to driving like I did to begin with.  Getting sort of used to it I suppose—five thousand miles in three months is moving around somewhat….”  If you’d like to hear the end of the tour there's one more stop.",

One wonders what he would have thought if you’d told him in 1906, when he first came to the farm at age 22, that he was going to stay for 11 years, spend two years fighting in a World War, and then, at age 35, finally marry the girl he’d had a crush on since he was six years old.  And of course, one wonders what he would have thought if you’d told that 22-year-old farmer (as he was dipping chickens) that he was going to be the president of the United States someday.  “We can never tell what’s in store for us,” he wrote later.  And of course, none of us can.  And that’s the story of Harry Truman.  Thanks for taking the Truman Farm Home cell phone tour.",

The tour begins at Roaring Mountain, then takes you to Obsidian Cliff, Indian Creek, and Sheepeater Cliff, where it concludes. If traveling from the north (Sheepeater Cliff), you can begin the tour there. At each stop, you will learn about Tukudika lifeways. As you listen, imagine what Yellowstone might have been like before it became the world’s first national park. Reflect upon what the concepts of home and lifeways mean to you. \n\nRoaring Mountain takes its name from the fumaroles (steam vents) that punctuate its surface. The name makes the geologic feature seem lifelike. Thinking about the significance of place names creates an opening for thinking about how Native American names are both used and misused. Tuku is the Shoshone word for bighorn sheep, and dika is the Shoshone word for eaters. Thus, Tukudika means “eaters of the mountain sheep.” The Shoshone gave their bands names for the foods each band ate or for places they traveled to or stayed in. By the late nineteenth century, the name Sheepeater was commonplace in English. The name is not a misnomer; neither does it tell the full story of this fascinating group; and it was problematic because some early European American travelers used the name pejoratively. \n\nNineteenth-century accounts by Euro-American traders and travelers claimed that Native Americans were afraid of thermal features and that this fear led them not only to give a wide berth to the features but to avoid the Yellowstone region altogether. Although this claim was easily debunked in the twentieth century, it bolstered the case of early park managers to remove American Indians from the park and move them onto reservations. In fact, Native Americans had many uses—practical, medicinal, and spiritual—for the area’s abundant thermal features. The Tukudika soaked the sinews of bighorn sheep in thermal waters in order to make them pliable for bow-making. Their well-designed bows were desirable trade goods to other Native Americans and to European Americans.\n\nOf course, bows could not function alone. To learn more about their counterpart, the arrow, travel now to Obsidian Cliff.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Three miles from Roaring Mountain stands the massive Obsidian Cliff, which was formed out of a 180,000-year-old lava flow. Obsidian is volcanic glass that forms when rhyolitic (silica-rich) magma cools quickly, leaving no opportunity for crystals to form in the rock. (In the late nineteenth century, Obsidian Cliff was called Glass Mountain. This is another instance of a name that has changed as more knowledge has become available.) The higher the silica content, the smoother and sharper the stone. Silica accounts for more than 75 percent of obsidian’s composition, which makes it the ideal material out of which to fashion tools and weapons. \n\nWorking in extended-family groups, the Tukudika dug out pits atop Obsidian Cliff with shovels made from bison or elk bone. (Numerous quarries have been identified at this site.) After the intense labor of flint-knapping, a cantaloupe-sized piece of obsidian would yield two to three arrowheads. In addition to arrowheads, the Tukudika and other Native American groups made spear points, knives, and scraping tools out of obsidian. Archaeological evidence of quarries and workshop sites is complemented by evidence of stone circles, which indicate that Native Americans camped near the cliff while they collected stone.\n\nObsidian Cliff provided an essential resource and may have also served as a neutral meeting ground where tribes could quarry the stone peacefully. Although Native Americans quarried many types of stone, including chert, most developed a definite preference for Obsidian Cliff obsidian, which they valued for its utility and abundance as well as for its beauty. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis tells us that obsidian was quarried here at least 11,000 years ago. Obsidian from this site traveled far and wide on North American trade routes.\n\nThe Tukudika were hunter-gatherers to whom trade routes were of vital importance.",

                    "audioTranscript": "En route to Sheepeater Cliff is Indian Creek, so named for the trail that runs parallel to it. This path is believed to be part of the Bannock Trail, a corridor through the northern and northeastern parts of the park that connected seasonal hunting grounds and that was traversed by many Native American tribes.\n\nLike many tribes of the western United States, the Tukudika were not fixed in one place. However, unlike most western tribes, including other Shoshone bands, they did not adopt the horse. Instead, they hunted on foot in alpine areas, accompanied by work dogs. These medium-sized dogs, which looked like a wolf-husky cross, hauled travois (two-pole sleds) laden with supplies. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that the Tukudika were buried with their dogs, a finding that suggests the animals were also companions.\n\nFur-trapper Osborne Russell’s 1835 encounter with a group of Tukudika in the Lamar Valley (possibly also along the Bannock Trail) runs counter to other early Euro American stories, for it is generally positive, albeit somewhat romantic. Russell refers to the Tukudika as Snake Indians, another problematic name sometimes used for Shoshonean groups in the nineteenth century. He writes, “They were all neatly clothed in dressed deer and Sheep [sic] skins of the best quality and seemed to be perfectly contented and happy” (26). He goes on to describe camping with the Indians and trading household goods and tools for animal skins. “They were well armed with bows and arrows pointed with obsidian[.] The bows were beautifully wrought from Sheep, Buffaloe [sic] and Elk horns secured with Deer and Elk sinews and ornamented with porcupine quills and generally about 3 feet long” (26-7).\n\nThe Tukudika spent time in the Lamar Valley and along the Yellowstone Lake, but they are associated most closely with a geologic formation called Sheepeater Cliff. Indeed, this site helps us to understand the Tukudika’s day-to-day existence.",

                    "audioTranscript": "This ancient formation of columnar basalt, five miles south of Mammoth Hot Springs and in the shadow of Bunsen Peak, was named Sheepeater Cliff by Philetus Norris, Yellowstone’s second superintendent, for an Indian camp located here in the nineteenth century. Although Sheepeater Cliff was not the exclusive domain of the Tukudika, the area affords a microcosmic view of the Tukudika way of life, highlighting the ways in which they harnessed Yellowstone’s resources to forge a productive relationship to the land. A relatively protected area, Sheepeater Cliff possesses several useful features: cliffs that provide shelter and game, flat areas for setting up camp and work sites, and access to the Gardner River.\n\nThe Tukudika were known for their timber traps for game, particularly bighorn sheep, as well as for hunting blinds and drivelines. In addition to bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), the Tukudika ate small game such as deer, rabbits, and marmots. More than 50 percent of their diet consisted of plants, roots, nuts, and berries. For preparing these foods, they used steatite (soapstone) vessels. In camp, they constructed newe-gahni (Shoshone for “houses built to suit a specific purpose”), structures akin to wickiups. A typical structure was composed of lodgepole pine curved at the top and covered with grasses and leaves. It could be situated against a cliff face or rock overhang to provide greater shelter and stability.\n\nEarly park officials pined for an uninhabited, pristine wilderness. At the same time that writers, painters, and photographers depicted Yellowstone for a popular audience, American Indians were pushed out of the story and out of the frame by these first non-indigenous storytellers. In fact, even to early explorers, this land would not have seemed uninhabited, for signs of Native-American presence—trails, camps and campfires, hunting and fishing traps, wickiups and other structures, the quarry at Obsidian Cliff as well as other quarries—would have been thick on the ground.\n\nThe Shoshone word for homeland is teviwa, and the area you have just traveled through was once part of the Tukudika teviwa. (Indeed, many Native American groups consider Yellowstone to be part of their ancestral lands.) How might you expand your definitions of home and lifeways after listening to this tour? How might you see, or think about, the park differently now that you have this knowledge? What stories will you tell about your time in Yellowstone?\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning about the Tukudika’s significance to Yellowstone National Park and about Yellowstone’s significance to them.

Over the next twelve stops we will hear powerful stories of people who seized their freedom on the Underground Railroad and came to Boston. We will also learn about the activists and allies in this city who helped these freedom seekers along their way.\nWe will spend the first part of our tour on the north slope of Beacon Hill, home to Boston’s free Black neighborhood. Members of this community came together to provide a safe-haven and support for many freedom seekers.\nWe will then walk downtown where many Beacon Hill activists joined other Bostonians to engage in high profile protests and rescues.  \nWe will end our tour near the waterfront, which served as an entry point for so many freedom seekers on the Underground Railroad.      \nBear in mind, Boston’s Underground Railroad history is expansive. No tour, including this one, can claim to be all encompassing. Rather, we hope to shed light on some of the lesser-known stories, not already featured on our other tours, including the Black Heritage Trail, which you can find on the National Park Service app as well.    \nLet’s get started. \nOur tour begins here on Smith Court, an integral center of Black life and activism in 1800s Boston. The African Meeting House, the three story-brick building with tall arched windows, served as a church, schoolroom, and gathering space for the community. Here, Underground Railroad activists planned how they were going to help those escaping slavery. For example, in the early 1840s, Black Bostonians formed the New England Freedom Association which held their meetings here.  According to William Cooper Nell, one of the leaders of this group: \n\"The object of our Association is to extend a helping hand to all who may bid adieu to whips and chains, and by the welcome light of the North Star, reach a haven where they can be protected from the grasp of the man-stealer… \"\nGroups such as the New England Freedom Association, and later the Boston Vigilance Committee, provided funds, clothing, food, information, and other assistance to the freedom seekers coming to and through Boston on the Underground Railroad. \nIn 1850, the federal government enacted a harsh new Fugitive Slave Law that allowed slave catchers to roam free states in search of runaways and mandated the assistance of state and local authorities, as well as the public, in returning freedom seekers to slavery.  Soon after, Black Bostonians rallied here at the African Meeting House to plan their collective response. Lewis Hayden, Boston’s most prominent Underground Railroad leader presided. One activist, Joshua B. Smith, militantly claimed, “If liberty is not worth fighting for, it is not worth having” and encouraged his listeners to arm themselves against the slave catchers...For as Smith said, “When he could not live here in Boston, A FREEMAN...’He had lived long enough.”\nDirectly across from the African Meeting House stands 3 Smith Court, the yellow house. According to the records of the Boston Vigilance Committee, Black activist and clothing dealer James Scott sheltered several freedom seekers here in the 1850s, as did William Cooper Nell, another prominent Underground Railroad operative, who also boarded here. Authorities arrested, tried, but did not convict Scott for his alleged role in leading the successful courthouse rescue of freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins in 1851.   \nSmith Court also witnessed a dramatic Underground Railroad confrontation in 1847.  A slave catcher attempted to capture Mrs. Dorsey, a freedom seeker, in her home at the end of Smith Court. Black activist Nancy Prince hurried to the scene, grappled with the slave catcher, and threw him out of the house.  She then rallied the women and children who gathered during the commotion and got them to hurl stones and anything else they could find at the slave catcher, running him out of the neighborhood.   \nBefore we move on to our next stop, we encourage you to take a walk to the rear of Smith Court.  Look right and left, up and down the alley. See how tightly packed these little hidden homes and neighborhoods are.  These densely crowded streets and tucked away alleys and houses served as temporary homes and safe havens for so many freedom seekers fleeing slavery on the Underground Railroad.",

Two of these allies, George and Susan Hillard, used their status and privilege to shelter several freedom seekers at their home here at 62 Pinckney Street.\nAt first glance, George Hillard did not appear to be the typical ally of the Underground Railroad. Although a former law partner to the radical abolitionist Charles Sumner and generally in favor of racial equality, George Hillard opposed the more radical abolitionist calls to end slavery immediately. As a federal commissioner, Hillard also had to uphold the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, which had strict consequences for those aiding freedom seekers. \nSusan Hillard, unlike her husband, was a staunch abolitionist and used George's political cover to hide freedom seekers in their home throughout the 1850s. Records document the Hillard home as a safe house for at least five freedom seekers during this time. While it is unclear how much George knew of Susan’s ongoing Underground Railroad activities, he likely had some awareness and either did not interfere, or quietly supported her efforts. \nThe Hillards most notably sheltered freedom seeker Ellen Craft in October 1850 when slave catchers tracked her and her husband William to Boston. Upon hearing the news of the slave catchers’ arrival, Susan Hillard found Ellen Craft in a home on Mt. Vernon Street, the next street over. Susan acted immediately:  \n\"I proposed to Ellen to come and do some work for me, intending not to alarm her. My manner, which I supposed to be indifferent and calm, betrayed me, and she threw herself into my arms, sobbing and weeping…She, however, recovered her composure as soon as we reached the street, and was very firm ever after.\"   \nGeorge supported his wife’s efforts to conceal Ellen Craft. Susan recalled her husband saying, \"I am perfectly willing to meeting the penalty, should [Ellen] be found here, but will never give her up.\"  \nWith the help of both the Hillards, Ellen and William Craft averted the slave catchers. \nFrom their unassuming home on Beacon Hill, George and Susan Hillard sheltered those on their journey to freedom. Evidence of 62 Pinckney Street’s Underground Railroad past gathered public attention decades after the Hillards lived here. According to a 1926 Boston Transcript article:  \n\"Only a few years ago, when some repairs were being made in the plastering of the ell, a well-concealed trap door in the ceiling of a closet unexpectedly dropped upon the head of a workman, revealing an unfinished space under the lean-to roof large enough to hold several human beings. This place was without windows, but it was ventilated in a measure by an opening into a shaft under a skylight. Recalling the tradition that this house had been a station on the ‘Underground’ in Mr. Hillard’s time the then owner had the place explored, with the result that two tin plates and two iron spoons were found on the floor. Were these the relics of the last meal ever served to fugitives under this roof?\"",

To learn more about the Haydens, we encourage you to take the Black Heritage Trail tour offered on the National Park Service App.\nA couple doors down you will come to 70 Phillips Street, the home of Elizabeth Riley. In February 1851, slave catchers arrested freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins and held him at the courthouse. Within hours, Black Bostonians, led by Lewis Hayden, rescued Minkins and brought him to Riley’s home where she sheltered him in her attic. According to Lewis Hayden, he and Black attorney Robert Morris:  \n“safely lodged him [Minkins] in the attic of a widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Riley, one of our race, whose fidelity and humanity we all fully confided in.'\"  \nThe Riley home also included 1 Southac Court, one of those tucked away alley dwellings so prevalent throughout Beacon Hill.  The famed freedom seeker Jane Johnson and her sons lived here beginning in 1856. The year prior, Johnson and her sons escaped their enslaver John Wheeler as they all traveled through Pennsylvania, a free state.  Johnson and her sons came to Boston to begin their new life in freedom.  She courageously returned to Philadelphia a few months later to testify against Wheeler.  \nAccording to the Liberator, when lawyers called Johnson to the stand:  \n\"The name was followed by a breathless silence and a buzz of incredulity…When Jane first appeared, he (Wheeler) laughed immoderately and nervously, then became deadly pale, and as the testimony went on, red and pale by turns. At last, he could bear it no longer, but picked up his hat and disappeared… \" \nJohnson then left the courtroom escorted by abolitionists as well as state and local authorities, who guarded her from the federal marshals and slave catchers. Having secured her own freedom, Johnson took in other freedoms seekers both at her home here on Southac Court and at her later Beacon Hill residences. \nDiagonally across and a little further down the street stands 81-83 Phillips Street. You will see a plaque indicating that on this site once stood the home of John Sweat Rock, a Black lawyer, doctor, dentist, and activist.  Rock not only provided medical care to freedom seekers, but also had a strong friendship with Harriet Tubman, the famous Underground Railroad conductor, who stayed at his home when in Boston. Two boardinghouses once stood here as well, operated by John R. Taylor and William Manix. Boston Vigilance Committee records show that both Taylor and Manix sheltered many freedom seekers at their boardinghouses, including Jane Johnson and her sons.   \nAs you walk back up the street, reflect upon these stories of bravery and resilience. And remember, they only provide a snapshot of the Underground Railroad history hidden in plain view here in the Lower Southac neighborhood.",

The Twelfth Baptist Church, known as the “Fugitive Slave’s Church,” once stood at this approximate site.  With many freedom seekers worshipping here, Twelfth Baptist Church became more than just a sacred space for its congregants. As an 1874 history of this church stated, \n\"[Twelfth Baptist] was the home of the oppressed, the vantage ground of the champions of human freedom. … The fugitive was never refused its shelter and protection... In short, this church became the vantage ground of the “new party;” the platform from which slavery was assailed most grandly and fearlessly.\"  \nReverend Leonard Grimes led this church for 25 years, during the height of the anti-slavery era. With the support of his congregants, Grimes played a critical role in Boston’s Underground Railroad.  \nGrimes became pastor of Twelfth Baptist in 1848, having moved to Boston several years prior.  Although he grew up free in Virginia, Grimes witnessed the horrors of slavery. He used his profession as a hackman, or carriage driver, to illegally transport freedom seekers. In 1840, Grimes was convicted and sentenced to two years of hard labor for helping an enslaved woman and her six children escape to Canada. While serving his sentence in Virginia, Grimes began preaching, which he continued to do once released. When he moved to Boston and became Reverend of Twelfth Baptist Church, Grimes used his position in the community to continue his support of freedom seekers.  \nAfter the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, more than forty congregants of Twelfth Baptist fled north out of fear of capture.

Lewis Hayden, who escaped slavery with his family and later became Boston’s most prominent Underground Railroad operative, ran his clothing shop on Cambridge Street.1 Many Black-owned businesses, including Hayden’s, also became important informal community centers, where activists came together, conversed, and planned their collective action.  Sometimes, these shops also served as safe houses and rendezvous points for freedom seekers escaping on the Underground Railroad.  \nWilliam Craft, who had escaped slavery with his wife Ellen and stayed with the Haydens for a time, established his cabinet making shop at 51 Cambridge Street, which is no longer standing.  In Boston’s first test of the new federal Fugitive Slave Law, slave catchers came looking for William and Ellen Craft in October 1850. Evading capture while his wife hid with the Hillards, William barricaded himself in his shop armed with two knives and several pistols. One reporter claimed: \n\"No man could approach within a hundred yards of Craft’s shop without being seen by a hundred eyes, and a signal would call a powerful body at a moment’s notice...\" \nAbolitionists, “armed to the teeth,” guarded the Crafts and thwarted the slave catchers at every turn. Fearful for their own safety, the slave catchers ultimately abandoned their plans to capture the Crafts and left the city. The Crafts fled to England, and eventually returned to the United States following the Civil War.",

                    "audioTranscript": "You are now in Bowdoin Square and the former site of the Revere House Hotel. This Hotel has unique ties to the Underground Railroad history of Boston. \nIn April 1850, Senator Daniel Webster, the famous statesman and orator from Massachusetts, arrived at the Revere House Hotel.  A month prior Webster delivered his infamous “Seventh of March” speech, throwing his full support behind the Compromise of 1850, a package of legislation that included the new Fugitive Slave Law. This law allowed slave catchers to apprehend freedom seekers without due process throughout the country, including free states, and it mandated the compliance of local and state authorities and the public at large. Facing strong backlash in Boston for his support of this law, Webster delivered a speech from the portico of the Revere House Hotel defending his stance as the way to ensure national unity. Standing on the front steps, Webster called upon Massachusetts residents to enforce this new law as their Constitutional duty, despite whatever “misguided” convictions they had.  \nOnce in effect, however, the Fugitive Slave Law drew slave catchers to Boston in search of freedom seekers believed to be residing in the area.  With its close proximity to the Black community on Beacon Hill, the Revere House Hotel provided enslavers and their agents a central and convenient place to lodge while they pursued freedom seekers living and working in the city.  \nFor example, in 1854, Col. Charles Suttle, the enslaver of Anthony Burns, tracked the young freedom seeker to Boston and stayed at the Revere House Hotel throughout the duration of the case. Abolitionists harassed Suttle from the moment he checked into the hotel.  Much like they did during the Craft case in 1850, activists kept a careful watch on Suttle and his colleagues and tried to impede them at every turn.  Suttle even had to relocate from the ground floor to an attic room at the hotel with armed guards due to credible death threats. \nThe Fugitive Slave Law galvanized Bostonians to embrace more brazen and militant tactics to protect those seeking their freedom in the city.",

This historic gathering space gained its reputation as the “Cradle of Liberty” from the meetings held here that helped inspire the American Revolution. However, it equally lived up to that nickname when considering its abolitionist and Underground Railroad history.\nBy the late 1830s, Boston abolitionists had begun regularly using Faneuil Hall to host their meetings and rallies. Oftentimes, they called these meetings to protest high profile fugitive slave cases in the city, encouraging supporters to help those in need and thwart the slave catchers. \nFor example, in 1842, authorities arrested freedom seeker George Latimer, which prompted major protests throughout the city. On October 30, abolitionists gathered in Faneuil Hall to call for action against Latimer’s arrest. Among other resolutions, the attendees declared: \n\"if the soul-traders and slave-drivers of the South imagine that Massachusetts is slave-hunting ground, on which they may run down their prey with impunity...they will find themselves mistaken.\"  \nThough Bostonians quickly purchased Latimer’s freedom, his case galvanized the abolitionist community. They soon gathered thousands of signatures for a petition that led to the passage of the 1843 Personal Liberty Act, which prevented state officials and facilities from supporting the capture of freedom seekers. \nA few years later, following the arrest of another freedom seeker in 1846, thousands of Bostonians once more gathered in the Hall in protest, with former president John Quincy Adams presiding over the meeting. Here they established a Vigilance Committee to assist those escaping from slavery on the Underground Railroad.  \nWith the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Bostonians flocked again to Faneuil Hall. At this meeting, the abolitionists expressed their outrage at the unjust and inhumane law. Abolitionist Caroline Dall attended this meeting and recorded her experience in her journal: \n\"I could not resist going to the meeting at Faneuil Hall in the evening. It was a grand meeting. There was but one feeling among the 6000 persons assembled there, and that was to trample this law under foot.\" \nBy the end of the meeting, those in attendance had established the final iteration of the Boston Vigilance Committee.

Lewis Hayden and other militant abolitionists heard about the arrest and decided to act. During the hearing, they stormed inside, overwhelmed the guards, and carried Minkins to the safety of Elisabeth Riley’s attic on Beacon Hill. Five days later he arrived in Montreal Canada where he lived free for the rest of his life. Rev. Theodore Parker later described the rescue of Minkins as  \n“the most noble deed done in Boston since the destruction of the tea in 1773.”  \nThe rescue of Minkins sparked outrage from federal officials. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, former senator from Massachusetts, referred to the rescue as “a case of treason.”  \nThe federal government responded by showing they could enforce the Fugitive Slave Law in Boston with the arrest of freedom seeker Thomas Sims a couple months later. After escaping from Georgia, Sims lived in a boarding house in the North End of Boston until his arrest in early April. Holding Sims in this courthouse, federal officials took the threat of another rescue seriously. Guards were stationed outside of the courthouse, a militia was garrisoned at Faneuil Hall, and the courthouse itself was draped in chains, while Sims was held captive in a third-floor room. Describing the excessive display of force, Abolitionist lawyer Richard Henry Dana wrote, \n“Our temple of justice is a slave pen!”  \nUndeterred, abolitionists hatched a plan to rescue Sims. They planned to place mattresses below the third story window where Sims was held so that he could jump to freedom. However, it appears officials heard of the plot and fixed iron bars to the window, thereby thwarting the plan. In the early morning of April 12, 1851, authorities marched Sims to Long Wharf and sent him back into slavery on the ship The Acorn.  \nThree years after the return of Thomas Sims, the eyes of the nation again turned to Boston with the arrest of 20-year-old freedom seeker Anthony Burns. Born in Virginia, Burns escaped to Boston via ship and worked at a local clothing store. After slave catchers arrested Burns in May 1854 and brought him to this courthouse, word of his arrest quickly spread. Anti-slavery activists called for a mass meeting at Faneuil Hall while a smaller group of White and Black militant abolitionists met at Tremont Temple.  \nDuring the Faneuil Hall meeting, the group from Tremont Temple began an assault on the courthouse to free Burns. Using a makeshift battering ram, abolitionists broke down the courthouse's door and began hand to hand fighting with federal marshals guarding Burns. The rescue attempt failed, but during the attack, an abolitionist fired a pistol, killing one of the deputies. \nIn the aftermath of the assault, federal troops, with permission from President Franklin Pierce, were brought in to guard the courthouse while Burns awaited his return into slavery.  \nMake your way to our next stop, the site of the Boston Massacre at the top of State Street, to hear more of Burns’ story.",

This wharf, the port, and the surrounding harbor strongly tie to the history of slavery in Boston, from the years of the slave trade to those of the Underground Railroad and emancipation.  \nDuring the colonial period, local merchants created vast amounts of wealth by trafficking enslaved individuals and trading goods consumed and produced by enslaved labor. Long Wharf served as one of the primary entry points for enslaved individuals into the colony. The Middle Passage Port Marker formally honors and remembers the Africans who died and those who endured the transatlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. It also recognizes the vital role that Africans and their descendants played in the development of both the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the United States. \nDuring the Underground Railroad years, Boston’s wharves became both an entry and departure point for freedom seekers. While those such as Thomas Sims and Anthony Burns were forcibly transported back into slavery through the Harbor, the wharves also welcomed freedom seekers as they took their first steps into a free state.  \nMany people, including Burns and Sims, had escaped southern slavery by stowing-away on ships bound for Boston. The Boston Vigilance Committee stood ready to help those individuals, by sending “Committees of Reception” to ships suspected to have stowaways aboard. These committees provided food, clothing, and crucial information to freedom seekers. Black women served as critical members of these committees since captains rarely perceived them as threats. As Vigilance Committee member Thomas Wentworth Higginson recalled,  \n\"The practice was to take along a colored woman with fresh fruit, pies, &c – she easily got on board & when there, usually found out if there was any fugitive on board; then he was sometimes taken away by night.\" \nCaptain Austin Bearse, another member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, provided aid to freedom seekers who came to Boston by sea. In one instance, Bearse learned of a stowaway on a ship docked near Castle Island, just south of Boston. Bearse sailed his boat up to the ship, but its captain immediately threatened violence if Bearse attempted to rescue the stowaway. Bearse returned here to Long Wharf to regroup. When he failed to find anyone to assist him, Bearse took bold action: \n\"Knowing it was daylight soon I had to lay a plot. I took a dozen old hats and coats and fastened them up to the rail in my yacht, which gave me the appearance of having so many men; I then went down back alongside the schooner again and told the captain I  had now come prepared, and he had better give up the fugitive and save bloodshed. After parleying a little while he agreed to put the slave in my boat.\" \nDue to Bearse’s cunning efforts, the freedom seeker successfully escaped to Canada. \nWhile those who made it to shore received assistance from Boston abolitionists, the journey proved grueling and demonstrates the strength of those who embarked on this difficult path to freedom. One of these courageous individuals was Elisabeth Blakeley, a freedom seeker from North Carolina. Fleeing a life of unimaginable horror in December of 1849, she snuck aboard a boat and hid herself in a narrow hole. Abolitionist Wendell Philips later shared her experience hiding aboard,  \n“she lay while her inhuman master, almost certain she was on board the vessel, called out to her, ‘you had better come out! I am going to smoke the vessel!’ She tells: I heard him call, but my mind was liberty or death.”\nWith her enslaver unable to find her, Blakeley hid aboard the ship for four weeks as it sailed north during the middle of winter. When Blakeley arrived in Boston in late January, she could barely stand because her feet were so badly frostbitten. The abolitionist community welcomed her and helped her begin her new life in freedom.  \n-- \nElisabeth Blakeley’s story, as well as the others you have heard on this tour, exemplify the immense courage and ingenuity of freedom seekers who escaped slavery and made their way to Boston on the Underground Railroad. These stories also highlight the various ways Boston activists sought to help them gain and maintain their freedom.  \nTogether, the freedom seekers and those who assisted them along their way, created a legacy of resilience, bravery, and sacrifice, that continues to inspire us today and encourages us to consider how we too can ensure a more just and freer world.",

Over the next twelve stops we will hear powerful stories of people who seized their freedom on the Underground Railroad and came to Boston. We will also learn about the activists and allies in this city who helped these freedom seekers along their way.\nWe will spend the first part of our tour on the north slope of Beacon Hill, home to Boston’s free Black neighborhood. Members of this community came together to provide a safe-haven and support for many freedom seekers.\nWe will then walk downtown where many Beacon Hill activists joined other Bostonians to engage in high profile protests and rescues.  \nWe will end our tour near the waterfront, which served as an entry point for so many freedom seekers on the Underground Railroad.      \nBear in mind, Boston’s Underground Railroad history is expansive. No tour, including this one, can claim to be all encompassing. Rather, we hope to shed light on some of the lesser-known stories, not already featured on our other tours, including the Black Heritage Trail, which you can find on the National Park Service app as well.    \nLet’s get started. \nOur tour begins here on Smith Court, an integral center of Black life and activism in 1800s Boston. The African Meeting House, the three story-brick building with tall arched windows, served as a church, schoolroom, and gathering space for the community. Here, Underground Railroad activists planned how they were going to help those escaping slavery. For example, in the early 1840s, Black Bostonians formed the New England Freedom Association which held their meetings here.  According to William Cooper Nell, one of the leaders of this group: \n\"The object of our Association is to extend a helping hand to all who may bid adieu to whips and chains, and by the welcome light of the North Star, reach a haven where they can be protected from the grasp of the man-stealer… \"\nGroups such as the New England Freedom Association, and later the Boston Vigilance Committee, provided funds, clothing, food, information, and other assistance to the freedom seekers coming to and through Boston on the Underground Railroad. \nIn 1850, the federal government enacted a harsh new Fugitive Slave Law that allowed slave catchers to roam free states in search of runaways and mandated the assistance of state and local authorities, as well as the public, in returning freedom seekers to slavery.  Soon after, Black Bostonians rallied here at the African Meeting House to plan their collective response. Lewis Hayden, Boston’s most prominent Underground Railroad leader presided. One activist, Joshua B. Smith, militantly claimed, “If liberty is not worth fighting for, it is not worth having” and encouraged his listeners to arm themselves against the slave catchers...For as Smith said, “When he could not live here in Boston, A FREEMAN...’He had lived long enough.”\nDirectly across from the African Meeting House stands 3 Smith Court, the yellow house. According to the records of the Boston Vigilance Committee, Black activist and clothing dealer James Scott sheltered several freedom seekers here in the 1850s, as did William Cooper Nell, another prominent Underground Railroad operative, who also boarded here. Authorities arrested, tried, but did not convict Scott for his alleged role in leading the successful courthouse rescue of freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins in 1851.   \nSmith Court also witnessed a dramatic Underground Railroad confrontation in 1847.  A slave catcher attempted to capture Mrs. Dorsey, a freedom seeker, in her home at the end of Smith Court. Black activist Nancy Prince hurried to the scene, grappled with the slave catcher, and threw him out of the house.  She then rallied the women and children who gathered during the commotion and got them to hurl stones and anything else they could find at the slave catcher, running him out of the neighborhood.   \nBefore we move on to our next stop, we encourage you to take a walk to the rear of Smith Court.  Look right and left, up and down the alley. See how tightly packed these little hidden homes and neighborhoods are.  These densely crowded streets and tucked away alleys and houses served as temporary homes and safe havens for so many freedom seekers fleeing slavery on the Underground Railroad.",

Two of these allies, George and Susan Hillard, used their status and privilege to shelter several freedom seekers at their home here at 62 Pinckney Street.\nAt first glance, George Hillard did not appear to be the typical ally of the Underground Railroad. Although a former law partner to the radical abolitionist Charles Sumner and generally in favor of racial equality, George Hillard opposed the more radical abolitionist calls to end slavery immediately. As a federal commissioner, Hillard also had to uphold the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, which had strict consequences for those aiding freedom seekers. \nSusan Hillard, unlike her husband, was a staunch abolitionist and used George's political cover to hide freedom seekers in their home throughout the 1850s. Records document the Hillard home as a safe house for at least five freedom seekers during this time. While it is unclear how much George knew of Susan’s ongoing Underground Railroad activities, he likely had some awareness and either did not interfere, or quietly supported her efforts. \nThe Hillards most notably sheltered freedom seeker Ellen Craft in October 1850 when slave catchers tracked her and her husband William to Boston. Upon hearing the news of the slave catchers’ arrival, Susan Hillard found Ellen Craft in a home on Mt. Vernon Street, the next street over. Susan acted immediately:  \n\"I proposed to Ellen to come and do some work for me, intending not to alarm her. My manner, which I supposed to be indifferent and calm, betrayed me, and she threw herself into my arms, sobbing and weeping…She, however, recovered her composure as soon as we reached the street, and was very firm ever after.\"   \nGeorge supported his wife’s efforts to conceal Ellen Craft. Susan recalled her husband saying, \"I am perfectly willing to meeting the penalty, should [Ellen] be found here, but will never give her up.\"  \nWith the help of both the Hillards, Ellen and William Craft averted the slave catchers. \nFrom their unassuming home on Beacon Hill, George and Susan Hillard sheltered those on their journey to freedom. Evidence of 62 Pinckney Street’s Underground Railroad past gathered public attention decades after the Hillards lived here. According to a 1926 Boston Transcript article:  \n\"Only a few years ago, when some repairs were being made in the plastering of the ell, a well-concealed trap door in the ceiling of a closet unexpectedly dropped upon the head of a workman, revealing an unfinished space under the lean-to roof large enough to hold several human beings. This place was without windows, but it was ventilated in a measure by an opening into a shaft under a skylight. Recalling the tradition that this house had been a station on the ‘Underground’ in Mr. Hillard’s time the then owner had the place explored, with the result that two tin plates and two iron spoons were found on the floor. Were these the relics of the last meal ever served to fugitives under this roof?\"",

The Haydens, who fled slavery themselves, sheltered scores of freedom seekers, including William and Ellen Craft. To learn more about the Haydens, we encourage you to take the Black Heritage Trail tour offered on the National Park Service App.\nA couple doors down you will come to 70 Phillips Street, the home of Elizabeth Riley. In February 1851, slave catchers arrested freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins and held him at the courthouse. Within hours, Black Bostonians, led by Lewis Hayden, rescued Minkins and brought him to Riley’s home where she sheltered him in her attic. According to Lewis Hayden, he and Black attorney Robert Morris:  \n“safely lodged him [Minkins] in the attic of a widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Riley, one of our race, whose fidelity and humanity we all fully confided in.'\"  \nThe Riley home also included 1 Southac Court, one of those tucked away alley dwellings so prevalent throughout Beacon Hill.  The famed freedom seeker Jane Johnson and her sons lived here beginning in 1856. The year prior, Johnson and her sons escaped their enslaver John Wheeler as they all traveled through Pennsylvania, a free state.  Johnson and her sons came to Boston to begin their new life in freedom.  She courageously returned to Philadelphia a few months later to testify against Wheeler.  \nAccording to the Liberator, when lawyers called Johnson to the stand:  \n\"The name was followed by a breathless silence and a buzz of incredulity…When Jane first appeared, he (Wheeler) laughed immoderately and nervously, then became deadly pale, and as the testimony went on, red and pale by turns. At last, he could bear it no longer, but picked up his hat and disappeared… \" \nJohnson then left the courtroom escorted by abolitionists as well as state and local authorities, who guarded her from the federal marshals and slave catchers. Having secured her own freedom, Johnson took in other freedoms seekers both at her home here on Southac Court and at her later Beacon Hill residences. \nDiagonally across and a little further down the street stands 81-83 Phillips Street. You will see a plaque indicating that on this site once stood the home of John Sweat Rock, a Black lawyer, doctor, dentist, and activist.  Rock not only provided medical care to freedom seekers, but also had a strong friendship with Harriet Tubman, the famous Underground Railroad conductor, who stayed at his home when in Boston. Two boardinghouses once stood here as well, operated by John R. Taylor and William Manix. Boston Vigilance Committee records show that both Taylor and Manix sheltered many freedom seekers at their boardinghouses, including Jane Johnson and her sons.   \nAs you walk back up the street, reflect upon these stories of bravery and resilience. And remember, they only provide a snapshot of the Underground Railroad history hidden in plain view here in the Lower Southac neighborhood.",

The Twelfth Baptist Church, known as the “Fugitive Slave’s Church,” once stood at this approximate site.  With many freedom seekers worshipping here, Twelfth Baptist Church became more than just a sacred space for its congregants. As an 1874 history of this church stated, \n\"[Twelfth Baptist] was the home of the oppressed, the vantage ground of the champions of human freedom. … The fugitive was never refused its shelter and protection... In short, this church became the vantage ground of the “new party;” the platform from which slavery was assailed most grandly and fearlessly.\"  \nReverend Leonard Grimes led this church for 25 years, during the height of the anti-slavery era. With the support of his congregants, Grimes played a critical role in Boston’s Underground Railroad.  \nGrimes became pastor of Twelfth Baptist in 1848, having moved to Boston several years prior.  Although he grew up free in Virginia, Grimes witnessed the horrors of slavery. He used his profession as a hackman, or carriage driver, to illegally transport freedom seekers. In 1840, Grimes was convicted and sentenced to two years of hard labor for helping an enslaved woman and her six children escape to Canada. While serving his sentence in Virginia, Grimes began preaching, which he continued to do once released. When he moved to Boston and became Reverend of Twelfth Baptist Church, Grimes used his position in the community to continue his support of freedom seekers.  \nAfter the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, more than forty congregants of Twelfth Baptist fled north out of fear of capture. Grimes raised money to pay for many of these individuals’ freedoms and supported many more freedom seekers on their journey.  \nGrimes played a role in almost every major fugitive slave case in Boston in the 1850s, as some of these freedom seekers, including Shadrach Minkins and Anthony Burns, worshipped at Twelfth Baptist.  \nWhen Grimes passed away in 1873, The Boston Globe printed,  \n“It was credibly stated that [Grimes] had been instrumental in enabling four hundred persons of his own race to escape from Southern bondage.”   \nToday, there is a plaque at the site of Leonard Grimes’ home at 28 Grove Street, near the intersection of Grove and Phillips Streets, just steps away from where you stand.

                    "audioTranscript": "Here at 5 Phillips Street once stood the home of Henry Thacker, a prominent Black caterer and activist. His home is also a site of one heart-warming Underground Railroad reunion.   \nIn 1847, Thacker aided George and Lizzie Lewis, a father and daughter who escaped from slavery.  Forced to separate on their journey north, Lizzie came to Boston and stayed at Thacker’s home.  George, on the other hand, went to Albany, New York.  While there, George met a Black crew member of a ship from Boston who told him that he had met Lizzie and that she was staying “at Mr. Thacker’s in Southac Street.”  Reverend Leonard Grimes, who we just heard about, went to Albany and assured George that his daughter was safe and well in Boston with the Thackers.  Soon after, Austin Bearse, a ship captain and member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, brought George to the city. According to Bearse, when they reached the city, a fellow abolitionist took them to this street:  \n\"…and while we were looking for the number of the house, I heard some one say, “Well, there’s father!” We turned to look, and it was indeed Lizzie calling “Father!”\"  \nYou stand today where father and daughter finally reunited.  Imagine the flood of emotions that took place in that personal and powerful moment here on that day.  \nAcross the street lived Joshua Bowen Smith, the militant abolitionist we heard from in the first stop at the African Meeting House.  Henry Thacker employed Smith in his catering business before Smith set out on his own and soon established himself as the “Prince of Caterers.” In this high-profile position, Smith was able to keep a careful watch out for slave catchers. He also employed and assisted numerous freedom seekers as a member of both the Boston Vigilance Committee and the New England Freedom Association.  \nHere on Southac Street, Smith lived with fellow activist and New England Freedom Association member John Coburn, who was arrested for “aiding and abetting” the successful rescue of freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins from the Boston courthouse in 1851.

Today, this is a bustling city street full of businesses, restaurants, hotels, as well as Massachusetts General Hospital. Cambridge Street of the mid-1800s, however, was narrower and still somewhat residential. Black porter Burrill Smith lived at 168 Cambridge Street. Not only did Smith shelter freedom seekers in his boardinghouse, but he also hosted famed Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman during some of her early visits to Boston.\nIn addition to the residences here, Cambridge Street served as a hub of Black-owned businesses. Lewis Hayden, who escaped slavery with his family and later became Boston’s most prominent Underground Railroad operative, ran his clothing shop on Cambridge Street.1 Many Black-owned businesses, including Hayden’s, also became important informal community centers, where activists came together, conversed, and planned their collective action.  Sometimes, these shops also served as safe houses and rendezvous points for freedom seekers escaping on the Underground Railroad.  \nWilliam Craft, who had escaped slavery with his wife Ellen and stayed with the Haydens for a time, established his cabinet making shop at 51 Cambridge Street, which is no longer standing.  In Boston’s first test of the new federal Fugitive Slave Law, slave catchers came looking for William and Ellen Craft in October 1850. Evading capture while his wife hid with the Hillards, William barricaded himself in his shop armed with two knives and several pistols. One reporter claimed: \n\"No man could approach within a hundred yards of Craft’s shop without being seen by a hundred eyes, and a signal would call a powerful body at a moment’s notice...\" \nAbolitionists, “armed to the teeth,” guarded the Crafts and thwarted the slave catchers at every turn. Fearful for their own safety, the slave catchers ultimately abandoned their plans to capture the Crafts and left the city.

                    "audioTranscript": "You are now in Bowdoin Square and the former site of the Revere House Hotel. This Hotel has unique ties to the Underground Railroad history of Boston. \nIn April 1850, Senator Daniel Webster, the famous statesman and orator from Massachusetts, arrived at the Revere House Hotel.  A month prior Webster delivered his infamous “Seventh of March” speech, throwing his full support behind the Compromise of 1850, a package of legislation that included the new Fugitive Slave Law. This law allowed slave catchers to apprehend freedom seekers without due process throughout the country, including free states, and it mandated the compliance of local and state authorities and the public at large. Facing strong backlash in Boston for his support of this law, Webster delivered a speech from the portico of the Revere House Hotel defending his stance as the way to ensure national unity. Standing on the front steps, Webster called upon Massachusetts residents to enforce this new law as their Constitutional duty, despite whatever “misguided” convictions they had.  \nOnce in effect, however, the Fugitive Slave Law drew slave catchers to Boston in search of freedom seekers believed to be residing in the area.  With its close proximity to the Black community on Beacon Hill, the Revere House Hotel provided enslavers and their agents a central and convenient place to lodge while they pursued freedom seekers living and working in the city.  \nFor example, in 1854, Col. Charles Suttle, the enslaver of Anthony Burns, tracked the young freedom seeker to Boston and stayed at the Revere House Hotel throughout the duration of the case. Abolitionists harassed Suttle from the moment he checked into the hotel.  Much like they did during the Craft case in 1850, activists kept a careful watch on Suttle and his colleagues and tried to impede them at every turn.  Suttle even had to relocate from the ground floor to an attic room at the hotel with armed guards due to credible death threats. \nThe Fugitive Slave Law galvanized Bostonians to embrace more brazen and militant tactics to protect those seeking their freedom in the city.",

Their first and most earnest desire is for employment…Cannot you find… one or more places where the hunted slave may abide securely, and work through the winter? … Many of the fugitives come very poorly provided with clothing; and those who have garments of any kind to spare, will be sure to confer them on the suffering and needy by sending them, marked 'For fugitives,' at 21 Cornhill... \"\nWhen freedom seekers arrived in Boston, they knew they could find support and aid at The Liberator office.

This historic gathering space gained its reputation as the “Cradle of Liberty” from the meetings held here that helped inspire the American Revolution.

Oftentimes, they called these meetings to protest high profile fugitive slave cases in the city, encouraging supporters to help those in need and thwart the slave catchers. \nFor example, in 1842, authorities arrested freedom seeker George Latimer, which prompted major protests throughout the city. On October 30, abolitionists gathered in Faneuil Hall to call for action against Latimer’s arrest. Among other resolutions, the attendees declared: \n\"if the soul-traders and slave-drivers of the South imagine that Massachusetts is slave-hunting ground, on which they may run down their prey with impunity...they will find themselves mistaken.\"  \nThough Bostonians quickly purchased Latimer’s freedom, his case galvanized the abolitionist community. They soon gathered thousands of signatures for a petition that led to the passage of the 1843 Personal Liberty Act, which prevented state officials and facilities from supporting the capture of freedom seekers. \nA few years later, following the arrest of another freedom seeker in 1846, thousands of Bostonians once more gathered in the Hall in protest, with former president John Quincy Adams presiding over the meeting. Here they established a Vigilance Committee to assist those escaping from slavery on the Underground Railroad.  \nWith the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Bostonians flocked again to Faneuil Hall. At this meeting, the abolitionists expressed their outrage at the unjust and inhumane law. Abolitionist Caroline Dall attended this meeting and recorded her experience in her journal: \n\"I could not resist going to the meeting at Faneuil Hall in the evening. It was a grand meeting. There was but one feeling among the 6000 persons assembled there, and that was to trample this law under foot.\" \nBy the end of the meeting, those in attendance had established the final iteration of the Boston Vigilance Committee.

Lewis Hayden and other militant abolitionists heard about the arrest and decided to act. During the hearing, they stormed inside, overwhelmed the guards, and carried Minkins to the safety of Elisabeth Riley’s attic on Beacon Hill. Five days later he arrived in Montreal Canada where he lived free for the rest of his life. Rev. Theodore Parker later described the rescue of Minkins as  \n“the most noble deed done in Boston since the destruction of the tea in 1773.”  \nThe rescue of Minkins sparked outrage from federal officials. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, former senator from Massachusetts, referred to the rescue as “a case of treason.”  \nThe federal government responded by showing they could enforce the Fugitive Slave Law in Boston with the arrest of freedom seeker Thomas Sims a couple months later. After escaping from Georgia, Sims lived in a boarding house in the North End of Boston until his arrest in early April. Holding Sims in this courthouse, federal officials took the threat of another rescue seriously. Guards were stationed outside of the courthouse, a militia was garrisoned at Faneuil Hall, and the courthouse itself was draped in chains, while Sims was held captive in a third-floor room. Describing the excessive display of force, Abolitionist lawyer Richard Henry Dana wrote, \n“Our temple of justice is a slave pen!”  \nUndeterred, abolitionists hatched a plan to rescue Sims. They planned to place mattresses below the third story window where Sims was held so that he could jump to freedom. However, it appears officials heard of the plot and fixed iron bars to the window, thereby thwarting the plan. In the early morning of April 12, 1851, authorities marched Sims to Long Wharf and sent him back into slavery on the ship The Acorn.  \nThree years after the return of Thomas Sims, the eyes of the nation again turned to Boston with the arrest of 20-year-old freedom seeker Anthony Burns. Born in Virginia, Burns escaped to Boston via ship and worked at a local clothing store. After slave catchers arrested Burns in May 1854 and brought him to this courthouse, word of his arrest quickly spread. Anti-slavery activists called for a mass meeting at Faneuil Hall while a smaller group of White and Black militant abolitionists met at Tremont Temple.  \nDuring the Faneuil Hall meeting, the group from Tremont Temple began an assault on the courthouse to free Burns. Using a makeshift battering ram, abolitionists broke down the courthouse's door and began hand to hand fighting with federal marshals guarding Burns. The rescue attempt failed, but during the attack, an abolitionist fired a pistol, killing one of the deputies. \nIn the aftermath of the assault, federal troops, with permission from President Franklin Pierce, were brought in to guard the courthouse while Burns awaited his return into slavery.  \nMake your way to our next stop, the site of the Boston Massacre at the top of State Street, to hear more of Burns’ story.",

                    "audioTranscript": "You are currently standing at the end of Long Wharf, the last stop of this tour. This wharf, the port, and the surrounding harbor strongly tie to the history of slavery in Boston, from the years of the slave trade to those of the Underground Railroad and emancipation.  \nDuring the colonial period, local merchants created vast amounts of wealth by trafficking enslaved individuals and trading goods consumed and produced by enslaved labor. Long Wharf served as one of the primary entry points for enslaved individuals into the colony. The Middle Passage Port Marker formally honors and remembers the Africans who died and those who endured the transatlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. It also recognizes the vital role that Africans and their descendants played in the development of both the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the United States. \nDuring the Underground Railroad years, Boston’s wharves became both an entry and departure point for freedom seekers. While those such as Thomas Sims and Anthony Burns were forcibly transported back into slavery through the Harbor, the wharves also welcomed freedom seekers as they took their first steps into a free state.  \nMany people, including Burns and Sims, had escaped southern slavery by stowing-away on ships bound for Boston. The Boston Vigilance Committee stood ready to help those individuals, by sending “Committees of Reception” to ships suspected to have stowaways aboard. These committees provided food, clothing, and crucial information to freedom seekers. Black women served as critical members of these committees since captains rarely perceived them as threats. As Vigilance Committee member Thomas Wentworth Higginson recalled,  \n\"The practice was to take along a colored woman with fresh fruit, pies, &c – she easily got on board & when there, usually found out if there was any fugitive on board; then he was sometimes taken away by night.\" \nCaptain Austin Bearse, another member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, provided aid to freedom seekers who came to Boston by sea. In one instance, Bearse learned of a stowaway on a ship docked near Castle Island, just south of Boston. Bearse sailed his boat up to the ship, but its captain immediately threatened violence if Bearse attempted to rescue the stowaway. Bearse returned here to Long Wharf to regroup. When he failed to find anyone to assist him, Bearse took bold action: \n\"Knowing it was daylight soon I had to lay a plot. I took a dozen old hats and coats and fastened them up to the rail in my yacht, which gave me the appearance of having so many men; I then went down back alongside the schooner again and told the captain I  had now come prepared, and he had better give up the fugitive and save bloodshed. After parleying a little while he agreed to put the slave in my boat.\" \nDue to Bearse’s cunning efforts, the freedom seeker successfully escaped to Canada. \nWhile those who made it to shore received assistance from Boston abolitionists, the journey proved grueling and demonstrates the strength of those who embarked on this difficult path to freedom. One of these courageous individuals was Elisabeth Blakeley, a freedom seeker from North Carolina. Fleeing a life of unimaginable horror in December of 1849, she snuck aboard a boat and hid herself in a narrow hole. Abolitionist Wendell Philips later shared her experience hiding aboard,  \n“she lay while her inhuman master, almost certain she was on board the vessel, called out to her, ‘you had better come out! I am going to smoke the vessel!’ She tells: I heard him call, but my mind was liberty or death.”\nWith her enslaver unable to find her, Blakeley hid aboard the ship for four weeks as it sailed north during the middle of winter. When Blakeley arrived in Boston in late January, she could barely stand because her feet were so badly frostbitten. The abolitionist community welcomed her and helped her begin her new life in freedom.  \n-- \nElisabeth Blakeley’s story, as well as the others you have heard on this tour, exemplify the immense courage and ingenuity of freedom seekers who escaped slavery and made their way to Boston on the Underground Railroad. These stories also highlight the various ways Boston activists sought to help them gain and maintain their freedom.  \nTogether, the freedom seekers and those who assisted them along their way, created a legacy of resilience, bravery, and sacrifice, that continues to inspire us today and encourages us to consider how we too can ensure a more just and freer world.",

After doing reconnaissance with Maj. Gen. Thomas, Captain Henry Stone writes that what is today known as Cheatham Hill was finally selected 'more because the lines were nearer each other than because the enemy's lines seemed vulnerable' They were roughly 600 yards away from the Confederate line here.

Colonel Dan would be at the forefront of the assault with men from his old regiment, the 52nd Ohio infantry. In the minutes before the fateful action, Colonel Dan would recite a section from Thomas Macaulay’s 1842 poem ‘Horatius’ to his men. “Then out spake brave Horatius, the captain of the gate: To every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late.

                    "audioTranscript": "The attack on the Confederate position was designed to be a heavy frontal assault. Two brigades were to charge up this very hill in order to break through the earthworks at the top. The obstacles for the Union soldiers were immense. The earthworks at the crest stood up to 8 feet tall and were topped with head logs that protected the Rebels behind them. In addition to that, the Confederates had placed a series of formidable field fortifications directly in the Union path. Colonel Alan Fahnestock of the 86th Illinois infantry describes the scene: “They had logs with sharp sticks through the log like hay racks (called Chevalle de Frise), the ends bound together with wire”. These defenses, along with cleverly hidden Confederate artillery, causes the Union assault to falter, and then to stop completely. The fighting at the crest of the hill just ahead became some of the bloodiest and violent of the entire battle. Confederate soldier Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry writes “Yet still the Yankees came. It seemed impossible to check the onslaught… a solid line of blazing fire right from the muzzles of the Yankee guns being poured right into our very faces, singeing our hair and clothes, the hot blood of our dead and wounded spurting on us, the blinding smoke and stifling atmosphere filling our eyes and mouths, and the awful concussion causing the blood to gush out of our noses and ears, and above all, the roar of battle, made it perfect pandemonium… Hell had broke loose in Georgia sure enough.”",

He writes “Our brave Colonel urging his men on, was struck as he said ‘Come on boys, the day is won,’ as he reached the earthwork. He was shot about 4 inches below the collar bone, in the right breast, falling outside of the fortifications.” McCook was believed to have been wounded in close vicinity to this location. After his wound, he would be carried to the rear of the action. He was then transported back to his home in Ohio, where he died on July 17th, 1864.

The young soldier fell near this location during the battle. One of his comrades, Lieutenant Randalph Marshall would take on the difficult duty of notifying Sgt. Coffey’s mother with a letter written after the battle. He writes: “I felt it a duty for some weeks to write you indeed I should have done so soon after the death of your son, but the task seemed one of so delicate a character, that I have deferred it till now… That he fell like a brave solider, gallantly fighting in defense of his country, and for the most sacred rights of man, needs no assurance from me. The united testimony from his commander as to his courage, consistency, and patriotic devotion to his country is in conclusion evidence of the esteem in which he was held by them. …Copernicus was my messmate in many campaign, he and myself have messed and slept together and especially on this last one he and I shared the same tent and bed. On the morning of the 27th of June, we rose from our bed beneath our shelter tent and after breakfasting filled our knapsacks and started to the fatal charge. …He fell gloriously on the field. I miss him much and shall ever cherish his memory as a faithful and true friend. I know the pang of your sorrow and distress felt by his mother, whom he loved and revered.”",

He was perceived as smart, capable, and brave by his men and his superiors. Gen. O.O. Howard said of Harker “The only complaint I ever heard was that if Harker got started against the enemy, he could not be kept back… Whenever anything difficult was to be done, anything that required pluck and energy, we called on Gen. Harker.” Harker’s 3rd brigade of seven regiments was ordered to charge this section of the Confederate works. In the early morning hours of the 27th, Harker was seen sealing and finishing up several letters home. In what was noted as potentially an eerie premonition, Harker gave a member of his staff his personal papers and said “I shall not come out of the charge today alive”. A few hours later, while at the front of the charge and urging his men forward, a bullet tears through his arm and enters his chest. He would fall near this spot. A private from Illinois would later write “Several of the men nearest him spang up to carry him off the field; of these some were struck down at once, but others filled their places.” A surgeon would declare his wound fatal and Gen. Harker would die by 1:00 pm later that day.",

Originally the Kennesaw Memorial Association, a veteran’s association, tried to raise funds for the monument, the state of Illinois would provide $20,000.00 to fund the construction of a monument and a gubernatorial appointed commission to oversee the project.\nJames Dibelka was chosen as the architect and J. Mario Korbel as the sculptor for the monument. The McNeel Marble Company of Marietta, Georgia erected the monument. The monument stands 25 feet high and is made of Georgia white marble. An American eagle sets atop the monument and life-size figures of a Union soldier at parade rest is flanked by two Grecian women representing “peace” and either “victory” or the State of Illinois stands on its front edifice. The final project costed $25,000.00; however, it would include the placement of the additional markers of the McCook Brigade marker, Neighbour marker, Fellows marker, Coffee marker, and the stone arch marking the tunnel dug to undermine the Confederate earthworks.\nThe monument was restored the fall of 2013 through spring of 2014.

While many of the other soldiers who perished here were reinterred in soldier's cemetaries, this young man's remains were missed. They were discovered in the trenches near this location in early 1934 by the Work's Progress Administration (WPA) as part of a trail building project. His remains were moved to this current location in order to be closer to the trail. A ceremony was held to honor his service and memory on July 1st, 1934 and his casket was lowered into the grave draped in both a U.S and Confederate flag. His grave sits directly in between in what was both the Union and Confederate lines.\n\nFrom an exerpt reflecting on the 'Unknown' by Walt Whitman: \"And everywhere among these countless graves - everywhere in the many Soldiers Cemeteries of the Nation ... - as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories of slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles - not only where the scathing trail pass'd those years, but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land - we see, and see, and ages yet may see, on monuments and gravestones, singly or in massess, to thousands or tens of thousands, the significant word..

In 1845, her people moved upstream and built Like-a-fishhook village, which they shared with the Mandan and Arikara. There Buffalo Bird Woman grew up to become an expert in traditional Hidatsa gardening. \n\nMapi (Sunflower)\n“Usually we planted sunflowers only around the edges of a field. We thought a field surrounded thus by a sparse sown row of sunflowers, has a handsome appearance.”\n\nAma’ca (Beans) \n“In the spring, when I came to plant beans, I was careful to select seeds for the following points: seed should be fully ripe…plump, and good size.” \n\nKo’xati (Corn) \n“We knew when corn planting time came by observing the leaves of the wild gooseberry bushes. This is the first of the woods to leaf in the spring.”\n\nKuku’l (Squash)\n“We had a reason for planting the squash seeds in the side of a hill. If we planted them in level ground the rains would beat down the soil …but if we planted the sprouts on the side of the hill, the water from the rains would flow over them and keep the soil soft.” \nBuffalo Bird Woman’s Garden\n\nAs you walk further north there is a Drying Stage on the right. the description below for a Watchers' stage is similar to the Drying Stage.  \n\n\"A watchers' stage was not hard to build. Four posts, forked at the tops, upheld beams, on which was laid a floor of puncheons, or split small logs, at the height of the full grown corn. The floor was about four feet long by three wide, roomy enough for two girls to sit together comfortably. Often a soft robe was spread on the floor. A ladder made of the trunk of a tree rested against the stage. The latter had three steps.\" Wilson, Waheenee\n\nWayside: Drying Stages \n\"A corn drying stage stood before every lodge.\"\nBuffalo Bird woman's Garden\n\n\"By far the chief use of the drying stage was to dry vegetables, especially our corn and sliced squashes. Firewood, collected from the Missouri in the June rise [flood], was often piled on and under the stage floor to dry.\" \n\"The keepers of the O'kipa ceremony used to bring out their buffalo head masks, and air them on the drying stage that stood before their lodge door.\"\nBuffalo Bird Woman's Garden",

Home to the Awatixa, a Hidatsa subgroup, this lively village covered an area of about 10 acres and contained at least 51 earthlodges. An estimate of 500-600 people lived in the village, 10 to 30 per lodge. The Hidatsa oral tradition state the Awatixa subgroup claim no other homeland other than the region along the Missouri near the Knife River.\n\nThe Awatixa also state they were here long before Hidatsa proper and Awaxawi, another Hidatsa subgroup, arrived. Many generations lived in Awatixa Xi’e Village, Lower Hidatsa. They farmed, gathered and hunted food.They were devout in their beliefs and incorporated their spirituality in everything they did. They gave freely, food and clothing, to all in need and no one in the village ever went hungry.\n\nThis area was a major trading center, like a modern-day mall. People came from far and wide to trade goods. The corn and Knife River flint were the best-selling items. One could also trade beads, horses, produce, meats, hides, bison robes, beaded clothing for anything you wanted if you could negotiate a fair trade.\n\nWayside: Awatixa Xi'e Village  (Ah-wah-TEE-Khah) (Eh) \nCircles in the Earth\nYou are at the Edge of the large village of earthlodges. When the dwellings collapsed, they left circular mounds of earth around hardened, saucer-like floors. From that pattern you can picture the extent of this village and speculate about the number of inhabitants. \n\nThe bowl-shaped earthlodge depressions are surprisingly close together, leaving barely enough room for corn-drying scaffolds between dwellings. On sprawling prairie this crowded design suggests a close-knit social structure or the need for protection against marauding tribes. \nSketch of an unfinished earthlodge wooden framework. These earthlodges measure thirty to sixty feet in diameter-large enough for an extended family of five of their best horses. At least five inches of earth covered a wooden framework of rafters and support posts. \nPhoto: Arial view of Lower Hidatsa\nFifty-one earthlodge depressions are clearly visible from the air. According to archeological evidence, people occupied the site for centuries before the Awatixa built this village. They abandoned it after the smallpox epidemic in 1780, but later returned and built a new village at the river's edge.",

Because of the speed smallpox spread throughout the village, it led to so many deaths and due to the horrific nature of smallpox they were unable to give there loved ones their customary funeral rites.",
                    "audioTranscript": " The North American smallpox epidemic from 1775–1782 overall death toll was estimated at 130,000; However, it is believed that many more Native Americans died than was accounted for. Lewis and Clark remarked in 1804 that the population was substantially less than reports before the epidemic.\n\n “Beginning in October, as the expedition made its way through present northern South Dakota, it passed numerous abandoned villages, composed of earth-lodge dwellings and cultivated fields. Some of the fields, although unattended, still had squash and corn growing in them. These had once been home to the mighty Arikara tribe. About thirty thousand persons strong in the year the United States won its independence, the tribe had been reduced by smallpox epidemics in the 1780’s to not much more than one-fifth that size. … What had been eighteen villages the previous year had been reduced to three by the time Lewis arrived.” (Ambrose, 178)\n\n Because of the smallpox epidemic in 1781, the Awatixa had to abandon Lower Hidatsa village. Some survivors moved to other surrounding villages, but most went north to Rock Village (near where the Garrison Dam is today).\n\nWayside: Middens\nTo imagine these people's daily lives, consider their trash. Molehill-like mounds two to four feet high near the village edge are middens or garbage heaps packed with broken pottery, bone tools, and flacked stone. Shattered buffalo bones are the most frequent objects archeologists have unearthed there.\nThough agrarian and river-based, the Awatixa (Ah-Wah-TEE-Khah) still depended on bison for meat, hides, and bone tools. Hunters brought back the butchered bison, and villagers crushed the large leg bones to extract marrow fat for grease.\nPhoto 1: Bison hunt, from a painting by Karl Bodmer\nPhoto 2 of Archeological cross-section of a midden. By focusing on everyday debris, you can begin to picture village activity yet miss the rich ceremonial life.

                    "audioTranscript": "Welcome to the self-guided tour of Totem Trail!\nThe Indigenous people of the Northwest Coast created a unique style of art for their totem poles called formline to establish the main design units. This curving, swelling line creates three-dimensional shapes using three elements: the ovoid, the “U,” and the “S.” When painted, black is used on accented areas such as pupils and eyebrows. Red is used on lips, nostrils, and bodies. Bluegreen is used in eye sockets and two-dimensional areas. \nFigures on poles include Eagles with short, pointed beaks and talons; Ravens with longer flat beaks and “ears;” Bears with a short snout, round ears, and flared nostrils; Wolves with a narrow face, tall ears, and long snout; Frogs have large eyes, a wide mouth, and small nostrils. Some poles include humans, animals in human form, or a person with a tall hat on the tops of poles called a “Watchman.” Some of figures may represent clans or crests. \nClans are powerful social units divided into two moieties or groups (the Eagle and the Raven). They play an important role in creating and raising totem poles. Crests are animals or objects exclusively associated with a particular clan. \n (Image: Map of Prince of Wales Island with villages highlighted) The majority of the 16 historic poles come from Kagaini Haida territory, south of Sitka. They were obtained around 1903 by Alaska’s territorial governor John Brady for the 1904 St. Louis Exposition and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition. Upon return to Alaska, they were displayed in what is now known as Sitka National Historical Park. \nThe original locations and donors of the poles are mostly known, but their original meanings were either not documented or have been lost.  \nIn the 1930’s, local Native carvers restored or re-carved the poles as a Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) project. Many of the poles along Totem Trail are CCC renditions of the original poles. What is left of the originals are in Totem Hall and the Visitor Center’s Seaside Porch. The largest of the original poles are behind the Visitor Center in an enclosure where you may view them.  \nThere are several types of totem poles. House posts are carvings on the support poles of houses; Frontal poles are freestanding poles placed against or near the front of a house displaying clan crests, clan history, and/ or a legend; Mortuary or Memorial Poles honor a living or dead person with a plain pole and a crest symbol on top. The family deposits ashes of the deceased person either in a box on top of the pole or in a hole in the back. Detached poles could be a History Pole recording a clan’s history, a Legend Pole telling a real or fictional story, or a Crest Pole showing a particular clan’s ancestry. Totem poles were never considered part of a religious practice or worshipped.\nEnjoy the rest of the tour and feel free to ask any questions!",

The bear’s body had been painted red, the square shaped teeth were white, and the eyes and brows are black. On the right, the second fragment is approximately 12 feet tall. The bottom figure is of a sitting bear with its claws tucked under the face. On top of the bear’s head sits a Watchman. His body is painted red, he is wearing a tall blue hat with a red stripe. The aged and worn off condition of the paint and the fact that these are fragments are good clues to indicate these fragments are very old.\nThese 2 totem fragments are from a Kaigani Haida pole from Old Kaasaan on Prince of Wales Island obtained from John Baranovich.  These are original pieces of one (of the two) Yaadaas Clan crest corner poles brought to the park in 1906.  This pole originally stood at 23’ and along with its twin, stood at the exterior corners of the Yaadaas clan house. Photographic evidence shows that the poles were carved before 1885.  \nThe original twin of this pole is on exhibit in Totem Hall in the visitor center.

It was designed by Tlingit Master Carver Tommy Joseph and raised by the community in 2011. His design brings together key pieces of the park’s history and includes colors and figures not found in poles of a more traditional nature.  This might be categorized as a contemporary “history pole.”\n\nAt the very bottom of this pole sits a replica of Merrill Rock in remembrance of E. W. Merrill, the local photographer who served as the first custodian of the park. It has a round blue-green engraving of Merrill’s profile and a camera. Above that are figures that symbolize the natural resources that play an integral role in the lives of all who have inhabited this place. The figure of a female face with very ornate red and black designs within the eyes represents Mother Nature while the figures of salmon draped over her shoulders and the green and yellow leaves above her acknowledge the importance of the sea, river, and forest.  Next, between the two columns of green devil’s club leaves sits a replica of one of the original Yaadaas Crest poles brought to the park.  Preserving these poles, traditional culture, and way of life that they memorialize has been part of the park’s purpose since its beginnings. Above this are this are the circular Orthodox calendar and square possession plaque representing the addition of Russian American history to the park’s focus in 1972.  The next figure up is a brown bison, which serves to acknowledge the National Park Service and its role in preserving the natural and cultural resources of the park. The yellow and black Chilkat robe worn on its left side is a reminder of the park’s 42-year partnership with the Alaska Indian Cultural Center. At the very top, black Raven and red Eagle at the top represent the two moieties of the Tlingit people, the first inhabitants and caretakers of this land. The Tlingit name of the pole comes from the interlocking talons position of these figures.",

Prior research indicated that the pole originated from the Haida village of Howkan, which is located on Long Island near Prince of Wales Island.  Newer research indicates that this pole likely originates from the Tlingit village of Tuxekan on Prince of Wales Island, because its carving is more similar to other poles seen in historic photos of Tuxekan.    \nThis is most likely a crest pole. The figures on this pole are very life-like and distinct as compared with the highly interconnected and overlapping design of many Haida poles.  Tlingit poles typically have figures isolated from one another and present a more rounded and sculpted appearance, which can be seen on this pole.  \nThe Prince of Wales Archipelago is still occupied by both the Tlingit and Haida.

The first recarve and the original pole now stand in Totem Hall in the visitor center. \nThis pole measures 16 feet tall, 2 feet wide. Though the large single, black and red bird figure at the top of this plain column is similar to Raven in form, the feathers carved on the back of the head and wings and the length of the beak suggests it could be a cormorant.  You can compare this bird to the Raven memorial pole farther along on the Totem Loop Trail. \nMemorial and mortuary columns were common pole types found in Southeast Alaska.  Memorial poles, along with house posts, are among the oldest forms of totem poles.\nThere is a fine distinction between memorial and mortuary poles. Both act to remember important people, but mortuary poles were used like a funerary urn, to hold a loved one’s ashes. The mortuary pole was an actual internment, while the memorial pole was a column of remembrance.  In some instances, a memorial pole was raised to honor a living person. The similarities in construction and appearance of these two types of poles make it difficult to tell them apart at a glance. \nBefore Christianity was introduced to the Alaska Native people by the missionaries, the dead were sometimes cremated.  The backside of a mortuary column often had a hole used as a receptacle for the ashes of the dead.  Both memorial and mortuary columns were usually topped by a single figure indicating the moiety or the clan of the person interred.",

Atop this figure is an animal with a shrimp in its mouth, another symbol said to represent a thief. At the top of this pole is a figure representing a white man, indicated by the depiction of curly hair and a beard. \nThis is a Ridicule Pole. Traditionally, a ridicule pole served to resolve conflicts in a non-violent way via public acknowledgement of a wrongdoing. It was erected to notify everyone of an unpaid debt or of harm or injury to another.The crest of the person who owed the debt or caused the harm or injury would be carved into the pole and was raised at a potlatch.The righting of the wrong or payment of the debt was accomplished at another potlatch, again, so that there would be many witnesses. Then the pole was burned and the wrong was never mentioned again.\nAn interesting sidenote is that this pole formerly stood near the old foot bridge across Kaasdaa Heen (Indian River) and was swept away in 1941, during the heaviest documented flood in the history of the Park. It was retrieved by the US Navy who was involved in gravel removal operations in the area. The gravel removal caused the banks to be eroded, so when there was an especially heavy rainfall, it washed the pole away.",

The pole was recarved in 1983 by Nathan Jackson (Yéilch Ya’di) and Steve Brown (Kaajísdu.áxch). Jackson and Brown used early photographs by E. W. Merrill from the Park collection to reproduce the details of the original pole. The Civilian Conservation Corps recarving of the same pole is in the covered Totem Preservation Exhibit near the upper trailhead of the Totem Loop Trail.\n\nThis pole is most likely a clan crest pole, which depicts the origin of the clan and its crests. \n\nThe pole is 32 feet tall, 2 feet 4 inches wide and 3 feet thick.\nThe bottom figure is a bird, perhaps a Thunderbird, depicted with a short, hooked beak and “ears” on its head, it is painted black with blue-green around the eyes and has red lips. Above the owl is a killer whale. The whale is black and has blue-green circles around the eyes, a small round face in the blowhole, a dorsal fin and its tail is tipped toward the viewer. Atop the whale is Raven, black with blue green around the eyes. Next up the pole is a frog, facing downward. Frog is green with large round eyes, a wide mouth and has spots on its back. Sitting above Frog is a human holding an unpainted stick, perpendicular and centered on its body. The human’s body is red, it has blue green around black eyes and a red mouth. The top figure is Raven, black with long beak, holding an unpainted crescent moon with its foot. \n\nTotem poles are expressions of the values, character and experiences of the clans who hosted the potlatches to raise the poles.  More important than physical possessions of the Tlingit and Haida are their crests.  Anytime and anywhere crests are used, whether on blankets, tunics, hunting tools, spoons or other utilitarian objects, the crests are public record of who owns the item.  In this traditional system, it speaks to the history of the people, as those items are passed on from one generation to the next.",

Sukkwan borders the southern border of the traditional territory of the Tlingit, and includes Tlingit legends which are incorporated into the carvings. The pole was most likely carved before 1888 and was acquired from Johnny Kanow/Jones by Governor Brady on November 15, 1903.\n\nThis pole was sent to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904 and then traveled to the Lewis & Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon in 1905. It arrived at Sitka National Monument in 1906. By 1939, the original pole was severely decayed.  It is believed the current pole standing before you is a re-carving of the original pole.  \n\nThe pole is 28 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 2eet thick. Most of the pole has weathered to the wood, however some red and black staining or paint remains. \n\nThe figures on this Kaigani Haida pole represent 3 Tlingit legends. \nThe bottom figure is a bear with a snail or shrimp-like creature in its mouth which may represent how the Gaanaxteidí clan acquired their crest (the woodworm)\n\nThe middle figure appears to be a depiction of the Tlingit legend of the bear who married a woman.\n\nThe top figure represents an ancient Tlingit legend figure, Lakich’inei (Lagwadji’na), who was a villain pressing one of his children (who was half-human and half-dog) against his coat made from the spine of a fish, killing the child.",

After a replacement pole was recarved by Frank Kitka (Ganóosgu éesh the CCC between 1938-1941, it was loaned to the US Naval Air Station on Japonski Island across from Sitka, who turned the pole over to Mt. Edgecumbe High School, a boarding high school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs who took over the military facilities after WWII.  One of the few originally loaned to the US Navy, it was the only intact pole when, in 1961, it was arranged for its indefinite loan to the Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka. It remained there until 1983 when it returned to the Sitka National Historical Park. The original pole obtained from Sukkwan can be seen in the totem preservation exhibit, on the outside of the Visitor Center.  \n\nThis pole is 33 feet tall, three and a half feet wide and 2 feet thick. It is painted with traditional red, black and bluegreen colors. Interestingly, this pole blends Haida carving style with Tlingit stories.  \n1.\tThe large figure at the base is probably a devilfish or octopus recognized as a bear.  Notice the suction cups used as eyebrows. \n2.\tAbove that is a female bear holding the hunter who was lost in the woods and he became her husband; \n3.\tGuteel, a Tlingit figure associated with the creature from which mosquitoes originated is the second figure from the top of this pole.  \n4.\tThe pole is topped by a village watchman.\n\nThe original of this pole may be viewed in the Totem Preservation Exhibit located outside the visitor center at the north end.",

They would then walk across the island in an event now known as what Herb Hope, Kiks.adi elder, would describe as, “… a survival march through our own back yard to a planned destination.” \n\nIn 1804, the Tlingit Kiks.adi clan fought a key battle against invading Russian forces at the mouth of Indian River. The K’alyáan Pole is a memorial to those Kiks.adi people who lost their lives in the conflict. It is named after K’alyáan, the legendary warrior who led the battle.\n\nThe bottom figure represents the Raven helmet worn by K’alyáan during battle.\nThe rest of the pole depicts the various clans of the Raven moiety.

It was raised on the site of the historic Kiks.adi fort with the help of the Sitka community. \n\nFollowing the memorial ceremonies marking its dedication, the pole was given to the park by the Kiks.adi in memory of their ancestors of long ago who fought the battle that marked the last major Native resistance in Sitka to Russian domination in Alaska.",

By the late 1930s the original pole had seriously deteriorated, it was at this point over 100 years old, and we hadn’t yet developed the preservation techniques we have today. Today only a fragment of the original pole remains. \nWhen the second generation of this pole was carved by George Benson and Peter Jones of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1940s, the crew had to fit the design onto 2 logs pieced together.The house posts were recarved in 1981-1982 by Reggie Petersen. \nAlthough several figures are identifiable, such as a bear on the bottom, raven in the upper middle portion and two traditional village watchmen at the top, many other figures are not. Little information about the story of this intricately carved giant has survived.\nThe house posts each display a single figure, with a large face at the top, red arms crossed over the body, and two smaller faces between the figure's red legs.

                    "audioTranscript": "The story of Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa, the little brown shark of Puʻuloa\n\nA story about Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa unfolds along the Pānau coast of Kīlauea volcano. Oral tradition says that a pregnant woman went into the ocean and had a miscarriage while she was in the water. When she later returned to the ocean, a shark came up under her, and turned out to be her miscarried child transformed; it had become a manō (shark). The child is named Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa (the little-brown shark of Puʻuloa), also referred to as Kaʻehuiki. The child’s mother, Hōlei, and father, Kapukapu, named their son after the great shark deity Kaʻahupāhau (cloak that is well cared for) from Keawalauopuʻuloa; currently known as Pearl Harbor in Oʻahu. Their child resembled Kaʻahupāhau because he was ʻehu, or reddish-tinged, like her hair.\n\nKaʻehuiki was nourished on ʻawa by his father and diluted with the milk of his mother for 10 days when he was put in a sea cave. When his parents decided to go to the uplands, Kaʻehuiki had to care for himself and became a shark ʻaumakua (deified family guardian).\n\nOne night, Kaʻehuiki appeared in his father’s dream and asked his permission to travel around the coast of Hawaiʻi to pay homage to all the district sharks. His intent was to meet the oldest brother of Pele, Kamohoaliʻi - the king of all sharks. He hoped Kamohoaliʻi would adopt him into the family. His father picked ʻawa roots, coconut, red-fish, and fowl and continued to chant as he went to the sea cave. A little brown shark, Kaʻehuiki, swam in the cave as his father began to consecrate the shark in chant for a long and successful journey.\n\nIn the fourth month, Kaʻehuiki first traveled to Hilo and met the great shark, Kepanila. Later he met Kaneilehia of Kaʻū. He continued to befriend the other district sharks of the island of Hawaiʻi and asked them to become his traveling companions on his journey: Kua of Kona, Manokini of Kohala, and Kapulena of Hāmākua\n\nThe shark of Kohala, Manokini, described to Kaʻehuiki the difficulty of traveling across the rough ʻAlenuihāhā channel to the island of Maui, and the ferocious shark, Kauhuhu of Maui, that governed it. Upon their arrival to Maui, Kauhuhu called out to them for being in his cave. He extended and opened his large jaws to bite Kaʻehuiki. Kaʻehuiki swiftly entered his wide mouth and devoured his vitals from the inside; leaving Kauhuhu lifeless as he floated in the tides.\n\nFinally, the voyage led to the island of Kahoʻolawe, where they could pay homage to Kamohoaliʻi-- the “king of all sharks”. He was overgrown with sea moss and barnacles - his mana emanated from him. Kamohoaliʻi consented to adopt the little-brown shark and an elaborate ceremony took place. He gave Kaʻehuiki the ability to take a hundred diﬀerent forms, immeasurable mana, and a long life.\n\nThe journey of Kaʻehuiki continued all the way to the distant lands of Kahiki, however, today he lives within the sea caves of Pānau. Oral history tells us that Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa is an ʻaumakua (who is part of the Pele family), a form of the great Kamohoaliʻi, and a shark who invokes the power of Kaʻahupāhau. Puʻuloa, now within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, is seen as the place of the birth of Kaʻehuikimanōopuʻuloa. It is where many Hawaiians connect the piko (umbilical stump) of their child to his birthing place. It is a way to obtain a long life, and life-prolonging protection from an ʻaumakua of this land.",

Though there are similar deposits elsewhere in the world, many have been impacted by human use or are in remote areas that are much harder to reach.\n\n So why do we see these terraces here?  While the volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery, scientists have proposed two possibilities. One is the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera; the other is perhaps a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.\n\nAt Mammoth, a network of fractures and fissures forms the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface. The water comes from rain and snow falling on the surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.  Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open.\n\nLimestone, deposited here millions of years ago when a vast sea covered this area, provides the final ingredient. Hot water with dissolved carbon dioxide makes a solution of weak carbonic acid.  As the solution rises through rock, it dissolves calcium carbonate, the primary compound in limestone.  At the surface, the calcium carbonate is deposited in the form of travertine, the rock that forms the terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs.\n\nContinue to the first overlook, where you’ll see active springs interspersed with dormant travertine terraces.",

The active spring in the distance on the far right is Canary Spring, currently the largest active hot spring at Mammoth Hot Springs.  If you would like to get a closer look at it, you can either park here, if driving, and walk down the boardwalk to the right of this point, or you can continue on around this loop drive and park at the entrance area and then walk down a boardwalk that leads to Canary Spring from that parking lot.\n\nAnother Spring on the Main Terrace to the far left is New Blue Spring. It is one of the best examples of the area’s dynamic character. It shifts activity frequently and can become active or inactive several times in one year. A boardwalk to the left will take you to this hot spring if you would like to take a closer look.\n\nTerraces are like living sculptures, shaped by the volume of water, the slope of the ground, and objects in the water’s path. Travertine builds up rapidly here at Mammoth and causes the features to change quickly and constantly. Approximately two tons of travertine are deposited daily in the Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces.\n\nSome vents will clog completely, new vents may form, and old vents may reopen.  Sometimes the water is concentrated in a few springs; at other times, water may spread across many outlets. Visitors are surprised to find that a favorite hot spring has dried up since they were last here. This does not mean the springs are drying up; it just means that the water is changing its location of output within the area. For example, Canary Spring is once again experiencing dry periods.\nIn every case, water follows the path of least resistance, which could be above ground or underground. Scientists estimate that, at any given time, about 10 percent of the water in the Mammoth Hot Springs system is on the surface; the other 90 percent is underground.\n\nThe features are always changing, but the overall activity of the entire area and the volume of water discharged remains relatively constant. The Mammoth Terraces is one of the few places on Earth where rock forms before your eyes. You can actually see the changes. \n\nContinue up the hill to the next pullout on the right, which will give you a good view of Fort Yellowstone.",

Poachers killed animals. Souvenir hunters broke off large pieces of these hot-spring terraces and also from geyser cones in other areas of the park. Developers set up camps for tourists near hot springs, along with bath and laundry facilities in the hot springs. Civilian superintendents who were hired to preserve and protect the land had differing expertise and intentions, but all were underfunded and understaffed. Thus, Yellowstone National Park turned to the US Army for help. In 1886, men from Company M, First United States Cavalry, Fort Custer, Montana Territory, came to Yellowstone under command of Captain Moses Harris. They began what would be 32 years of military presence in the park.\n\nAt first, soldiers lived in temporary frame buildings at Camp Sheridan at the foot of the Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces. After enduring five cold, harsh winters and realizing there was no end in sight to this assignment, Congress appropriated money for a permanent post. From 1891 through 1909, Fort Yellowstone was built, most of which still stands today and is used for housing and administrative offices. In 1916, when Congress created the National Park Service, the Army turned Fort Yellowstone over to the new agency. The fort has served the park well ever since, both as administrative headquarters and as a constant reminder of the debt the nation owes the officers and enlisted men of the United States Army for protecting and preserving Yellowstone National Park for future generations.\n\nContinue to the left.

Colorless and yellow thermophiles grow in the hottest water, whereas orange, brown, and green thermophiles thrive in cooler water.  Colors also change with the seasons due to differing amounts of sunlight.  When a hot spring stops flowing, the thermophiles responsible for the color die, and the travertine deposit is then eroded by weather.

Activity declined after the 1980s, but then resumed to a lesser degree in 2011.\n\nTo the right, across the road from New Highland Terrace, is a healthy mixed forest of limber pine, juniper, and Douglas-fir trees. What a difference in the growth of trees! This is probably what the forest to the left looked like before the hot-spring activity began. \n\nThis is also a good place to see birds such as Clark’s nutcrackers, magpies, and northern flickers.

In the early days, women were barred from swimming in Bath Lake because in good weather a large number of nude male bathers occupied it exclusively. GL Henderson, owner of the Cottage Hotel at Mammoth, suggested the government should regulate this matter by either constructing or permitting the construction of dressing rooms so that women and men in bathing suits could use the spring together. Eventually a bath house was constructed in 1919. When Bath Lake went dry in 1926, the bath house was removed. The 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake restored water flow to the lake, but by this time bathing was no longer allowed in any springs. In 1984, the lake dried up once again and remains dry.\n\nContinue up the next hill to the second pullout on the right to see White Elephant Back Terrace.",

As with many of the other springs you have seen, activity shifts constantly. \n\nContinue down the hill.

                    "audioTranscript": "The dramatic presence of this feature comes from abundant water, white formations, and colorful thermophiles that thrive in hot water. Angel Terrace was named around 1895, most likely by photographer F.J. Haynes, who likely chose the name because of the “purity of the deposit and the snowy whiteness when inactive.” At the height of its activity in the 1920s and 1930s, Angel Terrace was described in ranger notes as the “Gem of the Mammoth formations.”\n\nAfter the 1930s, activity declined, and Angel Terrace was dry and crumbling for decades. In 1985, however, it resumed activity once again! As you have seen here, at Mammoth, changes cannot be predicted, but they are certain to occur.\n\nFrom here you can return to the parking lot if walking, or return to the Grand Loop Road if driving.\n\nIf you are interested in walking other trails, don’t forget about Canary Spring Trail that starts here from the parking lot.  Also, Palette Spring is a level boardwalk that starts at the bottom of the Mammoth Terraces.  Mound Terrace is also an active, colorful spring, but does involve a steep uphill walk on boardwalk with many steps from the bottom of the Mammoth Terraces. \n\nWe hope you enjoyed the views of past and present hot-spring activity along the Mammoth Hot Springs Upper Terrace Drive. In addition, we hope you have found many reasons to preserve and protect the resources of this planet—from the thermal features of Yellowstone to the nature near your home.",

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986, Kennecott is considered the best remaining example of early 20th Century copper mining. In June 1998, the National Park Service acquired many of the significant buildings and lands of the historic copper mining town of Kennecott and is still in the process of stabilizing many structures.",

Located at the far southern end of Kennecott, at the northern end of a 30-foot (9 m) wide, half-moon shaped shuttle bus turnaround, an eight-foot (2 m) tall by twelve-foot (2.5 m) wide rusted, sculptural metal sign announces the Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark. Several three- to four-foot (1.25 m) tall circular metal cogs and wheels are embedded in the ground in front of the sign, with a boulder on the ground with a plaque that commemorates the National Historic Landmark.Just to the left of the sign, a wood plank boardwalk runs past a 10-foot (2.75 m) wide by six-foot (2 m) deep covered bus shelter and information kiosk with a 10-foot (2.75 m) tall triangular roof. Note a wooden bench in the center, information panels on the interior and exterior walls, and at the front right corner post, maps of the area inside a metal brochure box with a slanted, hinged lid. Behind a three and a half -foot (1.25 m) tall wooden railing, the boardwalk continues around to the left along the top of the bluff, overlooking the Kennicott Valley and Glacier below. There are two wooden benches spaced roughly evenly along the boardwalk, and three additional three-foot (1 m) wide by two-foot (60 cm) tall information panels to the south along the railing.Note that the buses do not typically use this shuttle stop, but drop passengers near private businesses in town. It is however, used for day use parking. A wheelchair-accessible ramp and boardwalk to the north links the turnaround to the Old Blackburn School, Kennecott Visitor Center and bookstore. Note there is an ADA accessible outhouse midway along the ramp just before you reach the school building, located to the east along a 12-foot (3.5 m) wide wooden deck.Note that while many of the approaches to the buildings here at Kennecott are accessible by many new wheelchairs, the town is filled with unpaved gravel surfaces and uneven terrain.An information panel on the right exterior wall of the kiosk displays a hiking trail map of the area. Text at the top left of the panel reads:Learn MoreCome visit us in the Visitor Center to learn about recreational opportunities, backcountry etiquette, bear safety, and more. For more information on these and other trails, pick up free handouts at the Visitor Center.Continuing down the left side of the panel, text next to an illustration of a black bear reads:Be Bear Aware!You are in bear country. Bears are attracted by smells, including food and other fragrant items. Unfortunately, receiving them can lead to aggressive behavior that puts both bears and humans in jeopardy. To help bears focus on foraging for their natural foods, and to keep yourself safe:Food must be in your direct control or in an approved Bear Resistant Container at all times-even in the middle of the day, even on the glacier.Bear Resistant Food Lockers are available at popular camping locations in Kennicott Valley.Portable Bear Resistant Food Containers can be borrowed from the Park's Visitor Center, free of charge.Federal law requires proper food storage at all times. Improperly stored food can result in a fine or imprisonment. At the middle left of the panel, text next to an illustration of a hand shovel reads:Pack in, pack out, dig deepThis area is managed as wilderness. Please pack out everything you pack in. Bury your solid human waste at least 6 to 8 inches deep, and 200 feet (60 m) from water, camp, and trails. Make it look like you were never there!Further down on the left, text next to an illustration of a boot with spikes sticking down from the sole reads:Hiking on GlaciersGlaciers provide unique and rewarding hiking experiences, best enjoyed with caution. A glacier's edge, glacial melt pools, and river potholes can be extremely dangerous due to rotting ice and swift, cold water. Fine glacial silt may look dry but can be very slippery, and contrary to first impressions, there is only a thin layer of rocks covering the ice. Crampons are strongly recommended. Remember, you are still in bear country when on a glacier.At the bottom left, text next to an image of a sheet of paper and a pencil reads:Backcountry ItinerariesIf you are heading into the backcountry, we encourage you to tell a third party your trip route and expected return time. Voluntary Backcountry Itinerary forms are also available. This will not result in an automatic search, but enables us to assist if you run into trouble. A map fills the right-hand side of the panel, showing the Root Glacier, a large, pale-blue area at the top, converging with the Kennicott Glacier in the middle. An orange \"You Are Here\" sign in the center shows your current position, with the town of McCarthy and the airport indicated at the bottom of the map. In the narrow green forested areas to the right of the glaciers, a dotted red line shows the paths of the five hiking trails here at Kennecott Mines.

Note this same ramp also continues south, linking the visitor center to the shuttle bus turnaround.\nA three-foot (1 m) tall, cast bronze, tactile, topographical model of the town sits in the middle of the deck. Measuring about five feet (1.25 m) wide by three-feet (1 m) deep, feel the locations of all the buildings and surrounding topography of the town. \nA visual map of the town just below the touchable exhibit show the various buildings in different shades of red, orange, yellow, white, and gray. These indicate which are National Park Service structures versus private property, and which structures are open to the public. Text at the left of the map reads:\n\nExplore Kennecott Mill Town\nA remarkable lode of copper ore near this very spot was discovered by American prospectors in 1900. Workers then developed the camp, mill, mines, and railway over the next decade. Kennecott Mines went into regular production in 1911, and proved hugely profitable. The mines were tapped out and closed in 1938.\nToday, Kennecott mill town is the best preserved example of early 20th century copper mining technology in the country. It is also a thriving community and a gateway to an immense wilderness.\n\nBehind and to the right of the outdoor model, a single wood door leads inside the school from the outside deck. \nInside at the left, a black-and-white photograph fills the bottom of a four-foot (1.25 m) tall by three-foot (1 m) wide angled metal display panel on the floor. A woman in the center, dressed in a long sleeve white, high-collar shirt and floor-length black skirt, stands behind a couple rows of boys and girls of various ages, from six years old to teenagers. Information at the top of the panel tells us that the Blackburn School was built in 1913, moved to Kennecott circa 1915, and restored between 2002 and 2005. Beside a copy of a hand-written inventory of supplies and books at the school, text continues:\n\nMoving with the boom and bust of mining towns\nIn 1913, the Kennecott Copper Corporation supplied materials to construct this building in the tiny community of Blackburn. Located along the railway between Kennecott and the future town of McCarthy, Blackburn had grown up as prospectors moved into the valley.\nBy 1915, however, Blackburn was mostly empty—its spring dried up and everyone moved to McCarthy, which was booming as a stop-over on the way to the Chisana gold fields. Kennecott was also booming, so the Corporation moved this building up to its present location on a flatcar. It served as a school for workers’ children until the end of the 1921-1922 school year, when the student population had grown again and classes moved to the new and larger Two Room School. The Old School was converted to storage.\n\nInside the School, staff and additional exhibits answer questions about the backcountry, front country trails, and the landmark, and more maps, books, and gifts are available for sale in the Alaska Geographic bookstore.",

Proceed down nine more steps to an eight-foot (2.5 m) wide by 19 foot (5.8 m) long wooden platform in front of the Recreation Hall. The single red and white wood door entrance is located in the middle of the building.Note the wheelchair accessible ramp is located on the west side of the building, but is reachable only from the lower service road. Note also there are two, red and white, gender neutral accessible outhouses near the base of the ramp, located immediately to the south along a 10-foot (2.75 m) gravel driveway leading west back to the service road.Facing the front door, exercise caution moving over the slightly raised wooden threshold onto the hardwood floor of a small, 10-square foot (three-square meter) anteroom. At the right, two pot belly stoves sit on a single-brick raised platform. At the left, a two and a half-foot (0.75 m) tall flip book display, mounted on an angle, stands in front of a three and a half-foot (1.1 m) wide by seven-foot (2.1 m) tall wall panel at the back. The panel presents information about the activities that took place here, while the flipbook offers more vignettes about the community's social and political history up to the present day.Beyond this entrance area, the hall opens up into a 30-foot (9 m) wide by 50-foot (15 m) long open, rectangular room with 15 foot (4.5 m) ceilings. Rows of six-foot (2 m) square windows line the center of both walls, looking up to the mountains on the east and out over the Kennicott Glacier on the west. Rows of wooden benches at the base of the walls sit on opposite sides of the dark, hardwood floor. A large movie screen hangs at the back of the hall, and there's a modern, black and silver wood stove in the far back left corner.Back inside the anteroom, facing the two pot belly stoves, the stove at the left is identified as a Great Western wood burning stove. It stands six feet (2 m) tall with a nearly three-foot (1 m) wide square black base. It has a generally cylindrical body with metal castings and hardware that rises to another dark cylinder at the top, connecting to a stovepipe into the ceiling above. Feel free to explore this original artifact.Opposite the stove, a black-and-white photograph at the top of the wall panel shows the frontier buildings and town of Kennecott in the early 20th century. A hand-written musical score appears across the bottom of the panel. Next to an image in the center of a pair of brown leather boxing gloves with green lacing, text reads:Recreation HallBuilt in 1916, restoration complete in 2003A place to socialize and celebrateThe twinkle of lights and sound of music enticed managers, their families, and workers to fill the Recreation Hall for dances, symphonies, school plays, Christmas pageants, movies, the occasional church service, and indoor sports like basketball, shuffleboard, roller skating, wrestling, and boxing matches. Organizing and enjoying these activities together helped create a sense of community among employees.The Kennecott Copper Corporation provided the Recreation Hall and other comforts to attract and keep workers. In exchange, the Corporation expected them to work hard and stay out of trouble.Below this text, between the wall panel and the flip book, note a music stand on the vignette with some sheet music from the era. There is also a lady's dance card from the 1920s for use at Kennecott dances, with numbered lines and a white string loop and small tassel.Turning to the first page of the flip book, a quote at the top of the dark purple page reads:\"Such an abundance of dancing partners.\"Text continues:Dances were held in the Recreation Hall two to four times a month in the 1920s, although this dwindled to once a month by the late 1930s. In those decades, dancing required a partner of the opposite sex, but women-nurses, teachers, secretaries, and wives-were in short supply at Kennecott. To keep things orderly and to be sure that everyone had a turn, men reserved a dance by writing their name on a lady's dance card. Dance cards could fill up very quickly.A quote at the bottom reads:\"There is a recreation hall where a few of the dances-the big ones like New Years and Fourth of July, etc., are held and everybody attends... the men outnumber [us] ... and no matter how much your feet hurt or your knees weaken, you have to keep on dancing.\"- Ethel LeCount in a letter to a friend, 1938.To the right on page two, a black-and-white photograph shows a line of men in suits and women in long elegant dresses standing underneath hundreds of strands of twisted streamers.",

The original Kennecott post office sign hangs above the boxes, a four-foot (1.5 m) wide black sign with white block letters reading, \"U.S. Post Office, Kennecott, Alaska.\" Note a reproduction hangs in the original location, directly above the door outside. <br />To the left of the door is a floor-standing information panel. Text at the top of the panel reads:<br /><br />Post Office<br />Built in 1917, restoration completed in 2006<br />Keeping in touch with home<br />The vast majority of Kennecott workers were far from home and family, so the Post Office was an important link to their loved ones. Workers sent letters and money orders-after all, they were here to make and save money. They also received news and mail-order goods. Mail traveled by train and, in later years, by air. Some long-term staff had brass mailboxes here, but most letters were sent to their recipients via general delivery.<br />To send news or to wire money home more quickly -and at greater expense-workers went to the Wells Fargo telegraph service in the Railway Depot.<br /><br />A black-and-white photograph, entitled \"Snowbird at the post office, 1937,\" fills the bottom of the panel. It shows a woman standing outside in front of the snowy and ice-covered Post Office next to a modified automobile with caterpillar tracks in the rear and skis in the front. <br />Move through the door to enter the back room of the Post Office. The open backs of the letter boxes line the wall to your right. Opposite the boxes, a mail duffel bag artifact hangs on the back wall at the left.<br />Another single wooden door at the back left of the Post Office leads into the Storeroom, though it is highly recommended you move back outside through the front door of the Post Office to continue your tour, beginning in the Store.<br /><br />Note that beacons inside each of the remaining three entrances will automatically trigger the appropriate interior audio description for your location.â€ƒ<br />\"<br />",

                    "audioTranscript": "\"Power Plant. 4 Â½ minutes.<br />Located at the northern end of town along the west side of the main gravel road, four towering smoke stacks rise from the three-story, 13,218 square foot (4,025 square meter) Power Plant. <br />As you move along the road toward the center of the plant, be mindful of rusted metal rails and other large metal debris lying in front of the nearly 120 foot (36 m) long structure.<br />Banks of three, eight-foot (2.5 m) tall by 10-foot (2.75 m) wide double hung white windows line the walls of the first section of the long red building.<br />A 10-foot (2.75 m) wide wood plank boardwalk near the end of this portion of the plant leads over a set of railroad tracks and over a small wooden threshold through a set of double red and white wooden doors onto a 10-foot (2.75 m) wide by five-foot (1.5 m) deep metal platform. A four-foot (1.25 m) tall metal railing surrounds the platform, with metal mesh screening between the rails.<br />The platform looks out over the power plant floor, to four enormous, two-story tall boilers at the right. A smokestack rises up from each, penetrating the roof and reaching for the sky beyond. To the left and right, additional large tanks and pipes line the periphery of the inside walls of the plant.<br />Straight ahead, on a catwalk on the other side of the plant, across the shop floor, a seven-foot (2.1 m) tall black-and-white floor-standing photograph shows a man in a long-sleeve shirt, tie, soft-billed cap and overalls standing before the turbines holding a pair of gloves. Mr. McGavoch was one of the electrician's here at the plant.<br />A three and a half-foot (1.1 m) wide angled information panel mounted flush with the top of the railing at the left tells the story of the Power Plant. Text next to an image of an early electric light bulb reads:<br /><br />Built and expanded 1911-1917, rebuilt after the 1924 fire, restoration completed in 2014<br />Power was essential for Kennecott operations<br />In the earliest years, a small wood-burning boiler powered the sawmill. The first of the boilers in front of you came up when the railway was completed in 1911. As the others were added, this became one of the largest power plants in Alaska.<br />The boilers burned oil to generate steam. The steam generated electricity in the Mill's steam turbines, heated the ammonia reaction in the leaching plant, and warmed buildings throughout the Mill camp. The diesel-electric generators (to your left) sent electricity to the camp, Mill, trams, and mines. The Pelton wheel generator hiding behind them was used in emergencies. Multiple ways to generate power meant that even if something went wrong, operations could continue.<br /><br />A black-and-white photograph at the right side of the panel shows an aerial view of the plant from the west. A quote at the bottom of the panel reads:<br /><br />\"An oil storage tank located on the hill above the power plant held enough oil to operate Kennecott all winter...At 30 degrees below zero, the steam plant was a nice place to work.\"<br />-Wesley Bloom, journeyman electrician at Kennecott, 1935-1937<br /><br />From this location, note an exterior, four-foot (1.25 m) wide wood plank boardwalk, parallel to the plant that runs about 60 feet (18 m) north to a second, wooden observation platform inside the plant at the left. Inside, the boardwalk extends left from the platform, snaking around some of the pipes and tanks inside the plant, providing additional viewing vantage points closer to the boilers and smokestacks.<br />Power played a critical role in Kennecott's self-sufficiency. Industry requires power, and generating power in the wilderness, on a sizable scale, required imagination and herculean effort. The plant provided power and steam heat to the entire town. Steam traveled to outlying buildings through underground wooden conduits. These were often built under wooden sidewalks, keeping them free of snow and ice in the winter. Water for the steam boilers was diverted from Bonanza Creek, north of the town. Power was also transmitted over a high-tension line to Bonanza and then across the hill to Jumbo.<br />\"<br />",

At the time, suffragists believed that the recently-adopted 14th Amendment gave them the right to vote. The 14th Amendment, passed during Reconstruction, addressed citizenship and equal protection under the law. In part, it reads:\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nVirginia Minor of St. Louis, Missouri went to court to argue that 14th Amendment gave women the right to vote. In 1875, the Supreme Court ruled in Minor v. Happersett that the US Constitution did not grant women--or anyone--the right to vote.",

Inez Milholland led the Suffrage Procession astride a white horse, symbolizing the purity of women. While many of the marchers were white, there were a small number of African American, Chinese, and Native American women represented as well, including Ida B. Wells, Mabel Lee, and Marie Louise Bottineau Baldwin. Although these women of color marched in the DC parade, the suffrage movement was largely divided along racial lines.\n\nHave you marched or demonstrated for social justice?

In 1917, NWP began picketing President Wilson to demand his support of a constitutional amendment for woman suffrage. These \"Silent Sentinels\" stood outside the White House holding banners demanding the vote. This was the first time that the White House had been picketed as a form of protest. The continued picketing for months.\n\nWhen the US entered World War I, public sentiment turned against the women. Many viewed protesting the President in a time of war as unpatriotic. More than 150 women were arrested and jailed. Many went on hunger strikes in protest and were force fed. When people found out about the harsh treatment, public opinion began to shift. By 1918, Wilson began speaking in support of the amendment. Congress passed the 19th amendment in June 1919. It was ratified by 3/4 of the states and became part of the Constitution in August 1920. The NWP continued fighting for women's equality.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Welcome to a two minute introduction to mindful meditation. One of the main reasons people meditate is because sometimes life can feel a bit like a roller coaster. One moment we are confused about how we're changing, how much we have on our plates, how exciting life can be and scary. Sometimes we feel like we have little control of the ride we are on. Meditation is a tool we can use any time, and any place to help us regain a little control. And help us feel more calm during the ups and downs of life. When we take a few moments to concentrate on the present and how our bodies are responding, we can center ourselves and still our minds. Best of all, we figure out how we are feeling when we are confused, and decide what to do about it. So now, I invite you to find a comfortable position either seated or standing. if you feel comfortable, either seated or standing, and if you feel comfortable, lower your gaze or close your eyes. We will start by taking a cycle of deep breaths to transition from wherever you were a few moment ago, to a still meditation space. This is called “square breathing.” We will breathe in for four counts, hold for four counts, and breathe out for four counts. And repeat this cycle four times. Deep breath in. Deep breath out. Deep breath in. Deep Breath out. And continue. As you breathe in, soften any tension you may be holding in your jaw. Soften any tension you may be holding in your neck, melt any tension you may be holding in your shoulders. Deep breath in. Deep Breath out. Feel your chest rise with each breath, and fall as you slowly let your breath out. Feel your arms relaxed at your sides or in your lap. Slowly open your palms and face your palms upward. Deep Breath in, Deep Breath out. Deep Breath in, Deep Breath out. When you are ready, I invite you to open your eyes. Congratulations on finishing this introduction to meditation session. You did an awesome job today. Whenever you feel stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, and you want to calm your mind. You can try this practice. Enjoy this relaxed, peaceful state. And take it with you as you move to the next stop on the Escape adventure.",

The purpose of this activity is to identify those people in our lives who build up our self-confidence and add positivity. Once the activity is complete, you can answer the clue to release the third code.\nLook around your feet. Did you know there is a lot of biological activity in dirt? Have you noticed the bumpy, knobby, and sometimes dark soil along the trails? That’s biological soil crust! Just like a coral reef is formed over time by lots of small organisms living together, soil crust is formed the same way. Moss, lichen, green algae, cyanobacteria (sigh-AN-oh bacteria), and microfungi all work together to hold sand grains in place to create an environment where seeds can grow. We as people are a bit like the Earth’s crust. We have a lot going on inside our bodies that help us be strong: we give our bodies rest, we give our bodies nutrition, some of us get exercise by playing with friends or playing sports. One of our “crust layers” we want to keep intact are our friendships. We want people in our lives who don’t BUST OUR CRUSTS. We want to keep ourselves, our friends, and each other intact. Think about being bullied--that really busts my crust! Now think about spending time with someone you really like. Doesn’t that feel good? Like the biological crust, a single footprint off the trail can erase decades of growth. In other words, bullying, teasing, and intimidating break us down just like crust. Build others up--positivity is contagious!\nI challenge you to take a few moments to reflect on some things that “bust our crusts”. Not too long – we don’t want to spend too much time focusing on the things that bother us. Now, take a moment to think about the people in your life who help build up your crust. Maybe it’s your best friend who always makes you laugh or shares the best memes. Or perhaps it is someone online you play video games with. Maybe it’s a grandparent or someone you play sports with at school. These positive people, the ones who “build up your crust” are the people we want to surround ourselves with. Not people who break us down – and bust your crusts! When we form friendships and bonds with positive people, we let them in to see who we truly are. It can be scary to open up and be vulnerable with another person, but it’s worth it! These are the people who we can lean on when the times get hard – and I bet you can return that favor to them when they need a positive influence in their lives. We help build each other’s layers, just like the geology in the rocks all around you here at Colorado National Monument.\nRead on below to solve the third stop clue and then head right on to stop number four!

As a group or as an individual, it is time to embrace silence and reflect on your experience today. Take a walk or choose a location to stand or sit comfortably. If you are in a group, try not to go in the same direction, but stay within sight of adults in the group. Set your timer for five  minutes. While on the walk or in a comfortable, relaxed position, reflect on the following thoughts: Which of your unique strength helped you complete the activities today? Maybe it was your curiosity, or your willingness to try new things. How did you shine during these activities? Maybe you found out you are a great listener, good storyteller, empathetic, sensitive, good at making others smile or laugh, or maybe a really great problem solving.\nOnce the five minutes is up, and your timer goes off, it is time to write down your one of your awesome strengths. With a pencil or pen or paper write down the unique strength you thought of while walking in nature. If you don't have something to write with, just make a mental note of your strength. You don't even need to share your strength out loud. I encourage to save this little paper, though, in a special place. Maybe you have the perfect spot in your locker or in your wallet, or maybe on the mirror you look in when you get ready for school or work. Placing your strength somewhere that is highly visible will help remind you that when life feels challenging, you have strength to keep going.\nAnd guess what? It's time to solve the final code word.

While looking at the ocean you may notice the lighter streak of color going North to South. This is the marking of the kelp bed in the Cabrillo State Marine Reserve that stretches from Ocean Beach to the end of the peninsula. However, kelp forests like this can be found all down the west coast of North America. These ecosystems can grow off the Pacific Coast because the cool currents from the north mix with the warm currents from the south. The blending of these two temperatures allow for high biodiversity! \n\nThese kelp forests are marine protected areas because of the unique ecosystem they provide for many species. The kelp in the forest can grow to be 175 feet tall, creating homes for bottom feeders, deep sea and surface dwelling fish, and many marine grazers such as snails. Many different species also use our kelp forest as a nursery-ground, making it a vital part of their lifecycles. A common species found in kelp forests are Garibaldi (Hypsypops rubicundus), California’s state fish. The Garibaldi can be identified by its bright orange color. These fish thrive in areas with cool water temperatures and prefer waters up to 100 feet deep. As a result, they are only found off the Pacific Coast!\n\nPause for a moment to breathe in the salty ocean air. Close your eyes and imagine the vast wilderness and abundance of animals living just below the surface of the waves.\n\nAlthough there is not an opportunity to see the marine life found in the kelp forests up close, there is still a way to see what lives in our waters!

You can see a beautiful view of the native chaparral and sage scrub plant communities. These plants are adapted to Southern California’s Mediterranean climate which is characterized by a short rainy season followed by a long, hot period of drought. Only 2% of the world falls into this category, making this biome even more remarkable! The rainy season here is only from December-March. The plants found in these habitats have adapted to survive in a place with little rain. \n\nAlthough these plants are not all related, they have adapted similar traits to survive heat and drought. For example, thick, small, or waxy leaves help plants store water. Plants with thick leaves, like the Chalk Dudleya (Dudleya pulverulenta), store water in them as a reservoir for months without rain. Other plants are drought deciduous, meaning that they lose their leaves in periods without water and quickly resprout them when water becomes available. By doing this, the plants can maintain their energy stores during periods of drought. Black Sage (Salvia mellifera) and California Sagebrush (Artemisia californica) both lose their leaves in the warmer, dry summer months. The sage at the park expresses the same oil as cooking sage!\n\nDepending on the time of year you visit, you may see beautiful blooms across the park. In times of rain, plants reproduce by flowering, seeding and quickly returning to dormancy. This allows the plants to reproduce when they know it is going to be the most successful. \n\nPark scientists have researched local vegetation to gain an understanding of these unique plants in order to preserve them. Thanks to a dedicated group of researchers, staff, and volunteers, Cabrillo has been able to restore many native plants throughout the park. Importantly, this is also thanks to visitors like yourself protecting the native plants by leaving them to bloom for future generations.\n\nTake a minute to look up the hill. Do you notice any hidden structures? During the World Wars, this land was utilized as a military base. Because of that, many look out points and artillery stations were disguised in the natural landscape. One of these military artifacts can be seen up ahead.",

North of the structure is a cement and metal track that this roofing would slide along. Underneath, a giant light would be lifted out of the ground and shine into the ocean. The light was capable of illuminating incoming ships for 4.5 miles. If attacked, this allowed the military to prepare and send the word to local forces. \n\nImagine working a lookout shift and always being prepared for a call to scan the ocean for an incoming ship. The duty would start with maintenance of the light to be sure it was ready for use. Then the soldiers would sleep in shifts with the expectation that they would all be awakened whenever the searchlight was needed. The searchlight would only be illuminated when needed because continual illumination would give away the location of the light. Initial searching was done visually, using radar, and with audio-based equipment.\n\nAmerican military presence in Point Loma dates back to 1852 just after California became a state. In 1898, the Fort Rosecrans base was formed on this land. By 1913, Cabrillo National Monument was designated, and was allotted a portion of the land previously owned by the military. Although the land was given to the National Park Service, during war times the area was needed by the military due to its geographical advantage. It is uncertain if the monument was used during the World War I, however, it is known that the public still had access to the lighthouse! Certainly, the park was a vital resource during the WWII and was the first base to be notified about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. \n\nDid you know: The spotlight has ‘moved’ throughout time. You may wonder how this is possible for such a large piece of equipment! Due to a modernization project in 1936, the physical searchlight from a different location was installed at this disappearing structure. As a result, the light is often considered to be our ‘mystery’ due to the move!",

Please help the community preserve this special plant by enjoying it from a distance.\n\nPlease stay on trail to help the park preserve native habitat. You may notice paths leading closer to the cliffside, however, these are social trails. Social trails are paths created by many guests going off the approved trail. These visitor-made pathways cause substantial ecological damage due to trampling. \n\nCabrillo’s park rangers think agaves are amazing plants because of their adaptations. Shaw’s Agaves can reproduce sexually, through pollination, or asexually by creating clones of themselves! If agaves do not get pollinated, they create clones of themselves (called pups!) to ensure that there are enough individuals to keep the population abundant. This is what has happened at the park. A large portion of the agaves at the park have reproduced asexually and created clones. Scientists were worried that all of the park’s plants were planted from the same set of clones, meaning that they would all be genetically identical. However, recent research has shown that plants reintroduced into the park had a wide range of genetic diversity! Genetic diversity will allow the community to better withstand diseases and other threats. This discovery has given our scientists hope that the population will continue for decades to come!\n\nAs you continue down the trail, we invite you to look at the surrounding plants for pollinators. How many can you count while you are visiting Cabrillo National Monument? An amazing way to share your information with others is to upload photos of pollinators to community science databases! A link to recommended applications can be found in the ‘Things to Do’ tab. These mobile apps allow everyone in the local and global community to work together in identifying these important animals, information that’s placed in a database that scientists can access and use. At the moment, there are over 700 species of bees recorded within the San Diego area. New species of pollinators like bees, flies, beetles, and ants are being discovered every day. This is one of the many reasons why places with intact habitat like Cabrillo are important to preserve and protect. You never know what we might discover, together.\n\nBehind the Shaw’s Agave is an exposed cliffside providing a window into the past.

From here, you can look down the northern view of the peninsula to see the sandstone bands in the cliffside. These bands are the result of millions of years of sedimentary deposition of sand, mud, and rocks that created condensed layers while the peninsula was underwater. This significantly occurred during a geological period 65-75 million years ago, of which many trace fossils of past animals can been seen in the rocks. During this time period, pressure was building on the Rose Canyon fault. As a result of this pressure, the peninsula was slowly lifted out of the water! The increased compression of the Rose Canyon fault caused an uneven rise of the land, which is why the rock bands in the cliff are at a tilt. As the fault continues to move, the tilt continues to grow.\n\nAll of the geological formations at this stop can also be seen from the tidepools. Please be advised that the spur trail is a steep, sand path. Before entering, you may notice the sandstone formations on the left. The land here appears to form vertical wave-like-patterns. These formations are called badlands, due to the extreme erosion from the wind and water in the area. This soft soil is likely to continue to slip away over time and is very easily damaged by shoes or climbing. \n\nFrom down this trail, you may be able to see trace fossils or concretions. Please keep in mind that everything found in the park is federally protected and should be left where you found it. Trace fossils are markings that look like streaks in the sandstone and were once created by animals, such as the ancient relatives of ghost shrimp, as they scavenged for food in what is now the Rocky Intertidal Zone. Concretions are round markings where the sand and minerals formed around an object, much like a pearl forms around a grain of sand inside a mollusk's shell!  \n\nFun fact: Actual Cretaceous reptile bone fossils have been found in similar areas very close by. Mosasaur and Hadrosaur bone fragments have been found between Sunset Cliffs and La Jolla (respectively). A gigantic ammonite fossil was also found in the tidepools ages ago, and there’s a cast of it in the auditorium, along with a pretty wacky story of how it disappeared and was found in city hall years later. \n\nAs you continue down the trail, look at the cliffside and sea-level rock formations.

A wonderful opportunity to see shorebirds can be found  when looking at the rock formations exposed in the water. Common on these  platforms are Western Gulls, who have a dark gray back, white body and white head. California Brown Pelicans are the largest of the seabirds at the park with a large brown body, and long beak sporting a large pouch. Cormorants have black, long necks and bodies, with pale bills. How many species can you identify?\n\nNow look inland, at our native vegetation climbing the hillside. Cabrillo National Monument is home to many species of land birds, such as sparrows, finches, towhees, and phoebes. Practice your naturalist skills by listening to their calls or songs and trying to match it to a nearby bird; this is part of something called birding, which is the act of observing and identifying birds by their characteristics!",

This is the first stop on a self-guided tour that will take you around the grounds of the estate, past the mansion and outbuildings, and through the gardens. As you walk to the front of the house, you may wonder “Why is Melrose part of a National Park?” Simply, because it is one of the best-preserved estates in the Deep South from the mid-1800s. For that reason, it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Melrose helps tell the American stories of an economy based on growing cotton and the world of chattel slavery.  \nThis land was once part of a series of Indian villages. The early French settlers called this area “Natchez” after the name of the native people who lived here.   As the number of settlers and their enslaved African workers grew, so did disputes with the Natchez. After a series of wars, the Natchez Indians and some Africans rose up against the French in 1729.  The French drove the Natchez out of this area and sold many of them into slavery.  Over the next 70 years, European countries enticed settlers into the area with offers of large land grants. One early settler, Alexander Moore, bought land on this site in 1790, not long before the region entered the United States as part of the Mississippi Territory. \nThe story of the Melrose estate begins many years later when John McMurran bought part of Moore’s plantation in 1841.  By then the land was described as an “old waste cotton field.” McMurran crafted the estate that you see today. By 1860, Melrose was home to John McMurran, his wife Mary Louisa, and their two children. It was also home to twenty-two enslaved people of African descent who worked on the estate. \nAfter the Civil War, the McMurrans sold Melrose to Elizabeth and George Malin Davis. They then left it to their daughter Julia and her family. Julia’s son, George Kelly, and his wife, Ethel, moved to Natchez in 1909. They made Melrose a focal point of the Natchez Spring Pilgrimage tours that started in 1932. After Ethel Kelly’s death in 1975, John and Betty Callon purchased and restored the estate. The unique importance of the Natchez story led Congress to create a new national park in 1988. Natchez National Historical Park tells the story of all the peoples of Natchez. The Melrose estate with its land, its historic buildings, and its museum collection, serves as the centerpiece of the park.",

From this point, you can see the estate’s original landscape design. A curved fence separates the well-tended formal front lawn from the meadow beyond. The McMurrans and their guests entered Melrose by carriage through the estate’s white wooden entrance gates. Next they passed a small pond lined with cypress trees with a reflection of the big house in the distance.  The gravel drive wound through a series of oak and magnolia trees to the front of the mansion.  A secondary drive led to the rear of the house, where a cluster of white wooden buildings form the working part of the estate.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Melrose is often called “one of the great houses of the American South.” The design of the mansion is based on the Greek Revival style. It was popular in America in the years before the Civil War. The tall ceilings, deep porches, and large windows and doors of this style worked well in the hot, humid Southern climate. The 16,000-square-foot house features some of the finest brickwork in the nation.  The four Doric columns out front are made of brick but covered with stucco and painted to resemble stone. The porch wall behind them received the same treatment. Similarly, the large front cypress doors are painted to look like oak. Skilled laborers and trained carpenters – many of whom were probably enslaved - used locally milled cypress to construct the mansion. Giant cypress trees were logged out of the Louisiana swamps. They provided wood that was easy to cut but resistant to termites and rot.\n \nJohn McMurran moved to Natchez in the 1820s, not long after Mississippi became a state. In 1831, he married Mary Louisa Turner, who was the daughter of a local judge. In 1833, her parents gave them a 645-acre plantation and 24 enslaved people.  McMurran grew up in Pennsylvania where slavery had been outlawed in 1780. He moved to the slave world of the Deep South. There, the practice of slavery allowed him to build great wealth.",

This role made her responsible for the house and grounds. She made certain that her enslaved servants tended them well. She wrote many letters to family members that give us details about the estate. They tell of the plants growing in her greenhouse, and they describe the different seasons at Melrose. Above all, they show how much pleasure she found in her gardens. In 1849 she wrote to her sister: “I enjoy my quiet days at Melrose so much that I give them up with reluctance to pay morning calls, but it is a duty for all our society, and the sacrifice must be made occasionally .... My double white Camellia is blooming. All my camellias are full of buds and look in beautiful order but they will bloom too early. What a pity!”",

This one originally enjoyed a backdrop of open pastureland. The earliest photographs taken on the Melrose grounds were made not long after 1900. They show how the camellias and gardenias in this garden had already grown into large bushes. The towering crape myrtles have become filled with Spanish moss over the years.\nMary Louisa McMurran and her family enjoyed their walks through the different parts of their garden. She oversaw the planting of seeds and the growing of tropical plants in cold frames and a greenhouse. She took great joy in her flowers, calling them “God’s smiles.” In the beginning, small boxwood bushes lined these grassy walking paths, but flowering spring bulbs and monkey grass replaced them as edging in the 1900s.\nGeorge and Ethel Kelly, the second family to own the estate, placed their own stamp on this part of Melrose. They installed a tennis court on the west end of the flower garden.",

Canning fruit was a major task for the enslaved kitchen servants in the summer months, overseen by the mistress of the estate or plantation. In 1850 John McMurran received a dozen small peach trees. His law partner, John Quitman, provided them for the Melrose orchard. Today, the orchard holds figs, peaches, pears, apples, and cherries, just as it did during the McMurran era. Cattle grazed around the trees to keep the grass down. The McMurrans also grew peaches and nectarines at their Louisiana plantations, Killarney and Moro.\nGeorge and Ethel Kelly installed the iron gate at the orchard entrance. It came from Cherokee, a house they owned in downtown Natchez.   \nThe wooded area on the far side of the orchard holds a cemetery. The McMurrans buried their enslaved servants there.  They planted evergreen trees like cedar around the area. In 1844 a young woman named Laura became the first burial. She had “quite a large funeral.” Marice died of dysentery in 1861. Wesley died in 1853. The carriage driver Charles died in 1855. Today, there is no above-ground evidence of the cemetery remaining. However, a letter written in 1887 mentioned a brick wall surrounding the Melrose graveyard.",

The first-floor functions included a laundry and a dairy. \nLaundry days at Melrose were difficult for the slaves and filled with hard tasks.   These were backbreaking jobs that involved dangerous materials. People had to heat water in iron pots in the large fireplace. Then they poured the hot water into large washtubs where they scrubbed clothes, bedsheets, and table linens for the estate. They used caustic lye soap for cleaning and acidic lemon juice for deep stains. They had to rinse each item and wring it out. Afterward, they hung it on a clothesline to dry. Then they repeated the entire process for the next batch. They heated small irons in the fireplace for ironing all the cotton and linen items.\nMelrose had a small herd of dairy cows to provide fresh milk and butter for the estate. It was stored and processed in this building. The dairy room contains a series of built-in cement fixtures along one side. The lower part was closed behind wooden doors. It served as an early refrigerator holding blocks of ice to keep food cold. Water filled open troughs of the upper part where enslaved servants placed dairy products to cool that would be processed into butter and cheese. The water also served to keep ants out of the food.\nThe upstairs rooms housed enslaved household servants. They had to respond to the ringing of the series of bells across the back porch of the big house. William and Eliza Jones served as a valet and a maid to the McMurrans. They likely lived in one of these upstairs spaces. William traveled with the McMurrans to northern resorts such as Niagara Falls in the summers. He also went with them to Europe when they made their Grand Tour with their children in 1854. Estate slaves were not like plantation slaves whose lives were ordered by the cycle of planting and picking cotton. Slaves who worked in the McMurran household lived their lives according to the routines and whims of the masters.   \nAlice Sims came with the Davises to Melrose in 1866, along with her family. She had previously been enslaved by the Davis family at their Vaucluse Plantation in Louisiana. The Sims lived upstairs in the dairy building.",

They are made of brick and lined with natural cement. Rainwater runs through downspouts from the gutters around the roof of each building. At the bottom of each downspout is a metal “boot” that swivels. These funnel the water either into a cistern or into a pipe that drains out onto the ground. A copper sieve filled with charcoal helped to filter the water. A series of underground pipes connects the cisterns behind the Melrose mansion so that as one filled with water it would flow to the next one.\nThese cisterns are capped with hand pumps to allow access to the water within.

A steep exterior stairway on the north end was hidden behind painted wooden blinds. This gave the household servants almost invisible access to the second floor of the house.  Several slave bells are located across the back gallery. They were used to call slaves to carry out tasks for the McMurran family and their guests inside the house.   Those bells could ring at any time of the day or night, for a slave’s time was not their own.  Two slave bells in the basement of the big house were used to call slaves from the two parlors, dining room, or front door, the most important areas of the mansion.

The first floor contained the cooking kitchen. The first floor also held a pantry and a possible dining room for the Melrose slaves. The cooks and some of the other household servants lived in the three upstairs rooms.  An enslaved woman, Rachel, was the primary cook in 1850 and probably lived above the kitchen until 1864.  Family letters mention another cook, “Dicey,” who was a slave on the nearby Quitman family estate, Monmouth.  “Mammy” Helen sometimes cooked, and she too likely lived in an upstairs room in the kitchen or dairy building.

The enslaved people who lived there were not tied to the call of the slave bells on the back of the mansion. Their tasks probably included working with some of the livestock or working on the estate grounds. The cabin to the right originally consisted of three rooms or “cells” with no interior doors. This cabin would have housed three separate families. The other, two-room cabin, would have held two families.\nThe cabins offered a separate world with its own community. In 1856 two sets of young people had weddings at Melrose. The McMurrans’ daughter Mary married Farar Conner in the drawing room of the mansion. Patrick and Mime, described by Mary Louisa McMurran as “two we have reared and trained in the family – the children of old and favourite servants,” were married here as well. Mrs. McMurran wrote that after their wedding, Patrick and Mime “retired and passed the evening with some invited friends, and had a fine supper.” Viola, an enslaved cook at nearby Monmouth, served as bridesmaid; she was married to Marcellas, described as the “second waiter” at Melrose.\nLike Alice Sims, Jane Johnson came to Melrose with the Davis family in 1866. She was still working as a cook for the family but was no longer enslaved. Tradition holds that she and her family lived in the larger three-room cabin. She had it altered by the addition of interior doors.  Slave cabins in town or on estates such as Melrose had wooden floors, glass paned windows with exterior shutters, and some store-bought furnishings.

Carriages frequently broke down. The large, powerful horses could become frightened and uncontrollable. An 1843 letter from Eliza Quitman to her husband John described such an accident: “Mr. McMurran’s horse ran off with his Barouche yesterday morning and injured the carriage very much. Charles was on his way out to Melrose to take his mistress to church, when the horses took fright and ran away.” \nIn 1857 a coachman met the McMurrans’ son John and his new bride Alie at the river landing when their steamboat came in late one night, and he safely delivered them to Melrose. A man named William followed in a wagon with their baggage.\nTypically, upon returning from an outing, Charles would stop at the front door of the mansion to let out his passengers onto the carriage block.

By the end of the Civil War, John McMurran was hurting financially. He and his wife were also overcome by the death of their daughter and several grandchildren at the house in 1864 and 1865. The couple decided to sell Melrose. They made plans to join their son and daughter-in-law in Maryland. \nAt the end of 1865, the McMurrans sold Melrose to George and Elizabeth Davis who eventually gave the estate to their daughter, Julia. She and her husband, Stephen Kelly, had a son in 1877,  named for his grandfather. The Kellys’ upgrades at Melrose included building this playhouse for the boy. Near the kitchen “Georgie” could be easily watched by servants like Jane Johnson and Alice Sims. Sadly, Julia and her father both died in 1883. Stephen took his 6-year-old son to be reared in New York City. After 1883, no one lived in the Melrose mansion for two decades. Jane Johnson and Alice Sims continued to live with their families on the property as caretakers and tenant farmers.",

                    "audioTranscript": "This gravel parking lot replaced the large Melrose vegetable garden. There, Mary Louisa McMurran oversaw enslaved gardeners and laborers. They tended the plants that fed the entire estate. The vegetable garden was connected to the Kitchen building by a dirt path lined with cherry laurels. These native plants were used as hedges all around the estate. That path has now been expanded and paved to make it wheelchair accessible. The clever white wooden gate that swings both ways is probably a Kelly-era addition. \nThis large garden provided a space for seasonal vegetables to feed people on the estate. The slaves may have also had their own garden plots down behind the cabins. The gardens would have held tomatoes, peppers, corn, squash, melons, beans, and peas in the summer. They were followed by root vegetables and greens in the cooler months. The gardens grew enough fruits and vegetables to feed two dozen people daily. \nThe raised beds that are located by the parking lot today give visitors a chance to see examples of some crops that were grown out on plantations, such as cotton and sugar cane. More than 350 people were held in bondage on the McMurrans’ five cotton plantations. Their forced labor generated the great wealth that paid for the splendor of the Melrose estate.\nThis concludes your tour of the Melrose grounds. We hope you have enjoyed your walk and learned something along the way about the estate, its people, and the system of chattel slavery that built and sustained this country. We also hope this has whetted your appetite to come back again to this beautiful and tragic place.",

The boardwalk can get very slippery in inclement weather and snakes are sometimes known to warm themselves along our boardwalk.  So please watch where you step and enjoy your visit.\nAs you begin your walk, take a moment to look around and notice what our park looks like today.  You may notice our boardwalk that runs through the forest ahead.  As you focus further, you may see that our forest mostly consists of deciduous trees that lose their leaves in the fall and burst open with color in the spring.  Birds may make themselves known to you and a squirrel just might scurry by.\nSeeing all these things in front of you, you may begin to wonder about what it was like when people lived here thousands of years ago.  And while the first people to visit this area probably saw a much colder, more evergreen forest, for the most part the natural landscape really hasn’t changed too much.  The past people of Russell Cave would have enjoyed temperate winters, warm summers, and plenty of food sources to choose from.  That doesn’t mean that there weren’t bad years where food was less plentiful, but overall, this would have been a safe place to call home.\nAs you continue walking toward the cave, think about if you had to start all over again in a new place to make a home.  What kinds of things would be most important for you?  What priorities have stayed the same, and which have changed over the thousands of years?",

To your right, you can make a quick pitstop at our sinkhole and trailhead.  The hiking trail is a 1.2-mile hike that takes you straight up our mountain and back down.  Constructed in the 1960’s this asphalt trail can be difficult to traverse with the wrong footwear, so we recommend closed toe shoes and plenty of water before starting this strenuous hike.  If you have more questions about the trail, please stop into the visitor center and talk to a ranger about it.\nThe sinkhole you will see at the small overlook is a prime example of cave country.  In this region, you will mostly find limestone caves which are formed by moving water.  Limestone is a rock that allows water to flow through it and is also easily dissolved by slightly acidic rainwater.  Over time, rain will seep into the ground and reach a layer of limestone hidden beneath the earth.  As the water moves through the rock, it will dissolve a hole in the limestone, and eventually the weight of the soil can break through the thin layer of rock remaining, creating a sinkhole quite quickly.  Water moving underground through the stone can also create passageways through the limestone, eventually creating cave systems like Russell Cave.  Our cave system has been mapped for at least seven and a half miles worth of passageways that wind back into and throughout the mountainside.  \nWhen rounding the corner and seeing Russell Cave for the first time, think about the natural processes that went into creating this habitat where people would eventually make their home. Compare this to other sites or even your own home that needed human intervention to make it livable.",

Perhaps the water is rushing by below you, flowing from the normally dry riverbed.  Or you may be looking at the smallest trickle of water or somewhere in between.  All are possibilities and would have been for the people living here over thousands of years ago as well.  Dating back to around 10,000 BCE all four time periods recognized in the southeast would have seen people interacting with the cave in some respect.\nStarting at the earliest time period, the Paleolithic hunter-gatherers probably didn’t use the cave very regularly.  Sporadic use for a safe place to sleep while following food sources would have probably been the extent of use for these people.  As time moved on, the Archaic time period would begin around 8,000 BCE.  These people began to invent tools and devices that would make life overall easier.  One such invention was the atlatl, a stick that used a hook on the end to hurl spears further and with more force when hunting.  This time period is one of the longest in the Southeast history and this is probably when Russell Cave was used the most.  While it’s hard to know exactly how the cave was used, we can guess that with the cave being a dry, safe shelter that was close to water and therefore food sources, this was probably used extensively over the thousands of years.  At some points it may have been used seasonally, and others it may have been used year-round.  People may have moved on from it only for others to come across it and make it their home.  We don’t know the specifics, but we do know it was used quite a lot.\nConstantly creating and growing, people eventually began to find ways to make settling in one place easier to do.  During the Woodland period, people began to work with the idea of farming their own food rather than going out to find it.  The bow and arrow and pottery were also invented during this time period allowing for more time to be put into leisure activities and creativity now that food was basically taken care of as a necessity.  This then led into the final prehistoric time period in the southeast, the Mississippian period.  During this time villages were formed with their own governments, religions, and economies.   We believe that during and after this transition Russell Cave was probably used more as a stopping place along trade routes and as a known safe place to spend a night or two.  Think less of a home and more of an Airbnb.  \nEventually, conquistadors and colonizers would make their way to this area and disrupt the cultures and lives of those living around Russell Cave.  Never again would this site serve as a home to the tribes that first settled this land.  As you make your way to the cave shelter, consider a place or item that has been shared with a multiple generations in your family.  Would you see your connection to your gone family members differently if you didn’t have that place or thing to remember them by?",

For thousands of years, other humans have looked into this cave and felt a whole range of emotions.  Perhaps awe at the large opening, relief of finding shelter, or perhaps the love and comfort of coming home.  Others more recently may have also felt curiosity for the wonders hidden under the earth you stand upon.  \nLong known as a cave where stone points could sometimes be found, it wasn’t until a surveyor for the Tennessee Valley Authority and member of the Chattanooga chapter of the Tennessee Archeological Society was shown this site by the locals that anyone thought there may be more to Russell Cave than a cool cave and swimming area.  In 1953, the Tennessee archeological society would begin a dig that was immediately recognized as massive and then contact the Smithsonian Institute to ensure the most care and resources were given to this special site.  From 1956 to 1958 the Smithsonian Institute would lead a major excavation, going over 32 feet into the ground and finding artifacts that would later be dated to about 10,000 BCE.   The National Geographic Society purchased the land that Russell Cave sits on and would eventually donate the land to the American people.  Due to the massive amount of evidence found of human occupation, President John F. Kennedy decided to declare Russell Cave a National Monument in 1961 for everyone to have the chance to learn from and enjoy.  Once the National Park Service took over, another dig was planned, and ten and a half feet were excavated where you can now see the concrete lined pit.  Overall, close to three tons worth of artifacts were found ranging through all four of the time periods found in the southeast.  \nWe now work to protect this site for future generations to enjoy.  While no more excavations are planned, we hope that future technologies will be able to glean even more information from what has been left behind.  Keeping artifacts and their surroundings safe is extremely important as removing even one piece can mean losing a part of the story.  Each artifact acts as a piece in the puzzle of the past, and the more pieces that are missing, the less we will get know about those that came before us.  \nBefore you head back to the visitor center or embark on our trail, take a moment to consider all the things that you use every day.  How each of those items has been personalized to you, how everything has a purpose, even if it’s just to make you happy, and how all of them combined tell the story of who you are.  Imagine leaving all these things behind for future archeologists to find.  As it is right now, they would probably tell a pretty good story.  But over time some things will deteriorate and maybe completely disappear.  Other things may be passed down through the family and end up in totally different places, and other stuff may be taken by a passerby who sees something cool.  Eventually, your story will be harder and harder to tell, and you will be more of a guess than a whole story.  Keep this in mind as you explore the world around you and be thinking about the stories that have been left behind for us to figure out and learn from.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this tablet guided tour of Russell Cave.  Please be sure to return this tablet back to the ranger at the front desk, and feel free to ask them any questions you may have had along the way.  Have a great rest of you visit, and a wonderful rest of you day.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Welcome to Guilford Courthouse National Military Park! Founded in 1917, this was the first National Park to ever preserve a battlefield of the American Revolution. Today the park is over 250 acres, preserving a unique battlefield and a beautiful forest. \nFor your safety today, any time you are on the tour road, stay to the left side which is labeled with the pedestrian symbol, and share the road with vehicles and cyclists.\nYour tour will take you over 1 ½ miles from your first to your last stop. \n\nYou are at the site of the largest field battle to occur in the Southern Colonies during the war. Over 6300 soldiers took part in 2 ½ hours of fighting here. \nBut how and why did two large armies fight in the central piedmont region of North Carolina? This would have been a sparsely populated section of the poorest rebelling colony. \nTo answer that question, we need to understand what events led us to this point, and we can do that by breaking the American War of Independence down into 3 major phases.\nThe First Phase of the war began in 1775 in Massachusetts. After a decade of protests and antagonism over how the British Empire should be run, and what role the colonies would play within it, troops were sent to occupy Boston and enforce the Coercive Acts. These actions were in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party, which occurred at the end of 1773.\nThe British wanted to make an example of Boston to prevent any further acts of rebellion, get repayment for the destroyed tea, and restore some sense of order in America. Fighting began when British troops clashed with Americans at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. They soon found themselves surrounded in Boston, with rebels from several colonies swarming the countryside. By early 1776 the British were forced to evacuate Boston, but both they and their American opponents knew that the British army would return soon enough.\nIn the summer of 1776, the new United States declared independence on July 4, and just a month later the British returned, landing an army in New York to begin the second phase of the war. This phase sees the British trying to fight the Americans as though they were a foreign enemy. They sought decisive battles, seized crucial ports, and also tried to cut New England off from the other colonies. Now,  despite repeated battlefield successes, the British were unable to crush the rebellion, and slowly realized this was a different kind of war, a war that would require winning the hearts and minds of the people.\nWhen a British army surrendered at Saratoga, New York in 1777, the face of the war changed again. The French, who were already supplying the Americans with weapons and war materials, entered the war and would now contribute their army and navy to the American cause. This change of events led the British to change strategy, and leads us to the third and final phase of the war, the Southern Phase.\n\nThe reason the British army came to the South was to reclaim its most profitable colonies, and to recruit loyalists. With the French in the war, the British needed to send more men and more ships to protect the rest of their empire. With less men for North America, they hoped loyalists could help fill the gap in manpower. These colonists who stayed dedicated to the Crown were the British army’s biggest hope in the Southern theater.\nThe British initially captured Savannah Georgia in 1778, then defended it from French and American forces in 1779. By 1780, the British were ready for their full-scale invasion, capturing an American army in Charleston in May, then spreading out into the backcountry, establishing forts and outposts all through South Carolina and Georgia. In August, another American army was sent to stop the British tide, but it was routed at the Battle of Camden. It seemed the British would soon be moving into North Carolina, but resistance fighters in the countryside, sickness in camp, and the devastating defeat of British loyalists at the Battle of King’s Mountain in October, stopped the British momentum as winter set in at the end of 1780.\n\nIn December 1780, a new American commander arrived to take control of the forces in the south. Major General Nathanael Greene was a former Quaker and a self-taught military man who had served in the Continental army since the siege of Boston. A combat commander and former quartermaster general, this was his first independent command in the war.\nFacing Greene was General Charles Cornwallis. An aggressive and skilled combat commander, Cornwallis had previous command experiences before the War of Independence. The south was also his first totally independent command, but he was slowly growing frustrated with the slow process of pacifying the countryside. \nAs the year 1781 began, these two commanders could not have realized they were about to embark on a campaign that would shift the war in a new direction.",

                    "audioTranscript": "A few points of reference as we get started on our tour. You are now at the Hoskins Farm Site on the western boundary of the battlefield. The Guilford Courthouse, which no longer stands, would have been at the far eastern boundary of the battlefield, near modern day Tour Stop 6. The only major road at the time of the battle would have been the New Garden Road running west to east up the middle of the battlefield. Today the modern New Garden Road runs right up to the park’s main gate, then becomes a gravel walking trail the rest of the way to the court house site.\nIf you would like to learn more about the Hoskins Family, what brought them here, and what their farm was like, there is a separate, 4 stop, audio tour you can take of the farm site.\n\nNow, back to the battle. March 15, 1781 dawned damp and cold. The British army were on the road by 5 a.m. determined to not let the Americans get away. What they didn’t know was that the Americans had stopped running. Greene’s army received numerous reinforcements in the week leading up to the battle. Where once, the two armies were equal in size, the American rebels now outnumbered the British two to one. Greene’s army had approximately 4400 troops to General Cornwallis’ 2100 soldiers.\nLight Horse Harry Lee led a portion of American cavalry and infantry out early that morning to keep an eye on the British and provide a warning of their approach. His men clashed with the men of Tarleton’s British legion early that morning at another Quaker settlement only 4 miles from where you are located, called New Garden. At some point in the fighting, Banastre Tarleton lost two fingers when a musket ball smashed into his sword hand. But Tarleton quickly received treatment, and he still led the cavalry when they arrived here later in the morning. \nJust before NOON on March 15, 1781, the British army began gathering at the Hoskins farm, and started deploying for battle. As they did so, their artillery, which would have been on the New Garden Road to your north, fired up the road at the Continental Artillery which sat in the middle of the American first line. \nIf we were here in 1781, the ground to your east, between the Hoskins farm and the American first line, would have contained several large, open farm fields, about 400 yards in length. The fields would be enclosed by fences like the ones you see at the farm today. Across those fields, we would be able to see the North Carolina Militia, over 1100 strong, waiting for the oncoming British attack. But where is the rest of the American army? The British cannot see it through the woods, and they know they are outnumbered, but they are still determined to launch an attack. While they appreciate the ability of militia to fight like guerilla fighters, they do not respect the American ability to fight in a traditional field battle. They plan to march up, deliver a volley then drive the rebels away with the bayonet. For weeks, they have tried to force the Americans to stop retreating and fight them, hoping for the opportunity to route the American Army from the field like they did at the Battle of Camden. \nBut what the British soldiers don’t know is that Greene has deployed his army into 3 defensive lines. The first line that they can see is made up of North Carolina Militia. A second line waits further in the forest. These men are Virginia militia. Beyond them, near the courthouse is General Greene’s third and main line of defense, made up of professional continental soldiers. The plan is that the first two lines will deliberately give way after causing casualties and wreaking havoc to British organization. Greene’s hope was that by the time the British reached the third American line, they would be worn down, disorganized, and vulnerable to a devastating defeat by the Continentals.\nBy 12:30, the British Army was deployed all around you, facing east. It was time for Cornwallis to launch his infantry attack, and at our next stop, we will witness the beginning of what would be over 2 hours of merciless fighting.\n\nProceed out the back gate of the Hoskins Farm Site, and turn left, walking up Green Acres lane.

                    "audioTranscript": "You are now at the Crown forces monument. Dedicated in 2016, this monument is meant to commemorate all the men who served the British cause here. Cornwallis, confidently leads into battle several of the finest regiments in the British Army whose colorful names and long histories speak of proud service to king and country. The elite Brigade of Guards, led by Charles O’Hara, stand in reserve behind the main battle line along with troops of Loyalist and British cavalry under Banastre Tarleton;. The 23rd Regiment of Foot (famously known as the Royal Welch Fusiliers); and the 33rd of Foot, advance on the north side of the New Garden Road, under the command of James Webster, and supported by a company of light infantry and a company of German riflemen called jaegers.  Where we are standing is where the 71st Highlanders would have crossed the farm field as they attacked the American first line. Off to our right in the woods, the Hessian Regiment Von Bose represented the British right flank in this initial attack. These units south of the new garden road are commanded by Alexander Leslie.\nSupporting these foot and mounted units are six guns of the Royal Artillery, 4 six pounder guns and two smaller 3 pounder guns, sometimes called “Grasshoppers”.\n\nIf you look towards the park tour road, that is where the American first line was located. A mere 60 yards from you is how far apart soldiers would typically be in this era before they fired volleys with their smoothbore muskets. A volley is when all of the soldiers fire at the same time. Their weapons were so inaccurate that they fired together to essentially create a devastating wall of bullets flying through the air, hoping that they would actually hit someone on the opposing side.\n  These 1,100 North Carolina militiamen were in two brigades divided by New Garden Road.  To north and south of them on their flanks were what would be called “Corps of Observation”--cavalry and infantry supported by riflemen. These Corps on the flanks are under the command of Colonels William Washington to the north and Henry Lee to the south.  In the center, on New Garden Road, were two six-pounder guns of the First Continental Artillery  under Captain Anthony Singleton. Aware of the militia’s limited military ability, Greene urged their two commanders, Generals Thomas Eaton and John Butler, to make a stand, fire two shots, but yield to British bayonets.  Their job wasn’t to try and stop the British. Their job was to weaken them by causing casualties.\n\nAs the British arrived at our position, the Americans fired a massive volley into them.\nThe redcoats returned fire and then charged the militia line with their bayonets.  Many of the militiamen at the center of the line broke and disappeared into the forest after only firing one shot.  A few continue to fire, then feeling their mission finished, rushed to join them.  less than half will be rallied at the courthouse.\n\nIn contrast, William Washington’s and Henry Lee’s forces on the far flanks retreat in proper military fashion.  Washington on the north falls back with Webster’s light infantry and German riflemen in rapid pursuit, while Lee’s men gradually moved southeast.  \nAs this happens, British infantry in the center paused at the fence to reform their tattered ranks and gaze back at their wounded comrades who littered the Hoskins’ farm fields. They then pushed into the woods, seeking out the rest of the American army. \n \nOn your way to the American second line, take time to examine the varied monuments. The vast majority of the Monuments at Guilford Courthouse were placed in the park in an era before it was owned by the National Park Service. In the 19th century a group of local businessmen formed the Guilford Battleground Company, and purchased the land for preservation but their ideas of how to use the battlefield were very different from the modern day mission of the National Park Service. The Original Battleground Company wanted the park to be a patriotic pleasure park and added shrubberies and even a man-made lake to the battlefield. They also reinterred several prominent North Carolinians from the Revolution here, some with ties to the battle, others with no direct involvement. \nAnother monument that is directly related to the fight here, is the Arthur Forbis monument, visible from where you are, beside the tour road with an interpretive sign beside it. Captain Forbis was a part of the Guilford militia, the militia of this very county. As they waited for the approaching British infantry that morning, his commanding officer saw a British officer mounted on horseback. Forbis carried a rifle that was more accurate than the common musket, and his commander asked Forbis if he could take out the officer. Forbis lined up his shot, fired and killed the officer. In the ensuing battle, Forbis was wounded and left on the battlefield until his family came searching for him and took him home.",

Here, 1,200 Virginia militiamen stand divided by the Road into two brigades commanded by Generals Robert Lawson, on the north, and Edward Stevens, on the south. You can imagine these men in an irregular line, extending parallel to the base of the General Greene monument. Greene has placed these men here because he knows the forest, like a vast maze, will confuse and slow down the British infantry and limit the use of their cavalry and artillery.  Although these Virginians are the citizen-soldiers of the militia, both brigades contain many ex-Continental soldiers and officers, veterans who will lead and help provide a steady example for their comrades.  \n\nThe light infantry and Jägers of Webster’s brigade far to our north, are moving in pursuit of Washington’s infantry, cavalry and riflemen, and reach the right flank of the Virginia line .Off to your right, General Lawson pushes some of his men forward, towards the modern day parking lot off to your right, trying to exploit the flank of Webster’s brigade, but in doing so, they expose their left flank to the approaching redcoats of the 23rd regiment and Guards Brigade, who would be directly approaching your current location.  Surprised by the sudden presence of more British troops, these militiamen flee with only a portion being halted and reformed by their officers.  The firefight in the woods here breaks into small unit actions as Webster’s redcoats push back Lawson’s Virginians and Washington’s infantry and riflemen to the north. At one point in the smoke and confusion, General Cornwallis, who has already had one horse shot out from under him, nearly rides into an ambush before a Sergeant of the Welch Fusiliers redirects him to safety.\nAs this end of the second line disintegrates, the south end of the line fights on for over 30 minutes. At our next stop, we will talk about the events on that end of the line.\n\n\nBe sure to check out the Nathanael Greene monument on your way to your next stop.

As a precaution, and to encourage their resistance, Stevens has placed picked men in low ground behind the line to shoot down any man who runs. Stevens has done this in part because he has suffered devastating defeat before. At the battle of Camden, it was his men who fled at the first shots and triggered the route of the American army. Stevens was determined to never let such a tragedy happen again.\n\nEmboldened, Stevens’ men retreat stubbornly.  After over 30 minutes of resistance, Stevens receives a severe wound in the thigh and it is only when that happens that the Virginia general finally gives the order to retreat.\n\nSomething that General Cornwallis does not realize is that with the collapse of the American second line, his ability to destroy the American army is actually getting weaker. The southern end of the British line has broken off in pursuit of remnants of the Virginia Militia and riflemen. As they drift away, they are not able to contribute to the main British attack along the New Garden road.\n\n That separate fight starts to form in what is now Forest Lawn Cemetery off to the south, on your left. As the British pushed through the woods, a section of Virginia militia had moved off to attack what it thought was an isolated British unit, the 1st battalion of guards. They pushed them south, up a rise, before the British regrouped and pushed the militia back to their starting position near where we currently stand. By the time this happens, the hessian Regiment Von Bose appears. They had been delayed due to the chaos of hand to hand fighting with the North Carolinians at the first line. But when they appear, the Virginians mistake them for allies. The Hessians are wearing Blue coats that appear very similar to the uniforms of the professional American soldiers, called Continentals. It is not until the Hessians unleash a point-blank blast of musket fire that the Virginians realize their error. But as the Virginians retreat to the southwest, The Hessians and Guards continue to pursue them, drifting farther and farther away from the main body of the British army, and deeper and deeper into woods now inhabited by militiamen, riflemen, and the troops of Light Horse Harry Lee’s Legion.\nAnd at our next stop, we will reveal how this separate comes to a surprising finish.\n\n\nWhen you are ready, follow the road left to Auto tour stop 4, the site of the Joseph Winston Monument.",

Unlike the smoothbore musket carried by the majority of soldiers on both sides of this battle, the rifle is accurate to distances of 2-300 yards. This is due to the rifle grooves on the inside of the barrel, that grip and spin the musket ball as it exits the weapon, giving it a reliable and predictable flight path. One thing we need to keep in mind about this weapon though, is that it takes a lot longer to reload than a musket. A trained soldier with a smoothbore could fire 3-4 shots per minute. That’s a shot every 15-20 seconds. For a rifleman, it took 45 second to a full minute to load and fire one shot. And most riflemen couldn’t put a bayonet on the end of their weapon like a musket. All the more reason for them to try and keep their distance from their enemies and rely on the accuracy of their weapons. \n\nThe separate fight, instigated by Lee’s withdrawal to the southeast, consumed much of the strength of the Von Bose Hessians and the First Guards. This extended back and forth battle raged across the area that is now the modern day Forest Lawn Cemetery and spilled into what is Greensboro Country Park directly to your south.  \nAs the Hessians and Guards push into the woods, they slowly get surrounded. The riflemen use the trees and the steep terrain to hide and reload before closing in and shooting at the disoriented professional troops. \n\nThe tide turned when Lee left the area. When the main battle was raging at the American third line near the courthouse, Lee departed to investigate what was happening. The asbsence of Lee’s infantry and cavalry left the riflemen and a few Virginia Militia to keep the battered Redcoats in check. But without the cavalry, they were left dangerously vulnerable just as Tarleton’s British Legion unexpectedly arrived to support the Guards. The First Guards and Von Bose Regiment could now reform, and they fired a deadly volley into the American line. Immediately, Tarleton’s cavalry charged ferociously into the Americans who now had no defense. During the final moments of the battle, the militia fled into the woods. Tarleton’s troopers saved the British and Hessian troops from annihilation.\n\nThe Monument you see here is topped with a statue of Major Joseph Winston and is dedicated to him and two officers under his command, Captain Jesse Franklin, and Lieutenant Richard Taliaferro. These men were engaged in the separate fight here, but Lt. Taliaferro didn’t survive. As Tarleton’s final charge crashed home, the militia fled to their horses, but Taliaferro was shot and killed as he went to mount his horse. \n\n\nWinston would go on to survive the war and serve in the state legislature and congress. In 1849, when Forsyth county was created, the county seat was named after him. Over time it slowly grew and meshed with another village, forming the modern-day city of Winston-Salem.\nFranklin served in the United States Senate and was briefly Governor of North Carolina in the 19th century. Both men were not initially buried here, and had their bodies moved here by the Guilford Battleground Company in the 1890s. Underneath the tree to your right, you can also see the burial site of Winston and Franklin.  Taliaferro is believed to have been buried on the battlefield, but the site of his hasty burial is unknown.\n\n\nFollow the Park’s tour road down the steep slope and passing by tour stop 5.

Arrayed along the high ground in front of you are Two brigades Greene’s best troops. At the time of the battle the area you now stand in would have been cleared fields just like the Hoskins farm, and a strip of land south of the new garden road would have been clear as well. \n\n  The brigade on the left end of the American third line, directly to your front, consists of two regiments of Continentals from Maryland and Delaware under Colonel Otho H. Williams; the regiments on the right side, off to your left, are two regiments of Virginia 18-month Troops under General Isaac Huger. Between these two brigades are two six-pounder guns under Lieutenant Ebenezer Finley. At the left end of the line, with the 2nd Maryland, are the two six pounder guns of Anthony singleton.\n\n\nTo our north, your left, the first British troops appear and attempt an attack on the American third line.\nLt. Col. James Webster is Cornwallis’s most aggressive commander.  His light infantry and Jägers hound William Washington’s troops through the forest from ravine to ravine.  Finally, Washington’s men exit from the forest and cross the wooded ravine to our north and quickly reform on the far northern end of the third line, which is beyond the modern park boundary.\nAs the battle begins approaching his last line, General Greene grows cautious.  To protect his main retreat route he dispatches Colonel John Green’s Virginia regiment across the road toward the Reedy Fork Creek crossing, two miles north.  Sensing an attack by Webster’s redcoats, Greene orders Colonel John Gunby’s First Maryland, a regiment of seasoned veterans, to swing right and fire into the lone British unit as it appears. \nInstead of facing you, their line would swing like a gate, and would now be facing to your left.\n\nAs soon as the 33rd regiment of foot arrives, they sweep down the steep slope just to the north of the modern tour road.   The First Maryland Regiment are now in a position to rake their right flank with fire, and with Washington and Hawes attacking them in front, they pour in deadly volleys of musket fire.  One ball strikes General Webster, seriously wounding him in the knee.  In pain, the British commander orders a withdrawal and the 33rd regiment retreats back up the slope until more British troops can arrive.\n\nComing out of the forest on the new Garden Road to your right, the Second Guards enter the open ground at the third line, we are standing close to where their left flank would pass.  With them rides Cornwallis followed by two three-pounder guns of the Royal Artillery.\n\nOpposing them on the south end of the third line is Colonel Benjamin Ford’s Second Maryland, a new regiment whose men are entering battle for the first time. These men swing their left flank forward as they try to push into the field to cover the rear of the First Maryland and oppose the approaching Second Guards.  As the Guards approach, the Second Maryland hesitate and adjust their line.  Suddenly, the Guards surge forward, catching Ford’s men off balance.  The Marylanders fire an ineffectual volley and, much to the disgust of their officers, break, and dissolve into the woods behind.  The Guards, now unopposed, eagerly take advantage of the situation to move upon the rest of Greene’s last line. \nBut thanks to the quick thinking and initiative of a few commanders close buy, the battle is not yet lost for Greene’s army.\n\n\nContinue along the foot trail up the other side of the vale.

The guards swung north hoping to roll up the American third line but Greene reacted immediately, ordering Colonel Gunby to turn his Marylanders around and stop the Guards.  As they faced about, William Washington’s horsemen, thundering south down the Reedy Fork Road with sabers drawn, charged into the Guards.  Now turned, the First Maryland fired on the Guards at point blank range. With Lieutenant Colonel John Eager Howard leading them, the Marylanders charged forward, trapping the Guards between the bayonet and the saber in a vicious hand-to-hand contest. All around you, these soldiers were gripped in vicious fighting.\n\nOn a slight rise on the west side of the field, where the modern-day tour road meets the historic New Garden Road, Cornwallis and Guards commander General O’Hara, witnessed the Guards caught in this two-sided attack. As Washington’s horsemen completely plowed through the redcoat ranks, they turned to strike again.  At this moment, Cornwallis made a snap decision—he ordered the Royal Artillery’s three-pounder guns, loaded with “grapeshot”, to fire on the American cavalry before they either charged back into the Guards or turned to capture him and the guns.  Clusters of iron projectiles shot through the air and cut down men and horses, Marylanders, and even some of the Guards Battalion!  Washington’s horsemen gallop off under this destructive fire.  Cornwallis’ terrible gamble saved the Guards.\n\nAs more redcoats emerged from the woods to the south and west, Howard ordered the First Maryland to withdraw and join the rest of the army moving north on the Reedy Fork Road. The American army was now in full retreat to its camps at Troublesome Creek, 12 miles away.\n\n\nProceed up the trail and get back on the Historic New Garden Trail.

                    "audioTranscript": "Greene’s army was in full retreat. Cornwallis sent the 23rd and 71st regiments in pursuit of the American army, capturing the last of Greene’s artillery and all its ammunition. Two miles north they encountered a line of Continentals drawn up in defense of a ford.  After marching and fighting since early morning, these exhausted British regiments were stopped by one powerful volley and decided to return to the battlefield. Greene’s retreating army continued north toward its camp.  The Battle was over in this area, but it did not truly end until that separate fight that we covered at tour stop 5 was finally resolved by the charge of Tarleton’s Cavalry.\n\n Fighting to destroy their enemy, Cornwallis’s army suffered 27% casualties, losses they could ill afford so far from re-supply and reinforcement.  In contrast, Greene’s defeated army suffered far less, and in a few days it began to recover its strength. In the immediate aftermath of the battle, houses and buildings within a few miles of the courthouse became shelters for the wounded and dying. Both armies provided doctors to help treat the men. They are aided by camp followers, the women that were employed by the army and helped to nurse the soldiers, and they are also aided by the local Quakers. Despite being pacifists, the Quakers felt that it was their duty to help treat the men and try to ease their suffering.\n\nOn March 17, Cornwallis marched his battered army out of Guilford Courthouse and  Greene pursued.  After Cornwallis turned southeast toward British-held Wilmington on the coast of North Carolina, the American general chose to head back to South Carolina and begin a campaign against the British and loyalist garrisons that lasted until 1782.  At Wilmington, Cornwallis decided to abandon the Carolinas, move his tired troops into Virginia, and join British forces already there. Tired of trying to win Hearts and Minds, Cornwallis returned to destructive offensive operations in Virginia. His hope was that he could cut off men and supplies from reaching General Greene, forcing the American commander to abandon the Carolinas.\n\nUltimately the overall British commander, Sir Henry Clinton, ordered Cornwallis to secure a naval base on the Chesapeake where he could be reinforced and resupplied. Their hope was for a new campaign in Virginia in 1782.\n But to their shock, at Yorktown in October, Cornwallis surrendered to the combined French and American armies under General George Washington and General Rochambeau. These armies had managed to sneak away from the British in New York and catch Cornwallis by surprise, while the French navy trapped him by sea. \n\nIt is the surrender at Yorktown that finally breaks British spirits. No longer able to muster the political will to fight, Parliament had to pursue peace and recognition of American Independence.\n\n\nGuilford Courthouse was one of the many battles that made this possible. Along with the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, they prevented British pacification of North Carolina, and frustrated Cornwallis so badly that he made the rash decision of moving into an isolated position in Virginia. \n\nThe war formally ended in 1783, but it would take the people of the former colonies many more years to recover from the death and destruction of their war for Independence. \nFor the enslaved, most saw no change in their status in this society, while many others escaped to freedom with the British when they evacuated. \nFor the native peoples of the western frontier, it was the beginning of unrelenting invasion and war as their American neighbors sought more and more land. \nFor thousands of loyalists, the result was being forced to flee the only homeland they had ever known. For others, they managed to stay in America and find some level of normalcy within their new circumstances.\nFor most who supported the rebellion, this was the birth of a new era of liberty. Life under a government of their own design.\n\nWe hope you have enjoyed your tour of the battlefield. Please be sure to stop by the Visitors Center to see artifacts recovered from the battlefield and be sure to check out our park website for more information. \nThe quickest way back to the visitor center is to follow the Historic New Garden Trail. \n\nThank you for visiting!

The resulting caldera filled with water, forming an extension of Yellowstone Lake. The lake resembles the shape of a human hand, and West Thumb is the large western bay that would be the thumb. \n\nThe waters of Yellowstone Lake are the lifeblood for a large network of plant and animal communities. As you walk the geyser basin and enjoy views of the lake, you might see trumpeter swans, pelicans, eagles, and other wildlife. \n\nPlease note: Thermal activity occurs throughout this area. Stay on the boardwalk at all times. \n\nBecause of the dynamic nature of the features along this tour, you may complete the tour in as little as a half-hour or be out for an hour or more. Before heading out, a few safety notes: \n\nIt can be windy, so cinch down your hats and secure personal items. \n\nStay on the boardwalks and established trails at all times. Superheated water is just below a thin crust throughout the basin. Besides the high chance of breaking through the crust and causing bodily injury or death, leaving the trail can damage hydrothermal features—ruining the experience for everyone. \n\nBoardwalks can be slippery when wet or covered in snow. \n\nWatch for wildlife and maintain the minimum safe distance of 25 yards (2 bus-lengths) from any wildlife—and 100 yards (8 bus-lengths) from bears or wolves. \n\nThe trail is .5 mile (.8 km) around the outer boardwalk loop, and .25 mi (.4 km) around the inner loop. This tour follows the outer loop first and the inner boardwalk second.  \n \nReady? Head on to the next stop: Thumb Paint Pots.",

Downey Street was the entrance into West Branch from the south. If you look up and down the road, you can still find scattered hitching posts in front of several of the homes. \n(music) In 1870, the U.S. census counted Iowa’s population at almost 1.2 million. The towns and farms that now covered the state had, within a single generation, replaced the traditional American Indian uses of the land. Herbert Hoover’s grandfather, Eli Hoover, was one of the first few settlers of West Branch, arriving by covered wagon in 1854. When the census takers came sixteen years later, the town’s population stood at about 200.  But the railroad’s arrival in West Branch that same year helped the town’s rapid expansion into a thriving agricultural and business centered community.  \nDuring Herbert Hoover’s childhood, the intersection of Downey and Main was the town crossroads. Although several of the streets that existed historically have been moved or no longer exist, you can still see the road trace of the original Downey Street as it runs past the little Birthplace Cottage. Because it wasn’t far, the Hoover family walked down this street into town to do their shopping.\n(sound effects: birds chirping) Did you notice how most of the homes along this street have either four-board or picket fencing in their front yards? For modern-day homeowners, what looks like a decorative choice was actually one of necessity for the folks living on Downey Street. When “Bertie” Hoover was a boy, he probably saw local farmers drive their livestock to market down the middle of this wide street - right past his front door.(sound effects: horse and buggy, cows, pigs) But if it weren’t for those fences, a stray pig or cow might have actually wound up eating the vegetables in his mother’s garden or stepping on the tulips in their front yard!\nIn the 1870’s, the streets of West Branch were either “dusty thoroughfares or muddy bogs.” (sound effects: rain, horse and buggy) When it rained Downey Street would turn sticky with mud and lots of wagon wheel ruts. It wasn’t unusual to see a team of oxen or even a horse and buggy get stuck. At the time of Hoover’s birth in 1874, West Branch didn’t have sidewalks. However, by 1885 the city had finished over three and a half miles of wood plank walkways. The sidewalks here today are representations of those late 19th century boardwalks; they may be slippery when wet, so please watch your step.",

(sound effects: talking, laughing, fireworks) Here during the hot Midwest summers, Dr. Leech held ice cream socials church groups and 4th of July celebrations for the whole town. His lawn parties grew in popularity when box supper socials to benefit the volunteer fire company became an annual event. The West Branch Times wrote, \"All gentlemen are invited to come and buy a box and take supper with your own or someone's best girl!\", \nAlthough this home was built many years after Herbert Hoover's childhood, there is still a connection between the physician who practiced medicine in West Branch for 55 years and the young boy who left and became the nation's 31st President. When Dr. Leech passed away at the age of 91 in 1937, services were held at the West Branch Methodist Church. Herbert Hoover, ever guided by the understanding that it takes a community to raise a child, sent a personal message of sympathy that was read at the funeral. In it, the former President remembered and praised Dr. Leech's \"long life of usefulness to the community and loyalty to his neighbors and friends.\", \nIf you haven't been there already, you can go one block west to learn about the historic West Branch homes located on Poplar Street.",

In 1870, Miles had married Hulda's younger sister, Agnes Minthorn, just five days after Hulda and Jesse Hoover were wed. Now they were settling down with a family of their own.\nThere was much visiting back and forth between the Miles and Hoover homes, and the two families became close friends. The short walk on Downey Street often brought the Hoover children, Tad, Bertie, and Mary, together with their cousins for playtime or a shared pot of soup that had spent the day simmering on a wood stove. But their time together was short-lived.\nIn the spring of 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Miles to serve as an agent responsible for the care and education of the Osage and Kaw tribes in the Oklahoma territory. When Laban, Agnes and their children left that summer, they rented their home first to the Methodist Church for a parsonage, and then to Dr. L.J. Leech, a well-known and respected physician in West Branch.\nBut the ties between the Miles and Hoover families remained strong. Following Jesse Hoover's death, Laban Miles asked Hulda if his nephew could come to live with them on the Osage reservation. In 1882, eight-year-old Herbert spent eight months there with his aunt, uncle and cousins. For the future President, they were memories that lasted a lifetime.",

This 3-level wooden barn, part of the Miles Farmstead, is the only agricultural structure in the area that survives from the time when Hoover was a young boy.\n(sound effects: native birds) Isaac Miles was a widower with two young daughters when he moved to West Branch in 1874 and opened a drugstore. Three years later, he met and married a young woman, who had inherited 100 acres of farmland to the southwest of the Hoover cottage. So Miles sold his drugstore and decided to give farming a try. And as soon as the two-story frame house and barn were built, the new family moved in. Isaac's daughters, Providence and Abbie were around the same age as the Hoover children, and it's likely they played together in this rural playground filled with natural wonders.\n(music) Iowa farmsteads were laid out according to the character of the land. Rolling hills could serve as pasture or as a partial support for buildings like a barn. Where the ground was flat, crops were planted; (sound effects: chickens, rooster) outbuildings like chicken coops were constructed close to the home, but definitely downwind, to make for a short walk in the winter. And a road was leveled to give the farmer access to railroads and markets where he could sell his harvest. \nAn 1880 census showed that Miles had managed to get 73 acres under cultivation with corn, oats, rye, potatoes, and apples. He also raised 5 milk cows, 5 beef cattle, 55 pigs, and 20 chickens. Farming did provide for Isaac and his family, but in 1882, Isaac became involved with his father Benjamin in the establishment of a Quaker-inspired school to educate Native American children in the industrial arts. It was during this time, when some of the Osage, Cheyenne, and Arapaho children lived and worked on the Miles Farm, that 8-year old Bert Hoover fished and hunted the countryside with them, learned the lore of the woods, and how to make bows and arrows.",

These beliefs and practices dictate how humans relate to water, animals, plants, the land, each other, and the Creator.\n\nAbiding by tamáalwıt, Native Peoples enjoyed stable cultural and political communities coupled with sustained economic success. Native people of the Columbia Plateau were connected to each other and other nations across the continent by an extensive trade network. Through this network, weyíıletpuu people exchanged horses, camas, and more for everything from dentalium and abalone from coastal nations to bison hides from plains nations.\n\nThe Cayuse Nation is made up of multiple bands. In the early to mid-1800’s, tílewkeỷkt was the leader of the band that lived here each winter. Around that same time, foreigners began entering weyíiletpuu homeland looking for beaver and other animals. The fur trade was booming, and they were looking to profit. These newcomers built off the existing Native trade network, relying on the knowledge and infrastructure of Native peoples. Trading posts were built by competing American and British fur companies. One of these posts was built in 1818 on the Columbia River 25 miles west of here. This post became Fort Walla Walla, operated by the Hudson’s Bay Company. Much closer, just two miles from here, a small community of retired fur trappers received permission from weyíıletpuu leaders to build homes along the Walla Walla River beginning in 1823. Many members of this community were French Canadian or Métis, having both Native and French-Canadian heritage.",

When tílewkeỷkt gave the missionaries permission to build a mission here, the expectation was that they would participate in a reciprocal relationship by giving back to the community. It was a surprise when the Whitmans instead put up fences, put locks on their doors, and kept Native people out of their house. For the Whitmans, these measures were an attempt to recreate their concepts of “civilization” and safety.\n\nThe missionaries and weyíiletpuu people entered this relationship with different expectations of each other which quickly dissolved into disappointment and frustration for everyone.

The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) was one organization in search of missionaries to send beyond the borders of the United States. In 1836, the ABCFM recruited Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, Henry and Eliza Spalding, and William Gray to spread Christianity in what was then known as Oregon Country.\n\nUpon the missionary party’s arrival in the pášx̣apa valley in the fall of 1836, the actual location of the mission was still undecided. The ABCFM had originally set aside funding for a single mission in the Oregon Country. What they had not planned for was the amount of personal discord that led to the mission party refusing to settle together.

Their idea of a civilized Christian society involved staying in one place, and that is what they planned to re-create here. To them, the traditional weyíiletpuu lifestyle was “uncivilized” and lacked value. What could they do to convince this community to stay in one place year-round?\n\nThey hoped agriculture would be the answer.\n\nBut for many weyíiletpuu families, agriculture meant giving up much more than they gained. Staying in one spot meant losing opportunities to trade and socialize with other bands and nations. Not only was agriculture a complete change of lifestyle, it would be a change to a less sustainable system. Farming meant trying to cultivate crops imported from the east that were not as well suited for the land and the climate here.\n\nIn reports sent back to the ABCFM in 1844, Marcus wrote:\n “You will excuse me for want of particulars about the Indians and things in general, for my time is so occupied between attending to the Mill, the sowing of my wheat, attention to the wants of my family and the supply of the Imigrants that little time is left for writing.” \n\nThe Cayuse continued working with the missionaries, but the missionaries’ attention was quickly shifting to the immigrants arriving from the United States.\n\nThe rising flood of immigrants led to rising tensions at weyíiletpe. At times, the gristmill was at the center of the growing frustration. After a particularly heated argument regarding the mill, Tomahas threw sticks into the mill and attacked Marcus. Tilewkikt stepped in to stop Tomahas. During a separate but similar incident, Tomahas told Marcus that he should leave permanently.

Gray sent letters to Reverend David Greene, the secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) who had appointed each of the missionaries. Fellow Oregon missionaries Asa Smith and Cornelius Rogers sent letters to Greene, too. Each letter spoke poorly of the other missionaries’ character, ability, and competence.\n\nBecause of the long-winded and detailed complaints that they received from Oregon, the ABCFM decided to put an end to the mission stations at weyíiletpe and lapwai, relieve the Spaldings, Grays, and Smiths of their duties, and send the Whitmans to the Tshimakain station. It was suggested that the Rogers go north with the Whitmans. Greene wrote:\n\n“It seems to be the unanimous opinion of you all… that your company can not live & labor together… This is to the Committee extremely painful and humiliating. It is an alternative to which they have never been brought by any other mission; & which for the honor of the cause, they trust may never occur again.”\n\nIt took a full two years to receive a response to a letter sent across the continent. By the time the missionaries received Greene’s orders, the Grays and Smiths had already left and the disagreements among the remaining missionaries had seemingly passed. But the ABCFM’s orders stood. Without delay, the Oregon missionaries decided to send Dr. Whitman to the ABCFM in Boston. When he returned, he brought news: all the mission stations would remain active.

                    "audioTranscript": "When wave after wave of immigrants began settling in the region and even being housed at the mission station, some weyíiletpuu people began to question the missionaries’ intentions, especially when it came to Dr. Whitman.\n\nAt first, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) generally supported the Whitmans’ dual focus on incoming immigrants and the Cayuse People. By 1846, though, it seemed that the Whitmans were neglecting their designated purpose in favor of supplying the\n\nimmigrants coming into Oregon Country. In a letter dated April 6, 1846, Rev. David Greene of the ABCFM wrote to Marcus:\n\n“Still we are not quite sure that you ought to devote so much time and thought to feeding the emigrants, and thus make your station a great restaurant for the weary pilgrims on their way to their promised land. Such a work is a very humane & good work; but the work of guiding men to Christ is a better one and coincides better with the vocation of a missionary laborer.”\n\nPerhaps the ABCFM began to worry because the number of immigrants from the United States was growing exponentially and could therefore take up an exponential amount of the Whitmans’ time. Perhaps they worried because the weyíiletpuu mission, which by that time had been active for ten years, had not yet officially welcomed a single soul into the church. Though many Cayuse people adopted parts of Christianity, none met the extensive membership requirements upheld by the missionaries.\n\nConcern was growing throughout the surrounding Cayuse communities as well. The flood of immigrants on which the Whitmans seemed so intently focused had brought with them a deadly stowaway: measles.\n\nIn 1847, a measles epidemic swept through the area. It was not the first time the Cayuse had encountered measles- unfamiliar diseases had been making their way into the Pacific Northwest since European and American travelers had begun interacting with the peoples of the region- but this was a particularly deadly outbreak. Up to six Cayuse people died each day, mostly children and the elderly. This death rate was especially alarming. Many American immigrants got sick as well, but far fewer died from the disease.",

To meet their definition of religious conversion, the missionaries also asked the Cayuse to learn English and abandon their native languages, to adopt settled agriculture, and to upend Cayuse cultural norms. The Whitmans took actions to distance themselves from weyíiletpuu individuals and culture which complicated their task. How does one build relationships and teach about language, farming, and religion, when space is not made at home for the people one wishes to teach",

                    "audioTranscript": "Some of the tensions surrounding the mission were caused by two poisoning incidents. The first involved William Gray. When a few of his watermelons were taken, Gray was upset. He put emetic, a substance that induces vomiting, into some of the remaining melons to deter others from taking more. A few weyíiletpuu men ate some of the contaminated watermelons and became sick. The emetic was from Whitman’s medical supplies. Since Whitman had supplied the emetic, he was blamed for the incident.\n\nLater, some arsenic-poisoned meat was placed out to protect the mission’s livestock from wolves. Unfortunately, Cayuse men saw the meat going to waste and ate it, not knowing that it was tainted. The men survived but developed a severe rash, a symptom of arsenic poisoning.\n\nEach of these incidents was a seed of doubt in the minds of the weyíiletpuu people.\n\nMaking things worse, news of Indian Removal in the United States had traveled to Oregon Country along with stories from the Pacific Coast of a trader threatening to unleash disease if Native peoples did not cooperate with his trading post. Later in 1847, when measles struck, many Cayuse people fell ill and developed a severe rash. The similarities between the measles rash and the rash from the arsenic poisoning, as well as news coming from other Indian nations, fed suspicions regarding the missionaries’ involvement.\n\nDr. Whitman had stepped into a medical role knowing that he would be held to the standards of a tıwáat, a weyíiletpuu doctor. He knew that the weyíiletpuu penalty for malpractice was death. During the measles epidemic, Dr. Whitman treated both Americans and Cayuse patients. Despite using the same treatments, fewer Americans died under his care. Many Cayuse people questioned the doctor’s abilities and motives and wondered if the Cayuse deaths were intentional.\n\nDr. Whitman was cautioned multiple times, by various groups, that he was endangering himself if he stayed. On November 28th, 1847, as measles raged, Whitman was once again warned to leave the mission. He did not heed the warning. That night, a small group of men led by tílewkeykt finalized their plan to save their communities from measles: killing Dr. Whitman. By evening of the following day, both missionaries and many of the adult men at the mission were dead. Over the following month, the 47 people remaining at the mission site were held hostage.",

With the mission closed this branch of the Oregon Trail was abandoned, but waves of American immigrants continued to travel into and through Cayuse homeland. Militias were hastily formed in the Willamette Valley in a frenzied response to the attack. Even those who didn’t join militias wanted revenge. The regional newspaper, The Oregon Spectator, called for the Cayuse to “…be hunted as beasts of prey…” and “…their name and race be blotted from the face of the earth.” These quotes show that though there were only a small group of men who were involved, the entire Cayuse Nation was blamed and vilified for the events.\n\nJust three months later, the Oregon Volunteer Militia began waging war on the weyíiletpuu nation. From 1848 to 1850, weyíiletpuu families hid and fled from armed forces who disrupted seasonal harvests, stole livestock, and pushed entire communities to the edge of starvation. To end the persecution, weyíiletpuu leaders surrendered five men to the army.\n\nNews of the attack on the mission station had quickly traveled back to the United States, where reactions were also severe. As a direct result, the United States formed Oregon Territory in August 1848, encompassing most of the present-day states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and surrounding the Cayuse Nation. The new Oregon Territorial Government put the five surrendered men, collectively referred to as the Cayuse Five, on trial for the death of Dr. Whitman in 1851. From the beginning there were questions over jurisdiction. Witnesses also failed to identify some of the defendants as the attackers. And yet, all five were quickly convicted, hanged, and buried in an unmarked grave. Descendants of the Cayuse Five are still seeking justice for their ancestors.\n\nIn 1855 weyíiletpuu leaders, along with leaders from other Native nations, met with U.S. officials near the present-day town of Walla Walla to negotiate a treaty. After ensuring some of their most important lands were reserved for exclusive use, these leaders signed a treaty to share other lands with the expanding United States. This agreement between nations is still in effect today; it guarantees certain rights and activities to members of the nations that signed.",

Over time, misconceptions surrounding Oral Tradition have been dispelled and it is now recognized as a valuable source of information on the past. As a result, this history has been told many different ways and has had many different legacies.\n\nA one-sided version of this history was reinforced by the physical monuments placed here during and after the mission-period. The missionaries and their descendants wanted to demonstrate their presence through physical markers: buildings, monuments, gravestones, and changes to the landscape.  While there is no physical monument to the weyíiletpuu within the park, the Cayuse people of the past are memorialized through the continued sovereignty of the Cayuse Nation. Weyíiletpuu people are still living on the lands of their ancestors and continue to keep their memory alive through their culture. \n\nWe are left with legacies that are not easy or comfortable to face because of the decisions made here. All the people who were here experienced tragedy and trauma that has reverberated across generations. Today, all who live in this region, and this nation, still struggle with the implications of this history.

                    "audioTranscript": "In 1864, for the fourth time in three years, the US Army of the Potomac crossed the Rappahannock and Rapidan Rivers on the offensive. In 1862 and 1863, bad luck and lackluster leadership prevented the Army from decisively defeating the Confederates in their territory. But by the end of 1863, the war seemed like it had taken a turn thanks to three major US victories. Ulysses S. Grant cemented Union control of the Mississippi River with the capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Army of the Potomac, led by George Gordon Meade, defeated the supposedly invincible Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Another   Federal victory at Chattanooga, Tennessee, opened the heartland of the deep south to invasion  . But by the spring of 1864, the war was still far from over. On March 2nd, 1864, Grant was promoted to Lieutenant General and made General in Chief of the US Army. Grant no longer commanded an individual field army but instead was tasked with directing the entire US war effort, and he was running out of time.   \nThe upcoming 1864 election loomed over the US war effort,    and Lincoln worried that the war had strained the Northern public’s will to continue. With victory still uncertain and hundreds of thousands of men dead, the Democrats running on a peace platform seemed poised to sweep the polls . That could mean an end to the war with a reunited nation and slavery still intact; or, a peace deal with the Confederacy resulting in two separate nations. With this hanging over him, Grant needed to move fast; he either needed to win the war before the election   or at least convince the American public that military victory was at hand by the time they headed for the polls.\nGrant designed a grand campaign for the spring of 1864. The goal was to launch simultaneous attacks throughout the country; each US field army was assigned a specific goal that, if successful, could end the war quickly and decisively. General George Meade’s Army of the Potomac's assignment was a familiar one, defeat and destroy Robert E Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. So vital was this mission that rather than stay in Washington DC as his predecessor had, Grant made his headquarters in the field alongside Meade. This made for an awkward command situation. Meade had offered Grant his resignation, assuming the new army commander would want one of his own people in command of the Army of the Potomac. Grant kept him in charge, but Meade worried Grant’s presence would overshadow his own, both militarily, and publicly. \nAfter the enormous losses the Army of the Potomac suffered after Gettysburg, the army was reorganized. From eight corps in the summer of 1863 the army was consolidated into just four. The US 2nd Corps under General Winfield Scott Hancock, the 5th Corps commanded by General Gouverneur K Warren, and General John Sedgwick’s US 6th Corps, and finally the Cavalry Corps lead by General Philip Sheridan. Offsetting the simplified Army of the Potomac, however, was the presence of General Ambrose Burnside’s US 9th Corps. Burnside technically outranked Meade, so rather than attach the 9th Corps to the Army of the Potomac, Grant intended to coordinate the Army of the Potomac and the 9th Corps as separate forces himself. Partially for this reason, Burnside’s command would play a limited role in the coming battle, and the arrangement ultimately proved unwieldy and unworkable. \nHere on  the morning of May 5th, 1864, you would have seen thousands of US soldiers preparing to march south. One more good day's march, and they would be out of the woods into open terrain where Grant and Meade   could best use the 120,000 men of the Army of the Potomac. But Robert E Lee had other plans. Lee wanted to intercept the US forces before they left the Wilderness, planning to use the thick woods to his advantage. When Union troops  reported Confederates approaching from the west along the Orange Turnpike (the modern-day route 20), Grant came here. In 1864 this land was cleared and open, and while it's hard to tell now, is a slight hill. Grant's battlefield headquarters became a small tent city from which Grant tried his best to direct the battle in concert with Meade. As General in Chief and not directly in command of the Army of the Potomac, Grant left much of the fluid decision-making on Meade's shoulders. Grant occupied much of his time between decisions, whittling, and chain-smoking cigars, anxiously waiting to see how the Army of the Potomac would perform. It had beat Lee at Gettysburg, but it would need more than a single victory to win the war.   \nThis eight-stop tour will take you through the landscape and story of the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness and will take about an hour and a half to complete. The Wilderness of Spotsylvania County can be a confusing place to be, just as much so today as in 1864. To help keep yourself oriented, modern-day Route 20, the historical Orange Turnpike, will take you west through the northern part",

                    "audioTranscript": "The Wilderness of Spotsylvania County is aptly named. As a result of clear-cutting for farming and iron mining, the woods here consisted of dense second and third growth forest. In addition, most of the land here had been abandoned decades before the war, culminating in a land that was truly wild.   \n\nGeneral Winfield Scott Hancock, commanding the US 2nd Corps describing the wilderness said “The immediate region of the wilderness was known to our army and its leadership as one of the most difficult and perplexing in which soldiers were ever called to operate. A region though portions of which troops could not be forced without completely breaking up their formation, over all of which there were few opportunities for the use of artillery. It was a region in which the power of discipline almost disappeared, and in which tactics were practically impossible.”\n\nOn the morning of May 5th soldiers of the US 5th Corps   prepared to continue their march south. Indeed, a large portion of the corps, the 3rd division under General Samuel Crawford, was already moving. Other soldiers of the corps arrived here, at Saunders’ Field, one of the few clearings in the suffocating Wilderness. As the morning progressed, however, troubling signs appeared on the horizon. Sentries reported dust clouds rising from the Orange Turnpike to the west; it was not long before Confederate soldiers emerged from the dust clouds.    \nLee's Army was also split into three infantry corps  : the 1st Corps under James Longstreet, the 2nd Corps under Richard Ewell, and the 3rd Corps under AP Hill. On May 5, Longstreet's Corps was a day's march away, so Lee only had two-thirds of his Army available. Lee wanted to keep the US from moving further south but did not want to bring on a full battle until Longstreet arrived. Lee took the two Corps he had and started moving them east along two parallel roads, the Orange Plank Road to the south and the Orange Turnpike (modern day route 20) to the north. Both were advancing on intersections the US army would need to pass through; capturing either would stop the Army of the Potomac dead in its tracks. Even just getting close would likely halt the Federal advance, buying time for Longstreet to arrive with the rest of the Army.   \nHere on the Orange Turnpike, General Ewell found the US 5th Corps already in control of the targeted intersection. Heeding his orders from Lee to not bring on a major battle before Longstreet had arrived, Ewell stopped short and had his men start digging into a defensive line. As word filtered up to Grant and Meade, they decided to attack the Confederates. At 730 a.m., the order came down to General G.K. Warren, commanding the 5th Corps, to attack Lee's Army, but this was easier said than done. Before he could attack, Warren needed to form his command into a proper battle line. The process took time in the best of cases, and the Wilderness was not a best case. His command had started marching south first thing in the morning and was spread out over miles. To make matters worse, the dense forest and scarce roads of the Wilderness made any movement slow and communication difficult. \nHere at Saunders’ Field, Gen. Charles Griffin's  division of the 5th Corps, which had been first to see Confederates and raise the alarm, prepared for the now inevitable collision. US soldiers dug trenches and cut down trees to reinforce them, creating a solid series of earthworks. Should they be attacked first, or if their attack failed, they would have a strong position to rally on and fight. To their west, the Confederates were preparing in much the same way, but despite the two armies' closeness to each other, neither could see what the other was doing through the thick foliage.  \nAs Captain Amos Judson of the 83rd Pennsylvania described it, \"Here were two armies forming line of battle for a desperate struggle, within half a mile of each other, scarcely a movement of either of which could be observed by the other.\" \nAs Warren struggled to get his command into line, Meade received word of Confederates marching down the Orange Plank Road as well. What Meade initially believed was a diversion on the turnpike that could be quickly snapped up for an easy victory now revealed itself for what it was:, a full-blown Confederate offensive, and Lee was dangerously close to outmaneuvering the Army of the Potomac. For now, that was Meade's problem, as Warren had plenty of his own. While he got his men ready for battle, he hoped for reinforcement from General John Sedgwick's 6th Corps, which had started marching to his aid that morning. However, Sedgwick's advance was slowed by bad roads and hounded by Confederates. By noon Meade had lost his patience and ordered Warren to make the attack with whatever he had on hand. From the east to west, through the field you now stand in, 8500 US soldiers, like a wave off the ocean, swept forth to clash against the Confederate battle line. All would remember the violence of the colli",

When Europeans first began to settle the area much of the old growth forest was cleared to make way for farms, tobacco in particular. Over farming left much of the land unable to support agriculture. Some parts of the Wilderness transitioned to more industrial activities. Iron and gold mining cleared even more land before most of it was effectively abandoned.\n\nOver time the land recovered, and the snarl of brush and trees that today is called the Wilderness began to grow in. Not all the land was left to itself. Some people stayed and others left, creating a patchwork of farms and slave plantations of every size and type, big and small, wealthy and poor. Saunders’ Field fell neatly into the mix. Owned by a New Yorker, it was farmed by its namesake the Saunders’ family.

                    "audioTranscript": "You now stand on the southwestern part of Saunders field, on the Confederate battle line. Here General John Jones's brigade   of Virginians laid in wait for the US attack, watching as a wave of blue-clad soldiers marched out of the wood line and into the field in front of you. The US battle line stretched the entire 2000 foot width of Saunders’ Field, which today is about half as wide as it was in 1864,   and a mile and a half south of it. As US troops moved forward, they ran into problems after the first step. Moving faster in the open field than their comrades in the woods to the south, the US battleline broke into disconnected chunks immediately. Griffin’s Federal troops were left exposed to the Confederate defenders, who met them with a rain of lead and iron.  \nAt first, the attack here went relatively well for the US troops. Even though some regiments became disconnected from the units to their south, the US battle lines stayed largely intact. On both sides of the Orange Turnpike, Confederate troops gave way. General Jones’s death early in the attack left the Confederate defenders south of the turnpike without a leader in a crucial moment. Troops from Gen. Charles Griffin's Union division penetrated  the defenses held by Jones's and General George Steuart's Confederate brigades. However, as the Union troops gained ground, they found themselves lost and disoriented in the woods. The black powder smoke produced by soldiers' muskets was trapped by the thick woods, making it impossible to see what was happening. As US Regular Sergeant Burgess Ingersoll recalled, it became \"a weird, uncanny contest – a battle of invisibles with invisibles. Men's faces were sweaty black from biting cartridges, and a sort of grim ferocity seemed to creep into the actions and appearance of everyone within the limited range of vision.\"  \nTo make matters worse, the Confederate battleline was longer than the Federals’. When the attack landed, the Confederates simply swung the longer northern part of their line down onto the US troops, outflanking and outnumbering them. As some Union soldiers fell back, others were left behind and surrounded. North of the turnpike, the 140th New York, which had been in the first wave and broken through the Confederate lines, was now trapped inside the Confederate Army and forced to fight their way back out.  Here on the south of the turnpike, Alabamians counter attacked the confused and disoriented US soldiers. Some Union troops accidentally ran towards the Confederate soldiers as they tried to retreat. As they fled, many soldiers, the wounded in particular, collected in the swale, the depression that runs diagonally across Saunders’ Field in front of you. While the fighting devolved into small independent struggles for survival, the woods caught fire. As the fires spread, many wounded soldiers from both sides were consumed by them.  \nAs the US forces retreated across Saunders’ Field, some Confederates followed them and counterattacked. But Warren had advanced a reserve force in the trenches the US soldiers had already built, and the reserves stopped the uncoordinated Confederate counterattack cold. But the Confederates were not going to go back empty-handed if they could help it.  \nDuring the assaults, two cannon from Battery D, 1st New York Artillery, advanced to support the infantry. But the guns were mostly useless. Ordered to set up in the field just south of the turnpike, the gun crews found themselves unable to aim high enough to fire directly on any Confederate positions. Instead, they fired diagonally across the field, putting the Union soldiers in just as much danger as the Confederates. When the US attack collapsed and the Confederates counter-attacked, these guns were left behind. First captured by the 1st and 3rd North Carolinian Infantry regiments,   who were forced off by other Federals, the guns were captured again by the 6th Alabama. For a moment, the two Confederate units faced off, both convinced the capture of the guns were rightly theirs. They were so focused on their internal argument that the battle raging around them was forgotten, and a regiment of Federals tried to retake the guns, but the field was a no-man's land of fire and lead, and while the Confederates were driven away, the Federals were forced back themselves, leaving the guns abandoned in the field. \nThis constant back and forth, attack and counterattack like a bloody pendulum would come to define not only the fighting at Saunders field, but the Battle of the Wilderness as a whole.",

                    "audioTranscript": "The tangled Wilderness contained a few scattered farms. One was Saunders’ Field, which you have already seen, another was the Higgerson Farm,   which you stand on now. While Griffin's Federal division fought   the Confederates to your north, here was the division of General James Wadsworth. To your north (your right if your back is to the tour road) was the Iron Brigade, made up of Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and New York men. Here at the Higgerson Farm itself was Col. Roy Stone's brigade of Pennsylvanians, and to the south Gen. James Rice's Brigade. In the trees to their front were the Confederate brigades of Gen. John Gordan's Georgians and Gen. Junius Daniel’s North Carolinians. The dense woods of the Wilderness, however, prevented either side from seeing each other until they were almost right on top of one another. Unlike Griffin's division, which advanced over the mostly open ground around Saunders’ Field, Wadsworth's men plunged into the woods. \nBefore their advance began, soldiers in Stone's brigade were less than confident about their odds. One man told his comrades, \"boys, label yourselves, if we must go down there, as you will never come back.\" \nSo dense were the trees of the Wilderness that officers found it impossible to control their soldiers— regimental lines disappeared into the woods and immediately became entangled with or wholly disconnected from units to their left and right. Keeping a moving battleline straight was hard enough on the parade ground, profoundly challenging in dense woods, and pointless to even attempt in the Wilderness. Hidden by the trees were innumerable small creeks and gullies, and with every step the US soldiers were redirected in almost random directions by these hidden obstacles. Unable to see where they were going or hear the commands of their officers through the dense foliage, it was impossible to maintain anything but a random assortment of men heading in vaguely the same direction. \nNorth of the Higgerson Farm, the Iron Brigade ran into the southern end of the Confederate line at Saunders’ Field. However, the US soldiers became isolated from the rest of the division.  At first breaking through the Confederate battleline, the Iron Brigade soon found itself outflanked by Confederate reinforcements. First was Gen. George Doles’s Confederate brigade, which began firing into the Federals from their right, followed by Gordan's Georgians, who smashed into their front and overlapped their left. Isolated from the rest of their support, disorganized by the terrain, and hit on three sides by Confederate forces, the Iron Brigade broke for the first time in its history.  Famed for their fighting prowess, the Iron Brigade had suffered severe casualties on the first day at Gettysburg in July 1863. Almost a year later the Iron Brigade was a shadow of its former self and had only partially recovered. Diminished by years of hard service and isolated from help, the Confederate pressure was irresistible. The Iron Brigade’s retreat opened the rest of Wadsworth’s division to enemy fire on their unprotected sides.   \nHere at the Higgerson Farm, the Pennsylvanians under Stone were having just as rough a go of it. Almost as soon as they hit the tree line on the other end of the field, they descended into a swamp described by one soldier as the \"champion mud hole of all mud holes\" just in time to run face-first into the counter charging Confederates of Gordon's brigade. Mired in mud and disorganized, the brigade devolved into a complete rout, men struggling to pull themselves out of the swamp fast enough to avoid capture or death. Many did not. \nThe story played out much the same for Rice's brigade south of the Higgerson Farm. They, like Stone, ran headlong into counter charging North Carolinians under General Junius Daniel hidden by the woods, and approached suicidally close before firing and pitching-in with clubbed muskets. As isolated and outflanked as everyone else, they broke like the rest of the Federal line.    \nAs Wadsworth's shattered division retreated through the Wilderness, they tumbled into the clearings around the Ellwood Plantation, a little less than a mile to the east of the Higgerson farm  . Here, Wadsworth succeeded in rallying his command and held a defensive line for the rest of the day. But the repulse was stunning, and some officers looked to cast blame. General Stone was one of them, blaming the 143rd Pennsylvania for the failure. \nCorporal Avery Harris of the 143rd disagreed. \"I would have liked to have seen a rebel shell come and took the drunken head clean from his shoulders after he got through with his abuse. Could I photograph this hell hole that we were put in, I would then ask, what in the name of justice and cause and effect, had we to do with the outflanking and envelopment of the famous old Iron Brigade.\"",

                    "audioTranscript": "The Chewning Farm represents the southernmost advance of the US 5th Corps on May 5th before the Battle of the Wilderness broke out. Around 8:00 am, the officer at the head of the advance, General Samuel Crawford, received orders to halt as a result of the Confederates spotted to the west and sent back a response of his own, stating that he had taken up a good position on the open fields and slight high ground of the Chewning Farm, and reported fighting between advancing Confederates and US cavalry on the Orange Plank Road about a mile to their south. Received by Meade around 9:00 am, this was the first evidence of a full Confederate offensive. More news arrived from Crawford at 10: 15am, confirming that the advancing Confederates were not just scouts but a large mass of infantry.  \nCrawford's immediate superior, General Warren, ordered Crawford to fall back from the Chewning Farm and connect with the rest of the 5th Corps to be part of the offensive he was planning down the Orange Turnpike. Warren sent his aide, Major Washington Roebling, to deliver the order to Crawford  . Upon his arrival at the Chewning Farm, Roebling recognized an opportunity.  \nThe Battle of the Wilderness was developing along two primary lines. One fight along the Orange Turnpike to the north, and the other fight along the Orange Plank Road to the south. Roebling immediately recognized that control of the Chewning Farm could be a decisive factor. Ultimately, the goal of the US forces was to move south. From there the only path the US Army could realistically use was the Brock Road, which both the Orange Turnpike and Plank Road intersected. Should the Confederates gain control of either intersection, the Army of the Potomac’s route south would be closed, and the campaign would be over before it had really begun. Even worse, if the Confederates took the Brock Road / Plank Road intersection, they would cut off the US 2nd Corps from the rest of the army. That would potentially allow the Army of Northern Virginia to outnumber, surround, and destroy them. Whoever controlled the intersections controlled the flow of the battle and its outcome. Recognizing it at the time, Roebling later wrote.  \n\"This field was a commanding plateau overlooking the ground to the north and west and connecting with the Plank Road by two good roads, one leading to Parker's Store, and the other to a point a mile east of the store,”\n\"It became evident at once that it would be of the utmost importance to hold that field, as it's possession would divide Lee's Army into two parts if he attempted operations from the Plank Road and the Pike at the same time; and if he attempted to pass us and attack the 2nd corps further down the Plank Road we could fall upon his rear; again it was the best fighting ground in the whole neighborhood.\" \nFortunately, the US 5th Corps already had the Turnpike / Brock Road intersection well in hand, but the only thing between the Confederate 3rd Corps and the Plank Road intersection was the  5th New York Cavalry Regiment. Roebling believed that Crawford’s division, in control of the farm, was ideally suited to both help protect the intersections and keep Lee’s army split in two. From the Chewning Farm, Crawford was barely more than a mile and half from the Plank Road. He was in the perfect position to make Confederate movements along the road towards the intersection difficult, if not impossible. Even if Crawford did nothing and simply kept his troops stationary, they could keep the two halves of Lee’s army separated, something Lee knew was possible and feared. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Roebling’s call to make. \nWarren wanted every possible soldier before he attacked down the Plank road, so he sent Roebling to order Crawford to pull out of the Chewning farm and hook up with the rest of the Corps. Both Crawford and Roebling recognized how important the Chewning Farm was, but Crawford proved indecisive. Unable to convince Warren he should stay; he took a half measure. Instead of attacking the advancing Confederates to his south and trying to secure the vital intersection or turning around joining the attack against the Confederates to his north, he sent a small portion of his command to join the 5th Corps attack, too few men and too late to do anything other than get caught up in the chaos of the failing offensive, only to abandon the Chewning Farm later that evening anyway. On May 6th, Confederates occupied the Chewning Farm and closed the gap Lee feared the US might use to split his army.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Like the other clearings in the Wilderness, the fields around the farm of Widow Catherine Tapp   were important ground for an army. While combat broke out at Saunders’ Field and the Higgerson Farm, and Union troops occupied the Chewning farm, Lee set up his headquarters for the coming fight here in Tapp’s fields. Situated along the Orange Plank Road, it was as good a place as any for Lee to lead his Army. \nLee’s first objective for the area was the Brock Road intersection with the Orange Plank Road just a mile to the east of Widow Tapp’s.  He was unaware of Crawford’s presence thanks to his inaction. \nUnfortunately for Lee, Meade realized the same thing as he gained a more complete picture of the battlefield into the late morning. While Hancock turned his Corps around and marched north to hook up with the rest of the Army, Meade also rushed George Washington Getty’s division of the US 6th Corps south to hold the intersection while Hancock reoriented. Shockingly stiff resistance from the 5th New York cavalry slowed the Confederate advance long enough for Getty to arrive, and Lee's golden opportunity started melting away.   \nLee pushed the lead division of AP Hill’s Confederate 3rd Corps to take the intersection, but Getty held firm. As reinforcements poured in, the Federals counter attacked. However, the fighting here devolved into the same bloody back and forth as at Saunder’s Field, neither army able to gain ground on the other before the setting sun put an end to the fighting on May 5th. Most importantly though, the Army of the Potomac was now reunited, and in control of both vital intersections. The Confederates were spread thin and disorganized. Overnight they choose not to reinforce their positions  or reorganize their units. Assuming that Longstreet's Corps would arrive before the fighting renewed that morning, there seemed no need to worry. \nBut when the sun rose on May 6th, Longstreet was nowhere to be seen. Instead, at 5:00 am, 20,000 Federal soldiers burst from the woods along the Brock Road and slammed like a hammer into the poorly prepared Confederates. Even worse for the Confederates, overnight, Meade had repositioned Wadsworth's division of the 5th Corps on the Confederate 3rd Corps' unprotected left flank. In concert with Hancock, the two groups were closing on the Confederates like a vice. Lee was forced to stand at his headquarters here on Tapp Field and watch as a third of his army disintegrated in front of him.  \nDesperately trying to rally a defense before his entire army was lost, Lee lost his composure, yelling to one Confederate general as his men fled in disarray, \"My God, General McGowan, is this splendid brigade of yours running like a flock of geese?\" Before long,  Federal troops began to appear on the edge of the Tapp Field clearing. The Confederate 3rd Corps was still in a general retreat; AP Hill became so desperate that he ordered Confederate artillery in the clearing to begin firing on the US troops, with Confederates still in the way. Twelve cannon forced to fire through their own men were now all that stood between the Confederate army and complete disaster. Lee had chosen to engage the US forces in the Wilderness, betting he could stop the Federal campaign much as he had done the year before on similar ground at the battle of Chancellorsville. Now it looked like he had led his Army to its doom.  \nJust as all seemed lost Lee noticed a column of troops confidently marching up the Plank Road. An infusion of fresh infantry was exactly what he needed, so Lee rode up to them and asked who they were. “The Texas Brigade” came the answer from their commanding officer, General Gregg. Lee immediately ordered the Texans to charge, waving his hat in the air yelling “Texans always move them!” Caught up in the moment, Lee followed them as they advanced and prepared to charge into the Union onslaught. Noticing the army commander in their midst, the Texans stopped and called out “Go back General Lee go back!” The Confederacy lost one of its most famous generals, Stonewall Jackson, in these same woods a year ago, and the thought of losing another, worst of all Lee himself, was unacceptable. The Texans slowed their advance, and several tried to grab the reins of Lee’s horse and take him to the rear. But it was only when General Gregg requested Lee to retire that he left the front. \nAs Lee turned to the rear he met with Longstreet, who was informed of Lee’s attempt to join the counterattack personally. Longstreet assured Lee that if left alone and given a free hand he would blunt the US assault and restore the Confederate lines. Finally convinced his presence was no longer needed, Lee moved further to the rear, leaving the details to his subordinates. Those details, it turned out, were simple but effective. Lining up his command on either side of the Orange Plank Road, Longstreet launched them against the US attackers in unrelenting waves. The first brigades to charge took horrific losses. Gr",

                    "audioTranscript": "While the Texans did little to regain lost ground, they stalled Hancock's attack. Fortunately for the Confederates, by this point, the US forces were almost as disorganized in success as the Confederates had been in retreat. Much like during the attacks at Saunder’s Field, maintaining control of large formations of men in the Wilderness was a tricky business. As the Confederates crumpled before them, US forces rushed forward, degrading unit cohesion and organization.  \nThat was not too much of a problem, as the US had forward momentum. But now that they were running into fresh Confederate units it made it more difficult to coordinate. Although the US forces were able to resist the initial Confederate counterattacks, they were not organized enough to retake the initiative. Longstreet's constant assaults ensured that the Federal forces did not have the breathing room to get reorganized. But in much the same way that the Federal assault became disordered by the terrain over time, so too did Longstreet's. First hitting the US troops just after 6 am, the Confederate counterattack began to stall out by 8 o’clock. The two forces settled into a desperate close-in fight, as the woods filled with black powder smoke.  \n\"The atmosphere of the woods was now thick and heavy with sulphureous smoke. There seemed not wind enough to raise the dense shroud which clung to our line. Of the struggle along the front of other divisions we really knew nothing. The continuous rack of musketry – the excitement – the cheers of our own brigade – the sometimes sharp and sullen yells of the enemy – all deadened our senses to the fact that we were not alone engaged, but that the entire Army of the Potomac was in the throes of combat with its hereditary antagonist.\" Charles Cowtan National Zouaves 10th New York Volunteer Infantry. \nThe situation was about to get worse for the US troops, however. Just south of their battle line, and just south of where you now are, rested a clear-cut path intended for a railroad that had never been built. Unknown to the Federals, the chief engineer of the Army of Northern Virginia had   scouted the trail and found it perfect for moving a large force unseen around the US lines. Four brigades    totaling 6000 men were quietly advanced along the railroad grade until they were around the US left. Around 11 am the brigades unleashed themselves on the US troops, bursting out of the trees in front of you, in much the same way US troops had attacked the Confederates just a few hours before.  \nCaught by surprise from the side, the US line caved in with frightening speed. The flank attack accomplished exactly what Longstreet had hoped it would, breaking the stalemate in the woods and making the Federal positions untenable. As Hancock himself said after the war, Longstreet \"rolled me up like a wet blanket.\" \nEager to follow up the success, Longstreet was quick to assemble another force to attack the retreating Federal soldiers, grabbing and advancing a brigade of South Carolina troops led by General Micah Jenkins. Longstreet placed himself near the head of the column along with Jenkins. This, it would turn out, was a mistake. Much of Longstreet's command, Jenkins included, had been recently issued new uniforms made from imported British fabric. Rather than the stereotypical gray or tan, these uniforms were a dark blue-gray color, described by some as being almost black. \nAs the South Carolinians advanced, they found themselves in a sudden and deadly crossfire between the 12th and 41st Virginia Infantry, who in the maze of the wilderness had ended up facing each other on opposite sides of the Orange Plank Road. The Virginians began to fire on each other and their confusingly clothed advancing allies. General Jenkins was mortally wounded in the head and Longstreet took a bullet to the neck before the mistake was realized. Now Longstreet had met nearly the same fate as Stonewall Jackson a year earlier. At first staying on his horse Longstreet continued to ride forward, waving to the horrified troops that had shot him, but it did not take long for him to realize the severity of his wound, saying later “[T]he flow of blood admonished me that my work for the day was done.”\nShot through his right shoulder and neck, the bullet took with it a piece of Longstreet’s spine. Although Longstreet would survive, he would never regain the use of his right arm, and his voice would never fully recover. He would not return to the Army until October. In 1863 Lee lost Jackson in the in these same woods just 3 miles away, now in 1864 he would temporarily lose Longstreet when he needed him most.\nLongstreet's wounding proved to be a lucky break for the US 2nd Corps. Without him to lead it, Longstreet’s attack was as paralyzed as their commander's right arm. It took hours to sort out the mess and reorganize Longstreet’s Corps, hours the Federals were all too happy to put to use.",

Taking up positions behind their trenches, these regiments were ready to defend the vital Brock Road in relatively short order. \nShattered as they were, many of the Union soldiers on the south side of the Orange Plank Road began working on reorganizing and solidifying their lines for another fight behind the protection of trenches. \n\"It was our one hope – shattered, fatigued, and out of ammunition as we were by this time – to get across the parapet and, after a short rest in the hollow ground in the rear, to re-form and be ready again for action.\" Thomas Galwey 8th Ohio. \nWinfield S. Hancock, commanding the 2nd  Corps, threw his energies into reorganizing and preparing his command for the inevitable Confederate attack. Around 4:15, Confederate troops beat back the US picket lines and began to slam into the Federal trenches. Lee hoped to simply smash through the Federal battle line with pure brute force. For half an hour, the Confederates blasted away at the US positions, however, the Union soldiers were well protected as they poured lethal rifle fire into the stubborn  and exposed Confederates . A chance to break the US line came when a portion of the trenches here caught fire, forcing the defenders to abandon them. Confederates seized the opportunity and broke through right in front of a US artillery battery, which loaded their guns with canister—cans of iron balls—turning them into giant shotguns. US infantry surged into the breach and beat the Confederates back in hand-to-hand fighting. By 6 pm, the Confederate attack had failed, leaving Lee little more than a long causality list to show for it. \nOn the north side of the battlefield, back at Saunders’ Field, the Confederates tried one more attack and struck the Federal flank there, but it came too late in the day, and the setting of the sun all but ended the battle of the Wilderness on the evening of May 6. \nOn May 7th, Grant and Meade had a hard decision to make. More than 29,000 men were dead, missing, or wounded, 17,666 Federals and approximately 11,400 Confederates. It became clear to them that any more fighting where they were was useless. They had tried everything they could, and none of it had worked. At any other point in the war, the two armies would have separated. They would have spent the next few weeks or even months recovering from their fight before either made a move. But this was not any other point in the war, and Lincoln was about to find out. \nOn May 6th Henry Wing, a correspondent from the New York Tribune, left the battlefield for Washington with reports of the first day of the battle. As it would turn out he would be the first person to bring any news of the fighting to the national capital. Haggling for time on a US government telegraph line in Union Mills 20 miles from DC, his report came to the attention of Lincoln himself. Wing was transported to the White House to report on the situation directly to the President. Wing revealed that before leaving the wilderness Grant have given him a message for the president. Grant’s message was simple “Well, if you see the President, tell him from me that, whatever happens, there will be no turning back.” Lincoln was so overjoyed by this news that he lifted Wing off the ground in a bear hug and planted a kiss on the messenger's forehead. For more than three years, Lincoln had been looking for a General that would stand his ground and finally fight the war to a finish. Now he knew he had finally found one. \nAs soon as the sun set on May 7, the Army of the Potomac marched for Spotsylvania Courthouse. There, Grant hoped to return to the original plan of getting in between Lee and Richmond. For the first time, the Army of the Potomac had fought the enemy and made the decision to keep the initiative;  to force Lee to react to them, rather than the other way around. For the next 11 months, the Army of the Potomac would only do two things. They were either fighting the Confederates, or marching to the next fight. The Battle of the Wilderness was the beginning of the end for the Army of Northern Virginia. But first, the two armies would come to blows once again, just 10 miles down the Brock Road around the Spotsylvania County Courthouse.",

Each of these stations has a corresponding audio track; start listening to each track at its corresponding station and continue to enjoy it as you hike to the next station.\n\nWhen you arrive at station C, there is a fork in the trail.  Take the path to the right. \n\nFor a shorter version of the trail, roughly 2 miles, hike to Station F and take the left turn for the Liaison Trail shortcut, marked with brown thin posts. We will remind you again when you arrive at station F.  \n\nPlease help preserve the natural and historic resources of Saratoga National Historical Park by leaving plants, wildlife and historic objects undisturbed. \n\nWelcome to the Wilkinson Trail!\n(Actor)\n“At Saratoga, the British campaign that was intended to crush America’s rebellion ended instead in a surrender that changed the history of the world.” \n\nWhile walking this historic land you will see woods, open fields, hills and streams. You will also see cannons and white marker posts tracing long-removed fortifications from the Revolutionary War battles fought here.\n\nWhat you don’t see was arguably the most important element of the events that unfolded...the men, women and children on both sides of the conflict, some of whom were willing to make the supreme sacrifice for causes they believed in. \n\nOn these grounds in 1777, determined American soldiers defeated a world class British army invading their homeland. This stunning victory spurred international allies to openly provide supplies and armed forces to the new United States, making it possible for America to ultimately win its independence.\n\nWalking the trail you will retrace the same paths where soldiers marched to and from battle, where determined souls overcame overwhelming odds, and where America’s fight for freedom breathed new life. Listen for the echoes of years gone by...let this trail be a journey into the past, and perhaps you may glimpse scenes of 18th-century America and the human stories and events surrounding the Battles of Saratoga.",

Because the course of the river, so beneficial for conveying all the bulky necessaries of an army, is precisely the route that an army ought to take for the great purposes of cutting communications between the Southern and Northern Provinces….”\n–General John Burgoyne of His Majesty’s British Army \n\n(narrator)\nSince the Revolutionary War’s opening shots at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the British had wanted to bring an end to the rebellion in the American colonies. General John Burgoyne, commander of the British forces here at Saratoga, believed the Lake Champlain-Hudson River Valley Corridor would be the best travel route should an invasion become necessary. \n\nThat belief formed the backbone of British plans to invade New York by marching south from Canada —a daring scheme that would utilize separate armies, in an effort to isolate New England, the perceived heart of the rebellion.  \n\nIn 1777, the plan was put into action…\n\nBurgoyne’s British forces invaded south into New York using the natural corridor of waterways.  A smaller force under Lieutenant-Colonel Barry St. Leger would support this movement by marching east from Lake Ontario toward the Mohawk River, which they would follow to the Hudson, and meet up with Burgoyne’s troops at Albany. Once in Albany, the combined force would establish communications with General Sir William Howe in New York City --all in the hopes of stopping the American rebellion before France or Spain chose to intervene.  \n\nAware that General Burgoyne’s troops were advancing south from Canada, the American forces, under the command of General Horatio Gates, made plans to prevent further invasion.  But what made this land the most advantageous site for the Continental Army to take a stand against the advance of the British?  Why here?  Consider the landscape around you as you walk.  \n\nTopography and ground cover played important roles here at Saratoga.  Under the advice of Colonel Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a brilliant Polish engineer serving with the Americans, they chose a raised area a few miles south of here, known as Bemis Heights, to build their fortifications and stop the British advance to Albany.  \n\nBemis Heights overlooked the Hudson River and the road to Albany at a natural “bottleneck” in the river valley. Dense woodland and difficult ravines prevented the British from traversing the land just east of the river. Swampland and ravines directly beneath Bemis Heights restricted Burgoyne’s advance to the river and the road, both of which were highly visible and vulnerable to American forces.  These imposing defenses forced Burgoyne’s army to take the only safe route open to them and move inland, away from the Hudson, a few miles north of Bemis Heights.\n\nThis historic walking trail loosely follows some of the roads the British used for that move inland, as well as during the Battles of Saratoga, in September and October of 1777.\n\n(Music)\nDid you know the Revolutionary War is considered America’s first civil war?

Many people faced difficult decisions with no easy answers but potentially severe and even deadly consequences.\n \nIf you lived here in the 1770’s, would you be a Loyalist or Tory, terms for individuals loyal to the established government of Great Britain?  Would you be a Rebel or Whig, terms for Americans wanting personal freedom and a country that could make it’s own decisions regarding government, trade, taxes and laws for its people?  Or would you try to remain neutral?\n\nIt must have been a difficult decision for many of those early Americans...a wrong decision could result in being jailed, losing friends, neighbors, job, home, and even family members.  Just as politics can divide nations today, in the late 1700s there were a variety of viewpoints, often influenced by economic status, race, religion, gender and age, which resulted not only in discord on the battlefield but also in the personal lives of those torn between conflicting loyalties within their families and communities. \n\nThe site you are on used to belong to John McBride during the 1770s. This family made the difficult decision to remain loyal to Great Britain and the King.  Their neighbors, the Freemans, were also Loyalists.  Would the McBrides and the Freemans ever have imagined their fields bearing fierce fighting between British soldiers and…fellow Americans? \n\nLoyalists involved with the Battles of Saratoga served mainly in two regiments, the King’s Loyal Americans and the Queen’s Loyal Rangers.  The Loyalist forces were positioned on the knolls behind this farm. \n\nThe American Revolution truly was America’s first civil war, pitting neighbor against neighbor and sometimes brother against brother.  Always suspicious of one’s fellow neighbors and friends, it was a trying time to be a local resident.\n\n(Music)\nWho do you think of when you hear the term “redcoats?”  What about Hessians?

Each soldier carried over 40 pounds of equipment, and added to this was the daily grind of extreme weather —including heat, cold, driving rain, humidity— and mosquitoes and black flies, and accompanying hunger, thirst and fatigue.  \n\nAbout one mile north of here, the British split into three columns, or three groups. One column followed the road along the Hudson River. A second kept about a mile west of the river. The third moved along one mile farther west from the river. This spacing was intended to help sweep around American positions the British were sure had to be somewhere near here.  \n\nYou are now walking on the same trail used by the troops in the center column accompanied by Burgoyne himself.  \n\nBut just who were these forces we so commonly call “Redcoats?” The British Regiments were famous on many European fields of battle.\n\nHere at Saratoga, they consisted of men from England, Scotland, Wales, Germany and Ireland. Also with them were regiments of German auxiliaries –almost 3,000 officers and men– supplementing Burgoyne’s army. In addition, they were joined by Native people, including about 150 Fort Hunter Mohawk warriors and their families, as well as dozens of Iroquois and Algonquin warriors from the Seven Nations of Canada.  \n\nThe rest of the forces included French Canadians and American Loyalists. For this world-renowned fighting force, even the possibility of defeat at the hands of the contemptuous rebels was unthinkable.  \n\nIntegrated forces were not purely a British military practice. The American army integrated African Americans, American Indians, and Caucasian soldiers in the same units. Enslaved men were sometimes forced to serve in the place of their owners. Many were not slaves at all, but free men who volunteered to serve. Although only white men were appointed as commissioned officers, all soldiers served and fought together and received the same rations, uniforms and pay. This marked a unique situation in a time of active slavery in this country. In fact, about five percent of the American troops here at Saratoga were black men, reflecting a policy of integration which didn’t happen again until the Korean War. \n\n\n(Gunshot)\nShhhh...is that musket fire in the distance?

The British army advanced south in three columns, a few miles away from the American Camp.\n\nAs the fog lifted, about 12:30 in the afternoon, the clash began. \nSome of Daniel Morgan’s riflemen brushed with the advanced guard of Burgoyne’s center column in the clearing of Freeman’s Farm. To the British, the Americans appeared a motley crew, mostly dressed in whatever piecemeal uniforms they could muster. But appearances were deceiving. The Americans had a lot more at stake.\n\nEyewitness accounts on both sides from that first day of battle recall some of the most heated fighting any of them had ever seen:\n\n(Random Actors voices - all men, each quote a different actor)\n\n “it was the hottest Fire of Canon and Musquetry that ever I heard in my life”\n\n“We continued to press on, keeping our lines as well as the ground would permit; loading and firing rapidly as possible as we advanced.  \n\n“the blaze of the artillery and small arms was incessant and sounded like to roll of the drum”\n\n“Both armies seemed determined to conquer or die”\n\nThe battle swayed back and forth for more than three hours, with each side taking turns commanding the field. Morgan’s riflemen singled out specific targets, while the massed Continental and British lines filled the air with volleys of lead. Sounds of men crying out in pain and fear could be heard across the field. Both sides scrambled to carry out their wounded.   \n\nJust as the British lines began to waver in the face of deadly fire from the numerically superior Americans, German reinforcements from the left column arrived from the river road with two 6-pound cannons, forcing the Americans to withdraw under the cover of darkness…",

According to this letter, Clinton was willing to send 2,000 troops north from the City to exert pressure south of Albany and make General Gates divert some troops to cope with this new threat. Burgoyne decided to wait for this diversion before he moved again against the American troops.\n\nFor the next 16 days the two sides were encamped more or less facing each other; less than two miles separated the opposing armies. The Americans continued to strengthen their defensive fortifications and Bemis Heights, while the British constructed their own fortifications, represented by the red topped posts, some of which you might see nearby.  \n\nBurgoyne’s men felled hundreds of trees to construct several defensive “redoubts,” a name coming from the French term for “temporary field fortifications.”  Each redoubt was built of walls formed with heavy logs. These positions were staggered to defend a 2-mile span west of the Hudson River, with each redoubt intended to provide supporting fire to those nearby. The soldiers also cut hundreds more trees to clear areas in front of these redoubts so the American enemy would have no hiding places near the British lines. Such massive clear-cutting for these works left much of the land bare.\n\nThe British kept working, and waiting…\n(sounds of wood chopping)",

The enemy’s position, on the other hand was strong and his large army was three times superior to ours so that we could not attack him with any hope of success.\n- Brunswick Lieutenant Anton Adolph Heinrich Du Roi, October 7, 1777\n\n(Narrator)\nIt is said an army marches on its stomach. Burgoyne’s army had difficulties moving through this unfamiliar countryside and even more trouble finding enough rations and supplies. A ration is the amount of food given to a solider for one day. On a campaign, it consisted of one and a half pounds of flour or bread and one and a half pounds of salted pork or beef. But the bread was not fresh and soft; it was flat, hard, and dry – poor tasting, but well preserved for storage and travel.  This “ship’s bread” as it was then called, dismayed the Germans soldiers who were used to baked bread. The salted meat, soaked in saltwater for months at a time tasted even worse; washing the meat one to two times in fresh water was often required to make it edible. Women received half rations and children received about one quarter ration.  \n\nOn October 3rd, due to the British supply shortage, Burgoyne had to cut troops down to 1/3 of its normal rations. Officers sent out foraging parties to find food in the nearby farms. Eunice Campbell Reid, a child of a local farmer, reported on a German foraging party.\n\n(Young Actress)\n“Whilst there were a large party of Brunswickwers, to the number of thirty or more, come and went into Mister NcNeil’s potato field and dug a considerable part of the crop. Each of them had three knapsacks or bags which they filled with potatoes and carried off… some took pairs of tow cloth trousers that were hanging up to dry, tied up the bottoms of the legs and filled them with potatoes, tied them up, and taking one under each arm went off with the trousers as well as their contents.”\n\n(Narrator)\nThe locals that lived here, having temporarily fled, often found devastation when they returned home.

Civilian camp followers marched with both British and American armies.  Camp followers included women and children, merchants, and occasional refugees. Their jobs were to wash, mend and sew the soldiers’ clothes, forage, tend the wounded or sick, help provide some supplies, and take care of themselves and their children. They did not generally cook for soldiers, as the soldiers did their own cooking.

Why get involved at all? There were a variety of reasons.\n\nAs already mentioned, women camp followers were an essential part of both American and British armies in the 18th Century. \n\nAt home however, when their husbands, sons or brothers went off to war, women were left to fend for themselves. In England and in America, military service could mean months and even years that a man would be away, leaving women to maintain homes, farms, families, and perhaps even businesses. They were then confronted with the realities of inflation, shortages, and threats to homes and towns.\n\nHere in America, women’s efforts were also greatly needed in the combined fronts of economy and politics. Listen to this poem that appeared in the Massachusetts Gazette in 1767 in attempts to persuade women to political patriotism:\n\n(Actor or actress)\n“Young ladies in town and those that lived round.  \nLet a friend, at this season, advise you.  \nSince money’s so scarce, and times growing worse, \nStrange things may soon hap and surprise you.  \nFirst, then, throw aside your high topknots of pride, \nWear none but your own country linen,\n Of economy boast… Let your pride be the most\n To show clothes of your own make and spinning.”\n\n(Narrator)\nThis and other ventures followed the cues of colonial leaders as they encouraged consumer boycotts of British goods. Self-sufficiency became both a political statement and an economic necessity.\n\nWhat about stories like that of Deborah Sampson, who masqueraded as a man to join the Continental Army, or Molly Pitcher, who took her injured husband’s place in a cannon crew?  These were very heroic but highly unusual exceptions. \n\nDespite the contributions women made to the Patriot cause during the Revolutionary War, the achievement of independence failed to bring a revolution in the rights of American females. For most women, the war’s end in 1783 signaled a return to their customary duties within their families and households.\n\nAlthough women gained little in the way of additional legal and political rights American Revolution helped foster a female ideal that has become known as “republican motherhood.” These women involved in the Revolution instilled in their children the virtues on which a republican form of government was believed to rest – wisdom, honestly, loyalty and a compassion for one’s fellow citizens. They believed this was best achieved through education, which brought about an unprecedented emphasis on increasing the opportunities for female education during the postwar era.  \n\n(sounds of a fire crackling)\nDo you enjoy camping? Can you imagine being in rugged wilderness conditions for weeks at a time?  With the American lines less than two miles away, how did it feel to be a solider or camp follower in the British army during those 16 days after the Battle of Freemans Farm? Would you be anxious for action? Nervous? Exhausted from building fortifications?  Homesick?",

Poospatuck, meaning “where the waters meet,” is one of the oldest recognized sovereign Native American reservations in the United States. Over the centuries the Unkechaug have fished, farmed, hunted, lived and worked on this land.  \n\nWhen European colonists arrived in the 17th century they utilized a complex legal system and foreign bureaucratic procedures to dispossess Indigenous Long Islanders of their land, conferring ownership to individuals and making claims to large areas such as the Manor of St. George, patented originally to William “Tangier” Smith. While the land that would become the William Floyd Estate was originally deeded to the Unkechaug in perpetuity from the Manor of St. George, it was later sold by the Smith family to William Floyd’s grandfather, Richard Floyd II. \n\nSoon after purchasing the more than 4,000 acres of land in 1718, laborers for the Floyd family began the back-breaking work of clearing fields, constructing ditches, planting and tending crops, and doing the innumerable agricultural and domestic jobs that were required to establish and operate a farm of this scale. This work was largely performed by indentured and enslaved people until slavery was abolished in New York in 1827 and indentured servitude was phased out by the Floyds in the mid 19th century. Immigrant wage labor entered the mix in the 1840s and continued into the 20th century. As you walk through the land, look for the ditches and mounds that continue to mark the edges of long abandoned fields, the “lopped” trees that were bent over to create living fences, and the cleared fields that once grew corn, rye, wheat, and clover.",

From this location, the home was not only protected from the harshest winds and storms, but it also provided the family with a view of activities in the lower acreage, Moriches Bay, and Fire Island. Enslaved Blacks developed the lower acreage into an elaborate grid of cultivated fields, pastures and ponds. The farm prospered through the late 18th century and early 19th century, as William Floyd and his son Nicoll employed the skilled labor of enslaved Blacks, free and indentured Indigenous people from the neighboring Poospatuck reservation, and free day laborers.  \n\nWhen the Floyds scaled back and eventually abandoned farming in the late 19th century, they maintained the fields and trails for recreation and hunting. John Treadwell Nichols, husband of William Floyd’s great-great-granddaughter Cornelia, was Curator of Birds and Fishes for the Museum of Natural History in New York.

Richard Floyd I, Nicoll’s grandfather, immigrated to Setauket, NY around 1667 from Brecknockshire, Wales. He became one of the early colonists on Long Island and one of the largest landholders in the Town of Brookhaven.  \n\nEnslaved, indentured, and free labor were employed in the construction of the house, just as they were for the clearing of the fields and roads. It was, to begin, a small, but substantial 6 room starter home. But, as the family grew and needs changed, each generation put their mark on the home, whether this was by adding new rooms or changing the function of already established spaces. \n\nWilliam Floyd inherited the home, wealth, and status of the family when he was just 20 years old. Roughly a month after proclaiming his support for independence in July 1776, William Floyd and his family were forced to flee their estate as British forces moved to occupy the grounds. Redcoats quartered in the Old Mastic House for the duration of the Revolutionary War as Long Island remained a royalist stronghold. According to family lore, “Unka Steve” an enslaved man from Barbados was entrusted with staying behind to observe and report on the occupation of the estate.  \n\nIn 1783, Floyd returned to the estate with his family and began the work to restore the estate which was in disrepair after its occupation by the British. Floyd’s 1792 portrait shows the updated and expanded home, with a new main hall and parlor as well as east and west service wings. When Thomas Jefferson and James Madison visited Floyd in 1791, they would have seen a stately manor house and a thriving productive farm. \n\nWilliam Floyd left the estate to his son Nicoll in 1803 when he moved with his second wife and two young daughters to Westernville, NY. The home remained in the family for many generations.",

The term “Pikle,” or “Pikel,” has its origins in Old English. It is a phonetic spelling of the word “Pightle,” which referred to a small enclosure near a house or a piece of land in an open field. It initially served as the headlands to the agricultural fields and pastures of the lower acreage, a brief break in the landscape between the manicured lawn of the family home and the commercial enterprise of the working farm. By the 1860s, however, the Floyd family chose to give up farming in favor of careers in politics and law. As the house became a summer retreat for hunting and entertaining guests, the Pikle became a borderland for the forest that grew up around the home. Today, it continues to serve as a haven for wild birds and animals.",

We do not know the details of his birth or how he came to the Floyd Estate, but from the 1850 census we know that he was born in New York around 1775, just one year before the signing of the Declaration of independence. He was an agricultural laborer, enslaved by William and/or his son Nicoll Floyd and manumitted, or “released from slavery,” around 1820. After manumission, Lon continued to work on the estate’s farm, while his wife Hannah “cooked up at the house.” He took pride in his boats, and is remembered navigating “[Home Creek] and [Moriches] Bay in search of crabs, eels, and bunkers…”  \n\nLike other enslaved people at the Floyd Estate, Lon and Hannah lived in a cabin about a mile distant from the manor house.

Guests could choose a room in Old Mastic or \"camp” out in the building before you.  \n\nThis building was originally constructed around 1899 as a storage building for the kitchen. It was built just steps away from the Old House, near the kitchen and bedroom doors to your left.  \n\nAround 1921, the structure was moved to its current location. It became a place to house guests and servants travelling with the family. Cornelia, who inherited the estate in 1903 with her brother William, and their sister Rosalie, posted their rules for their guests.  \n\nSome of the more interesting rules and messages include: \n\nThe guests in charge of this establishment were chosen because of their affability, adaptability, and capability. Any dissatisfaction should be at once reported to the mismanagement. \nThe Old House can best be set on fire by dropping a lamp; carrying candles is monotonously safe. \nLadies are requested to have their rooms made up by eleven o’clock A.M.

His descriptions help us to understand the roles, skills, and personalities of his fellow workers. When he started at the Floyd Estate, Ross remembered that John Gelston Floyd, Sr. lived in the house on his own. In his old age, John, Sr. relied on the help of the Carmen family who lived in the rooms above the kitchen. He explained:\n\n“There was a colored family in the kitchen. Elijah Carmen and Charity, his wife, and five children. Charity did the cooking. Elijah did the chores around the house and helped on the farm.

Long before electricity and heating were common features within homes, firewood was a critical resource for keeping warm throughout frigid Long Island winters.  \n\nMundane though a woodshed may seem, its importance was not lost upon the residents of the Old Mastic House. Cornelia Floyd Nichols remembered: \n\n“Here are oak, hickory, cedar and apple waiting to yield up the sunshine of many years on our hearth. This is seasoned wood. It has fulfilled all the processes that nature has ordained for complete maturity. Perhaps that is the reason we so often sought the woodshed in moments of stress.

Oat, flax, wheat, rye, and other grains were the dominant crops here and throughout Long Island in the early 19th century. In his 1804 ledgers, Nicoll Floyd II recorded selling just 10 bushels of Indian corn and 20 bushels of corn. But, by the mid 19th century corn had grown in popularity.

Ross, 1913 \n\nWith livestock, farming tools, and machinery, the barns were an essential feature of life at the Floyd Estate. The Merrifield sheep barn and the Robinson Barn, for cows, were massive two-story barns that towered over the barnyard.  \n\nThe “New Barn” on the right was built from the salvaged wood of an earlier larger barn. In 1898 John Gelston Floyd Jr. had a windmill erected on the roof of that barn with a water tank in the loft to provide running water to the house.  \n\nThroughout the generations, the barns were also a favorite space in which to play hide-and-seek. Recalling her childhood in the 1840s, Sarah Floyd Turner wrote: \n\n“Nick with his eyes blind-folded counted out one-hundred, while the others, scampered like rabbits through the manger. Some had the courage to cross long beams that bridged the lofts together, stealing like cats over a span of twenty feet, with a deathly depth below, others burrowed in the hay or hid in the horse stalls, while some hung onto rafters and beams among the swallows nests, awaiting the signal from Nick….Peals of laughter resounded from floor to rafters as each was made to hide and seek in turn, till the cows came home and the setting sun warned them to flee from the barn before the dreaded bull took possession with the cows.”",

He spent much of his time here building and repairing the equipment he needed to manage livestock. For Cornelia Floyd Nichols, the shop became forever associated with Charles Ross. She reflected: \n\n“There were countless broken things being kept seven years to ‘come in handy’, and handy they did come in for Ross. He could make anything out of anything, from ‘springes to catch woodcock’ or a figure 4 rabbit trap to the set of furniture made of crooked cedar branches which we found at the end of a snowy winter.   \n\n“Though rainy days in the shop were fun it's true character came out with sunshine. One door opened to the barnyard, the other to the old garden behind the house… \n\n“From the garden came the long, straight line of insect sounds, behind you the shir-r-r of the grindstones as Ross’ foot on the treadle held the rhythm. Sometimes he would let you help by tipping the can of water suspended over the whirling stone. It was cool in the shop. There was so much sunshine outside that it lighted every corner yet never seemed to really come in.

Upon their return in 1902 they found that the extreme wind and weather on the Outer Banks had damaged the building. Enlisting the help of locals yet again, the brothers repaired the building and added more space to the workshop for living quarters. In 1903 they needed additional space to put together their flyer, so they constructed the wooden hangar building next to their workshop/living quarters.

The two brothers did not do this alone; local residents from the US Life Saving Station at Kitty Hawk and other visitors routinely helped the brothers carry their 100 plus pound gliders up the dunes after every attempt.

In its over-200 year history, however, its doors were not always open to all. Women had to fight for their right to be heard within its walls, first by writing fiery petitions on slavery and women’s rights. In 1838, Abolitionist Angelina Grimke spoke on behalf of these petitioners at the State House, becoming the first woman to address a U.S. governing body. During her anti-slavery speech, she advocated for women’s rightful place in society:  \n\n“These petitions relate to the great and solemn subject of American slavery-a subject fraught with the deepest interest to this republic, whether we regard it in its political, moral, or religious   aspects. And because it is a political subject, it has often been tauntingly said, that woman has nothing to do with it...  \n\nThis domination of women must be resigned-the sooner the better; in the age which is approaching, she should be something more–she should be a citizen... I hold, Mr. Chairman, that  American women have to do with this subject, not only because it is moral and religious, but  because it is political, inasmuch as we are citizens of this republic, and as such our honor, happiness, and well being, are bound up in its politics and government and laws.” \n\nFollowing the Civil War, women’s suffragists came knocking at the State House doors. The decades that followed saw numerous hearings where suffragists and their opponents engaged in intense debate over women’s right to vote. Suffragists won victory in 1919 when the Massachusetts State Legislature ratified the 19th Amendment. The following year, Democrat Susan Fitzgerald and Republican Sylvia M. Donaldson became the first women to win elected state representative seats. \n\nWhile some fought for access to the Massachusetts State House, many of Boston’s women worked beyond its walls to make change and better their communities.  \n\nThis tour will guide us through stories of Black and White women from a community just next door to the State House, Beacon Hill. During the 1800s, Beacon Hill served as a hotbed of activity in the work to abolish slavery, the fight for equal education, and the struggle for women’s rights. Women in Beacon Hill played a significant role in these and other efforts, having forward-thinking and aspirational visions of a just and equitable world.

Upon her departure from New Orleans, Slater made the critical decision to bring a six-year-old enslaved girl named Med with her on the journey, leaving Med’s mother behind. Slater traveled from Louisiana, a slave state, to the state of Massachusetts, which legally abolished slavery in 1783. \n\nIn August 1836, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society learned of Med’s presence in the home of Thomas Aves at 21 Pinckney Street. Historical records suggest that members of the Society posed as Sunday School recruiters in order to gain access to the home of Thomas Aves. Member Lydia Maria Child recalled, “We obtained all the evidence we wanted, carried it to a lawyer, who petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus; the judge granted the petition; and the man who held little Med in custody was brought up for trial.”  \n\nOn August 27, 1836, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw presided over the case Commonwealth v. Aves, ultimately ruling that enslaved people brought to Massachusetts by their enslavers could not be held against their will. Shaw’s ruling removed Med from the institution of slavery, but due to her young age, Med was placed in the care of the Samaritan Asylum for Indigent Children in Boston. Commonwealth v. Aves set an important legal precedent for free states and served as a landmark victory for the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. However, the newly emancipated Med never reunited with her mother and died two years later at the Asylum.",

Vernon Street where Ellen was taking upholstery lessons to share the dire news. Susan remembered, “I proposed to Ellen to come and do some work for me, intending not to alarm her. My manner, which I supposed to be indifferent and calm, betrayed me, and she threw herself into my arms, sobbing and weeping…She, however, recovered her composure as soon as we reached the street, and was very firm ever after.”  \n\nSusan Hillard’s work with the Underground Railroad continued throughout the 1850s.

                    "audioTranscript": "By helping to support her elderly former employee, Rosanna Miller, Rebecca Parker Clarke realized a need to care for aging African American women in Boston. After going door to door in the local area, Clarke confirmed her belief by meeting with over 15 destitute Black women. With the support of her son, Reverend James Freeman Clarke, as well as Reverend Leonard A. Grimes and Governor John Andrew, she and community members met to help organize a charity to address this problem.  \n\nOriginally established at 65 Southac Street, now Phillips Street, the Home for Aged Colored Women served as a residential institution providing shelter, food, and other care for elderly Black women who could no longer support themselves and relied on charity to survive. The Home served as a refuge for elderly Black women at a time when, according to the 1900 Annual Report,  \n\n“No private institution would receive colored women, and the white paupers in the almshouses would not associate [with] them, so they were obliged to share the quarters assigned to the insane or vicious, or to remain outside, dependent on the precarious charity of an occasional benefactor, or of friends nearly as poor as themselves.” \n\nIn 1860, the Home admitted its first residents including Rosanna Miller. Most women came to the Home through referrals from family, friends, former employers, or church leaders, and some women applied for admission themselves. Located in Beacon Hill, many of the Home’s residents belonged to Boston’s Black community or resided in New England. Many residents had been formerly enslaved and others had been involved in Boston’s abolitionist movement and belonged to organizations such as the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. \n\nLocal Black women served as Matrons responsible for managing day-to-day activities and chores of the Home. The opinion of highly respected Matrons also helped determine whether an applicant should be admitted, or a resident expelled. Matron Rachel Smith served in the role for 25 years during which she organized an annual Fair to raise additional funds for the Home and connected with local organizations to hold entertainment events such as concerts and readings for the women. \n\nAs building capacity became limited, the Home focused on admitting local women and relocated to this location at 27 Myrtle Street in 1865. Later, the Home began to distribute outside aid to help a greater number of women by granting weekly allowances to help pay for their independent living costs. \n\nAs government aid expanded in the 1900s and women increasingly expressed a desire to sustain themselves, the Home’s Board determined that a residential institution no longer best served the needs of the community and the Home closed in 1944. Today, the Grimes-King Foundation for the Elderly, Inc carries on the legacy of the Home and continues to advocate for elderly Black women in Boston.",

In its over-200 year history, however, its doors were not always open to all. Women had to fight for their right to be heard within its walls, first by writing fiery petitions on slavery and women’s rights. In 1838, Abolitionist Angelina Grimke spoke on behalf of these petitioners at the State House, becoming the first woman to address a U.S. governing body. During her anti-slavery speech, she advocated for women’s rightful place in society:  \n\n“These petitions relate to the great and solemn subject of American slavery-a subject fraught with the deepest interest to this republic, whether we regard it in its political, moral, or religious   aspects. And because it is a political subject, it has often been tauntingly said, that woman has nothing to do with it...  \n\nThis domination of women must be resigned-the sooner the better; in the age which is approaching, she should be something more–she should be a citizen... I hold, Mr. Chairman, that  American women have to do with this subject, not only because it is moral and religious, but  because it is political, inasmuch as we are citizens of this republic, and as such our honor, happiness, and well being, are bound up in its politics and government and laws.” \n\nFollowing the Civil War, women’s suffragists came knocking at the State House doors. The decades that followed saw numerous hearings where suffragists and their opponents engaged in intense debate over women’s right to vote. Suffragists won victory in 1919 when the Massachusetts State Legislature ratified the 19th Amendment. The following year, Democrat Susan Fitzgerald and Republican Sylvia M. Donaldson became the first women to win elected state representative seats. \n\nWhile some fought for access to the Massachusetts State House, many of Boston’s women worked beyond its walls to make change and better their communities.  \n\nThis tour will guide us through stories of Black and White women from a community just next door to the State House, Beacon Hill. During the 1800s, Beacon Hill served as a hotbed of activity in the work to abolish slavery, the fight for equal education, and the struggle for women’s rights. Women in Beacon Hill played a significant role in these and other efforts, having forward-thinking and aspirational visions of a just and equitable world.

Upon her departure from New Orleans, Slater made the critical decision to bring a six-year-old enslaved girl named Med with her on the journey, leaving Med’s mother behind. Slater traveled from Louisiana, a slave state, to the state of Massachusetts, which legally abolished slavery in 1783. \n\nIn August 1836, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society learned of Med’s presence in the home of Thomas Aves at 21 Pinckney Street. Historical records suggest that members of the Society posed as Sunday School recruiters in order to gain access to the home of Thomas Aves. Member Lydia Maria Child recalled, “We obtained all the evidence we wanted, carried it to a lawyer, who petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus; the judge granted the petition; and the man who held little Med in custody was brought up for trial.”  \n\nOn August 27, 1836, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw presided over the case Commonwealth v. Aves, ultimately ruling that enslaved people brought to Massachusetts by their enslavers could not be held against their will. Shaw’s ruling removed Med from the institution of slavery, but due to her young age, Med was placed in the care of the Samaritan Asylum for Indigent Children in Boston. Commonwealth v. Aves set an important legal precedent for free states and served as a landmark victory for the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. However, the newly emancipated Med never reunited with her mother and died two years later at the Asylum.",

My manner, which I supposed to be indifferent and calm, betrayed me, and she threw herself into my arms, sobbing and weeping…She, however, recovered her composure as soon as we reached the street, and was very firm ever after.”  \n\nSusan Hillard’s work with the Underground Railroad continued throughout the 1850s.

                    "audioTranscript": "By helping to support her elderly former employee, Rosanna Miller, Rebecca Parker Clarke realized a need to care for aging African American women in Boston. After going door to door in the local area, Clarke confirmed her belief by meeting with over 15 destitute Black women. With the support of her son, Reverend James Freeman Clarke, as well as Reverend Leonard A. Grimes and Governor John Andrew, she and community members met to help organize a charity to address this problem.  \n\nOriginally established at 65 Southac Street, now Phillips Street, the Home for Aged Colored Women served as a residential institution providing shelter, food, and other care for elderly Black women who could no longer support themselves and relied on charity to survive. The Home served as a refuge for elderly Black women at a time when, according to the 1900 Annual Report,  \n\n“No private institution would receive colored women, and the white paupers in the almshouses would not associate [with] them, so they were obliged to share the quarters assigned to the insane or vicious, or to remain outside, dependent on the precarious charity of an occasional benefactor, or of friends nearly as poor as themselves.” \n\nIn 1860, the Home admitted its first residents including Rosanna Miller. Most women came to the Home through referrals from family, friends, former employers, or church leaders, and some women applied for admission themselves. Located in Beacon Hill, many of the Home’s residents belonged to Boston’s Black community or resided in New England. Many residents had been formerly enslaved and others had been involved in Boston’s abolitionist movement and belonged to organizations such as the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. \n\nLocal Black women served as Matrons responsible for managing day-to-day activities and chores of the Home. The opinion of highly respected Matrons also helped determine whether an applicant should be admitted, or a resident expelled. Matron Rachel Smith served in the role for 25 years during which she organized an annual Fair to raise additional funds for the Home and connected with local organizations to hold entertainment events such as concerts and readings for the women. \n\nAs building capacity became limited, the Home focused on admitting local women and relocated to this location at 27 Myrtle Street in 1865. Later, the Home began to distribute outside aid to help a greater number of women by granting weekly allowances to help pay for their independent living costs. \n\nAs government aid expanded in the 1900s and women increasingly expressed a desire to sustain themselves, the Home’s Board determined that a residential institution no longer best served the needs of the community and the Home closed in 1944. Today, the Grimes-King Foundation for the Elderly, Inc carries on the legacy of the Home and continues to advocate for elderly Black women in Boston.",

                    "audioTranscript": "Host: The Bar BC was one of the first dude ranches in Jackson Hole, and perhaps the most iconic. Today, it’s the oldest one still standing. It was founded in 1912 by Struthers Burt and Horace Carncross, Easterners who emigrated to Wyoming. Burt and his wife, Katharine Newlin Burt, were prolific writers, so their ranch attracted a more artistic and literary set. The clientele tended to be wealthy Easterners who wanted a rustic vacation experience, away from the constraints of high society. Many former guests bought ranches in the area, and some of their families are still in the valley today. During the heyday of dude ranching in the 1910s and 20s, many other ranches operated in Jackson Hole and throughout the West. At its height in the 1920s, the Bar BC was actually one of the valley’s largest employers, hiring over fifty people to help run the ranch each summer. The industry declined as tourism dropped during the Great Depression and World War II, though there are still some dude ranches in Jackson Hole today. Excerpt from \"Jackson Hole Journal\": \"You couldn’t see the ranch as you started toward the Gros Ventres, with the Tetons and evening at your back. It looked as though you would have to travel straight across the valley for hot miles of sagebrush to those further mountains. Then suddenly came the second bench, a prehistoric riverbank, running neat as a dam north and south, then the steep road down a gully in the jolting wagon between larkspur and mules-ears, with perhaps a last decadent little snowbank still lingering in the draw—the whole panorama of river valley opening out below. Then finally you come down the first bench right into the ranch itself—the sod of tarpaper-roofed cabins, the corrals and saddle shed and barns and ditches and willows and big pines and aspen groves and the shining square of the swimming pool dug out of the flat between cabins and river. It was coming home with a vengeance.\"",

Struthers Burt’s friendship with Horace Albright, the superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, gradually brought Burt around to the idea of creating a national park in Jackson Hole. Burt became a strong conservationist in his own right and a key advocate for the future Grand Teton National Park, using his position of prominence to generate support for it. In 1930, he sold his share in the Bar BC to demonstrate the importance of preserving the valley as a park, and he and his family relocated to a ranch farther north. Burt also encouraged his friend, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to contribute funds to buy up property in the valley to donate to the park, which was a critical step in the formation of Grand Teton National Park as we know today. Excerpt from \"Diary of a Dude Wrangler\": \"We have entertained millionaires and poets and artists, business men of every description…angels and those who weren’t; people whose homes were in every part of the country from New York to San Francisco; Prohibitionists and Anti-Prohibitionists, Fundamentalists and Modernists, Reactionaries and Radicals, Futurists and Classicists; the bow-legged and fat-legged and spindle-shanked and knock-kneed; Englishmen and Frenchmen and Canadians.\"",

When guests were ready to go on a trail ride, the wranglers saddled up the horses and brought them out. Dudes often rode the same horse for years, developing a strong attachment. Look for the horses’ names written on the wall, above where their saddles would have hung. Excerpt from \"Diary of a Dude Wrangler\": \"Dude-horses are in a class by themselves. They are not easy to find. They must have a combination of qualities rare in any single animal, and certainly non-existent in the human animal. They must be young and fast, yet gentle and easy-gaited, and infinitely wise. I have seen the ignorant perform about them, and on them, feats that leave the cowpuncher gasping. Twice, I have seen people get on backward! Yes—they put the right foot in the left stirrup and with the utmost abandon, swung the left leg over the horse’s head and landed facing the horse’s tail, an exploit difficult for even the trained rider.\"",

Because the trip took so long and was so expensive, visitors tended to stay at dude ranches for weeks, if not the entire summer. Often, the same families would return year after year. However, with the growing popularity of the automobile in the 1930s and 40s and the advent of the “tin can dude” or automobile tourist, more people wanted to stay for just a few days and visit more locations—similar to the way people vacation today. A growing middle class also meant that more people had the means to travel, though generally not the freedom to take the entire summer off. These shifts changed the unique culture and camaraderie that once existed among the longtime guests and their hosts at dude ranches, and many ranches ceased operating altogether. Excerpt from \"Jackson Hole Journal\": \"The journey took about six days on a train through the summer Middle West with no air conditioning, and windows that opened to the blasts of baked prairie heat and cinders from the steam engines. … Finally, we boarded [another] train up to Victor, arriving in the morning for the total excitement of the Teton Range emerging, turned backwards, over the Idaho foothills; and then at last came the disembarkation to the waiting wagon, or, later on, the truck. The trip was miserable, enthralling, exhausting—an experience. And finally, the blessed clean, cool quietness of the ranch, loud at night with the sound of the river, brilliant by day with flowers and butterflies. No wonder that when Easterners went through all that, they felt that they had gotten somewhere—somewhere important, exotic, isolated and special, well worth the trip—but on the other hand, made worthwhile by that trip.\"",

Excerpt from \"Diary of a Dude Wrangler\": \"A friend of ours, a rancher from many miles away, came to visit us unexpectedly and found us in the midst of a fancy-dress party. I was dressed in some sort of a silly costume, and the doctor, my partner, was dressed in something even more silly. We give these parties every now and then, usually on the spur of the moment. The neighbors drop in, and it is all very colorful and amusing—the big log cabin lit with candles, the fire smoldering in an open fireplace, the fiddlers over in one corner, and, unlike most fancy dress parties, the cowboys real cowboys.

It was simply a large hollow, fed by a ditch that brought water to the ranch from Cottonwood Creek, over three miles away. Part of the flow was diverted to the garden and corrals, and the rest fed the swimming pool. Wells provided water for drinking and washing. Only two shallow depressions are visible today to mark where the swimming pool once was. Excerpt from \"Jackson Hole Journal\": \"We learned to swim in the wide swimming pool, held up by breath-inflated white canvas water wings. In the same pool, ladies dipped themselves, dressed in rubber shoes, black stockings, floppy black bathing dresses reaching to the knees, and floppy caps over all that put-up hair.

Here, huge mountains, enormous glaciers, and temperate rainforest meet the ocean. Visitor services are only found in town of Yakutat, which is a plane or boat ride away from Anchorage. A wide variety of outdoor enthusiasts come here to hike the beaches, float or fish the rivers, surf ocean waves, explore the bays, view glaciers, climb mountains and enjoy the wilderness.",

Yakutat is a remote community and, like many cities in Southeast Alaska, can only be accessed by air or water. Alaska Airlines offers daily jet passenger and freight service to and from both Juneau and Anchorage. Flight times vary depending on the season. The local airport is 4 miles southeast of the city of Yakutat. The Alaska State Ferry System offers a stop in Yakutat, but does not service the community year-round. The town activities are spread out over a few miles, so it is recommended to reserve a rental car before arriving.

Alaska Airlines offers daily jet passenger and freight service to and from both Juneau and Anchorage. Flight times vary depending on the season. The local airport is 4 miles southeast of the city of Yakutat. The Alaska State Ferry System offers a stop in Yakutat, but does not service the community year-round. The town activities are spread out over a few miles, so it is recommended to reserve a rental car before arriving.

There are air taxis in Yakutat who are approved to operate in the park, which you can find by visiting kayaking services. These air taxis fly planes that are capable of landing on the bush strip at Kageet Point, which is the most common point of access for Icy Bay kayakers. It's a raised beach strip, and makes for a lovely initial camping spot while you set up your gear. There are many bears throughout the area, but those using Icy Bay before you have been diligent in practicing proper food storage techniques and there have been no adverse human-bear interactions in recent years. Exercise proper caution as you would in bear country throughout Alaska.",

Deafening in spring and early summer when the waterfall peaks in volume, you can expect to get sprayed with water when standing on the footbridge near its base. This paved loop trail offers different vantage points of Yosemite Falls, and you can stop at several exhibits along the way to learn more about the natural and cultural history of the area. The eastern trail is accessible.",

At Canaveral National Seashore.\nSpeaker 2:\nMost people visit Canaveral National Seashore to enjoy the sounds of ocean waves or feel the impressive rumble of a rocket launch. But don't miss the history of this unique national park.\nSpeaker 2:\nRising 50 feet up between the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian River Lagoon is Turtle Mound, a protected archeological site composed of oyster shells discarded by early Native Americans in Florida. This is one of the jewels of Canaveral National Seashore.\nSpeaker 3:\nIf I could pick a favorite spot, I would choose Turtle Mound. Reason being the feeling of being on top of the world. They have an area over there that get the sea and overlook everything around you. So again, you get to hear the rustlings of the trees and the birds flying around.\nSpeaker 4:\nI feel like the less you hear in property noise here with like the mechanical stuff, the more animals will come out, and more people will get to see more the features and species that we attain.\nSpeaker 2:\nFurther to the south, the wilderness community of Eldora was once a trading port along Mosquito Lagoon. The state house of Eldora is one of only three historic homes that still remain within the park boundaries. Sitting on the old time porch gives the impression of living in another time.\nSpeaker 5:\nWhy is sound important to us?\nSpeaker 6:\nIt's so we can hear what's going on. Like, if it's an important situation, like what's going to happen to us or something around us.\nSpeaker 7:\nI say, sound is important because really you may see something and know how it works, but there may be a part that you're missing that you could hear. And, you know, it really identifies, puts more details.\nSpeaker 2:\nOn the west side of Indian River Lagoon, sits a historic home called Seminole Rest. As it catches the breeze from atop a Native American clam shell mound, this house is the perfect place to hear the tranquility of lagoon life.\nSpeaker 2:\nImagine how these sounds have changed over the years. What memories do you have of being in a place with wildlife and natural habitat?\nSpeaker 8:\nMy grandma and I, we went to a campground and we went kayaking in a place like Eldora. And that's the memory that I thought I thought of when I came.\nSpeaker 2:\nAt Canaveral National Seashore the opportunities to make new memories are endless. We have this moment, right now, to conserve natural sounds and protect the reason we love our national parks.\nSpeaker 11:\nNatural history deserves to be protected.\nSpeaker 2:\nTake a moment to listen to your surroundings. What do you hear and what should be protected?\nSpeaker 2:\nThis audio postcard was produced by the Young Sound Seekers Program, a partnership between the Center for Visually Impaired, Atlantic Center for the Arts, and Stetson University.

Water can present itself in many ways, but how does it feel to you?\nSpeaker 2:\nThe water is quiet.\nSpeaker 3:\nThe water is calming and peaceful.\nSpeaker 4:\nIt makes me fall asleep.\nBackground sound:\nBloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.\nSpeaker 5:\nWhoosh.\nSpeaker 1:\nWater can be rhythmic. A steady pitter-patter of rain.\nSpeaker 6:\nMusic in your ear.\nSpeaker 1:\nThe pull and ebb of waves.\nSpeaker 7:\nI like the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.\nSpeaker 1:\nPetals lapping at their borders.\nSpeaker 3:\nOne of my favorites was the bubbling of the mangroves.\nSpeaker 1:\nAt Canaveral National Seashore, many animals rely on this resource for food, travel, and shelter. On a clear, sunny day, you might get the chance to see dolphins, spraying mist with their splashing tails. On quiet, moonlit nights, visitors can come to the park to see nesting loggerhead sea turtles. But there's many more unexpected creatures just below the surface of-\nSpeaker 5:\nThe ocean.\nSpeaker 1:\nLet's take a dive.\nSpeaker 8:\nWhat listening activity that we have done at Young Sound Seekers would you like others to try?\nSpeaker 9:\nThe hydrophone cause you got to hear what was underwater. You got to listen to something you can't really see. It was nice to hear the popping shrimp in there, just popping, whipping their tail.\nSpeaker 2:\nSounds like a crab snapping its claws.\nSpeaker 9:\nFishes passing by. Boats you could hear from a distance. It was nice.\nSpeaker 1:\nHere at the Indian River Lagoon, more than 4,000 species of animals and plants thrive, all in under four feet of water. Long ago, the Timucua Native Americans prospered from the bountiful supply of oysters, shellfish, and muscles, leaving behind immense mountains of shells like the one at Turtle Mound. Within the diverse lagoon, you can hear the soothing sounds of chirping birds, the dashing fish, water rushing over the shells piled along the shore, and the many plants swaying in the wind.\nSpeaker 1:\nCome to Canaveral to experience, to live, to protect, and listen.\nSpeaker 10:\nThis audio postcard was produced by the Young Sound Seekers program, a partnership between the Center for Visually Impaired, Atlantic Center for the Arts, and Stetson University, supported by the National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division.",

And it's like, \"Oh wow! There's more to life than just me.\"\nSpeaker 10:\nIt takes you out of that thinking that I'm the center of the universe.\nSpeaker 8:\nIt's important to protect the Canaveral National Seashore, so we can continue to have a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\nSpeaker 11:\nI really understood, once I came to these parks for the first time, why they should be protected. It was very evident to me that there should not be houses built here. There should not be an airport built here because once you tear that stuff down, you've lost the home for all of these natural creatures. And it's very hard to get areas back to their original habitat, after you destroy them.\nSpeaker 8:\nIt's important to take time to incorporate wellness into your life. And the Canaveral National Seashore is maintained to help you do just that.\nSpeaker 12:\nIt's calming and relaxing and really soothes your nerves when you're stressful. It really just gives you a break from everything.\nSpeaker 13:\nIt takes you away from the stress of your everyday life.\nSpeaker 8:\nThe rushing waves provide calming natural sound for a picnic, and the sound of birds and rustling leaves makes you feel connected to nature. You can forget about whether you left the water running at home or not, and remember your ties to the environment.\nSpeaker 14:\nWhat would you want to tell somebody who's never been here?\nSpeaker 15:\nI would tell them to leave all their electronics but their phone at home and still mute your phone. So then you don't have as much anthrophony and you'll be focused on nature instead of your device.\nSpeaker 11:\nSay you have your headphones in listening to music. You can see the trees moving and everything but you can't really pick up the rhythm and how it's moving, how it sounds and everything. You may be able to imagine it, but not the exact kind of sound that you're looking for. And that's what is just so calming. There's a little rhythm, it just goes along and it just makes you relax.\nSpeaker 16:\nOf the wind and trees, listen to it, pay attention.\nSpeaker 8:\n\"I want to be the very best, like no one ever was.\" That's what Ash Ketchum said. And it's how The National Park Service feels about providing a beautiful place for people to come enjoy themselves and get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. So please come to our parks, enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy yourself because you deserve it.\nSpeaker 17:\nThis audio postcard was produced by The Young Sound Seekers Program, a partnership between the Center for Visually Impaired, Atlantic Center for the Arts, and Stetson University, supported by The National Park Service, Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division.",
