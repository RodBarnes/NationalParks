It is salt tolerant and can be found living in coastal environments that are relatively harsh such as the marsh-forest transition zone. Aromatic wax myrtle leaves and aromatic and when crushed the oils  were rubbed on the skin as an insect repellent.

From the intersection of Boundary Channel Drive and Boundary Access Road, travel north on Boundary Channel Drive ninety feet. Turn right and enter the parking lot.<br />Two benches are set at the mid-point of a sidewalk that sits between parking lots to the north and south. A wood sign behind the two benches and set amongst pine trees and vegetation is inscribed to read:<br />THE<br />LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON<br />MEMORIAL GROVE<br />ON THE POTOMAC<br />Walkways on either side of the sidewalk lead down to a platform along Boundary Channel. The approximately seventy-square foot wooden deck has a three-foot tall railing along the north and south sides and a pedestrian bridge that carries over the river to a heavily wooded island on the other side. The back, west side of the plaza has a seven-foot-high stone wall and set in the center a three by four-foot wood panel. A black sign on the panel reads:<br />Lyndon Baines <br />Johnson Memorial<br />Grove on the Potomac<br />Dedicated on April 6, 1976, as a living<br />Memorial to our thirty-sixth president.<br />National Park Service<br />U.S. Department of the Interior<br />Follow the trail across the footbridge to enter the grove<br />Two waysides sit at the right side of the entrance to the bridge. Similar to the sign along the back wall, the left sign reads:<br />Lyndon Baines <br />Johnson Memorial<br />Grove on the Potomac<br />The right sign is titled at the top:<br />The Boundary Channel<br />The background of the sign is a drawing of the Potomac River flowing along the southern edge of Washington and meeting Eastern Branch along the bottom. An area of Virginia jutting out into the Potomac is labeled \"Alexander's Island.\" Text along the bottom of the sign reads:<br />A surveyor's map from 1794 shows the narrow bog that attached Alexander's Island to the Virginia Shoreline.<br />Text on the left describes a lengthy dispute over the jurisdiction of Columbia Island:<br />England's King Charles I granted the entire Potomac River to Maryland in 1632. Four centuries later Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia were still arguing over their mutual boundary.<br />Alexander's Island was one controversial site. It was known for its \"bogs and swamps and frogs.\" At low tide the island was attached to - and claimed by - Virginia. At high tide the Potomac River encircled it, making it part of the District of Columbia<br />Tensions over Alexander's Island exploded in 1904. A group of enraged men carrying axes and sledgehammers raided the Alexander Island Race Track in an attempt to close it. The District of Columbia did not permit race track betting, while Virginia did.<br />In 1915 the Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the Potomac River. In the process they completely removed the swampy landmass that was Alexander's Island. In its place they created the Boundary Channel, which runs beneath this footbridge, and Columbia Island, which is visible across the channel from you.<br />In 1934 Congress determined that, while Alexander's Island had once definitely been part of Virginia, its destruction shifted the shoreline of the Potomac River. The Boundary Channel became the new official border for Virginia, and the man-made Columbia Island was unquestionably part of Washington, D.C.<br />On the right side of the sign is a map of the Potomac River along the southern point of Washington, Boundary Channel, Columbia Island and an area across the river in Virginia labeled \"Arlington Canyonment.\" Text below reads:<br />The Boundary Channel and Columbia Island on a World War II map.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

            "bodyText": "The centennial of World War I provided the opportunity to give long-overdue recognition to America’s 4.7 million sons and daughters who served in the War to End All Wars. The site eventually chosen for the new memorial was Pershing Park, originally the home of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) Memorial, dedicated in 1981 to honor the American forces who served in Europe during the war and named for their commander, General John J. Pershing. In 2020 the memorial was expanded to honor not just the AEF but all Americans who served, including U.S. Navy sailors, Coast Guardsmen, men and women in uniform who did not serve in Europe and those who served in civilian capacities.<br /> <br /> Memorial architect Joe Weishaar retained the major elements of the AEF Memorial, which included a statue of General Pershing and a 10-foot high wall containing two battle maps with appropriate inscriptions, were retained as part of the World War I Memorial, and added several new features.<br /> <br /> The memorial’s central feature is Sabin Howard’s sculpture A Soldier’s Journey, based on the myth of “the hero’s journey” and representing the American experience of World War I. On the reverse of the sculpture is the Peace Fountain, a cascade of water flowing over lines form the poem “The Young Dead Soldiers.” The poem, a call to remember those killed in war and give meaning to their sacrifice, is by Archibald MacLeish, an artillery captain in the war who later won three Pulitzer Prizes and served as the Librarian of Congress.<br /> <br /> The Belvedere is the conceptual center of the memorial and provides a commanding view of the memorials elements: the John J. Pershing Memorial to the left, \"A Soldier’s Journey\" directly ahead, and the flagstaff with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson and others to the right. Interpretive panels along the Belvedere wall describe American accomplishments in the war, the roles played by Americans of all backgrounds, and the legacy of the war. The center medallion depicts the figure of winged Victory portrayed on the medals awarded to the AEF and other Allied forces. Inscribed on the front of the wall are the names of the major campaigns for which Army and Navy units were awarded battle honors.<br /> <br /> The final element of the memorial is a pair of quotations inscribed on planter boxes farther to you right. One, from Willa Cather’s 1922 novel One of Ours, is a testament to the achievements and sacrifices of American armed forces in the war. The other, from Alta May Andrews of the Army Nurse Corps, speaks of her own pride in having a chance to serve, and more broadly for the contributions of all Americans – including women, African Americans, Native Americans, and immigrants – to the American war effort.",

            "audioDescription": "(646 words)<br />The Abner Cloud House is located on the C&O Canal in Washington, D.C., east of Fletcher's Boat House.<br />From the intersection of Canal and Reservoir Roads, NW travel north on Canal Road about one hundred fifty feet, then turn onto the far-left lane side road, to the left of a three-foot tall stone dividing wall. The three-story white Abner Cloud House will be on your left. <br />Follow the gravel path to the left around the corner of the house, where a parking lot runs along the house and about one hundred yards to the south.<br />The three-story white stone house has green painted doors and windows. At the building's west side from the parking lot, a door is on the bottom right and one window on the left. The second story features three windows, with the far-right window smaller and about two-feet lower. The third floor three windows are all the same size.<br />Two three-story trees sit on the right, south side of the building. To the left, north side gravel steps with a wood railing lead up to the side road that runs along the front of the house at an incline.<br />At the front side the road runs along the second-floor level of the building. Here a green door sits on the left side, with two windows to the right. Three windows line the top third floor. A chimney runs up the north side of the house. A small eight-foot tall tree stands to the left of the door.<br />Two small windows sit at the top on the north side of the house, and one small window on the top third level of the south side.<br />A brown metal sign hangs at the third-floor level on the house's east side. Written in white letters it reads:<br />Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historic Park<br />Abner Cloud House<br />Fletcher's Boat House<br />Boats, Canoes, Bicycles<br />United States <br />Department of the Interior<br />National Park Service<br />On the south side of the house, left of the door, is a two by three-foot wayside. The black and white sign is titled in the top left corner: <br />Abner Cloud House<br />Text below describes the history of the Abner Cloud House:<br />This house witnessed the building of the C&O Canal. Abner Cloud, a miller who had come here from Pennsylvania, built the house in 1801. Cloud's mill was about 200 yards upstream. The basement of the house was used by Cloud to store grain and flour, and the family lived in the upper floors. Restoration was completed in 1976, with much assistance from the Colonial Dames of America, Chapter III. The top two floors are now their headquarters.<br />The full background of the sign is an active scene of a three-story white house sitting alongside a canal. A canal boat passes on the right, two people canoe from the left, and three more people float by on a boat at the canal's far end. Next to them on the path is a donkey-drawn carriage being followed by a dog. A man on a horse walks in front of them, amongst three women in dresses. Other women and girls in dresses with a dog watch from the close side of the canal. Text at the top center reads:<br />This painting of the C&O Canal depicts the Abner Cloud House as a bustling place of commerce and tourism during the mid to late 1800s.<br />In the upper right corner is an image of a man sitting at the front end of a long, thin canal boat floating from right to left. A second man is back in the far end of the boat. Text to the left of them reads: [LINK 3]<br />George Washington's Patowmack Canal, completed in 1802, provided Cloud access to Georgetown markets. Long, narrow boats, called sharpers, transported his flour, entering the Potomac River just upstream from here, near Little Falls.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

On the right, the building abuts the former West Branch Bank Building; on the left is the pedestrian extension of Downey Street, which leads into the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The mostly wooden structure stands on a cement base 2 to 3 feet high. The rest of the building is painted a cream color and accented with light grey. In the center of the 25-foot wide façade, a double set of stairs lead to a pair of entrances. There are six steps up on either side of a central railing. Large storefront windows are located to the left and right of the stairs, above the concrete base. The second story is of clapboard construction with three rectangular windows. A small double third-floor window is set into the gable of the wide pitched roof. A central chimney sticks up from the peak. It’s just one step up from the street to the sidewalk here, and there is a curb cut at the corner of Downey Street, just to the left of the building. End of message.",

            "audioDescription": "(506 words)<br />The Abner Cloud Mill is located west of the Abner Cloud House on the C&O Canal in Washington, D.C. <br />From the intersection of Canal and Reservoir Roads, NW travel north on Canal Road about one hundred fifty feet, then turn onto the far-left lane side road, to the left of a three-foot tall stone dividing wall. You will pass the three-story white Abner Cloud House on your left. <br />Continue straight over a ten-foot-long bridge and stone tunnel to your right. The gravel road will turn left and descend as you go into a tunnel after about two hundred feet. This portion of the road is poorly deteriorated. <br />Upon exiting the one-hundred-foot tunnel, you will reach an open gravel space about sixty feet long. To the right, in the northwest corner is a two by three-foot wayside. The white sign is titled in the top left corner and reads:<br />Abner Cloud Mill<br />Echos of Milestones<br />Text beneath describes activity that occurred at the mill:<br />Baking bread, frying cornbread and eating \"stick to your ribs\" oatmeal, all have one thing in common: their ingredients started out at a grist mill. Decades before the sounds of lockhorns and mule hooves clopping by, mills were popping up along the Potomac River and the early Patowmack Canal that skirted Little Falls. The area in front of you was occupied by the grist mill, built and operated by Abner Cloud in 1801. Water supplied to this mill came from the Patowmack Company Skirting Canal.<br />Cloud operated the mill until his death in 1812, and his widow, Suzanne, continued to operate it until 1852. The mill changed hands throughout the following decades, at various times known as the Frizzle Mill and Cloud-Edes Mill. The National Park Service uncovered the building remains in 2010. It is speculated that wheat, corn, and oat flour milled here was carried by the C&O Canal boats. As you view the ruins, imagine the sound of the water wheel on the nearby stream pushing the mill stones as they clatter round and round.<br />The sign features a black and white picture in the upper right corner of the ruins of a two-story stone building. Three sets of window or door openings are on the first floor and three window openings line the 2nd floor front. Two more openings are on the first and second floor levels on the side of the building, which stands amongst a dead tree and brush. Text below reads:<br />Cloud Mill ruins, ca. 1914.<br />Photograph from the Rambler Collection, <br />Courtesy Historical Society of Washington, D.C.<br />The bottom half of the sign shows a black and white photograph of four canal boats sitting in line in still water on a canal. <br />Six feet to the left of the sign is a thirty-foot wooden bridge with handrails on both sides. The bridge carries over a rushing canal that feeds into the Potomac River. Stone blocks line the inner south wall of the canal and three steel beams span the stream on the north side of the bridge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

While it is not a part of Olympic National Park, it is popular with locals and visitors alike for its hiking and bird-watching.<br /> <br /> From the refuge: \"At <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Dungeness/\">Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge</a> one of the world's longest natural sand spits softens the rough sea waves to form a tranquil bay, fertile tideflats, and beaches of sand and gravel. Here wildlife find food, a place to rest, and protection from winds and pounding surf. Recognizing the area's importance to wildlife, President Woodrow Wilson declared Dungeness Spit and its surrounding waters a National Wildlife Refuge in 1915. Dungeness is one of over 500 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. A network of lands set aside specifically for wildlife, the System is our living heritage, conserving wildlife and habitat for generations to come. Dungeness NWR is open to the public year-round. Hiking, wildlife watching, and photography are popular activities on the Refuge. There is also an adjacent campground, Dungeness Recreation Area, which is managed by Clallam County <a href=\"http://www.clallam.net/Parks/Dungeness.html\">(click here for campground information)</a>. <br /> <br /> \"Some areas are closed seasonally or permanently to protect sensitive species. Pets, bicycles, kite flying, frisbees, ball-playing, camping, and fires are not permitted on the Refuge as they are a disturbance for the many migrating birds and other wildlife taking solitude on the Refuge. West of Sequim on Highway 101, turn north on Kitchen-Dick Road. Continue 3 miles (4.8 km) to Dungeness County Recreation Area. Pass through the recreation area to reach the Refuge parking lot.\"<br /> <br /> The refuge is open from 7 a.m. to half an hour before sunset, and closing times are posted daily at the trailhead. There is an entrance fee of $3 per family or group (up to 4 adults), payable by cash or check.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Believed to have been originally built in the last quarter of the 18th century, the Laurel Branch house was a simple one-story two-room dwelling of modest dimensions and appearance. Deeper than wide, room behind room, and exterior chimneys at one end the house was typical of an architectural style popular in lower Southern Maryland from the second half of the 18th century well into the first half of the 19th century. Homes of this style and construction were often owned by tradespeople or small landowners of modest means. As typical as this house is it is also in many ways atypical.</p> <p><br /> What makes this home more interesting is the way it was constructed. Much of it is far less “sophisticated” than one might think. Its sills and joists were laid without any support and riven clapboard of less than ideal dimensions were used in the construction of the roof and attic partitions. There is evidence that the ceiling rafters and joists were made from improperly dried wood and warped shortly after construction. No doubt other homes were built using these shortcuts, and no wonder only one, Laurel Branch, survived.<br /> If there is one aspect of the house that is the most interesting and helps us date it more precisely it is the two small, cater-cornered fireplaces. Laurel Branch is the only example of this room behind room plan with such fireplaces recorded in Charles County or as far as is known, in all of Southern Maryland. This design of corner fireplaces was common in the area between 1740 and 1770 and given all the other data the house is generally agreed to have been built circa 1770.</p>",

At one time, this watchtower boasted 5 cannons, one of which could shoot up to three miles down range.<br /> <br /> Fort Matanzas is a very simple structure, its main strengths being the artillery and its strategic location. Five cannons once guarded the fort. Each cannon could easily reach the inlet, then only a half-mile away. Two original cannon still stand guard at the fort today. These guns were placed at the fort in 1793 and left behind by the Spanish when they departed Florida in 1821. The other two cannon now on the gun deck are modern reproductions used for the park's cannon firing demonstrations.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "At the top of the wooden stairs is the gundeck. This audio description includes the interior areas of the fort that can be accessed from this location.<br /><br />Standing at the top of the stairs, at the gun deck level, facing east, the description, moving from left to right, includes:<br /><br />To the immediate left is a wooden bench.<br /><br />Beyond that wooden stairs lead to a platform and the entry to the second level.<br /><br />At 10 o'clock is the entry to the Soldier's quarters. It has a fireplace, wooden table, and long platform bed with artifacts such as muskets and wooden barrels. <br /><br />To the left of the entry to the soldier's quarters is a water cistern.<br /><br />Straight ahead and to the right, platforms extend out from the east wall and south wall with four cannons, facing outward.<br /><br />At 3 o'clock, at the southwest corner, is a cylindrically shaped structure, with a domed top. A 5 inch high step is at the entry to this structure, which is the sentry box. There is a low doorway, approximately 5 Â½ feet (Check NPS) tall. You may need to duck down. The interior is 8 feet high with three small square windows. <br /><br />To access the third level to the Officer's quarters you climb the wooden risers previously noted, at 10 o'clock, and enter through the wooden door at the landing. The Officer's quarters has various features that are roped off on the left, or west, wall, including the entryway into the powder magazine, where gun powder was stored. Ahead, to the north, there is a window, to the northeast a wooden chest, a desk, and to the east a wooden bed. In the center of the room is a wooden ladder to the observation deck. At the top of the ladder you will be facing north.<br /><br />Once on the observation deck, a pole behind you, to the south, is flying the Spanish colonial flag, which is white with a ragged red \"x\" shape. To you right, or east, is a chimney, made of coquina stone with a capped vent. <br /><br />The View from the observation deck: To the north is the intersection of the Matanzas River and the intracoastal Waterway. To the southeast is the Matanzas inlet and the distant Atlantic Ocean. To the west is a grassy area extending to scrubby native grasses and bushes, and, further away, to the intracoastal Waterway. The ferry dock, Matanzas river, and visitor center are to the east. <br />",

I'll be right back with lunch!\" If you could translate Tern-speak, this is what you might hear in May or June at the least tern nesting colony at the southern tip of Anastasia Island at Fort Matanzas National Monument.<br /> <br /> Each spring this smallest member of the tern family leaves its wintering grounds along the coast of Central and South America. Some fly through Mexico to California; others follow the Mississippi River, and others fly to the eastern coast of the United States for the summer nesting season.<br /> <br /> A social bird, least terns nest in colonies of only a few nests to several hundred nests, depending on the availability of food, suitable sand (coarse and shelly), and disturbance (or lack of it). Colonial nesting is also a protection against predators such as raccoons, dogs, and house cats. Colonies usually return to the same nesting site each year. In the past few decades, due to habitat loss and crowded beaches, some least terns have begun nesting on the flat, gravel roofs of buildings!<br /> <br /> In late March and early April the terns begin to arrive. The male least tern dives headfirst into the water to catch a small fish which he offers to a prospective mate. She will look him over and appraise his gift. If she accepts the fish, they will become a mated pair for that season.<br /> <br /> Here at Matanzas, there is plenty of food in the ocean and estuary, and the coarse coquina sand at the south end of Anastasia Island is ideal for least tern nests. (The colony at Fort Matanzas is the largest on Florida's east coast. In 2010 there were over 200 nests.) The nest is only a shallow scraping in the sand. After mating, the female lays 2-3 cream-colored, speckled eggs which are nearly invisible against the varicolored sand. Both male and female take their turns incubating the eggs and protecting them and then the chicks from the sun.<br /> <br /> After about 21 days, the eggs hatch into tiny, cream-colored, speckled chicks, which, for the first few days stay still in the nest, avoiding predators. After about four days the chicks are able to leave the nest and exercise their legs. Somehow, even though there might be hundreds of identical-looking chicks scurrying around the nesting grounds, the adults always know which ones are theirs (and vice versa) as the hungry chicks come running up for a meal every hour.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Within another four weeks (June and July) the young birds are fully fledged and ready to fly. However, if storms or predators wipe out the early nests, the pairs will often re-nest, extending the season into August or September.<br /> <br /> Both parents are very protective of the nests and chicks, dive bombing and even defecating on people or animals who come near. Disturbance of the birds threatens the survival of the eggs and chicks, because when the adults are forced to fly up in defense, it leaves the eggs and chicks exposed to the hot sun and to predators such as crows, herons, and gulls. If adults are disturbed repeatedly, they may even abandon their nests.<br /> <br /> By 1900, the species had been nearly wiped out by plume hunters seeking to satisfy the latest fashion statement-- feathers or even whole birds on women's hats. The species never fully recovered. Least terns are now listed as a threatened species in Florida based on this previous population decline and more recently, threats to their coastal habit.<br /> <br /> If you walk down the beach to look at the terns, please respect closed areas and keep your distance. If the birds fly up, you are too close. Leave your dog at home or keep it on a 6-foot leash. Birds perceive dogs as predators and will be disturbed even if the dog is not actively chasing them. An agitated bird is not able to look for food for its chicks. If you live close to the beach, keep your cats indoors.<br /> <br /> Only through protection of existing breeding areas can the continued existence of least terns be assured in Florida.<br /> <br /> The birds use only a small area of the beach for only about three months. People can have it for the rest of the year. Give terns a chance.</p>",

(Some of the trees, especially in the scrub area, are the closely related species sand live oak.)<br /> <br /> Live oaks possibly get their name because, unlike most other deciduous oaks which drop their leaves in the winter and might look dead, live oaks lose and replace their leaves gradually throughout the year and so look \"live\".<br /> Unlike many other oak trees, live oaks have narrow, smooth-edged leaves, although the leaves of young trees do show some teeth. The edges of these shiny, thick, dark green leaves often curl under. The thick, waxy coating and curling help the tree conserve moisture during the long, hot summers.<br /> <br /> Live oaks are fast growing, hardy trees that prefer acidic, sandy soil and lots of sun. They are fairly salt tolerant, but if you look at them from the side of the picnic area parking lot, you will notice that they appear to be bending away from the ocean. This is due to salt pruning in which salt in the air kills the tender buds on the side closest to the beach.<br /> <br /> Live oaks produce hanging male flowers called catkins which fill the air (and coat our automobiles) with yellow pollen in the spring. Small female flowers appear in clusters where the leaves join the twigs. Later, dark brown acorns are produced. The sweet \"meat\" within the acorn is coveted by birds, squirrels, and even deer. In earlier times, the Native Americans of the area ground live oak acorns into meal.<br /> <br /> Live oaks are known for their large size. The trees grow up to 60 feet tall, and the large canopy typically spreads nearly twice their height. The huge branches of mature trees droop and grow horizontally, sometimes even sweeping the ground. The champion live oak in Waycross, GA is 86 feet tall with a crown spread of 143 feet, and a trunk that is ten feet in diameter. Live oaks are also known for their age. Some scientists think that the Angel Oak in Charleston, SC is more than 1,400 years old.<br /> Tree boring has dated the large oaks in the Fort Matanzas picnic area to almost 200 years old.<br /> <br /> During the time of wooden sailing ships, live oak trees became very important because almost every curve found in a ship's hull could be cut from the curling branches live oaks. Also, the wood is very hard and strong. Dried live oak wood weighs about 60 lbs. per cubic foot, making it among the heaviest of any North American tree. The wood is also resistant to disease and decay. The USS Constitution was one of the famous ships built of live oak timbers, receiving the nickname Old Ironsides due to the strength of its oak construction. In the War of 1812 the USS Constitution engaged the British ship HMS Laurant. Old Ironsides shattered and crushed the Laurant's hull which was made of pine.<br /> <br /> In 1826 President John Adams set aside a stand of live oaks on Santa Rosa Island near Pensacola to assure a future supply of timber for the U.S. Navy. Some of these trees are still protected there in the Naval Live Oak area of Gulf Islands National Seashore.</p>",

It was not until 1916 that efforts were first made to preserve this unique part of America's history. The National Park Service continues to preserve this structure for future generations.</p> <h3>1916</h3> <p>Early on, the United States War Department believed that the construction of modern coastal fortifications was a priority and was unprepared to devote any of its resources to preservation of obsolete fortifications. Finally things changed in 1916 when a Fortification Bill was signed and money was appropriated. These repairs stabilized the areas which needed the most attention and removed some vegetation from the fort. Funding ceased when the U.S. entered World War I.</p> <h3>1924</h3> <p>In early 1924 another authorization was made to conduct repairs on the fort. These repairs included tearing down and rebuilding portions of the East and South walls of the gun platform. Many stones were removed and much of the original stone was used in reconstructing these walls. Later that year, President Calvin Coolidge issued an order which declared Fort Matanzas a National Monument. Among the many projects undertaken at this time was a $750 allotment to reconstruct a sentry box.</p> <h3>1935</h3> <p>The National Park Service took over full operation of Fort Matanzas on July 1, 1935. At the height of the Great Depression the Public Works Administration (PWA), not to be confused with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) allotted funding specifically for restoration of the old watchtower. Projects included a complete reconstruction of the tower arch and a portion of the south side of the tower wall. Also, for the first time in the history of Fort Matanzas, a sea wall was installed around the building to prevent further erosion. Across the Matanzas River, land was set aside to build a visitor center complex. This visitor center still stands in operation today! Over the years, additional projects have been undertaken for the continued preservation and public use of the monument.</p> <h3>1972</h3> <p>The National Park Service began the current ferry service in 1972 when a local boat captain started a concession operation to take people to the fort. Over the years, the monument has also gone through a series of different boat docking facilities. The first was wood, followed by aluminum, and later upgraded to a floating concrete platform which now houses the park's ferry service. Today the monument has two Ferry Boats which carry over 70,000 visitors a year, while the overall park receives over 600,000. Today's funding for future projects actually comes from the admission fees taken at the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument. A percentage of those sales help keep the boats in service and fund future projects geared to preserving and maintaining this national treasure for the enjoyment of future generations.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>One of the most common plants growing within the sand dune system at Fort Matanzas is sea oats (Uniola paniculata). It can be argued that sea oats is one of the most important species comprising the dune ecosystem, particularly the foredune. It is a hardy and salt tolerant plant that can survive in the harsh seashore environment. (It can even survive being inundated by sea water for short periods.) It and other pioneer plants help trap wind-blown sand, which is the first step in dune formation. Once the dune becomes established, sea oat's extensive root system acts to anchor the dune in place. Besides its vital role in contributing to sand dune stabilization, the seeds of sea oats are a crucial food source for one of the rarest animals at Fort Matanzas, the Anastasia Island beach mouse. In addition to beach mice, red-winged blackbirds, sparrows, and marsh rabbits also readily consume sea oats seeds.<br /> <br /> Let's look at sea oats in more detail. It is a plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is a semitropical perennial, meaning that it produces seeds from year to year, and inhabits the zone between the temperate climate to the north, and the tropical climate to the south. Its leaves are thin (about a quarter inch in width) and vary from eight to twenty-four inches in length, coming to a point at their tips. The plant itself is erect and can grow up to six feet tall.<br /> <br /> One of the most conspicuous features of sea oats is its large seed heads. They look a little bit like flattened oats, and turn a straw color in late summer. The plant reproduces itself by these seeds (their flat shape helps them disperse in the wind), but its primary method of reproduction is through the action of rhizomes (underground stems), which the parent plant shoots out in a radial pattern. Roots emerge at nodes along the rhizome where new clonal plants emerge into the daylight. This growth pattern contributes importantly to sea oats' ability to stabilize shifting sand dunes. In fact, being buried by sand actually stimulates growth in this species. The hot climate of Florida allows for a long growing season for sea oats, which lasts from spring through the fall.<br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of sea oats biology takes place beneath the surface. The plant benefits from existing in a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. This fungus uses the roots of sea oats as a substrate upon which to live. By doing so they in effect increase the surface area of the roots, by which the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil. This contributes to overall plant community health.<br /> <br /> Sea oats is considered such an important plant in terms of its integral role in sand dune formation and stabilization, that it has been given special protected status by the state of Florida. (It is illegal to destroy or remove sea oats without a permit.) To understand why this is so, think of the protective nature of sand dunes. They drastically reduce the impact of the wind (and the associated salt spray) coming in off the ocean. This allows other plants to grow in the leeward side of the foredunes, protected from the direct onslaught of the ocean. Where a greater variety of plants survive, organic matter (humus) is eventually laid down as leaves fall and plants die, forming a moist soil into which even more plants can grow (particularly woody species like trees). Eventually over hundreds of years a mature maritime forest forms where once was open seashore. Forests grow vertically as well as horizontally, supporting a greater variety of ecological niches that are filled with a multitude of animal species, leading to overall increased biodiversity. Without the initial formation of sand dunes, catalyzed by the presence of plants like sea oats, a mature forest would never have the chance to form.<br /> <br /> Of course, sand dunes also perform a much more utilitarian purpose besides ensuring biodiversity. They are nature's first line of defense against hurricanes and other large storms. By breaking up the wind and surf energy of a storm, and acting as a bulwark against tidal surge, sand dunes spare inland areas from the full fury of a storm's pounding. It follows that whenever sand dunes are compromised by putting roads and trails across them, or by constructing buildings upon them, they are no longer able to mitigate a storm's negative effects, thus increasing the likelihood that inshore areas will be subjected to greater damage. All this may be something to keep in mind the next time you see sea oats waving nonchalantly in the ocean breeze as you walk along the seashore!</p>",

One is here on Santa Rosa Island and the other is near San Diego. Scientists think that it never was a very abundant pine, probably always needing to be near the coast, but they do believe that in the past it occurred in more places along the coast. Unfortunately, specific places cannot be identified because of lack of fossil records. Furthermore, at the moment, it is not known which Torrey pine forest (Santa Rosa Island or San Diego) is the oldest.<br /> <br /> There is much debate on how and when the Torrey pine arrived on Santa Rosa Island. To date, researchers have yet to agree on an arrival date. Some have suggested several million years ago while others have suggested between 5,000 and 43,000 years ago. The seeds were most likely transported from the mainland by birds, possibly jays that are known to transport seeds a long distance, or possibly by cones floating across the ocean. The other possible explanation is that the Chumash or their ancestors brought them over. The Chumash were excellent seamen and traders and they did use Torrey pines. If that is true, the trees couldn't be much more than 13,000 years old (since this is the oldest human date from the islands). However, until it can be established by either fossil evidence or genetic variation that the trees were here before the Chumash, this possibility cannot be discounted.<br /> <br /> Thousands of years of isolation on Santa Rosa made this island version of the Torrey pine distinct. It is genetically different enough from the mainland trees that it is considered a separate subspecies and given its own common name-the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine (subspecies differ from each other in various ways but if crossed will produce fertile offspring). This island tree grows shorter, broader, and bushier than the mainland one. Also, its bark is thicker and scalier and its cones are rounder. They both have needles in clusters of five, but the pines on the island have blue-gray needles while those on the mainland are gray.<br /> <br /> Most scientists agree that the climate changed to a hotter and drier environment between 3,000 and 8,000 years ago, which may have caused a decrease in the number of Torrey pine forests, particularly on the mainland. The pines most likely survived here because of the cool, moist air from the persistent island fog and because of the limited competition from other plants-due to the island's isolation, a smaller number of plant species exist on the island as compared to the mainland.<br /> <br /> The Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine has a very limited range on the island. It only occurs on two sandstone bluffs in the northeast corner of the island. One is on the ridge overlooking Bechers Bay and the other is Box Canyon, one canyon over to the south. This limited range along with its limited individual genetic variability-all these trees are basically identical to each other-makes the Torrey pine very vulnerable to extinction. Species with little or no genetic variability cannot respond as satisfactorily to environmental changes-drought, a new disease, or insect pests-as can species with a more diverse gene pool.<br /> <br /> This is why the park closely monitors the health of the Torrey pines. And so far all studies have indicated that the pines are doing very well. In 1888, when the island Torrey pine was first described, the population of the grove was heavily impacted by sheep and was estimated to be about 100 mature, reproductive trees. With the removal of the sheep by 1910, the grove expanded to 1,500 trees by the mid-1990s and by 2015, the population increased to 3,500 trees and over 8,500 seedlings. Some of the oldest trees are in the heart of the grove and have been dated to over 250 years old.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing high on a rocky hillside, overlooking a wide ocean bay, surrounded by tall Torrey pine trees. In the distance, the coastline curves out to Carrington Point. In the middle of that curve are a cluster of buildings at the ranch complex, and a wooden pier that stretches far out into the ocean. <br /><br />The Torrey pines have tall thin dark brown trunks have bark with a cracked surface, like a cracked pie crust or alligator skin. Overhead, the tips of branches end in clusters of long spikey dark-green needles-up to about 10 inches long. Growing on the branches are brown oval -shaped pine cones, made of dozens of splayed open seed scales with gaps in between them.<br /><br />The rocky, bumpy ground surface below the pines is blanketed with brown pine needles; a few twisted, dead pine branches; and fallen pine cones. Some pine cones have rolled downhill, and collected at the bottom of gullies. <br /><br />Below the trees are a few smaller plants: island manzanita bushes, with red branches and green oval leaves with bunches of berries that are green, yellow, or red, depending on the season. Scrub oaks, with small bush-like trees with grey bark, small olive green, oval shaped leaves, and, in season, acorns shaped like a smooth cone, with a knit beanie hat on top. Monkey flower, with green oval leaves and small red flowers. <br /><br />Underfoot, the rocky ground surface is covered with lichen, a pale green crust-like growth, that looks like blotches of spray paint. <br /><br />Above the trees, you can often hear the screech of red tail hawks. One may also find Allen's hummingbirds-tiny, 3 inch long birds with fast fluttering wings, green backs, and purple throats. Sometimes you also find the colorful San Clemente spotted towhee, a large sparrow with a white-spotted black back and a black rump. Its breast is black, its belly white, and its sides are reddish brown. It has a black head with red eyes. Its wings are black with white spots and its long tail is black with white corners.<br /><br />As one heads south from the Torrey pine forest, a grassy hillside drops down toward low rolling hills, with sandy Skunk Point, in the distance.<br />",

From the time of Alpheus Thompson shipping cattle and sheep on a small schooner to the final shipment of cattle off Santa Rosa Island, boats have played a key role in ranch operations. Santa Rosa Island owners almost always had a boat specifically for transporting livestock, supplies, and personnel. Few other places in the Americas operated this way, and the Vail & Vickers ranch was among the last.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Mildred E</em>., 1901-1909</b><br /> The wooden, two-masted Mildred E. was built in 1884 in Meteghan, Nova Scotia, and was registered by Walter L. Vail and J. V. Vickers in December 10, 1901. Vail & Vickers used <em>Mildred E.</em> in island service for a short time. In 1903 the firm had the Santa Rosa Island constructed expressly for livestock transport, leaving Mildred E. to few duties. Proving unsatisfactory to the needs of the company, Vail & Vickers abandoned <em>Mildred E</em>. in 1909, claiming she was unfit for service.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Santa Rosa Island</em>, 1903-1915</b><br /> Some confusion has existed as to the <em>Santa Rosa</em> and the <em>Santa Rosa Island</em>. They were actually two different vessels. A. P. More's sailing schooner Santa Rosa wrecked in San Miguel Island's Cuyler Harbor in November 1899. Vail & Vickers contracted construction of the 87-foot, gasoline schooner <em>Santa Rosa Island</em> in Wilmington, California in 1903. Vail & Vickers put her to work hauling sheep off the island by July of 1903.<br /> <br /> After the ranch owners obtained the <em>Vaquero</em>, three of Walter Vail's sons-N. R., Ed and Banning-took the Santa Rosa Island on a four-month voyage to Mexico in 1915, leaving San Pedro for Cabo San Lucas, the Gulf of California, and Mazatlán. They and their friends, with a hired captain and cook, spent their time \"fishing, hunting, trading with the locals of coastal fishing villages, and socializing with Mazatlán's upper society of the day.\" Apparently the boat was sold shortly after the trip to Mexico and entered service in the South Pacific.<br /> <br /> <em><b>Onward</b></em><br /> Smaller boats served the island's smaller needs for transportation to and from Santa Barbara for supplies and provisions. Vail & Vickers' power boat <em>Tortuga</em> operated around Santa Rosa Island in the early 1910s, hauling supplies and mail for various camps on the island. Little else is known of it or of <em>Colleen</em>, another small vessel on the island. Vail & Vickers purchased the 64.5 feet long motor launch Onward for $7,737 in 1921 to perform errands around the island and channel in the 1920s and 30s. C.W. Smith, ranch foreman, used her for various tasks, including retrieving lumber from a wreck that came in handy for building corrals. Smith reportedly took <em>Onward</em> to Santa Barbara after the 1925 earthquake to check on damage there. The Vails kept her on a mooring at Bechers Bay. Vail & Vickers sold <em>Onward</em> in August 1942 to the DeLuxe Water Taxi Company, hoping to stave off the potential military seizure of the main island boat <em>Vaquero</em>, reasoning that the government would not take their only vessel; the attempt failed.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Vaquero</em>, 1913-1943</b><br /> To bring consistency and reliability to the island cattle transportation challenges, Vail & Vickers commissioned a new cattle boat in 1913 and christened her <em>Vaquero</em>. She was not the first <em>Vaquero</em> to operate in southern California waters. Harris Newmark recalled that a steamer <em>Vaquero</em> offered excursions from San Pedro to Santa Catalina in August of 1871. Vail & Vickers registered <em>Vaquero</em> in 1914.<br /> <br /> William Muller built <em>Vaquero</em> as a sturdy workhorse of a ship. She measured 121 feet and was \"beamy,\" or wide, in order to handle the cattle cargo and of a shallow draft to allow navigation close to shore.<br /> <br /> Rigged with two masts, she had six staterooms to sleep 18, a galley and dining room, and two toilets in the single deckhouse. Three generators supplied electricity for lights, an icebox, and a 25-watt radiophone. Two fuel tanks held 2,000 gallons each, and two water tanks stored a total of 1,800 gallons. She was originally powered by a gasoline engine, which was replaced in 1928 with a Western Enterprise six-cylinder diesel.<br /> <br /> The holds, divided into five cattle pens, had a capacity of about 10,000 cubic feet, or 200 head of cattle, which constituted seven carloads (rail cars) on the mainland. The deck, equipped with 3.5-foot gunnels topped with two-by-sixes to hold the cattle in, was divided into ten pens. A ramp would be deployed to load and unload the cattle to and from the deck and hold.<br /> <br /> The Vails docked <em>Vaquero</em> at San Pedro for many years, loading and unloading cattle at nearby Wilmington. The 115-mile trip to the island from Wilmington took at least twelve hours, and in the worst weather up to 23 hours, providing somewhat of an adventure when the Vail family came out to the island many times during the year. Margaret Vail Woolley recalled the family's first trip to the island on the Vaquero around 1928:<br /> <br /> \"My mother decided to trick us out in little yachtsman's uniforms. So she did-little white pants, little hats. We were so cute . . . and cold and filthy but over we went and slept. There were cabins on the Vaquero then . . . we could get our whole family in the rear cabin by doubling up considerably.\"<br /> <br /> On a typical weekend trip to Santa Rosa Island, the family would board Vaquero after school on Friday and sleep aboard in the staterooms during the overnight trip. A cook made hot meals in the cozy galley, a popular spot to stay warm during winter voyages. After spending Saturday and Sunday on the island, the family departed Sunday night, arriving in time for Monday morning school. During the 1930s, Russ Vail recalled, \"the vessel was used a little more easily in those days,\" with cheaper fuel and labor costs, so the Vail family traveled to and from the island on the boat regularly.<br /> <br /> V<em>aquero</em> not only shipped the supplies and cattle for Santa Rosa Island, but also contracted with the other islands' operators. In 1937 Vaquero transported much of Edwin Stanton's new sheep to Santa Cruz Island and regularly transported Robert Brooks' sheep to and from San Miguel Island and Ed Vail's sheep to and from San Nicolas Island. The Vails hired out <em>Vaquero</em> for other purposes in the off-season, including hauling supplies to southern California ports, as a fishing barge off Santa Monica, for wreck salvage, and, at one point in the 1930s, acting as a mother ship for a whaling operation. Vaquero captain Claude Morris recalled some of the memorable off-season voyages:<br /> <br /> \"The Hollywood studios used the boat for many movies. One early one was \"Laurel and Hardy Go to Sea.\" Other trips were hauling turtles from Turtle Bay in Mexico, tuna from San Diego, beans from Port Hueneme . . . . Catalina Island had an over population of rattlesnakes, so we hauled a group of young wild pigs to Catalina from Santa Rosa Island. Deer . . . were taken to Santa Rosa for sport hunting.\"<br /> <br /> At least once Vail & Vickers delivered cattle to San Francisco, according to Morris, and made a short run to Gaviota across the channel: \"There was no dock in Gaviota, so the cattle were just pushed overboard and herded ashore with skiffs, as the cattle would often swim out to sea.\"<br /> <br /> The United States' entry into World War II caused a chain of events that would alter the sea transport of Vail & Vickers cattle for many years to come. In December 1942 Vail received a letter from Commander G. W. D. Dashiell, the port director at San Pedro's Naval Transportation Service, informing him that the US Army would requisition <em>Vaquero</em> for wartime service. Vail had reportedly sold their smaller boat Onward in an attempt to circumvent taking of the Vaquero. The tactic didn't work, so Vail renewed the ships papers on January 1, 1943 and Vail delivered the boat to the Army at San Pedro on January 14th, ending thirty years' service by the sturdy and unique cattle boat of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> <em>Vaquero</em> then traveled across the Pacific Ocean under its own power. She was spotted off Biak Island in New Guinea, painted green, but its fate after 1944 is unknown. However, one researcher traced the boat up to 1954 when it was still in use by the Army.<br /> <br /> The Navy was aware of the need for beef in the war effort and, being sympathetic to the Vails' predicament, made available landing barges to ship Santa Rosa Island cattle. The Navy used the event as an exercise, using three LCTs (landing craft) and transporting 3,000 head of cattle to the beach at Ventura. Of the landing methods, Al Vail explained simply, \"Well, you drop the ramp and kick 'em off . . . most of 'em didn't even have to go through the water.\"<br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the Vails, by the fall of 1943 the landing craft were needed elsewhere. Ed Vail hired Edwin Stanton's island schooner Santa Cruz to restock the island that fall, but found that the Santa Cruz was \"totally inadequate for that size job.\" Vail & Vickers turned to the only answer they could at the time- hiring barges and tugs to make the cattle movements.<br /> <br /> For almost fifteen years following the war, the Vails used rented barges and tugs to move cattle to the mainland. At one point they bought and converted a landing craft for the job, but it sank off west Santa Cruz Island in rough weather. The barges were equipped with pens and loaded from the Bechers Bay pier using cattle chutes, as they had on the Vaquero. Occasionally, to unload calves that typically balked at entering the chute on the pier, the cowboys built a ramp of sand to the beached barge and drove the livestock ashore or drove them ashore simply by opening the pens and shooing the calves out into the shallow water.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Vaquero II</em>, 1959-1999</b><br /> After more than 15 years hauling island cattle by barge and tug, and no doubt tired of the inconvenient and costly method of transport, Vail & Vickers contracted with Lindwall Boat Works in Santa Barbara to construct a 64'6\" wooden cattle boat. Six open cattle pens constituted the bulk of the boat's square footage, with a capacity of about 100 head of adult cattle or 210 calves. The boat would be half the size of the original Vaquero and hold half the number of livestock as cargo, but would be faster and more efficient both in operation and crew requirements (it required only a skipper and a deckhand). In February 1959, the boat was delivered to Santa Barbara Harbor for launch and the Vails christened the boat Vaquero II.<br /> <br /> <em>Vaquero II </em>became a landmark at Santa Barbara Harbor. Operation between Port Hueneme and Santa Rosa Island for cattle shipments took about five hours. It made regular runs to the island (about every ten days) with food and supplies from its homeport at Santa Barbara Harbor, a trip of about three hours. Considered to be the last operating wooden cattle boat on the Pacific Coast, it handled the island cattle shipments with few breakdowns and enjoyed a reputation for seaworthiness.<br /> <br /> The Vails also used <em>Vaquero II</em> to haul Stanton Ranch cattle and sheep from Santa Cruz Island after their venerable schooner Santa Cruz wrecked off anchor in a storm in 1960. <em>Vaquero II</em> hauled Santa Cruz Island livestock for 26 years, including the final shipment of cattle after Carey Stanton's death in 1987. The Gherini family of east Santa Cruz Island also employed Vaquero II for their sheep shipments after their boat Hodge wrecked in 1976. <em>Vaquero II</em> held up to 600 sheep.<br /> <br /> Los Angeles Herald-Examiner columnist Cholly Angeleno wrote of the challenges an uninitiated passenger might have faced on what must have been <em>Vaquero II</em> in the early days:<br /> <br /> \"I remember when one of the Vails'] cattle ships stopped over at Catalina, with Ed Vail skippering the vessel. He promptly invited Hook Beardslee and me to take \"the cruise\" to Santa Rosa to pick up some cattle. But when we got aboard ship we promptly declined the offer. The farmyard aroma was stifling!\"<br /> <br /> With the end of ranching in 1998, Vail & Vickers donated Vaquero II in 1999 to a nonprofit organization and it was converted for other uses.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\"> <strong>Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",
            "audioDescription": "You have stepped off the boat, onto the lower landing platform of the dock at the east end of a very long pier, that runs east to west. You are standing on metal decking with sturdy railings. The decking runs along two sides of the larger platform above you. Supporting the entire structure are metal beams and thick round posts that look like telephone poles, which extend down into the ocean below. Around the waterline and below, barnacles and mussels cling, in dense clusters, to those posts. The ocean waters extend out in every direction.<br /><br />A tall metal staircase with twelve risers leads up to the platform above. The upper dock platform is about 100 feet by 70 feet. Five-foot high wooden railings run along the perimeter of the pier and dock platform and pier. Below the dock railing, at each corner, is a light beacon, under a clear bell-shaped cap. <br /><br />If you are standing at the top of the risers on the platform, to your left, attached to top of a post are two large outdoor lights. Just past the lights, mounted to the railing, is a heavy plastic yellow container that is rectangular with a rounded top. The lettering on it reads,<br /><br />Life Ring.<br /><br />Straight ahead, on the opposite side of the dock, is a park orientation panel, mounted to the railing. <br /><br />To the right of that panel, and running parallel to the railing, are two low wooden risers with yellow stripes painted on the sides. Matching yellow L-shapes are painted on the pier about 10 feet away from the risers' corners, seemingly outlining a rectangular area on the dock.<br /><br />The ocean end of the dock extends out farther on the left side, by about 20 feet. Near the middle of that side of the dock is a metal cabinet, covered with green canvas. Three shapes stick up on the top, also covered in canvas. Nearby is a large yellow plastic barrel with square shapes that curve out on the sides. <br /><br />In the far right corner of the ocean end of the dock is an upright metal cylinder, about five-feet wide by eight-feet tall. At the top of the cylinder is a giant metal hinge that supports a long steel \"arm,\" ending with two thick parallel metal plates, just a few inches apart, creating a slot, like that between prongs of tongs or a clamp. The plates hang down lower than the arm about one foot. On top of the arm are three thin metal bands, each curved into an upright loop that is connected to the sides of the arm. Lettering on the side of the steel \"arm\" reads,<br /><br />Hydro Pro.<br /><br />The wooden plank pier, that connects the dock to the island, is 650 feet long and 20 feet wide. At the land end of the pier, on either side, is a steep sandy-colored rocky ridge with eroded gullies and a sandy beach below. The cliff surface varies from top to bottom. Embedded in the top area are random clumps of cobble-sized stones. On the lower part of the cliff are layers of horizontal ridges, like the wavy edge of a stack of pancakes.<br /><br />On the south side, 18 wooden steps with railings lead downward. At the bottom step, there is a ladder, that you can climb down to reach the sandy beach. <br /><br />On the north side is an information panel. <br /><br />At the end of the pier, a dirt road continues upward, cutting through the cliff to the top of the plateau.<br />",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(May - October)</i></p> <p>Ricksecker Point is a promontory ridge between Rampart Ridge and the Tatoosh Range. The Nisqually River valley lies to the northwest of the ridge and the Paradise River valley is to the southeast. A one-way scenic loop drive traces the edge of Ricksecker Point. The third of a mile-long road has two main pullouts featuring views of Mount Rainier, the Nisqually and Paradise river valleys, and the Tatoosh Range. Both pullouts have wayside exhibit panels about the glaciers and lava flows that have shaped the geology of the mountain. Ricksecker Point is accessible by vehicle during the summer only. The road closes during the winter, typically from early November through mid-May.<br /> <br /> Ricksecker Point is a contributing component to the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District. Ricksecker Point is named for Eugene Ricksecker, an Army Corps of Engineers supervisor who surveyed the route to Paradise in 1904. The survey team originally named the feature “Gap Point”, but it was renamed after a road was constructed in 1909. Part of the original road to Paradise, the section around Ricksecker Point was considered one of the most dangerous stretches. It was narrow, bordered by steep cliffs, and prone to rockfall. Over the years the road was widened, resurfaced, and parking was included at viewpoints. A detour constructed in 1930 replaced the original route and became the main Paradise Road, while Ricksecker Point Road was left as a scenic bypass. In addition to providing excellent views, Ricksecker Point is an example of rustic style architecture that sought to blend with the natural environment. The road follows the curve of the ridge and guardwalls along the road use roughly cut, native stone. The stone guardwalls were constructed during the 1930s in part by the Civilian Conservation Corps.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Ricksecker Point is located at a promontory and forested ridge which projects between Rampart Ridgeand the Tatoosh Range. Nisqually River valley lies to the northwest of the ridge, and the Paradise River valley is to the southeast. The elevation of Ricksecker Point is 4200 feet. The topography of the road around Ricksecker Point maintains a relatively level 1% grade around the promontory. The road is generally 24 feet-wide, though the road widens in several places to form vehicular pullouts. Two pullouts are located along the first segment of the road, and one is located along the middle segment of the road between the two parking areas. The road and pullouts are bordered by a guardwall. The guardwall is 1 1/2 feet-wide, and 1 1/2 feet-high. The top of the guardwall is crenellated, with crenellations located at approximately every 18 feet. Ricksecker Point is organized as a series of overlooks to the outer edge of a road, which hugs the side of a steep promontory ridge. The road is one-third of a mile in length and follows a southwest orientation for about a quarter of its length away from the Road to Paradise; then turns and heads southeast for half its total length; then turns and heads north, to return to the Road to Paradise. The first, southwest trending segment of the road has two pullouts at the outer side of the road. This curvilinear segment is the most proximate to views of the Nisqually River Valley. The road turns to head southeast at a parking area known as the Nisqually Valley overlook parking area. This is the location of the earliest parking area and offers the most panoramic views at Ricksecker Point. The road then becomes less curvilinear and follows the orientation of the Paradise River valley. A very steep uphill slope bounds the road to the inside edge, and the stone guardwall and a steep downhill slope to the outer edge. This segment of the road offers magnificent views of the Tatoosh Range. One small pullout exists to the inner side at approximately half-way along this segment of the road. The road turns and heads north at another parking area, from where the Paradise River valley can be viewed. From here the road follows a relatively level road cut through silver fir and pines, to return to the Road to Paradise.",

A small double third-floor window is set into the gable of the wide pitched roof. A central chimney sticks up from the peak. It’s just one step up from the street to the sidewalk here, and there is a curb cut at the corner of Downey Street, just to the left of the building. End of message.",

During the winter, the White River Road is open to snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. </p> <p>The White River Road leads from State Route 410 toward the White River Campground and high-country trailheads. The <strong>White River Wilderness Information Station</strong> (WIC) is located just inside the White River Entrance. Stop for a climbing or wilderness camping permit, or information. Restroom facilities are located next to the WIC.<br /> <br /> As you follow the road to the west trails lead hikers to subalpine wilderness or to the moraine of the Emmons Glacier, the largest American glacier outside of Alaska. From the junction of the White River Campground, continue on toward Sunrise. Along the way look for outcrops of columnar lava, hillsides of wildflowers, and breathtaking vistas at Sunrise Point. </p> <p><br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – White River</b><br /> The road from White River up to Sunrise is a journey through the geologic history of Mount Rainier. The road carves through the slopes of a lava ridge that was shaped by ancient glaciers, leading to impressive views of not only Mount Rainier but also the surrounding region. Volcanoes and glaciers have dramatically shaped the landscape. As you travel up the mountain to Sunrise, discover geologic evidence left behind by these two forces that have molded Mount Rainier and still do so today. <br /> <br /> While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely. The Sunrise Road is steep and winding. Watch out for bicyclists and other drivers on the road, as well as wildlife. </p>",

On the north edge of the parking lot, between the paths is a bulletin board structure with information on the Sunrise and White River area and general information about the park. To the left of the bulletin board is a path to the women’s restroom and to the right a path to the men’s restroom.",

You can experience them all at this overlook that combines everything the Natchez Trace Parkway is about. <br /> <br /> Folks interested in nature and recreation can fish in the pond, watch turtles pile up and warm their shells in the sun, or imagine back more than 11,000 years ago and picture mastodons ambling to the creek.<br /> <br /> Walkers can stretch their legs on a short jaunt into the woods or down to Town Creek. Hikers can access the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail and walk a little more than 2 miles south to the Chickasaw Village Site, or head northward for little less than two miles to the Beech Springs Trailhead. <br /> <br /> Over time, people have used this area in many ways. The human history of Old Town started with American Indians who settled here. The name Old Town was what the English called a large established Chickasaw village. <br /> <br /> Old Town was not always a peaceful bottomland. The 1914 DAR marker indicates that the Battle of Ackia took place near here, which is debatable, but we know that during the Civil War's Battle of Tupelo, on July 15, 1864, an intense battle was fought in the bottoms at the creek. <br /> <br /> Standing on the north side of the overlook, there are views of both natural and cultivated land protected by the Natchez Trace Parkway. The agricultural land is leased and planted with traditional crops to help conserve the rural beauty of the Parkway. ",
            "audioDescription": "The overlook road branches in two directions. From one side, the bottomland of Town Creek and part of the Belt Belt prairie can be seen from this overlook, along with agricultural land and the Parkway road. A trail passes by the site and a DAR marker from 1914 is prominent next to the interpretive sign. On the other branch of the road, there is a picnic table, and a pond situated between the overlook and the Parkway.",

It took place near or possibly within the area which now makes up the monument. The incident initiated Spanish control of Florida for 235 years and led to the naming of the Matanzas River.<br /> <br /> When King Philip II of Spain learned that the Frenchman Rene de LaudonniÃ©re had established Fort Caroline, Florida he was incensed -- the colony sat on land belonging to the Spanish crown. Spanish treasure fleets sailed along the Florida coast on their way to Spain and Fort Caroline provided a perfect base for French attacks. Worst of all to the devoutly Catholic Philip, the settlers were Huguenots (French Protestants). Despite Philip's protests, Jean Ribault sailed from France in May 1565 with more than 600 soldiers and settlers to resupply Fort Caroline.<br /> <br /> General Pedro MenÃ©ndez de Aviles, charged with removing the French, also sailed in May, arriving at the Saint Johns River in August with some 800 people, shortly after Ribault. After a brief sea chase, the Spanish retired south to a site they had earlier reconnoitered, a Timucuan village called Seloy. The Spanish came ashore on September 8 and established and named their new village \"St. Augustine\" because land had first been sighted on the Feast Day of St. Augustine, August 28.<br /> <br /> Jean Ribault sailed on September 10 to attack and wipe out the Spanish at St. Augustine, but a hurricane carried his ships far to the south, wrecking them on the Florida coast between present-day Daytona Beach and Cape Canaveral (4 on map).<br /> <br /> At the same time, MenÃ©ndez led a force to attack Fort Caroline. Since most of the soldiers were absent, MenÃ©ndez was easily able to capture the French settlement, killing most of the men in the battle. Some of the inhabitants, including de LaudonniÃ©re and the artist Jacques LeMoyne, were able to escape to ships and return to France. MenÃ©ndez spared the women and children and sent them by ship to Havana.<br /> He then learned from Timucuan Indians that a group of white men were on the beach a few miles south of St. Augustine. He marched with 70 soldiers to where an inlet had blocked 127 of the shipwrecked Frenchmen trying to get back to Fort Caroline (5 on map).<br /> With a captured Frenchman as translator, MenÃ©ndez described how Fort Caroline had been captured and urged the French to surrender. Rumors to the contrary, he made no promises as to sparing them. Having lost most of their food and weapons in the shipwreck, they did surrender. However, when MenÃ©ndez then demanded that they give up their Protestant faith and accept Catholicism, they refused. 111 Frenchmen were killed. Only sixteen were spared - a few who professed being Catholic, some impressed Breton sailors, and four artisans needed at St. Augustine.<br /> Two weeks later the sequence of events was repeated. More French survivors appeared at the inlet, including Jean Ribault. On October 12 Ribault and his men surrendered and met their fate, again refusing to give up their faith. This time 134 were killed. From that time, the inlet was called Matanzas -- meaning \"slaughters\" in Spanish.<br /> Was this a cruel, cold-hearted act by the Spanish? Was Pedro MenÃ©ndez blindly following orders to rid Florida of the interlopers? Was it a religious conflict? What would the French have done to the Spanish if the hurricane had not wrecked their ships? Maybe there is even more involved. With food already low and no chance for resupply until spring, would there have been food and shelter for all if the French had been brought back to the new village of St. Augustine? Perhaps, as leader of his people, MenÃ©ndez knew that survival of the French in October might have meant the starvation of everyone by May.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Year-Round</b><br /> The National Park Inn and General Store operate year-round. The Longmire Wilderness Information Center is open during the summer season.<br /> <br /> Longmire is located in the southwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park and is 6.5 miles (10.5 km) east of the Nisqually Entrance. Volcanic mineral springs create a rare low elevation meadow surrounded by forest, tucked in a valley between lava ridges. Stumbling across the meadow in the late 1800s, the area around the meadow became James Longmire's homestead. The Longmire family later developed lodging and a mineral springs resort. With the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, the Longmire area became the park headquarters. Although park headquarters are no longer at Longmire (current park administration offices are located at Tahoma Woods outside of the park along SR 706), the original 1916 headquarters building houses a museum that tells the story of the early days of the park. Across the street from the museum, the \"newer\" Longmire Administration Building, completed in 1930, still holds offices for park staff and is home to the <strong>Longmire Wilderness Information Center</strong>. Visitors can stay overnight or get a hot meal in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/national-park-inn.htm\">National Park Inn</a> and general store, which was once park of the Longmire's mineral springs resort. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/longmire.htm\">Longmire</a>.</p> <h4><strong>Hiking</strong></h4> <p>Open year-round, Longmire still serves as a gateway to exploring Mount Rainier. The easy <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/day-hiking-at-mount-rainier.htm\">Trail of the Shadows</a> (0.7 miles) loops around the Longmire Meadow, popular with birds, deer, and other wildlife. Along the trail view bubbling mineral springs and learn about the Longmire family and early park settlers. The Trail of the Shadows is located across the main road from the National Park Inn. The portion of the loop trail closest to the road is dirt and gravel and suitable for wheelchair users with help, including a short spur trail into the meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. The far side of the loop trail is broken by tree roots and and includes a short section of boardwalk. <br /> <br /> Explore Longmire's developed area by following the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/longmire-historic-district-walking-tour.htm\">Longmire Historic District Walking Tour</a>, viewing examples of National Park Service Rustic Architecture, including the picturesque Longmire Administration Building.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/eagle-peak.htm\">Eagle Peak Trail</a> (7 miles roundtrip) is a steep climb through old-growth forest with great views of Mount Rainier, Nisqually Glacier, and the Tatoosh Range. The Eagle Peak trailhead is found across the suspension bridge from Longmire on the east side of Nisqually River. <br /> <br /> Branching off from the Trail of the Shadows, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/rampart-ridge-trail.htm\">Rampart Ridge Trail</a> (4.6 miles roundtrip) climbs up through a forested slope to the top of Rampart Ridge. A viewpoint along the trail looks back down on the Longmire area and the Nisqually River. Follow the ridge to connect to the Wonderland Trail and loop back down to Longmire. <br /> <br /> Longmire is one of the main starting/ending locations for the <strong>Wonderland Trail</strong>, or a waypoint where backpackers can pick up supplies. Day hikers can also use the Wonderland Trail to hike northeast from Longmire to Cougar Rock Campground or northwest towards Rampart Ridge Trail. Continue past the Rampart Ridge junction to connect to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/indian-henrys-hunting-ground.htm\">Indian Henry's Hunting Ground</a>. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The main park road transects the Longmire Area, with the Longmire Meadow and Trail of the Shadows on the left and the developed area on the right. The National Park Inn, a two-story wood building with a wrap around porch, faces the road. A network of paved trails leads to the front of the Inn. Parking is located behind the inn. Next to the inn is a small pull off road that provides access to a historic old-fashioned gas station, now converted into an exhibit, and the public restroom building. Past the inn, turn right to enter the main Longmire area. To the left of the road is the Longmire Administration Building, a large two-story wood and stone building with a small lawn in front and framed by tall trees. Across the road from the Administration building are several smaller wood buildings, housing the Longmire Museum and library. Straight ahead the road continues into the staff housing area, a cluster of small wood buildings, with long wood warehouses clustered around the maintenance area. Continue through the housing and maintenance area to reach the wood Longmire Suspension Bridge, which crosses over the Nisqually River. Continue to follow the road on the other side of the river to reach the Longmire Community Building and the Longmire Volunteer Campground.",

            "bodyText": "<p>County Road 94, better known as Loop Road, is a welcome respite from the traffic of the Tamiami Trail and a chance to discover the real Big Cypress National Preserve.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Pinecrest community was primarily a logging town with approximately 200 residents at its peak. It had a saw mill, a public school, general store and filling station, mess shack and bunk house, but little else.<br /> <br /> If you start driving Loop Road from the Miami (east) side, you will drive past a campground named Pinecrest. The name is one of the few things related to the failed town you will still see today along with a few other reminders such as the tiny gas station on the side of the road.</p> <p>Throughout the 24-mile drive, take your time. nEjoy the views of sawgrass prairies, hardwood hammocks, and cypress swamp. Watch for alligators, great blue herons, turtles, and other wildlife who call this place home.<br /> <br /> You can fish, photograph, and wet hike through the swamp-- just make sure you can find your way back.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "From Highway 41, also called the Tamiami Trail, there are two access points. Closer to Naples a large sign identifies the turn for \"Monroe Station\" and the Loop Road. From the Miami side watch for a sign identifying Loop Road. Two thirds of the drive is dirt with little to no shoulder. There are some places wide enough to pull over and get out to look around. The speed limit is usually 25-35 miles per hour. Share the road and always let wildlife have the right of way.",

All that remains is the church, the 15th New Jersey Monument, the 23rd New Jersey Monument, and one acre of ground.<br /> <br /> In April of 1863, Union General Joseph Hooker planned to cross the Rappahannock upriver from Fredericksburg and get behind Lee, while another Union force under General John Sedgwick remained in front of the town. Lee would either be crushed between the two forces, Hooker hoped, or he would be forced to retreat southward. On May 3rd, while a big battle was raging around the Chancellorsville Inn ten miles west of town, Sedgwick drove across the Rappahannock, captured the Sunken Road and Marye's Heights, and advanced westward to join Hooker, moving on what is now Route 3. On a low ridge line running at right angles to the road, crowned by Salem Church, a small force of Confederates determined to make a stand. It was an excellent position that commanded the approaches from the east; directly in front of them was a tangle of bushes and undergrowth.<br /> <br /> Sharpshooters were posted in the upper gallery of the church on the north side. When the Federals began their assaults, they were met by volleys of fire. The underbrush made the going difficult, but suddenly the Federals were on the crest of the ridge, only a few yards from the church, and advancing determinedly. At this moment Confederates posted in the road cut just behind sprang up and counterattacked fiercely, driving the enemy back down the slope and onto the plain below. One Federal soldier remembered the opening of the battle this way:<br /> <br /> \"A tremendous roar of musketry met us from the unseen enemy, one hundred feet away, posted behind a fence and a ditch. Men tumbled from our ranks dead, and others fell helpless with wounds.\"<br /> <br /> Federal soldiers aimed at the upper windows where the sharpshooters were; the pockmarks from their bullets are still visible. Other bullets ripped through the galleries. Inside, Confederate soldiers climbed over the tumble of furniture, which by this time must have been no better than fancy kindling. The next day Sedgwick was driven back across the river and the campaign was over.</p>",

The wreck now lies in the eastern part of Biscayne National Park and is one of the best shallow dive spots in the park.</p> <p>John G. Alden Naval Architects, Inc. designed <em>Mandalay</em>, originally named <em>Hardi Biou</em>, for Dr. Henry D. Lloyd of Brookline, Massachusetts. The 110’ 6” long, steel hulled schooner was built by George Lawley & Son, Corporation in 1928, at a cost of $177,000. The schooner was sold in 1931 and renamed <em>Valor</em>, and subsequently had 5 other owners under that name. Michael Burke, owner of Windjammer Cruises, Inc., purchased, refitted, and renamed the vessel <em>Mandalay</em> in 1965, for use as a luxury cruise ship.</p> <p><em>Mandalay</em> was beautifully outfitted in mahogany, brass, and ivory, and had a teak deck. Aft quarters were a suite of 2 rooms with an adjoining bath for the owner, 3 single staterooms, each with a bath, and a large guest room with an individual bath. Forward of the main mast were a large saloon and living room, 3 officer’s staterooms with a bath, and ample forecastle for 6 men with a washroom and shower. All bathrooms had hot and cold water and all waste connected to a complete sanitary system. There were electrical lights and fans and other electrical equipment, and every stateroom had individual ventilation.</p> <p>In late 1965, <em>Mandalay</em> was headed toward Miami with 23 vacationers and 12 crew, returning from a 10 day Bahamian cruise. Passengers had retired to their rooms after celebrating the arrival of the New Year, 1966. Captain Asmund [Jim] Gjevick, a 26 year old Norwegian, went to sleep about 1:00 AM, leaving a novice seaman at the helm. All were awakened when <em>Mandalay</em> was driven hard aground on Long Reef. Later, Captain Gjevick admitted he had miscalculated the distance from Fowey Rocks, causing <em>Mandalay</em> to be 20 miles off course. At the request of Capt. Gjevick, an SOS was sent by A.E. Lundquist, President of the Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Boston at 3:45 AM, which brought Coast Guard helicopters and patrol boats to the scene. Flares were dropped by the helicopters, and fired by <em>Mandalay</em> crew to illuminate the rescue operation that took place in windy conditions with 10 foot waves. Three helicopters lifted 24 persons, one by one, and flew them to Homestead Air Force Base. The only injury was to L. Quinn Hal, an Indianapolis real estate man, who cut his hand.</p> <p>Scavengers stripped the vessel, taking the ship’s compass, sextant, chronometers, passenger cameras, watches, and purses, and the owner’s personal gear. Tons of lead ballast blocks, taken by small outboard motorboats and melted into lead diving weights, were resold at $1.00 per pound. The ½ ton anchor and stud link chain were also taken. On the Sunday after <em>Mandalay</em> was grounded she was “picked to her skin and bones” by average work-a-day boat owners, before salvage tugs could arrive. The tugs failed to pull the ship off the reef, and so the masts were removed, by contract with the owners, for eventual use in the re-creation of a Spanish Galleon called <em>Golden Doubloon</em>. Today the skeleton of <em>Mandalay</em>, “red carpet ship of the Windjammer fleet”, can be found embedded on Long Reef in Biscayne National Park.</p>",

However, for nearly 1,000 slaves during the War of 1812, it was a fortress of salvation, and the place where they took their first free steps. Fort Albion, named after the ancient name for England and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/george-cockburn.htm\">Commodore George Cockburn</a>’s flagship, was constructed there in 1814 to serve two major functions: as a central base to sustain continued British attacks along the Chesapeake, and as a depot for receiving runaway American slaves into citizenship and service to His Majesty, King George III of England.</p> <p>Using America’s slaves against it was not a novel idea – the British successfully employed this war tactic during the Revolutionary War. However, in the War of 1812, American slaves were considered free British citizens as soon as they set foot on British soil (which included forts and vessels), as slavery was illegal in all British territories. The new recruits remained neither American nor enslaved in the eyes of the British. Some slaves stole boats or canoes and met British troops directly; others started fires to get the attention of British soldiers for rescue. In some cases, these slaves took up arms as part of an active offense, while in others they simply took the opportunity presented by the British to escape bondage.</p> <p>As early as 1813, British army and navy officers were instructed to “provide shelter, protection, and evacuation to refugees.” <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alexander-cochrane.htm\">Admiral Alexander Cochrane</a> formalized the policy in April 1814, with a <a href=\"http://www.novascotia.ca/nsarm/virtual/africanns/archives.asp?ID=70\">proclamation</a> offering the “choice of either entering into His Majesty’s Sea or Land Forces, or of being sent as FREE Settlers to the British Possessions in North America or the West Indies.”</p> <p>With an anticipated influx of new recruits, the Royal Navy needed a new base. Tangier Island provided an easy access point in the Chesapeake to the Upper and Lower Bays, as well as the Potomac, Washington and Baltimore, while being surrounded by slaves in the plantation country of Virginia and Maryland. Fort Albion included a barracks, a hospital, a church, family dwellings and gardens, meant to accommodate not just prospective soldiers, but the families they brought with them as well. From its earliest inception, Fort Albion was conceived not just as a place for military training, but a place which would be a temporary home for newly freed Britons.</p> <p>Tangier Island was not employed long; the War of 1812 ended less than a year after Fort Albion was built, on February 17, 1815. As the British withdrew, Cockburn ordered that “on no account [is] a Single Negro [to] be left, except by his own request,” fully embracing the status of the former slaves – whether in service or not – as free subjects of the British Empire. On March 21, 1815, the evacuation of the British from the island was completed, and Fort Albion and its barracks were burned. Former slaves were sent as soldiers and citizens to settle British colonies in the Caribbean and Canada.</p> <p>Between the fort’s intentional destruction and subsequent unintentional destruction by storms and floods common in the Chesapeake, nothing remains of Fort Albion today. Much of Tangier Island where it stood has eroded, leaving a sandy beach reminiscent of those that slaves saw as they set foot on the island, in search of freedom.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Melrose is often called “one of the great houses of the American South.” The design of the mansion is based on the Greek Revival style. It was popular in America in the years before the Civil War. The tall ceilings, deep porches, and large windows and doors of this style worked well in the hot, humid Southern climate. The 16,000-square-foot house features some of the finest brickwork in the nation. The four Doric columns out front are made of brick but covered with stucco and painted to resemble stone. The porch wall behind them received the same treatment. Similarly, the large front cypress doors are painted to look like oak. Skilled laborers and trained carpenters – many of whom were probably enslaved - used locally milled cypress to construct the mansion. Giant cypress trees were logged out of the Louisiana swamps. They provided wood that was easy to cut but resistant to termites and rot.<br />  <br /> John McMurran moved to Natchez in the 1820s, not long after Mississippi became a state. In 1831, he married Mary Louisa Turner, who was the daughter of a local judge. In 1833, her parents gave them a 645-acre plantation and 24 enslaved people. McMurran grew up in Pennsylvania where slavery had been outlawed in 1780. He moved to the slave world of the Deep South. There, the practice of slavery allowed him to build great wealth.</p>",

Suggestions for the memorial began in 1943, but it wasn't until 1949, when the Territory of Hawaii established the Pacific War Memorial Commission, that the first real steps were taken to bring it about.<br /> <br /> Initial recognition came in 1950 when Admiral Arthur Radford, Commander in Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC), ordered that a flagpole be erected over the sunken battleship. On the ninth anniversary of the attack, a commemorative plaque was placed at the base of the flagpole.<br /> <br /> President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who helped achieve Allied victory in Europe during World War II, approved the creation of the Memorial in 1958. Its construction was completed in 1961 with public funds appropriated by Congress and private donations. The Memorial was dedicated in 1962.<br /> <br /> According to its architect, Alfred Preis, the design of the Memorial, \"Wherein the structure sags in the center but stands strong and vigorous at the ends, expresses initial defeat and ultimate victory....The overall effect is one of serenity. Overtones of sadness have been omitted to permit the individual to contemplate his own personal responses... his innermost feelings.\"<br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, the USS <em>Arizona </em>is no longer in commission. As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship. The USS <em>Arizona </em>Memorial has come to commemorate all military personnel killed in the Pearl Harbor attack.",

Building the bridge over Hoover Creek seems to have been almost simple. The council approved the proposed bridge at a meeting on June 4, 1877. They instructed the street commissioner, Thomas Reeves (also the town marshal) to handle the project with a budget of $75.</p> <p>At the very next meeting, July 17, the Reeves reported on the completed project and what it had cost— $62.94. Fifteen dollars of this amount were credit given to men who worked on the project instead of paying their local taxes in cash. The only itemized expense associated with the bridge was $12.73 paid to Charles Leech for lumber and posts.</p> <p>The finished bridge was 22 feet long, resting on cedar piles driven deep into the creek mud. A basic pony truss along the sides of the bridge deck helped support the structure. <br /> <br /> In 1917 he town rebuilt the bridge, twice constructed out of wood, with a steel beam and concrete span. The National Park Service built a replacement bridge in 2021, part of the reconstruction of Hoover Creek to reduce flooding. The newest bridge attempts to recreate the original appearance and concrete railing of the 1917 bridge. Cedar pilings recovered from the creek during construction may have been the footings for the 1877 bridge.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge 211 words Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge. 1 ½ minutes. The Hoover Creek meanders east-west through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The creek is just a few feet wide, with shrubs and a few trees along its banks. At Downey Street, the creek flows beneath the South Downey Street Bridge. Downey Street is a gravel road about 12 feet wide with a wooden boardwalk on either side. Elsewhere, there’s a strip of grass separating the boardwalks from the roadway, but at the bridge, the boardwalks come right up alongside the road. Boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. The bridge is about 25 feet long, bordered on each side by a four-foot-high wooden post-and-rail fence. It’s about ten feet down from the bridge to the creek below. From the east side of the bridge, the view is toward Parkside Drive, which runs north-south alongside the park. The Friends Meetinghouse is about 60 feet away, at 2:00 on the clock face. The visitor center is about 200 feet away, at 10:00. If you’re facing west from the bridge, the Presidential Library and Museum is at 11:00 and about 200 feet away. The Birth Cottage is at 2:00, about 60 feet from the bridge. End of message.",

While continuing the ranching goal of preserving an undeveloped landscape, the NPS also began to focus on restoration and recovery from the unintended consequences of browsing and grazing by nonnative animals.<br /> <br /> What was once an island covered with coastal sage scrub, chaparral, oak scrub, oak woodland, and native grasslands, had given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including oats, bromes, foxtails, thistles, and mustard. Today vegetation mapping by the NPS shows that nearly 25 percent of the plant species found on Santa Rosa Island are nonnative, consisting of approximately 70 percent of the ground cover.<br /> <br /> Native plants that develop in isolation are often vulnerable to competition from nonnative species. Many of these nonnative plants have evolved with browsing and grazing pressure (browsers eat woody vegetation consisting of twigs and branches and grazers eat herbs and grasses). The native island plants have not coexisted with browsers and grazers since the pygmy mammoths, nearly 12,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> During the 1800s up to 80,000 sheep severely overgrazed the island, eliminating most of the native vegetation and creating open, disturbed, and eroded soils that allowed nonnative plants to flourish. Once established, these nonnatives out competed the natives for limited soil and moisture due to their longer germination and growth cycles and continued browsing and grazing by cattle, horses, deer, elk, and pigs. With the end of the ranching era cattle were removed in 1998, pigs in the early 1990s, and deer and elk in 2012.<br /> <br /> The restoration of the island's native vegetation is a primary goal of the NPS. Special focus is being placed on the 36 plants endemic to the islands, those occurring only on the Channel Islands and nowhere else in the world. Six of these occur only on Santa Rosa Island. Today, eight of these endemic plants are listed as endangered species. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, native plantings and nonnative weed control are currently underway.<br /> <br /> The recovery has been remarkable. Many native plants are now spreading beyond the buried seed banks and steep canyon walls and cliffs, where they remained protected from browsing and grazing for over 150 years, and are reestablishing themselves throughout the island. Like most of the island's drainages, this one where you are standing used to be almost completely devoid of vegetation except for nonnative grasses and weeds. Today, it's a thriving riparian habitat with willows, toyon, lemonade berry, lupine, buckwheat, and a variety of other native plants.<br /> <br /> You can actually help with this recovery by cleaning your boots and other possessions, such as backpacks, before you visit to make sure you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species to the island. Together we can ensure the return of native plant communities throughout Santa Rosa Island.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Plants Endemic Only to Santa Rosa Island</strong></p> <p>1.

Today, nearly 25 percent of the plant species found on eastern Santa Cruz Island are introduced, providing approximately 75 percent of the ground cover.<br /> <br /> Native plants that developed in isolation often are vulnerable to competition from introduced or alien species. Many of these alien plants have evolved with grazing pressure, whereas the native island plants have not co-existed with grazers or browsers on the islands since the pygmy mammoths, nearly 12,000 years ago. With sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs grazing and browsing on the native vegetation and disturbing the soil, the alien plants spread rapidly, competing with the natives for limited soil and moisture.

Nine of these endemic plants are listed as endangered species. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, the National Park Service, along with The Nature Conservancy, is working towards the removal of nonnative species. Over 9,000 sheep were removed from the eastern 6,200 acres of Santa Cruz Island between 1997 and 1999 (Sheep were eliminated by The Nature Conservancy from the rest of the island by the late 1980s.) Pigs were removed from the island by 2007 and weed control is currently underway.<br /> <br /> In 2011, work began here at Prisoner's Harbor to restore the largest coastal wetland on the Channel Islands. Island ranchers reduced this wetland habitat by more than 50 percent when they filled it with gravel, rerouted and channelized the creek, and planted eucalyptus and other nonnative trees and plants. Restoring the westland included excavating thousands of cubic yards of fill and reshaping the landscape to allow the wetland to flood naturally. In addition, nonnative trees and plants were removed and replaced with native vegetation. Learn more about this wetland restoration project on page 55 and by visiting the signs around the wetland area.<br /> <br /> One needs only to look at the recovery of vegetation, reduction of erosion, and the condition of archeological sites on San Miguel Island since the removal of sheep in the 1950s to envision what may eventually occur on all of Santa Cruz Island. Described as a \"barren lump of sand\" in the 1930s, San Miguel Island has undergone a remarkable recovery and now is densely vegetated with a diverse assemblage of native plants. In fifty years, we hope to write about the remarkable recovery and return of the native plants of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <b>Wetland Restoration</b><br /> Coastal wetlands in California are increasingly rare-over 90 percent have been eliminated. Prior to alterations in the late 1800s, the Prisoner's Harbor wetland was the largest wetland on the Channel Islands and provided a variety of habitats (open water, marsh, riparian, and woodland) for native plants and wildlife.<br /> <br /> Ranchers reduced this wetland habitat by more than 50 percent when they filled it with gravel, rerouted and channelized the creek, and planted eucalyptus and other nonnative trees and plants.<br /> The process of reviving the wetland's natural function and ecology on nearly 50 acres of land began in 2011. Thousands of cubic yards of fill were excavated and the landscape was reshaped to allow the wetland to flood naturally. In addition, nonnative trees and plants were removed and replaced with native vegetation.<br /> <br /> The return of the wetland not only increases the diversity and abundance of plants and animals, it also helps protect archeological resources and historic structures from erosion and flooding and provides visitors the opportunity to experience, enjoy, and learn about a natural wetland ecosystem.<br /> <br /> <b>More Restoration Information</b><br /> Close to the mainland yet worlds apart, Santa Cruz Island is home to plants and animals that are found nowhere else on Earth. Like the Galapagos Islands of South America, the Channel Islands exist in isolation, allowing evolution to proceed independently, fostering the development of 145 endemic, or unique, species. Santa Cruz Island is host to 60 of these endemic species. Some, like the island jay and the Santa Cruz Island silver lotus, are found only on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this isolation has also made these species vulnerable to extinction. The melodic song of the Santa Barbara Island song sparrow and the crimson flower of the Santa Cruz Island monkey flower are no longer heard or seen within the park. The destruction of these species' habitats by nonnative plants and animals has caused their extinction along with eight other rare and unique island species. Once found only on the Channel Islands, they have been lost forever.<br /> <br /> To save 10 other island species, including the island fox, from the brink of extinction as well as to protect more than 2,000 significant archeological sites, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy embarked upon a multi-year program to restore Santa Cruz Island. This restoration program is part of the National Park Service mission, as mandated by Congress, to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. As owner of over 70 percent of Santa Cruz Island, it is the mission of The Nature Conservancy to preserve the plants and animals that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the land and waters they need to survive.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and natural and cultural resource experts identified nonnative feral pigs as the most significant disturbance to the island's sensitive resources. Pigs cause major direct impacts to native plant communities, rare plant species, and archeological sites.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting caused massive destruction of native species and resulted in bare ground that was easily eroded and colonized by invasive weeds, especially fennel. This activity was a factor in the decline of nine island plant species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting also damaged a large number of archeological sites on the island that are associated with the Chumash native people who occupied the island from at least 9,000 years ago until the early 1800s. The feral pigs rooted three feet deep at a number of sites, disturbing these sacred sites and destroying their archeological value.<br /> <br /> Moreover, feral pigs played a pivotal role in the catastrophic decline of island foxes. Piglets provided a year-round food source for golden eagles, allowing these formerly rare or occasional visitors to expand their range and establish a resident population on the island that then preyed on island foxes. Golden eagle predation placed the fox on the brink of extinction on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.<br /> <br /> The consensus among numerous experts was that the eradication of feral pigs was the most important action that could be taken to protect and restore Santa Cruz Island. The National Park Service had success restoring other islands in the park through the removal of nonnative animals. The eradication of European rabbits from Santa Barbara Island and sheep and burros from San Miguel Island resulted in tremendous natural recovery. Feral pigs were also eradicated from Santa Rosa Island in a similar program. Pig eradication began on Santa Cruz Island in 2005 and was completed in 2007.<br /> <br /> Other management actions to initiate recovery of the island ecosystem were implemented. Golden eagles were live captured and relocated to northeast California. A captive breeding program for island foxes was established to restore a wild island fox population. The last captive bred island fox was released in 2008. The island fox was delisted as an endangered species in 2016 and has been recognized as one of the quickest and most succesful recoveries of an endangered species. Monitoring of the island fox population continues.<br /> <br /> Also, native bald eagles were reestablished on the island. This predator disappeared in the 1950s due to DDT poisoning, hunting, collecting, and intentional poisoning. Bald eagles eat fish, seabirds, and animal carcasses, not live foxes and are very territorial.<br /> In 2006 this program paid off. For the first time in more than 50 years, two bald eagle chicks were hatched unaided from two separate nests on Santa Cruz Island. Today the island is home to over 30 resident bald eagles.<br /> <br /> This multi-year program to remove golden eagles, reestablish bald eagles, save island foxes, and eradicate pigs has helped restore the balance to the naturally functioning ecosystem on Santa Cruz Island. Once restored, the island will offer one of the last opportunities to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p>",

Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the biggest challenge. The transportation of supplies and stock on and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and expense made it very difficult. However, ranchers adapted to the challenges of island life through self-reliance and, as one ranch foreman wrote, \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\"<br /> <br /> No one was better at this than Diego Cuevas, a former ranch foreman, who stated in an oral history that he learned to \"fix things by improvising. You had to out there. We didn't have any stores.\" Margaret Vail Woolley, part of the Vail family that owned the island, concurred, \"He [Diego] could make anything out of anything. It was remarkable. He was perfect for the island.\"<br /> <br /> Some of Diego's inventions included shutting off the generator by creating a timer using ice, cables, and pulleys (which didn't work), or by using a rat trap, string, and an alarm clock (which did work). He also built a motorized cart to haul slop to the pigs and a diesel-hauling trailer with a tank. He installed a truck engine in a boat given to the ranch by the Air Force and devised a cooling system for it that worked with salt water and a kelp knife to protect the rudder and prop, but soon discovered that fishing still was better from the rocks on the island shore.<br /> <br /> To be as self-sufficient as possible, island ranchers grew and raised much of their own food, importing deer, elk, quail, pigs, and rabbits. They would make many of their own supplies such as ropes, saddles, candles, and soaps. They often salvaged what they could from shipwrecks and from abandoned military establishments from World War II and the Cold War. And they had specialized boats constructed to transport supplies, cattle, and staff to and from the island.<br /> <br /> Ranching began on Santa Rosa Island in 1844 shortly after the island was granted to the Carrillo family by the Mexican government. Then from 1858 to 1901 the More family ran one of the largest sheep ranches in the state, with up to 80,000 sheep.<br /> <br /> They centered their operations in Becher's Bay, where they constructed a pier and built the clapboard ranch house, horse barn, and blacksmith shop barn that are still found here today. These buildings, built in the 1860s and 1870s, are some of the oldest wood buildings in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> For almost a century after the Mores, Vail & Vickers operated one of the largest and most productive beef cattle ranches in Santa Barbara County. Four generations of family members acted as stewards of the land managing the ranch in the traditional system of vaqueros (Spanish for \"cowboys\"), tending cattle on horseback, and preserving the last intact large Mexican land grant rancho in California as well as the last working island cattle ranch in the continental United States.<br /> <br /> Although the end of ranching in 1998 brought a close to a truly unique way of life, Vail & Vickers' commitment to ranching traditions preserved an undeveloped landscape that greatly contributed to the decision by Congress to include Santa Rosa Island in Channel Islands National Park in 1980.<br /> In 1986 the federal government purchased the island. Today, the NPS is preserving and interpreting the historic area so visitors will always have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the islands' past.<br /> <br /> For more information on ranching history and the historic buildings, please see the other site pins on the map and visit the ranch exhibit in the restored schoolhouse.<br /> <br /> For more even more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\"><strong>Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road. On the west side of the road is the Vail and Vickers Ranch House site, with a two story house and an outbuilding, both with white clapboard siding and dark green trim and roofs. The dirt road continues toward the north, with a long wooden rail fence running near the right or eastern side of the road, and a row of eucalyptus trees just beyond that fence. About a quarter of a mile down that road is the ranch complex, a cluster of ranch buildings and corrals. <br /><br />On a side road that loops to the right, near the eucalyptus trees, is small chain link fence enclosure with a low shed with a metal roof: the pig pen. Back on the main road, just past that side road turn, are two single story wooden sheds: the scale house and the branding shed. Further along the main road are two large red wooden barns, the blacksmith shop barn and the horse barn. After this, the road curves right toward the east, passing a single story grey wooden bunkhouse, a small single story white school house, several wooden rail corral enclosures, and a cattle dipping vat. As the road approaches the edge of the bluff, a hundred yards to your left, or the north, is the foreman's house-a white single story structure, with dark green trim and roof. On the other side of the road are a rope house, a cattle chute and a pile driver.<br /><br />To the east of the road where you are now standing, on the other side of the wooden rail fence, and running parallel to it, is a long row of eucalyptus trees.<br /><br />To the south of you, the road continues toward a cluster of national park service buildings-white with green trim and roofs. <br />",

Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the biggest challenge. The transportation of supplies and stock onto and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and expense made it very difficult. However, as former ranch superintendent Clifford McElrath wrote in his memoir On Santa Cruz Island, ranchers would adapt to the difficulties of isolated island life through self-reliance and by \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\" Pier Gherini, former owner of the eastern portion of the island, wrote a humorous story in \"Island Rancho\" about the self-reliance of Joe Griggs:<br /> <br /> \"Joe could do most anything, except write. An expert rider, huntsman, and general ranch worker, Joe also was a mechanical whiz. He once took a 1915 Waterloo Boy tractor that had been \"mothballed\" because the early workmen wouldn't touch it, and used the parts to make a sawmill. The fact that we didn't need a mill in no way detracted from the ingenuity and skill that went into its making. All of these people had one common characteristic. They knew and loved the Island. Each in his own way was rugged and self-reliant. They took its beauties and hardships in stride.\"<br /> <br /> Although livestock ranching on Santa Cruz Island began in the 1850s, it was under the direction of Justinian Caire beginning around 1880 that a variety of agricultural and ranching endeavors were developed in an effort to create a self-sufficient operation on the island.<br /> <br /> In California's Channel Islands, Marla Daily writes that, \"Buildings including several ranch houses, bunkhouses, barns, wineries, a chapel, mess hall, blacksmith shop, and saddle shop were constructed. Wherever possible, native island materials were used. Kilns were built for the manufacture of bricks and limestone mortar. Stones were quarried and cut to shape on the island. A resident blacksmith forged wrought-iron fittings, railings, and hinges used on many of the buildings. Employees included masons, carpenters, dairymen, team drivers, vintners, a wagon maker, cobbler, butcher, seasonal grape pickers and sheep shearers, a sea captain and sailors to run the company's 60-foot schooner. Hay, vegetables, and over a dozen varieties of grapes were grown, in addition to almond, walnut and other fruit and ornamental trees. Sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs were raised.\"<br /> <br /> Since the island was too large to manage from the one main ranch in the Central Valley, other facilities, or out-ranches like the one at Prisoners, were developed. Justinian Caire realized the importance of Prisoner's Harbor as the only good landing for goods, and set to work improving the small area known as La Playa (the beach) as the entrance gate to his island enterprises. Its facilities were of the utmost importance to the island's owners as the shipping facility, entry point for visitors, and warehouse location. Please see the Prisoners Harbor points of interest section (pages 52-57) for more information about the historical features in the area.<br /> <br /> Ranching by descendants of Justinian Caire, the Gherini family, continued on the eastern end of the island between 1926 and 1984. The Gherini era ended in February 1997 when the National Park Service acquired the last interest from the family. Ranching also continued on the rest of the island until 1987 when the Nature Conservancy acquired the property. In 2000, the Nature Conservancy donated 8,500 acres of its holdings, including the Prisoners Harbor area, to the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service is preserving the historic area so visitors always will have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the island's past.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "As you walk the compacted dirt road from the pier, just past the picnic area is a large livestock corral made of 5-foot-high white board fencing. Two interpretive panels at each side of the road illustrate restoring the landscape and the historic busy port of call.<br /><br />The scale house is located on the northeast edge of the corral. This open-sided building with a corrugated metal roof measuring eighteen by nine feet and is made of the same white fencing material with gates that open on either end where livestock entered and were weighed as they stood on the scale platform. The weighted balance is still in place, protected from the elements within a large white wooden box on the backside of the building. The warehouse is located just beyond the corral on the right side of the road. This large two-room brick building has two parallel gable roofs, as if two separate rectangular buildings have been joined side-by-side. It measures 54 feet on the front and rear, and 45 feet on the sides. Red brick-faced rubble walls with lime mortar, 20 inches thick, rise above a three-foot high stone foundation. A solid brick wall with an arched passageway separates the two storerooms. Two doorways with maroon hinged wood doors framed in white face the harbor, while two smaller doorways face the cliff at the rear of the building. Both sets of doorways feature arched openings filled with brick. The builders imbedded a carved plaque in the brick facade at the upper part of the west gable; it reads: 1887. A pit toilet is located just beyond the warehouse on the same side of the road. Further down the dirt road on the right is the former site of the original ranch buildings. The buildings are no longer standing, all that remains is an undergrowth of willow and coyote brush.",

Fortunately, the spread of these nonnative trees can be controlled. Many other non-native plants that reached the islands during the ranching period, however, are not as benign.<br /> <br /> What was once an island covered with coastal sage-scrub, chaparral, oak scrub, oak woodland, and native grasslands (both annuals and perennial) has given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including oats, bromes, fox-tails, thistles, mustard, and fennel. Today, nearly 25 percent of the plant species found on eastern Santa Cruz Island are introduced, providing approximately 75 percent of the ground cover.<br /> <br /> Native plants that developed in isolation often are vulnerable to competition from introduced or alien species. Many of these alien plants have evolved with grazing pressure, whereas the native island plants have not co-existed with grazers or browsers on the islands since the pygmy mammoths, nearly 12,000 years ago. With sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs grazing and browsing on the native vegetation and disturbing the soil, the alien plants spread rapidly, competing with the natives for limited soil and moisture. The nonnatives eventually overwhelm the natives, which often have longer germination and growth cycles.<br /> <br /> The restoration of the island's native vegetation is the goal of the National Park Service. Special focus is being placed on the plants that are endemic to the islands, those occurring only on the Channel Islands and nowhere else in the world. Eight of these occur only on Santa Cruz Island. Nine of these endemic plants are currently listed as endangered species. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, the National Park Service, along with The Nature Conservancy, is working towards the removal of nonnative species. Over 9,000 sheep were removed from the eastern 6,200 acres of Santa Cruz Island between 1997 and 1999 (Sheep were eliminated by The Nature Conservancy from the rest of the island by the late 1980s.) Pigs were removed from the island by 2007 and weed control is currently underway.<br /> <br /> One needs only to look at the recovery of vegetation, reduction of erosion, and the condition of archeological sites on San Miguel Island since the removal of sheep in the 1950s to envision what may eventually occur on Santa Cruz Island. Described as a \"barren lump of sand\" in the 1930s, San Miguel Island has undergone a remarkable recovery and now is densely vegetated with a diverse assemblage of native plants. In fifty years, we hope to write about the remarkable recovery and return of the native plants of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <b>Additional Island Restoration Information</b><br /> Close to the mainland yet worlds apart, Santa Cruz Island is home to plants and animals that are found nowhere else on Earth. Like the Galapagos Islands of South America, the Channel Islands exist in isolation, allowing evolution to proceed independently, fostering the development of 145 endemic, or unique, species. Santa Cruz Island is host to 60 of these endemic species. Some, like the island jay and the Santa Cruz Island silver lotus, are found only on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this isolation has also made these species vulnerable to extinction. The melodic song of the Santa Barbara Island song sparrow and the crimson flower of the Santa Cruz Island monkey flower are no longer heard or seen within the park. The destruction of these species' habitats by nonnative plants and animals has caused their extinction along with eight other rare and unique island species. Once found only on the Channel Islands, they have been lost forever.<br /> <br /> To save 10 other island species, including the island fox, from the brink of extinction as well as to protect more than 2,000 significant archeological sites, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy embarked upon a multi-year program to restore Santa Cruz Island. This restoration program is part of the National Park Service mission, as mandated by Congress, to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. As owner of over 70 percent of Santa Cruz Island, it is the mission of The Nature Conservancy to preserve the plants and animals that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the land and waters they need to survive.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and natural and cultural resource experts identified nonnative feral pigs as the most significant disturbance to the island's sensitive resources. Pigs cause major direct impacts to native plant communities, rare plant species, and archeological sites.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting caused massive destruction of native species and resulted in bare ground that was easily eroded and colonized by invasive weeds, especially fennel. This activity was a factor in the decline of nine island plant species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting also damaged a large number of archeological sites on the island that are associated with the Chumash native people who occupied the island from at least 9,000 years ago until the early 1800s. The feral pigs rooted three feet deep at a number of sites, disturbing these sacred sites and destroying their archeological value.<br /> <br /> Moreover, feral pigs played a pivotal role in the catastrophic decline of island foxes. Piglets provided a year-round food source for golden eagles, allowing these formerly rare or occasional visitors to expand their range and establish a resident population on the island that then preyed on island foxes. Golden eagle predation placed the fox on the brink of extinction on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.<br /> <br /> The consensus among numerous experts was that the eradication of feral pigs was the most important action that could be taken to protect and restore Santa Cruz Island. The National Park Service had success restoring other islands in the park through the removal of nonnative animals. The eradication of European rabbits from Santa Barbara Island and sheep and burros from San Miguel Island resulted in tremendous natural recovery. Feral pigs were also eradicated from Santa Rosa Island in a similar program. Pig eradication began on Santa Cruz Island in 2005 and was completed in 2007.<br /> <br /> Other management actions to initiate recovery of the island ecosystem were implemented. Golden eagles were live captured and relocated to northeast California. A captive breeding program for island foxes was established to restore a wild island fox population. The last captive bred island fox was released in 2008. The island fox was delisted as an endangered species in 2016 and has been recognized as one of the quickest and most succesful recoveries of an endangered species. Monitoring of the island fox population continues.<br /> <br /> Also, native bald eagles were reestablished on the island. This predator disappeared in the 1950s due to DDT poisoning, hunting, collecting, and intentional poisoning. Bald eagles eat fish, seabirds, and animal carcasses, not live foxes and are very territorial.<br /> In 2006 this program paid off. For the first time in more than 50 years, two bald eagle chicks were hatched unaided from two separate nests on Santa Cruz Island. Today the island is home to over 30 resident bald eagles.<br /> <br /> This multi-year program to remove golden eagles, reestablish bald eagles, save island foxes, and eradicate pigs has helped restore the balance to the naturally functioning ecosystem on Santa Cruz Island. Once restored, the island will offer one of the last opportunities to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p>",

This is plateau is a marine terrace-an ancient shoreline carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. Remnants of this and other marine terraces can be found around much of the island's coastline. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs below you.<br /> <br /> The islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <strong>Santarosae</strong><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.<br /> <br /> <b>Caliche Forest</b><br /> The island's isolation has also helped to preserve one of the island's most interesting features-the caliche forest, calcified casts of ancient vegetation that have been exposed in several areas by the eroding sand. This ancient fossilized vegetation is comprised of roots and trunks of a variety of plants, including possibly pines and cypresses that once grew on the island during periods of colder and wetter climates. The most unusual casting that has been found is a huge caliche log that was 2½ feet in diameter and about 30 feet long. Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/caliche-forest.htm\">Caliche Forest</a>.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Please note: To visit the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger. You can arrange a hike with available island staff.</strong></em><br /> <br />  </p>",

In the 1870s, the island was described as a \"barren lump of sand.\" For over 100 years sheep (up to 6,000 at one point), cattle, horses, pigs, burros severely overgrazed the island, eliminating most of the native vegetation and creating open, disturbed, and eroded soils that allowed nonnative plants to flourish. Once established, these hardier nonnatives outcompeted the natives for limited soil and moisture, due to their longer germination and growth cycles and ability to withstand grazing and browsing by livestock.<br /> <br /> The park is working to restore the island's native vegetation, and special focus is being placed on the 10 plants endemic to the islands-those found nowhere else in the world. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, all non-native animals have been removed and the effort to plant native species and control nonnative weeds is underway.<br /> <br /> The recovery of native plants has so far been remarkable. Many have spread beyond the buried seed banks and steep canyon walls and cliffs, where they remained protected from grazing, and have reestablished themselves throughout the island.<br /> This reestablishment of native plants has also aided in the recovery of endemic deer mice, island foxes, and nesting land birds by providing important habitat. Today, there are 16 land birds that nest annually on the island. Six of these-the song sparrow, horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, loggerhead shrike, Allen's hummingbird, and house finch-are endemic to the Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> You can help with this recovery of island natives by cleaning your boots and other possessions, such as backpacks, before you visit. This ensures that you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species to the island. Together we can guarantee the return of native plants and animals throughout San Miguel Island.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>Geographical Isolation</b><br /> As you hike up to Cavern Point, take a moment and rest halfway up the canyon. As you have been hiking, you probably have noticed areas of bright white, chalky rock that have been exposed along the hillsides due to erosion. While this excessive erosion due to overgrazing is detrimental to the island's native vegetation, it does give us the chance to take a closer look at part of the island's complex geology.<br /> <br /> This white layer is known as diatomaceous earth. It is derived from very small, single-cell sea plants called diatoms, which are made of silica (silicon dioxide). As these plants die, their silica skeletons settle into the various marine sediments at the bottom of the ocean, often enmasse. It is from this diatomaceous earth that the mineral chert is derived-some of the siliceous diatoms are dissolved by water and then later recrystallized as a dense hard form of rock. Chert fractures like glass and was used by the Chumash Indians for arrowheads, drill bits, and scraping and cutting tools. Chert on the islands has a light brown color owing to small amounts of iron impurities. Other impurities in chert give it a variety of colors that can be found throughout the world. The black variety is called flint and is colored by inclusions of organic matter. Jasper is the name given to the red-colored variety owing to inclusions of an iron oxide, hematite.<br /> <br /> Around five million years ago, compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of these marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common. A major fault that runs through the center of the island has moved nearly 100 feet in the last 30,000 years, and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a landbridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b>Santarosae</b><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p>",

One is here on Santa Rosa Island and the other is near San Diego.<br /> <br /> Thousands of years of isolation have made this island version of the pine distinct. It is genetically and physically different enough from the mainland trees that it is considered a separate subspecies and given its own common name-the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine.<br /> <br /> As the climate has changed, the pines most likely survived here because of the cool, moist air from the persistent island fog and because of the limited competition from other plants-due to the island's isolation, a smaller number of plant species exist on the island as compared to the mainland.<br /> <br /> The Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine has a very limited range on the island, occurring only in two locations. Along with its limited individual genetic variability, this makes the Torrey pine very vulnerable to extinction.<br /> <br /> To ensure the survival of this unique pine, the park closely monitors its health. So far, all studies have indicated that the pines are doing very well. In 1888, when the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine was first described, the grove was highly impacted by sheep grazing, and the population was estimated to be about 100 trees. Today that number has grown to over 4,000 trees along with many young trees. Some of the oldest trees are in the heart of the grove and have been dated to approximately 250 years old.<br /> <br /> Please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/torrey-pines.htm\">Torrey Pines</a> for more information on the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine.</p>",

These particles were laid down in layers underwater 7-16 million years ago.<br /> <br /> To the west (the area you have been hiking on) lies the Santa Cruz Island volcanics, composed primarily of andesite, a dark-colored, fine-grained rock. These rocks reveal a fascinating story about the formation of the Channel Islands. Between 15-30 million years ago, lava flows and volcanoes covered much of the area that now comprises the northern Channel Islands and the western Santa Monica Mountains. In some places the lava accumulated to as much as 10,000 feet thick. A certain type of lava, pillow lava, found in some of these rocks is evidence that much of the volcanic action took place below the surface of the ocean. In other places, oyster shells and other marine fossils are found embedded in the lava. At times, the buildup of lava was great enough that volcanic islands formed. These islands probably were short lived and were eroded to below sea level after the volcanic action ceased.<br /> <br /> The reason for these volcanic eruptions can be found within the magnetic particles in the rocks. As the rocks were cooling, magnetic particles within the rocks would have been set in line with the magnetic poles of the earth. However, magnetic measurements now taken in these same rocks show that they do not line up. In fact, they are off by about 100 degrees, with the oldest rocks showing the largest discrepancy. Geologists believe that when these rocks were formed, the platform on which the islands rest lined up in a north-south direction along the southern coast of California, with San Miguel Island's position lying just offshore from San Diego.<br /> <br /> As the Pacific plate made contact with and began to slide past the North American plate, forming the San Andreas fault, this platform was rotated in a clockwise direction to its present east-west position. As it rotated, the crust of the ocean thinned and the resulting reduction of pressure allowed molten magma to form and ascend from the mantle, erupting under the sea as lava.<br /> <br /> Around 5 million years ago, compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of these marine sediments and volcanic rocks and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common.

Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> As you reach the overlook, turn around and take in the view of Prisoners Harbor. The second largest historic Chumash village on Santa Cruz Island, Xaxas (hä´ häs), was located at Prisoners Harbor and was occupied for over 3,000 years. It was a major port of trade and a departure point for cross-channel travel. At the time of European contact ((Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo’s voyage in 1542) the village was home to approximately 95-160 Chumash, including many high-ranking families, a powerful chief, and tomo l (plank canoe) owners.<br /> <br /> Xaxas is just one of an estimated 3,000 archeological sites on Santa Cruz Island, ranging from small temporary camps to larger villages and dating back at least 7,500 years. At the time of European contact (Cabrillo's voyage in 1542), at least 1,200 Chumash lived in 10 villages distributed around the island's coast, including the largest historic island village, Swaxil, located near the Scorpion ranch.<br /> <br /> These archeological sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life.The Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the midden reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plant resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in swift tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The midden also reveals that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders was shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California. Chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of Olivella snail shells to produce these beads. Not only did the islands have an abundance of Olivella shells, but, even more importantly, eastern Santa Cruz Island had considerable natural deposits of chert, a hard durable silica rock.<br /> <br /> Eastern Santa Cruz Island was the center for manufacturing chert microdrills, as this location had chert of the proper type and quality for such tools within coastal Chumash territory. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on Santa Cruz have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island was not, unfortunately, isolated enough to protect the Chumash from the diseases the Spanish brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Chumash population had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics. The last of the Chumash islanders would leave their traditional island home in 1822.<br /> <br /> Although much has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of the island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Chumash, give us a window into this ancient world and remind us on another level how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol, Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Protecting the Islands</b><br /> This is why Channel Islands National Park was established by Congress in 1980-to protect, preserve, and teach us about the islands' unique past and fragile resources, including: the island Chumash and the ranchers who came after them; the native plants that are struggling to recover; the complicated geologic story; and the wide variety of other natural and cultural resources not mentioned in this guide. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and help preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Cruz Island and the rest of the Channel Islands. But don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to safeguard-to preserve-the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal . Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>Preserving the Past</b><br /> <br /> <em>An island ranch is a study in self-reliance. With no stores, phones...everything has to be fashioned from whatever is on hand; it's the art of making do.</em><br /> -Gretel Ehrlich, <em>Cowboy Island: Farewell to a Ranching Legacy</em><br /> <br /> While the isolated island offered ranchers several advantages over the mainland, including no predators and the world's best fence (the ocean), it created special challenges as well. Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the most considerable of these. The transportation of supplies and stock on and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and high expense made it very difficult.<br /> <br /> However, ranchers adapted to the challenges of island life through self-reliance and, as one ranch foreman wrote, \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\" In order to produce income and be as self-sufficient as possible, ranchers developed a diverse operation: they raised barley and potatoes, maintained a vegetable garden, and imported different animals, including sheep, cattle, horses, mules, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and ducks.<br /> <br /> Not all of these enterprises succeeded. Several attempts to grow crops were severely hampered by the island's unrelenting winds and blowing sand. And droughts caused ranchers to remove their livestock, impacting the raising of wool and meat for market.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, ranching persisted for over 100 years on San Miguel Island and included such colorful characters as George Nidever, a prominent California pioneer, William G. Waters, an eccentric entrepreneur, and the well-publicized family of Herbert Lester.<br /> <br /> Nidever was the first to begin ranching in earnest on the island. In 1850 he brought 45 head of sheep, 17 head of cattle, two hogs, and seven horses and by 1862 the stock had increased to 6,000 sheep, 200 head of cattle, 100 hogs and 32 horses. During the drought in 1863 and 1864 Nidever lost most of his livestock and those that remained denuded much of the island, leaving just sand dunes and drifts.<br /> <br /> Nidever is most noted for finding the \"Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island.\" She was an American Indian woman lived isolated on the remote island for 18 years after her people went to the mainland in 1835. Eighteen years later, Nidever, while collecting seagull eggs on the island, found her and eventually brought her back to Santa Barbara where she delighted the town with her language, songs, and dance. Tragically, however, within a short period of time she became ill and died.<br /> <br /> In the 1880s William Waters acquired the ranching rights to the island and became the longest-lived resident of the island, spending almost thirty years there. He proclaimed himself the \"King of San Miguel,\" stating that the United States had no right to the island and that it was his for the taking. When the government tried to investigate, Waters threatened to shoot any invaders of his nation. According to Waters, only when Grover Cleveland sent a civil request as the head of one nation made to another would he allow government surveyors to access to the island. In reality, what probably convinced Waters to allow the survey party access was the visit to the island by a U.S. Marshal and a contingent of armed men. Waters was eventually denied his request to remain as the self-appointed king and remained a U.S. citizen until his death.<br /> <br /> Waters and his work staff constructed the island's first road from Cuyler Harbor beach to the top of the island via Nidever Canyon, blasting rocks and making a fine but narrow grade for hauling supplies up and products down. The road remains as a hiking trail today and some of the rockwork is still evident.<br /> <br /> Waters and his staff also constructed the island's largest ranch house-the ruins of which lie before you. After sand drifts had buried the old ranch house in upper Nidever Canyon, work began on this new house in 1906. It was constructed out of materials salvaged from shipwrecks around the island - most of it from the lumber schooner the J.M. Coleman which had gone aground inside Point Bennett in 1905. The house was 125 feet long and 16 feet wide with double-walls to withstand the strong winds. A blacksmith shop/harness room, tool shed, well, cistern, and root cellar were also constructed.<br /> <br /> Robert Brooks acquired the island lease from Waters in 1917 and hired his friend from the Army, Herbert Lester, to manage the ranch from 1929-1942. Herbert brought his new bride, Elizabeth, with him to the island, and eventually had two daughters out here, Betsy and Marianne. Herbert and his family enjoyed isolated island life and saw it as an escape \"from the shallowness of civilization and its incessant and inconsequential demands.\"<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island soon came to be known as Lester's Island, and following in Waters' footsteps, he too dubbed himself the \"King of San Miguel.\" He wore a makeshift insignia to designate his rank and their mailbag read \"Kingdom of San Miguel.\"<br /> <br /> Numerous stories are known from the Lester era, due to extensive coverage in the press. In 1940, Life magazine ran an article about the family entitled \"Swiss Family Lester,\" including a story about the kids being educated in the \"tiniest schoolhouse in the world.\"<br /> <br /> In 1937, The Santa Barbara News-Press carried an article headlined, \"Man's Life Saved by Island King.\" The story described how Robert Brooks was working on the reconstruction of the landing down in Cuyler Harbor when he lost his footing, fell and impaled his thigh on a rusted bolt. He was in danger of bleeding to death if he did not receive immediate attention. Lester, relying on his Army experience, quickly sterilized the wound with Lysol and stitched it closed with a curved burlap sack needle and some fishing line. The ranch had no radio at the time so the American flag was hoisted upside down in the hope of attracting a passing vessel. Two weeks later their regular supply ship arrived and transported Brooks to the hospital. The doctors were quite impressed with Lester's work and refused to take any pay as Lester had completed all the treatment necessary and had saved Brooks' life.<br /> <br /> In 1948 island ranching came to an end when the Navy revoked Brooks' lease so that the island could be used as bombing range to train and test for the nation's Cold War defense system.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the ranch house built by Waters and lived in by the Lesters burned down in 1967 when the Navy inadvertently started a fire during weapons testing. All that remains today is what you see before you (piles of rubble, hardware and metal pieces, and two cement-lined excavations considered to be a cistern and a root cellar) and, of course, the stories of survival on a weather-beaten and most isolated island.<br /> <br /> Even today, the isolation of this island still affects visitors and the National Park Service. Public boat trips for park visitors are limited to only a few days each month during the summer and visitors must bring (and carry up to the top of the island) all their own food and water. Park staff must import food and drinking water as well, and have established a solar power system for energy. Like so many who visited and resided here before, we must learn to make do with what we have.<br /> <br /> For more information on ranching history, visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lester-ranch-site.htm\">Lester Ranch</a>.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>Back from the Brink</b><br /> Perhaps by now you have been lucky enough to cross paths with an island fox. They are frequently seen along the trail as well as around the campground area. The island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) lives on six of the eight Channel Islands-San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente. Each island has its own subspecies, and it is found nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> The island fox is the largest native mammal on the Channel Islands, but one of the smallest foxes in the world. It is nearly 20 percent smaller than its closest relative, the mainland gray fox. It's about the size of a house cat, averaging from 12 to 13 inches in height, 23 to 27 inches in length (including tail), and three to six pounds in weight. Similar in appearance to the gray fox, the island fox has a gray back, rufous sides (reddish-brown), and white undersides. There are distinctive black, white, and rufous markings on the face.<br /> <br /> Unlike the nocturnal gray fox, which hunts at night to avoid predators, the island fox is active during daylight hours. As a \"generalist omnivore,\" it eats almost all available foods on the islands, including fruits, vegetation, insects, mice, and crabs.<br /> Mating takes place in February and March, with pupping usually in April or May. Average litter size is two. The adult males play an important role in the raising of young.<br /> <br /> The fossil record for the island fox dates back at least 6,400 years. Since the Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland, scientists currently have two theories on how the fox arrived on the islands. However, due to the scant fossil history, significant questions still remain on the exact mechanism of the initial arrival.<br /> <br /> One theory is that the island fox's ancestor, the gray fox, \"rafted\" to the islands on driftwood, propelled by a storm or currents. During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today, narrowing the channel between the islands and mainland to perhaps just four to five miles across and grouping the northern islands together into one large island we call Santarosae. The other theory is that gray foxes were transported to the northern Channel Islands, like they were to the San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands, by American Indians.<br /> <br /> The foxes adapted to their new island home, evolving into a dwarf, or smaller, form of the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size. As the climate warmed and ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae was divided into the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. Because of a lack of permanent freshwater, the island fox did not inhabit Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> Between 1994 and 1999, island foxes almost disappeared on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands. Predation by nonnative golden eagles caused over a 90 percent decline in the population with just 15 foxes left on San Miguel Island, placing the island fox on the brink of extinction. By 2004, the island fox was listed as a federally endangered species.<br /> <br /> A successful recovery effort included captive breeding of island foxes, relocation of golden eagles, and the reestablishment of bald eagles (a natural competitor of the golden eagle). In all, on San Miguel Island 62 foxes were released over a six-year period with the final fox set free in 2007. Today, with the population at close to pre-decline numbers, the recovery effort has been recognized as one of the quickest and most successful recoveries of an endangered species.<br /> <br /> <b>Park Protection</b><br /> In 1980, San Miguel Island was designated part of Channel Islands National Park to protect, preserve, and teach us about the island's fragile resources and unique past. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, the National Park Service can preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about San Miguel Island and the rest of the Channel Islands-but don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to preserve the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.<br /> <br /> <b>Area Beyond Ranger Station is Closed to Unescorted Travel</b><br /> Due to unexploded ordnance, visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond this point. Entering this area without a ranger is a violation of federal law. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may only explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site.<br /> <br /> To see other parts of the island, such as Point Bennett or the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger. If you are with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics a ranger or volunteer will be available for most of these trips to lead hikes. They will announce time and date during your arrival. If you are a private boater, the San Miguel ranger can be contacted on Marine Radio Channel 16. You can also arrange a hike with the ranger through park headquarters at (805) 658-5730.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "In an open field, next to the airplane landing strip, sits the ranger station. It is an L-shaped wooden building. The building has brown, planked wood siding. If facing the front of the building, four upper, clerestory windows are visible near the peak of the roof. A lower roof overhangs the front of the building, supported by beams and posts, creating a covered walkway. Along that walkway, at ground level, five windows alternate with five doors. Two wooden benches along the exterior wall provide seating. At the bend of the L-shape is a 10-foot by 10-foot structure that sticks up about 10 feet taller than the roof. Sticking up from it are several tall rods and a shallow, concave-shaped satellite dish. An outdoor lamp attached to the side. <br /><br />In front of the station is a picnic table and a flagpole, flying the United States flag. On the left side of the walkway is a low wire frame platform. Mounted on top of this is a large brush, made of stiff blue plastic spikes, used to clean off the bottoms of boots. Further to the left is a small, single-seater wood plank outhouse, with symbols on the door representing both a man and a woman. Several other small storage sheds are nearby.<br /><br />The ranger station information center is through the second door from the right. The room is a large and open space, with high ceilings. It has light wood paneling. Windows line the back wall behind a partially-partitioned area with desks and a table with two chairs. Colorful pictures on the walls display island views. On the left side of the room are two doors leading to equipment and supply closets. To the right is a television, set on the top of a corner cabinet, with a shelf of videos below it.<br />",

Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> If you were to walk along the edge of the marine terrace below, you would discover tiny fragments of broken shells glittering in the soil and piles of shells falling out from the cliff edge. How did these shells get there? Must be the ocean at work-or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify this as a \"midden,\" a debris pile containing remnants of those societies who came before-the Chumash and their ancestors. This midden is just one of over 700 archeological sites on Santa Rosa Island that have been discovered, ranging from small temporary camps to larger villages. In fact, the oldest human remains yet discovered in North America came from Santa Rosa Island's remote northwest shoreline and date back over 13,000 years.<br /> <br /> Spanish mission records indicate that up to 1,200 Chumash lived in eight villages distributed around the island's coast, including a village here in Bechers Bay (near the ranch area). On the terrace above Southeast Anchorage there is a prehistoric village site dating back at least 7,500 years ago, where depressions in the ground mark individual thatched hut locations.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life. The Island Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the midden reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plan resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The midden also reveals that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California. Chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells to produce these beads.<br /> <br /> Not only did the islands have an abundance of olivella shells, but also, even more importantly, Santa Cruz Island (which lies to the east) had considerable natural deposits of chert, a hard durable silica rock. Eastern Santa Cruz Island was the center for manufacturing chert microdrills, as this location had chert of the proper type and quality for such tools. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island was not isolated enough to protect the Chumash from the diseases the Spanish brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Chumash had been devastated by measles, other introduced epidemics, drought, and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the Chumash islanders would leave their traditional island home in 1822.<br /> <br /> Although much has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of the island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the Island Chumash, remind us on another level how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol, Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol, 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Rosa Island</strong><br /> Archaeologist Phil Orr's discovery of human bones in 1959 at Arlington Springs provided evidence of the oldest known habitation of the island. Recently radio-carbon dated to 13,000 years before present, these are among the oldest securely-dated human remains in North America. The age of the Arlington remains and a host of archeological sites on the Channel Islands that date to the late Holocene (10,000-6,500 years before present) indicate an early migration route from the Old World into North America along the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island and the other Channel Islands provided rich resources for seafaring peoples to thrive by hunting seabirds, sea mammals, fish and shellfish. With extensive trade networks on the mainland, the island Chumash were able to trade marine resources with mainland peoples for goods they could not harvest or produce on the island. With plentiful food and fresh water, the island supported several villages at the time of European contact.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed up the coast of California in 1542, the first European to visit the Channel Islands, and documented three villages on Santa Rosa Island. A half-century later, Sebastian Rodriguez CermeÃ±o wrote about his interaction with the Chumash on the south side of the island on December 13, 1595, as he sailed southward along the coast: \"...and there came alongside a small boat like a canoe, with two Indians in it rowing. And having arrived at the launch, they brought some eighteen fish and a seal and gave them to us, for which we gave them some pieces of taffeta and cotton cloth in order that they should bring more. They went on shore and returned in the same boat with three Indians and brought nothing, At this island we went fishing with lines and caught some thirty fishlike cabrillas sea bass], which we soon ate on account of our great hunger....On both [Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island] the land is bare and sterile, although inhabited by Indians, there are no ports or coves in them in which to take shelter.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash, from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop. Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol. The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek, which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a hillside above the ocean, with a sweeping view of Bechers Bay, a wide curve in the coastline, far below. The hillside is covered with tall grass and scrubby shrubs. At the bottom of the hill is grassy, fairly level plateau that runs parallel to the shore, about one fourth to one half of a mile deep, ending in a steep cliff at the shoreline. Near the shoreline edge of the plateau, hundreds of yards apart, are deep crevices or gullies that run perpendicular to the shoreline, and deepen and widen at the shore. Darker tall bushes or small trees grow in these gullies. At the back of the plateau, where it meets bottom of the inland hills, is a long dirt road. It extends north toward the pier and the ranch complex with some tall trees. In the other direction, it runs southeast toward a hillside covered with a dark green stand of Torrey pines, and, beyond that, Skunk Point, a sandy spit of beach in the far distance. Just below us, on the plateau beyond the dirt road, is a long dirt airplane landing strip. A wire fence with wooden posts, separates this airstrip from the main road. A second dirt road follows the fence line, on the airstrip side. <br /><br />The ocean water near the shore is light turquois blue in color, growing darker blue further from the shore.

When Cabrillo came ashore there were approximately 100 Chumash living in 2 villages along the island's coast, including a village at Cuyler Harbor. The Chumash and their ancestors had been living on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years.<br /> <br /> Today there are over 600 fragile, relatively undisturbed archeological sites. The oldest one dates back to 11,600 years before the present-some of the oldest evidence of human presence in North America.<br /> <br /> Most of these archeological sites are \"middens,\" a debris pile containing remnants of those societies who came before. These midden sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life.<br /> <br /> The Island Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the middens reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plant resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The middens also reveal that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California.<br /> <br /> To produce these beads, chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells. Chert, a hard, durable silica rock, was found in considerable quantities on Santa Cruz Island. Because Eastern Santa Cruz Island had chert of the proper type and quality needed for tool construction, this location became the center for manufacturing chert microdrills. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island and the other Channel Islands were not isolated enough to protect the Island Chumash from the diseases the Spanish explorers and missionaries brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the Island Chumash had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics, as well as by drought and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the islanders would leave their traditional San Miguel Island home by 1816.<br /> <br /> Although much of the islander's history and way of life has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of San Miguel Island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the Island Chumash, remind us how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law.

Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on San Miguel Island</strong><br /> Historical records have proven that Chumash people made permanent settlements on San Miguel Island, although archeological remains of a village have not been found. One chronicler of the Cabrillo expedition wrote that local natives called the island Ciquimuymu , with two villages named Cico and Nimollollo . Accepted Chumash knowledge notes the island being called Tuqan , with the same name applied to its largest town that was probably located at Cuyler Harbor. A smaller settlement named Niwoyonmi has not been located. The occupants of this island would have experienced harsher climatic conditions than their neighbors on Santa Rosa or Santa Cruz islands; there were few locations that afforded good shelter, although water was available. Archeologists considered that the more intense conditions on the island likely spurred the San Miguel Chumash into extensive trade, especially with people on the mainland east of Goleta. San Miguel's occupants also had strong ties with those of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> Humans settled San Miguel Island at a very early date, as evidenced by evaluation of archeological materials found at Daisy Cave and other sites along the coastline. Preliminary results from excavations at Daisy Cave indicate a society reliant on the sea for sustenance, and one that had adapted through the development of technologies considered to be the earliest examples known in the New World, including the use of fishhooks and line. Fish bones from Daisy Cave have been dated as up to 11,500 years old, suggesting that the island was occupied as early as its neighbor, Santa Rosa Island; together (the four northern islands were one large island during this early period) these would represent perhaps the oldest known settlement in the region.<br /> <br /> As with the occupants of the other Channel Islands, the combination of pressures from the mainland missions, disruption of their trade and subsistence activities and invasions by European hunters eventually caused the Chumash to vacate the island, reportedly as early as 1816. However, the exact date when the last Chumash occupants of San Miguel Island were removed or left is not known. Fernando Librado, J. P. Harrington's Chumash informant, claimed that many people were killed in a fierce storm at the time of removal from the island, but the story has not been substantiated.<br /> <br /> The Chumash presence on San Miguel Island is today represented in the archeological record. Many important discoveries have been made indicating early habitation and technological innovation. Further investigations will lead to a better understanding of the social structure, subsistence and technology of the island residents and their relationships with mainlanders and other islanders.<br /> <br /> The earliest descriptions of the island Chumash culture and the first historical documentation of contact activities are found in the accounts of the various explorers who traveled in the region between 1542 and 1603. Cabrillo's chronicler Juan Paez de Castro wrote about San Miguel Island: \"Wednesday, the 25th October 1542], they left these islands, that is, the one farthest to windward, which has a very good port inside which no bad effects will be felt in any kind of sea weather. Paez mentioned the Chumash names for the island which they had apparently learned from the friendly occupants. Antonio de Herrera wrote in 1615, \"In the eight days they were at this port they were well treated by the Indians, who go naked and have their faces painted in a checkerboard fashion.\"<br /> <br /> Returning to San Miguel Island after exploring northward on the coast, Cabrillo's party hauled out their<em> frigata San Miguel</em> at Cuyler Harbor to recaulk and repair planking. Either here or on another island the fleet wintered; debate continues whether the long-accepted location of San Miguel Island is accurate. Nevertheless, the Chumash were not as welcoming this time. Francisco de Vargas recalled in 1560: \"With the natives of this island he had some great fights as they came out in a warlike manner. During all the time the fleet was at the Island Capitana the Indians never stopped fighting.\"<br /> <br /> Direct contacts with the island were few after Cabrillo's fateful voyage. VizcaÃ­no had contact with island Chumash in 1602, as his chronicler wrote: \"At dawn the captain's ship was near an island [San Miguel] in the shelter of which it was calm. A canoe came out with two Indians and a small boy, their eyes being painted with antimony. They asked us to go to their land; however, there was such a heavy sea and the island presented so many shoals that we did not dare to go to it, but veered out to sea . . . \"<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> Missionization<br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/collections-research/anthropology/chumash-life/#:~:text=Chumash%20life%20was%20centered%20around%20their%20town%20and%20village.&text=Some%20villages%20were%20as%20large,near%20the%20Santa%20Barbara%20Channel.\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.santaynezchumash.org/chumash-history\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students </em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",

They are frequently seen in Cherry Canyon as well as around the campground area. The island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) lives on six of the eight Channel Islands-San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente. Each island has its own subspecies, and it is found nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> The island fox is the largest native mammal on the Channel Islands, but one of the smallest foxes in the world. It is nearly 20 percent smaller than its closest relative, the mainland gray fox. It's about the size of a house cat, averaging from 12 to 13 inches in height, 23 to 27 inches in length (including tail), and three to six pounds in weight. Similar in appearance to the gray fox, the island fox has a gray back, rufous sides (reddish-brown), and white undersides. There are distinctive black, white, and rufous markings on the face.<br /> <br /> Unlike the nocturnal gray fox, which hunts at night to avoid predators, the island fox is active during daylight hours. As a \"generalist omnivore,\" it eats almost all available foods on the islands, including fruits, vegetation, insects, mice, and crabs.<br /> Mating takes place in February and March, with pupping usually in April or May. Average litter size is two. The adult males play an important role in the raising of young.<br /> <br /> The fossil record for the island fox dates back at least 6,400 years. Since the Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland, scientists currently have two theories on how the fox arrived on the islands. However, due to the scant fossil history, significant questions still remain on the exact mechanism of the initial arrival.<br /> <br /> One theory is that the island fox's ancestor, the gray fox, \"rafted\" to the islands on driftwood, propelled by a storm or currents. During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today, narrowing the channel between the islands and mainland to perhaps just four to five miles across and grouping the northern islands together into one large island we call Santarosae. The other theory is that gray foxes were transported to the northern Channel Islands, like they were to the San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands, by American Indians.<br /> <br /> The foxes adapted to their new island home, evolving into a dwarf, or smaller, form of the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size. As the climate warmed and ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae was divided into the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. Because of a lack of permanent freshwater, the island fox did not inhabit Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> Between 1994 and 1999, island foxes almost disappeared on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands. Predation by nonnative golden eagles caused over a 90 percent decline in the population with just 15 foxes left on Santa Rosa, placing the island fox on the brink of extinction. By 2004, the island fox was listed as a federally endangered species.<br /> <br /> A successful recovery effort included captive breeding of island foxes, relocation of golden eagles, and the reestablishment of bald eagles (a natural competitor of the golden eagle). In all, on Santa Rosa Island nearly 100 foxes were released over a six-year period with the final fox set free in 2008. Today, with the population at close to pre-decline numbers, the recovery effort has been recognized as one of the quickest and most successful recoveries of an endangered species.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Built in the eighteenth century, the Lower House is the oldest extant building on the Hampton property. During the second half of the eighteenth century, the house served as a temporary residence while the Ridgelys were visiting their iron works and later during construction of the Mansion. Around 1745, the original one-story structure was built. Later, it was expanded to include a three-bay-long addition to the north. Later in the eighteenth century, the older portion of the house was moved approximately 10’ south, and a single-story link was built between the two portions. Renovations to the interior of the house were made in the second half of the eighteenth century (circa 1780), possibly to prepare the residence for Captain Charles Ridgely while the Mansion was under construction.<br /> <br /> In 1840, the Lower House was expanded to include a three-bay east wing, and porches were built on the east and south façades of the wing. Other alterations to the Lower House during the 1800s include the addition of the west porch, expansion of the kitchen in the 1800s, and replacement of the link by 1900. Alterations in the twentieth century include installation of electricity and plumbing, and the removal of the west porch.<br /> <br /> The Lower House housed the farm overseer throughout the majority of the nineteenth century, and the farm manager after the abolition of slavery in Maryland in 1864. During the 1900s, the Lower House was known as the Huntsman’s Lodge, and served house guests who attended foxhunting events at Hampton. From 1948 until 1980 when the farm property was acquired by the National Park Service, the Lower House was the residence of John Ridgely, Jr and Jane Rodney.<br /> <br /> The Farm House yard was fenced by 1745, likely to keep livestock at bay from the Farm House, which was, until 1783, the primary Ridgely residence at Hampton. The outlying farm landscape was once lined with fences and hedgerows that defined ‘quarters’ and fields. A portion of the West Farm Field remains and is planted annually by park staff with ryegrass, oats, or corn to evoke its historic agricultural character.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Mount Locust is a location that has been settled on by many different people and under many different flags during its long history of human occupation that dates back as far back as 600 C.E. (Common Era), long before Europeans first stepped foot in the area. There is archeological evidence of two separate American Indian occupations on the site. The first was between 600 and 800 C.E during what is known as the Coles Creek culture and based on archeological findings it seems those who occupied the area lived in small, family-based groupings where they fished, hunted, and gathered, and made pottery much as their ancestors had in the past. The second occupation was a village site in a field southwest of the historic house that consisted of at least seven mostly circular structures that dated back to between 1000 to 1350 C.E during Plaquemine culture.<br /> <br /> Centuries later, John Blommart began what would become known as Mount Locust around 1780, but his stay was short. Blommart’s former business associate, William Ferguson, and his wife Paulina purchased Mount Locust in 1784 and built the Mount Locust historic house, which is now one of the oldest structures still standing in the area. William and Paulina owned and operated the farm until William’s death in 1801. A short time later Paulina married James Chamberlain, an overseer at Mount Locust, and they continued to build the growing plantation.<br /> <br /> Between 1785 and 1820, an increasing number of boatmen known as \"Kaintucks,\" were floating flatboats down the Mississippi River to sell their goods at the markets in Natchez and New Orleans. Without an efficient way to navigate back up the Mississippi River, the boatmen walked north on the Natchez Trace to make their way home. The growing number of travelers compelled the Fergusons to turn their home into a \"stand,\" which was nothing more than a crude inn. The family offered the boatmen a meal of corn mush and milk with meager sleeping arrangements on the porches and grounds. The boatmen paid just 25 cents for the much-needed food and accommodations the stand provided.<br /> <br /> After the invention of the cotton gin in the late 1700's, cotton became a popular cash crop in the South. Mount Locust was no exception as it was a thriving cotton plantation through the early to mid-1800's. During the, \"King Cotton\" era, a number of families were forced to endure the bondage of slavery and forced labor at Mount Locust. Archeologists believe 12 to 16 slave cabins once stood on the property, with four to five people occupying each dwelling. On the west side of Mount Locust, a cemetery holds the remains of 43 enslaved people.<br /> <br /> The end of the plantation system after the Civil War led to a slow decline at Mount Locust. Eventually the National Park Service took over the property in 1938, with the last of the Chamberlain leaving in 1944. Overall, Mount Locust was a home to the Ferguson-Chamberlain family for five generations.<br /> <br /> Visitors are encouraged to tour the grounds of Mount Locust. A short walk behind the house will take you to the enslaved person cemetery, the Ferguson-Chamberlain cemetery, and the brick kiln site, where slaves made the bricks to build parts of the Ferguson-Chamberlain home.",

It consisted of a wooden crib dam, a gate, and a feeder channel. This system diverted Cuyahoga River water to “feed” the canal from Brecksville to Cuyahoga Heights. The concrete Brecksville Diversion Dam was added in 1951-52. About 120 feet north, the newer dam created a dam pool that hid the old wooden structure underwater.<br /> <br /> Dams harm fish habitat, change water temperatures, and alter the natural flow of water and sediment through our waterways. In 2020, the National Park Service and its partners <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/dam-removal.htm\">removed these dams</a> to help wildlife recover and to make our water cleaner. After almost 200 years, the Cuyahoga once again flows freely here. A modern screw pump will help maintain the proper water level in the nearby section of canal that is designated a national historic landmark. This was the best solution for protecting both natural and cultural resources.<br /> <br /> From here, visitors can go north or south on the Towpath Trail. To the north are the remains of Lock 36, one of many water-filled “elevators” that raised or lowered canal boats. Beyond is the Mudcatcher and a view of a bald eagle nest across the river. To the south is a connector trail to Station Road Bridge with restrooms and more exhibits.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Restoring the River. 474 words This wayside graphic panel at the side of a path that heads west from the Towpath Trail towards the river, crosses a feeder channel which takes water from the river to the canal, and rejoins the main trail farther south, to the right as you face the sign. Ahead of you, past the sign, is a concrete structure containing a gate which controls the flow of water through the channel into the canal. Rail tracks run along the river on the far side. A highway crosses the valley here over a multi-arched bridge which towers above you. The graphic panel has photographs of two dams which were built at this location on the river. In upper right is a black and white photograph of water spilling over the 1827 wooden Pinery Dam, located just downstream of the gate into the feeder channel. The larger photograph at the left shows the 1952 Brecksville Canal Diversion Dam, which was built slightly downstream from the older dam, and partially destroyed it, hiding its ruins under water. In both pictures the river flows smoothly over the barriers, with drops of only a few feet. Text on the panel reads, “Removing Barriers. Restoring the Cuyahoga River as a healthy, free-flowing river has many challenges. A major goal is removing dams that block fish migrations and degrade natural wildlife habitats. Here two dams diverted water into this section of the Ohio and Erie Canal, a designated national historic landmark. Park managers must balance protecting natural and cultural resources. Could engineers design a new way to water the canal without a barrier? The 1827 dam fed a canal that grew the national economy. The 1952 one provided water to downstream steel mills. What role will a healthier river play in Ohio’s economy?” In the bottom right is a map of this area, with north pointing to the right. Along the top of the map is the railroad with the river running just below it. The Brecksville-Northfield bridge runs east to west up through the middle of the map, with your current position to the left of it, just east of the river. The gate across the feeder channel is near your position, with the channel itself running to the right to meet the canal, which runs closer to the bottom of the map. The position of the two dams are indicated between the gate and the bridge. The caption reads, “After the dams are removed in 2019, a pump system will keep the most intact portions of the historic canal watered.” At the bottom of the panel are images of a rainbow darter, brightly marked with orange and turquoise, and a smallmouth bass. The caption tells us that these fish are among the species whose populations are expected to improve with the removal of the dams. End of description.",

Flowing year-round from its headwaters near McAlester Mountain and Dee Dee Lakes, the falls is largest during spring runoff, usually in May and June. Both a lower and upper viewpoint are a short walk from the parking lot. The lower viewpoint is wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> What had to happen for Rainbow Falls to roar down into Stehekin Valley? The answer lies in the different types of glaciers that carved these mountains and what was left behind.<br /> <br /> Taking turns during great ice ages during the past 2.6 million years, ice from both a massive continental glaciers stretching from an ice sheet in Canada and from smaller local valley glaciers shaped the mountains, valleys, and what became Lake Chelan. The ice from the continental ice sheet entered Stehekin Valley by flowing down through Rainbow Creek Valley above you. This massive ice sheet in Stehekin Valley cut more deeply than glaciers in smaller tributaries and as a result, tributaries like Rainbow Creek were left as hanging valleys.<br /> <br /> As the ice melted away, ancient Rainbow Creek became blocked by massive leftover boulders and gravel from the lobe of the continental ice sheet. The creek blindly cut through the rubble before it tumbled over the edge of a hanging valley to free fall to the Stehekin Valley floor, creating the waterfall we see today.",

The trail begins as a six-foot-wide compacted dirt path near the Upper Campground and narrows to a single path trail as it meanders through the rocky canyon, coyote bush and other vegetation line both sides of the trail. Bright white chalky sedimentary rock outcroppings mark the grass covered hillsides. Before leaving the canyon and heading up the hillside, turn off the trail and descend into the rocky canyon bottom to explore the ravine where low growing, rock loving plants cling to the cliffs edges. While on the trail, steeply ascend the hillside to the top of the canyon. Up top there are spectacular views of the surrounding ocean, the Montanon Ridge, and Scorpion Canyon below. The trail continues to the plateau above Scorpion Canyon and eventually descends into the mouth of the canyon at Scorpion Anchorage.",

            "bodyText": "<h4>You have entered the Wao Akua— the realm of the gods.</h4> Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park contains many of Hawai‘i’s most precious resources. For native Hawaiians, the park also envelops many of their wahi la‘a (sacred sites), their ‘āina hānau (birth lands) and ‘āina waiwai (subsistence lands. These areas incorporate not just the physical landscape and its inhabitants, but also the spiritual entities that are believed to comprise and surround them—the akua (gods) and the ‘aumakua (guardian ancestors). Early Hawaiians utilized two primary land boundary systems—one, which partitioned an island into zones of spiritual signifcance and the other, which divided it and its resources geographically amongst the chiefs and commoners. Crafted generations ago, these two systems acted as a means of balancing an island’s spiritual, natural, and human resources in perpetuity. Since subsistence resources were plentiful in some areas while limited in others, it was the kuleana (responsibility) of the residents to maintain them. As long as they were cared for, life was sustained.<br /> <br /> The ahuapua‘a (land division) boundary system divides an island into vertical land sections that stretch from mauka (mountains) to makai (oceans). Visible landmarks, like mountain peaks, ridges, or ahu (rock cairns), are most often used to delineate the boundaries. Kīpukapuaulu resides in the ‘āina ʻili (smaller land parcel) of Keauhou within the ahupua‘a of Kapāpala. The treasured habitat of Kīpukapuaulu is also enveloped within the Wao Akua, the sacred realm of the gods. It is just one of seven (Kuahiwi, Kualono, Wao ma‘ukele, Wao Akua, Wao kanaka, Kula, Kahakai) such spiritually signifcant zones that horizontally divides an island. The Wao Akua region is revered for its ancient trees and wealthy seed sources. Where the akua and ‘aumakua reside, life fourishes—life that will, inturn, permeate much of the surrounding lands. Kīpukapuaulu is that wellspring of life supported by the akua and ‘aumakua that embody it.",

            "audioDescription": "\"Blackburn School Visitor Center. 3 Â¾ minutes.<br />The one-story, red and white painted wood Blackburn School is the first building at the far southern end of the town at Kennecott. <br />Note a wheelchair accessible ramp to the north of a 16-foot (5 m) wide wooden deck outside the west side of the building, ringed with a three and a half-foot (1.1 m) tall wooden railing, and an ADA accessible outhouse down a short ramp to the south. Note this same ramp also continues south, linking the visitor center to the shuttle bus turnaround.<br />A three-foot (1 m) tall, cast bronze, tactile, topographical model of the town sits in the middle of the deck. Measuring about five feet (1.25 m) wide by three-feet (1 m) deep, feel the locations of all the buildings and surrounding topography of the town. <br />A visual map of the town just below the touchable exhibit show the various buildings in different shades of red, orange, yellow, white, and gray. These indicate which are National Park Service structures versus private property, and which structures are open to the public. Text at the left of the map reads:<br /><br />Explore Kennecott Mill Town<br />A remarkable lode of copper ore near this very spot was discovered by American prospectors in 1900. Workers then developed the camp, mill, mines, and railway over the next decade. Kennecott Mines went into regular production in 1911, and proved hugely profitable. The mines were tapped out and closed in 1938.<br />Today, Kennecott mill town is the best preserved example of early 20th century copper mining technology in the country. It is also a thriving community and a gateway to an immense wilderness.<br /><br />Behind and to the right of the outdoor model, a single wood door leads inside the school from the outside deck. <br />Inside at the left, a black-and-white photograph fills the bottom of a four-foot (1.25 m) tall by three-foot (1 m) wide angled metal display panel on the floor. A woman in the center, dressed in a long sleeve white, high-collar shirt and floor-length black skirt, stands behind a couple rows of boys and girls of various ages, from six years old to teenagers. Information at the top of the panel tells us that the Blackburn School was built in 1913, moved to Kennecott circa 1915, and restored between 2002 and 2005. Beside a copy of a hand-written inventory of supplies and books at the school, text continues:<br /><br />Moving with the boom and bust of mining towns<br />In 1913, the Kennecott Copper Corporation supplied materials to construct this building in the tiny community of Blackburn. Located along the railway between Kennecott and the future town of McCarthy, Blackburn had grown up as prospectors moved into the valley.<br />By 1915, however, Blackburn was mostly empty-its spring dried up and everyone moved to McCarthy, which was booming as a stop-over on the way to the Chisana gold fields. Kennecott was also booming, so the Corporation moved this building up to its present location on a flatcar. It served as a school for workers' children until the end of the 1921-1922 school year, when the student population had grown again and classes moved to the new and larger Two Room School. The Old School was converted to storage.<br /><br />Inside the School, staff and additional exhibits answer questions about the backcountry, front country trails, and the landmark, and more maps, books, and gifts are available for sale in the Alaska Geographic bookstore.<br />\"<br />",

People shape the view as they make changes in the park and surrounding areas.An atmosphere altered by pollution affects both how far you can see, and in the long term, life itself in these parks. What will you- or your children- see from here in the future?A photo at the top of the granite rock; handrails create a safe walkway across the gray glossy rock. Visitors take in the eagle eye view of the mountain range beyond. The caption reads,The Top of the Trail TodayThe text reads,Climbing a Granite DomeThis trail climbs over 350 steps to the top, and an elevation of 6,725 feet (2050 m). Just a few steps up, the vista of the High Sierra peaks (above) first reveal itself. A black and white photo of Moro Rock near the top, with wooden stairs and long handrails running up the dome. Another black and white photo shows concrete steps with metal handrails circling a large rock on the way to the top. The caption reads, Yesterday's trail The first stairs were built in 1917 of wood. Concrete steps replace them in 1931, making them safer and blending them in with the granite rock.Please note, about 60 stair steps up the trail is a broad landing with strongly scented plants on either side called mountain misery.Exhibit Two: This orientation panel shows photos and a timeline of events. A black and white photo from September 7, 1936, of a hiker, gazing east from the top of Moro Rock. He leans on two walking poles and is wearing a stiff, wide brimmed hat, long pants and a jacket with shirt and tie. Near him is a stone stairway cut into the granite rock, a flagpole with two flags, and a metal handrail.The text reads,A High PointThe text explains that early travelers used ropes to scale this dome. Today's staircases make the trip easier, but it is still an effort to gain the top. From the 6,725 feet summit, on a clear day, you can see more than 150 miles. A timeline provides key dates, text and some related photos (starting as black and white and ending in color):1858. A bearded man, Hale Tharp, who was led by two young Native Americans to explore Moro Rock. 1860s. A dark horse with a spotted rump. This rock may have been named for a horse that grazed nearby. It may also come from \"moro\", the Spanish word for spotted animals or dark rocks.1890. Just two weeks after the creation of Sequoia National Park, Moro Rock gains protection when Congress enlarges park boundaries. 1903. A uniformed man, Buffalo Soldier Capt. Charles Young, and his regiment complete Moro Rock Road. 1913. Old model T style cars parked on dirt, under trees. Automobiles become more common at Moro Rock. 1915. The Mather Mountain Party begins its historic trip across the Sierra with a climb up Moro Rock. During the trip, the idea of a national park service is born.1917. A woman poses at the bottom of a new wooden staircase that leads up the dome's northern ridge. 1921. About twenty male Park rangers pose on top of Moro Rock, along with some other hikers, including several women and children. A large U.S. flag rises from the peak.1926. Congress enlarges Sequoia National Park to include the Great Western Divide, whose peaks are visible to the east. 1931. Workers remove the deteriorating wooden staircase and build a stone stairway that fits neatly into existing crevices in the rock.1933. New steps at the bottom of the stairway now complete the trail from the parking area to the dome's top. 1940s. About 50 male WW II soldiers pose for a photo while resting on top of Moro rock 1959. Encircled by a chain railing, a few men and women look out over Giant Forest.1960s. A new metal handrail along the entire stairway provides more protection from falls. 1975. Zigzagging white lightning cuts through a blue sky. The first recorded lightning fatality occurs at Moro Rock. 1978. Due to the way it blends almost invisibly into the granite contours, Moro Rock Stairway is added to the National Register of Historic Places. 1995 to 2005. Three people fall from the rock to their deaths in separate incidents. Always stay on the trail and within the railings.2005. A graph shows a cross section of earth and sky, with the Moro rock in the center at the bottom. A graph key represents the darkness in a spectrum of colors: purple represents the darkest; green is medium bright; and red is the brightest. Above Moro rock, the sky is dark blue and purple. On either side of the rock, the sky is dark high above the ground, but moves down through the rainbow, as it nears the ground, reaching red at a few points.

The length of the second ‘gate’ suggests use for the pack horses loaded with incoming trading goods and outgoing deer skins.<br /> <br /> Most trading posts of this era had a building for trading, including merchandise storage and a warehouse for storing the deer skins prior to shipment. Excavations at the site revealed Indian construction techniques (wattle and daub) consistent with the practice of using Indian labor.

During the winter, snowshoers and crosscountry skiers can still use the closed road. <br /> <br /> Westside Road is one mile from the Nisqually Entrance, in the southwest corner of the park. Westside Road was originally envisioned as part of an “around-the-mountain” network of roads encircling Mount Rainier but was never completed. Frequent flooding and debris flows by Tahoma Creek closed all but the first three miles of the road to vehicles. There is a small parking area at Dry Creek at the end of this three-mile section. From Dry Creek, the gravel road climbs to Round Pass, descends into the South Puyallup River Valley, then climbs to Klapatche Point, where the road terminates. From Dry Creek to Klapatche Pass, the road is 9.25 miles long with an elevation change of approximately 2,100 feet. Please note that due to danger from rock fall, vehicles must park south of the barricade at Dry Creek. Hikers and bicyclists should travel through the area with caution and avoid lingering in the hazard zone. There are no restroom facilities along Westside Road. The closest comfort station is at Kautz Creek, approximately 5.5 miles from the Dry Creek parking lot on route to Longmire. Westside Road closes during the winter at the Nisqually to Longmire road junction.<br /> <br /> <b>Bicycling</b><br /> Westside Road is one of only two roads closed to vehicles that remains open to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm\">bicycling</a>. The other former road open to bicycling is the Carbon River Trail, in the northwest corner of the park. Many mountain bikers park at Dry Creek and bike to various trailheads along the road, or to the road’s terminus at Klapatche Point. Only E-bikes possessing a motor of less than 750 watts (1 h.p) on which the motor only assists with pedal propulsion are permitted. Bicycles are not allowed on any trails. All trailheads along the road have bicycle racks.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Several trails branch off of Westside Road. <br /> <br /> <b>Lake George & Gobbler’s Knob Trail</b> begins at <b>Round Pass</b>, 3.8 miles from Dry Creek. The trailhead is to the west side of the pass next to a wide pullout. The hike to Lake George is easy with a gradual incline over 0.8 miles through the forest. Lake George is a pristine mountain lake nestled in the northwest shoulder of Mount Wow. There is a backcountry campsite and restroom facility. Lake George Cabin is one of the park’s historic patrol cabins. Continue an additional one mile to reach Gobblers Knob Fire Lookout, one the park’s four historic fire lookouts. The final stretch of the trail is very steep, with rocky switchbacks to reach the lookout, which has spectacular views of Mount Rainier’s southwestern slopes and the Tahoma and Puyallup Glaciers. Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and the Olympic Mountains can be spotted on clear days.<br /> <br /> Round Pass is also the location of the <b>Marine Memorial</b>, which remembers the death of 32 U.S. Marines that died when their plane crashed into the South Tahoma glacier on Mount Rainier on December 10, 1946.<br /> <br /> On the north side of Round Pass a 0.5-mile trail provides a short cut down to the <b>South Puyallup Trailhead</b>, or continue following Westside Road 1.2 miles (approximately 4.2 miles from Dry Creek). The <b>South Puyallup Trail</b> follows the South Puyallup River valley through forest to a backcountry campsite, then connects to the Wonderland Trail after 1.6 miles.<br /> <br /> Continue about three miles on Westside Road from the South Puyallup River trailhead, or approximately 7.2 miles from the Dry Creek parking area, to the <b>St. Andrews Creek Trailhead</b>. The trail starts on the right just past a rock bridge over St. Andrews Creek. On the left side of the bridge a short 0.3 mile loop trail leads to <b>Denman Falls</b> viewpoint. The historic St. Andrews Cabin is near the start of the St. Andrews Trail, before the trail climbs 2.6 miles up a ridge with long switchbacks up to the subalpine meadows of Klapatche Park and connects to the Wonderland Trail.<br /> <br /> Climb the final 1.2 miles (9.2 miles from Westside Road) to the road’s terminus at <b>Klapatche Point</b>, which is on the western border of the park. Look south back towards Round Pass or over the rolling hills to the west. <b>North Puyallup Trail</b> starts from Klapatche Point and follows a forested ridgeline east to connect to the Wonderland Trail at the North Puyallup River camp.</p>",

It remembers 32 U.S. Marines that died when their plane crashed into the South Tahoma Glacier on December 10, 1946. Due to the hazardous conditions of the crash location, their remains were never recovered. In 1946, it was the worst accident, in numbers killed aboard an aircraft, in United States aviation history and remains Mount Rainier’s greatest tragedy. The bronze plaque bears the names of the Marines. In the mid 1990s, the road to Round Pass washed out, making the area inaccessible to vehicles. In 1999, a duplicate of the Marine Memorial was placed in Veterans Memorial Park in Enumclaw, WA.  </p>",

Located on the backside of the park off Highway 246 on Kinard Road the pond can be a amazing place to enjoy nature. <br /> <br /> Hiking can be done year round. The Fisherman's Trail travels around the park, providing access to the lake at several points. While traveling this trail be wary of stinging and biting insects and snakes.<br /> <br /> The Star Fort Pond is home to many species of birds, especially aquatic birds. While many of these birds, such as great blue herons, are year round residents other, such as the ruddy duck, are seasonal. <br /> <br /> The fishing season at the Star Fort Pond is limited from April through October. Visitors may cast a line on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Fishing can be done from the bank, the fishing pier, or from a boat. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nisi/planyourvisit/fishing.htm\">fishing page</a> to learn more about the rules and regulations. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>By the 1890s, Union veterans, civic leaders, and community members desired to preserve the remnants of the Defenses of Washington. The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",
            "audioDescription": "(436 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />Two fifty-foot tall oak trees stand along the lower south end of the park at street level by 13th Street. The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets about two hundred yards to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front, to the north of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face. The bunker measures sixty feet across and twenty feet deep. The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with three-inch-wide log-like vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons on wheels, set on cement platforms and directed out to the north. Five additional cement platforms are set on about three-foot tall grass mounds that lead up to the cement wall.<br />About six feet left of the left cannon, sitting on grass just beyond the cement bunker wall is a stone marker with a bronze plaque displayed on its face. The stone is about five feet tall, four feet wide, and two feet deep. The plaque measures about one and a half feet high by two feet wide. It features a bas-relief and is engraved across the top to read:<br />LINCOLN UNDER FIRE AT FORT STEVENS<br />July 12, 1864<br />The image below is a bas-relief of a man in the center with top hat and long suit coat tending to a wounded man on the right falling with his head thrown back. Another man tries to pull the man in top hat away from the left. A man in the lower left corner watches on while holding a staff.<br />Back towards the flagpole is another bas-relief, atop a cement block base. It features the Fort Stevens design as viewed from above, detailing its walls, borders, bunkers and cannon platforms.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery.<br />To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building.<br />Directly back seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones.

Text written underneath reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1930<br />Text written on the left side of the side describes the formation of Battleground National Cemetery:<br />During the late evening of July 12, 1864, 4o Union soldiers that perished while defending Washington, DC from a two-day Confederate attack) known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) were laid to rest here in what was once an apple orchard. President Abraham Lincoln, who attended the burial ceremony, dedicated the land as hallowed ground, making Battleground National Cemetery one of America's smallest national cemeteries.<br />Between the 1870s and early 1900s a Superintendent's Lodge, rostrum, flagpole, and regimental monuments were added to the cemetery to pay tribute to the brave men who sacrificed all to preserve this nation and its capital city. In addition to the fallen soldiers, the cemetery also holds the remains of the wife and three children of Augustus Armbrecht, the original superintendent of the cemetery.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

            "audioDescription": "(497 words) Fort DeRussy is located in Rock Creek Park in northwest Washington, DC, bordered by Military Road NW to the south, Oregon Avenue to the west, and Rock Creek to the east. From the northeast corner of the intersection of Oregon Avenue and Military Road, travel two hundred fifty feet north on the east side of Oregon Avenue, along a cement paved path into the edge of a forest. A four by three-foot wayside titled Fort De Russy sits at the right side of the path. Follow the path around the wayside to the right and proceed one-hundred twenty feet east at a slight incline into the forest to a fork in the road with a dirt path to the left. Follow the dirt path four hundred thirty feet where two waysides sit to the left of the path. The left wayside is three by two feet and titled in the top left corner: Fort DeRussy. The sign features an image of men in military dress standing in a circular bunker around a cannon lowered in the circle and on a wheeled turret. Six men stand atop a four-foot-tall wall that encircles the cannon. Eight other men stand within the lowered cannon space. Text below describes the cannon and Fort DeRussy: Built in 1861 to protect the Rock Creek Valley during the Civil War, Fort DeRussy's cannon fired a total of 109 projectiles into the northern countryside as 12,000-15,000 Confederate soldiers attacked the city under the command of Confederate General Jubal Anderson Early on July 11-12, 1864. During this two day battle (known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) Fort DeRussy aided the surrounding forts by providing the main suppressive fire to ensure a Union victory on the battlefield. The largest piece of armament which Fort DeRussy utilized was the 100-Pound Parrott Rifle. This cannon, shown above at nearby Fort Totten, could hurl 100 pound projectiles several miles into the Maryland countryside. During the Battle of Fort Stevens, Fort DeRussy halted the Confederate advance into the city by firing this deadly and accurate cannon a total of 28 times. The top right corner features a black and white photograph of a man standing at attention in a plain coat, pants and boots with a strap across his chest and holding a rifle and bayonet at his right side. Text beneath him reads: Private Samuel Strawser, a member of the 151st Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was stationed at Fort DeRussy during the Battle of Fort Stevens. A black and white oval photograph in the bottom right shows a bearded man in a hat, suit and vest. Text to his right reads: \"On the right was Rock Creek running through a deep ravine which had been rendered impassable...every appliance of science and unlimited means had been used to render the fortifications around Washington as strong as possible\"<br />General Jubal Anderson Early Commander of Confederate forces during the Battle of Fort Stevens You can download a podcast of Fort DeRussy at www.nps.gov/rocr END OF DESCRIPTION",

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front to the east of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four-feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with six three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />Set at the low-end corner of the block at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets is a four by three-foot wayside.

Jubal Early with his force of 15,000 soldiers. Defended by a meager force of convalescents, quartermaster employees and 100 day militia volunteers, Fort Stevens held back an attack by Confederate skirmishers on July 11. Reinforcements from the Union 6th and 19th Corps on the second day checked and turned back the only Confederate threat against Washington, DC, during the war. Late in the afternoon of July 12, President Abraham Lincoln was exposed to Confederate fire while observing this battle where approximately 900 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing.<br />Nearby Battleground Cemetery, which was dedicated by President Lincoln soon after the battle, contains the graves of 40 Union soldiers who died in defense of Fort Stevens.<br />To the right is a map of the top corner of Washington, DC, showing the locations of Civil War forts.

Their plateau locations enabled them to lay down a withering cross-fire between them. To deter the possible advance of the enemy through the wooded hills surrounding the sites, civilian construction gangs cleared paths which could be raked from the guns of the forts.</p> <p>Contruction work for Fort Greble was started in September 1861 but was not completed until the second half of 1864. Fort Greble was never called upon to play a major role in the war, but did provide training ground for various units prior to their commitment in many cases of battle. The irregular, octagonal shape of Fort Greble was built to conform to the terrain and the areas it defended.</p> <p>When Congress ordered the closing of the defenses, Fort Greble was offered to Thomas W.

It is five feet long, three feet wide, and two feet tall and features a three by one-foot bronze plaque set on its top surface.<br />Raised text on the plaque reads:<br />The Civil War Defenses of Washington<br />Fort Reno<br />The site of this fort was selected in August, 1861.

The park also features a baseball field, tennis courts, and large grassy field areas.<br />As you face the marker, three water towers stand about two hundred yards in the distance. The tower furthest to the right is about three hundred feet tall and resembles a castle, with its rounded stone face, pointed top, and a smaller stairwell tower connected to its left side. The two towers to the left are made of red brick and have flat rooftops.<br />To the right of the stone marker, a gravel and dirt road leads into a grass field area and through the middle of the park.<br />",

The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill.

The towpath splits to the right while the road splits to the left. Follow the gravel towpath for one mile. You will come to a large field area and the towpath will split into four directions.

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "(270 words) Battleground National Cemetery is located in the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, DC. The one-acre park sits on the east side of Georgia avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south. The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery. To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building. On the west-facing side of the building at its left corner and to the left of the window, sits a one by three-foot bronze plaque. Engraved at the top it reads: ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN AT THE DEDICATION OF THE GETTYSBURG NATIONAL CEMETERY NOVEMBER 19, 1863. Text of the Gettysburg address is in the main content. Directly back seventy feet to the east from the Cemetery entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one one-foot tall marble headstones. Set behind is a thirty-foot wide white marble rostrum with eight columns. END OF DESCRIPTION",

Built by the Army Corps of Engineers from 1853 to 1863, it was a monumental engineering achievement. Its designer, Army Engineer Montgomery C. Meigs, supervised the project until 1861, when he was appointed Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. The construction and successful operation of the Washington Aqueduct symbolizes the Army Corps of Engineers importance in the field of public works and reflects the military influence on life in antebellum America. The Washington Aqueduct, constructed over 150 years ago, still supplies the nation's capital with public water today.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s, the growing population of Washington and the memory of two devastating fires forced Congress to acknowledge that the nation's capital required more than wells and springs to provide its water. In 1853, Congress commissioned a public water system. One year later, construction of the Washington Aqueduct began in Great Falls, Maryland. Meig's plan was to divert the water from the Potomac River into a large, underground conduit. Gravity, and later pumping stations, directed water through the conduit to reservoirs where it could then be pumped into the city's pipelines.<br /> <br /> To accomplish this feat, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a masonry dam across the Potomac, a control gatehouse at Great Falls, a twelve-mile conduit, eleven tunnels, six bridges, several pipelines, and two reservoirs. By 1863, the Corps had completed three resevoirs. Wagons and boats on the C&O Canal brought supplies like cast iron, sand, concrete, brick, and Seneca sandstone to the construction sites. The initial dam reached halfway across the river. In 1890, in order to meet the District's increasing demand for water, it was extended to the Virginia side. Meigs designed the dam to be anchored to the river bottom, not to block its flow but to divert it.<br /> <br /> Although no longer in service, the first gatehouse still stands next to the historic Great Falls Tavern along the C&O Canal in Maryland. Inside was a system of 20 small cast iron slide gates that filtered the largest debris from the water.<br /> <br /> The conduit stretches almost twelve miles downriver from the intake at Great Falls to the Georgetown Reservoir. The underground, circular tube, built of brick, stone, and mortar, is 9 feet in diameter. A road ran parallel to the conduit to facilitate cleaning, repairs and inspections. The road was originally named Conduit Road; today it is MacArthur Boulevard.<br /> <br /> As part of the original Washington Aqueduct water system, workers constructed six bridges to carry the conduit over streams and creeks. Only three, Bridge #3, Cabin John Bridge (also called Union Arch Bridge) and Rock Creek Bridge, remain today. Cabin John Bridge, built of granite and sandstone, held the record as the world's longest masonry arch structure (220 feet) for 40 years. Today, Rock Creek Bridge’s 200-foot arch is still one of the longest unsupported metal pipe arches in the world. <br /> <br /> Aqueduct water spilled into two reservoirs, Dalecarlia Reservoir at the District line and the Georgetown Reservoir two miles downriver. By allowing the murky river water to stand in these reservoirs, debris settles to the bottom before distribution throughout the city. However, the process never successfully removed all of the sediment and thus, Washington City's public water had a muddy-yellowish color until the installation of a rapid-sand filtration system in 1928. Today both reservoirs have been completely modernized.<br /> <br /> Several inscriptions at various places honor the engineers who designed and built the Aqueduct. Meigs had his own name and his assistant’s name, Alfred L. Rives, engraved on the Cabin John Bridge. When Rives quit the US Army to join the Confederate Army in 1861, Meigs replaced his name with the Latin phrase <i>Esto Perpetua</i>, or “Let It Stand Forever.\" After former US Secretary of War Jefferson Davis became the president of the Confederacy, his name was removed from the bridge as well. In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt ordered it be re-engraved.<br /> <br /> While building the Washington Aqueduct, Meigs was also Chief Engineer for the extensions and new dome of the U.S. Capitol, and the enlargement of the General Post Office Building. Both of these buildings are now National Historic Landmarks. After his work with the new aqueduct, Meigs served as Quartermaster General of the United States Army, both during and after the Civil War. During this tenure, he designed the Pension Bureau building, now the National Building Museum (also a National Historic Landmark). During the Civil War, Meigs helped establish Arlington National Cemetery, where he is buried.<br /> <br /> In the twentieth century, the aqueduct’s capacity was expanded many times. As of 2017, it produces 300 million gallons of filtered water per day, has a storage capacity of 44 million gallons, and serves 1.1 million customers. The aqueduct provides public water for all of Washington, DC, Arlington County, and Falls Church City in Virginia. The continual effectiveness of the historic water system is a testament to Meig’s design and the professional work of the Army Corps of Engineers who continue to operate it today. A portion of the aqueduct runs through the Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, where you can see the originial engineer's house and gatehouse. </span></span></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"> </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Sources:<br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">\"The Washington Aqueduct System.\"</span> National Park Service.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Ways, Harry C. <em>Washinton Aqueduct: 1852-1992.</em> US Army Corps of Engineers.</span></span></span></p>   <p> </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=6d960253-5f0c-4d15-a2a2-84735ea482f2\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmark Nomination</span></a> of the Washington Aqueduct.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</span></a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

A gravel access trail leaves from the corner of the lot toward lock 44 and lockhouse 44. Follow it South for 190 feet. On your right will be a set of two locks parallel to each other. Two wooden pedestrian bridges span the locks to the towpath and the lockhouse on the other side. The bridges have wooden railings. After going over the first bridge continue straight for about 10 feet to reach the second bridge. About five feet past the second bridge is the towpath, which is parallel to the locks. The lock walls are made of stone blocks. Four walls create two lock chambers that are about ten feet deep each. At the upstream and downstream entrance to the locks are wooden swing gates. Opposite the lock, on the other side of the towpath is lockhouse 44. The house sits parallel to the towpath with the front facing you. The house has two sections. A two-story section with a rectangular base and a one-story section with a square base. The two sections are connected, with the one-story section on the left and the two-story section on the right. The larger, two-story section has the front door and nine windows, two windows on either side of the door and five above. A small over hang sits over the front door. The smaller, one-story section has a door and a window. The building is made of white painted planks.",

Dams create a large barrier that restricts or stops the flow of water, which allows it to be used for irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigation. Dam 3, built in 1799, was meant to serve the armory at Harpers Ferry. It was built using the natural rocks of the Potomac River which created a unique zig-zag structure. Unfortunately, the dam proved ineffective. It was rebuilt in 1820, and then in 1832 the infrastructure of dam was used by the C&O Canal to build its Dam No. 3, which watered the Canal down to Seneca.",

From the Maryland Heights Trail parking lot turn left onto Harpers Ferry Road. Walk 280 feet and then turn right onto a stone staircase. The staircase has a stone wall on the right side and a metal railing on the left. At the bottom of the staircase turn left onto a wooden bridge that spans the canal. The bridge has wooden railings and ends in a staircase. Once down the staircase you are on the towpath. Turn right, or Northwest, onto the towpath. After 1.1 miles the dam will appear on the left. At a half a mile you will pass lock 34 and a water pump. Water availability dependent on conditions and time of year. At 1 mile you will pass lock 35. At 1.1 miles the Dam 3 will be in the Potomac River on the left. You can see the river through a lightly forested area. Looking at the river you can see a set of zig-zagging rocks stretching to the opposite bank. Little else remains of the original structure.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The U.S. Immigration Station is located in Angel Island State Park on Angel Island, the largest island in California's San Francisco Bay. While the island is the home of 740 acres of pristine parkland, including beautiful beaches, picnic areas and hiking trails, it is most famous for its rich history.<br />  </p> <p>In 1850, President Millard Fillmore declared Angel Island a military reserve and during the Civil War, the island was fortified to defend San Francisco Bay from potential attack by Confederate forces. Angel Island continued to be an active military installation through World War II. In 1905, the War Department transferred 20 acres of land on the island to the Department of Commerce and Labor for the establishment of an immigrant station. While the exact number is unknown, estimates suggest that between 1910 and 1940, the station processed up to one million Asian and other immigrants, including 250,000 Chinese and 150,00 Japanese, earning it a reputation as the \"Ellis Island of the West.\" Having served as the point of entry to the United States for Asia, Angel Island remains an important place for Asian Americans whose heritage and legacy are deeply rooted in the history of the U.S. Immigration Station.<br />  </p> <p>Before the 1800s, there was little immigration from Asia to the U.S. During the 19th century. However, the U.S. experienced mass migrations of immigrants from several Asian countries, particularly China. Multiple factors triggered this wave of immigration. In 1848, gold was discovered in California and throughout the 1850s, Chinese immigrants were recruited as a major source of labor for the U.S. gold mines. Many Chinese immigrants also came to the U.S. during this period to escape the Taiping Rebellion, a large-scale civil war that encompassed most of Southern China. In the 1860s, Chinese workers were recruited in large numbers from both China and the U.S. western mining industry to help build the Central Pacific Railroad's portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. During this time, Chinese laborers were also hired by the agricultural industry in California, which was suffering from severe manpower shortages and needed skilled farm workers.</p>   <p>By the 1870s, the U.S. economy was in a post war decline. The country experienced a series of economic crises starting with the Panic of 1873. The deflation and depression that followed caused wage levels to fall and many Americans to lose their jobs. In the West white laborers, many of them from the American South, found themselves competing for scarce jobs with Chinese immigrants who would work for lower wages. This led to rising resentment among the white population. Political and labor leaders began to use Chinese immigrants as scapegoats, blaming them for declining wages and high unemployment, and accusing them of being morally corrupt.<br /> <br /> In response to economic fears, primarily in California, the U.S. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which restricted Chinese immigration. The Act barred Chinese \"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\" from entering the U.S. for 10 years and forbade Chinese immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens. Nonlaborers from exempted classes – diplomats, travelers, merchants, students, ministers, and children of U.S. citizens – could immigrate to the United States after receiving a certification from the Chinese government. The Chinese Exclusion Act marked the first time the U.S. Congress restricted an immigrant group on the basis of race. Congress passed other exclusionary laws aimed at Chinese immigrants between 1888 and 1902, effectively reducing the number of Chinese entering the U.S.<br />  </p> <p>After passage of the various Chinese exclusionary laws, Japanese immigrants became increasingly sought after by American businesses. Because of this, the number of Japanese immigrating to the U.S., particularly to the West Coast, increased rapidly. The previous animosity toward Chinese laborers was transferred to Japanese immigrants. With anti-Japanese sentiment rising in California, the U.S. and Japan came to a \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" in 1907. Under the Agreement, Japan voluntarily limited the immigration of Japanese laborers and the U.S. permitted the immigration of spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the U.S. By 1910, the Japanese had begun to make their presence felt in the agricultural economy of the West Coast. In a letter from Governor William D. Stephens of California to Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby dated June 19, 1920, the Governor stated that \"The Japanese...have gradually developed to control, many of our important agricultural industries\" and described the presence of the Japanese in California as \"an even more serious problem than Chinese immigration.\"</p>   <p>San Francisco, California was a primary point of entry for Asians immigrating to the U.S., and new arrivals were housed in quarters located at the Pacific Mail Steamship Company docks on the San Francisco waterfront. The facilities at the docks, however, proved to be inadequate and unsanitary. A study authorized in 1904, recommended construction of an immigration station on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay. In 1905, the War Department transferred 20 acres of land on the island to the Department of Labor and Commerce for the construction of the new station. Angel Island was an ideal location for an immigration station due to its isolation from the mainland. Its location allowed for greater control over immigrant entry to the U.S., prevented immigrants on the island from communicating with immigrants on the mainland, and slowed the introduction of new or deadly diseases to the general population. The new Immigration Station opened on January 21, 1910 and became the major port of entry to the U.S. for Asians and other immigrants coming from the west.<br />  </p> <p>The Immigration Station opened for partial operation on the northern neck of the island, later called China Cove. Architect Walter J. Mathews designed the Station compound to include an administration building, hospital, powerhouse, wharf, and an enclosed detention center with an outdoor area and guard tower. Since many Chinese citizens made multiple efforts to immigrate under the exempt categories in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, immigration officials at the station had to determine who had legitimate exemption documentation before allowing them entry into the United States.<br />  </p> <p>When a ship arrived in San Francisco Bay, immigration officers boarded the ship to inspect each passenger's documents. Those who held proper documentation gained almost immediate entry to the United States, while those with questionable documents had to ride a ferry to Angel Island for further examination. Once they were on the island, immigration officials separated the immigrants by their race and sex, regardless of familial bonds, except for children under 12 years old who could stay with their mothers during their quarantine period. Each newly arrived immigrant received a full medical examination at the station hospital. If an examiner found evidence of a disease, the infected immigrant could not enter the U.S.</p>   <p>After their medical examination, healthy immigrants detained on the island awaited an immigration hearing conducted by two immigration inspectors, a stenographer, and a translator. These hearings functioned more like interrogations, as immigration officials tried to expose fraudulent claims by asking about the minute details of a person's life. Often these proceedings could take days, months, or in some instances, several years.<br />  </p> <p>Thousands of immigrants detained on Angel Island endured the station's prison-like environment. Detainees resided in confined dormitories with locked doors, unable to leave without the supervision of an escort guard. Immigration officers inspected all incoming and outgoing letters, packages, and other communications from detainees and they could not receive visitors until after their cases cleared. To pass the time, some men read books or listened to records in their native languages, while women often knitted or sewed. Sometimes guards allowed women and children to stroll around the grounds. Only 10 months after immigrants began residing in the men's detention barracks, poems began to appear on the walls. Carved into the unfinished wooden walls with the ends of ink brushes, these poems often expressed Chinese immigrants' frustration, resentment, or unhappiness over their experience. Angel Island's Immigration Station continued to operate in this manner until a fire burned the administration building on August 12, 1940.</p>   <p>A few months later, on November 5, 1940, the Immigration Station relocated to a landlocked base in San Francisco. After the relocation, the former Immigration Station was returned to the U.S. Army. In 1946, the Army decommissioned the military installations and reduced its presence on the island. In 1955, the State of California purchased 37 acres on the island, forming Angel Island State Park. When the U.S. Military finally left in 1962, they turned the remaining federal land over to the state to become part of the park. California largely neglected the property until 1970, when Alexander Weiss, a State park ranger, discovered the poems carved on the walls of the detention barracks. Immigrants had left very few first-hand accounts detailing their experiences at the Immigration Station, which gives greater value and significance to the discovery of the Chinese poems on Angel Island. These poems carved into the walls remain as a memorial to all of those who passed through the island's harsh detention barracks on their journey to a new life in the U.S.<br />  </p> <p>Today, Angel Island State Park administers the remaining buildings of the Island's original West Garrison post, which date back to the 1860s, and the East Garrison (Fort McDowell). The U.S. Immigration Station Barracks Museum administers what remains of the station. Visitors to the museum are able to explore the grounds of Angel Island's U.S. Immigration Station. Guided tours of the detention barracks are available, which include exhibits highlighting historic photographs, artifacts, and a re-creation of immigrant living quarters and interrogation rooms. Tours of the detention barracks also provide visitors with the opportunity to view the hundreds of poems carved into the wooden walls of the barracks. Ayala Cove, the Island's main point of entry and former location of the U.S. Quarantine Station, houses the Park Headquarters and the main Visitor Center. Angel Island's history encourages all visitors to appreciate the great lengths many immigrants took in order to live in, or become citizens of, the United States.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Immigration Station, Angel Island, a<strong> National Historic Landmark</strong>, is located in Angel Island State Park, on Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay, CA. Additional information is available on the <a href=\"http://www.aiisf.org/visit\">Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation</a> website.<br /> <br /> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-0b1a760f-7fff-6903-5563-443a7000fe84\">Discover more history and culture by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelbayareawwii/index.htm\">World War II in San Francisco Bay Area travel itinerary.</a></b><br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to restore the Angel Island Immigration Station in 2000.

            "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fodu/index.htm\">Fort Dupont</a> was erected as part of the Eastern Branch Line Defenses (Anacostia River). Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

Construction began in September 1861, but was not formally complete until 1864. The fort mounted 17 cannons and mortars. The earthwork was named in honor of Lieutenant John T. Greble, killed at the Battle of Big Bethel in Virginia on July 10, 1861. </p> <p>The two sites were located on densely wooded land, thereby providing sufficient lumber for the construction of the Fort Greble. Their plateau locations enabled them to lay down a withering cross-fire between them. To deter the possible advance of the enemy through the wooded hills surrounding the sites, civilian construction gangs cleared paths which could be raked from the guns of the forts</p> <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Fort Mahan was constructed at part of the Eastern Branch Defenses (Anacostia River). The earthwork was built to guard the approaches to Benning's Bridge, which crosses the Anacostia River.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was irregularly shaped with nine sides, and a perimeter of 354 yards. This fort was located less than mile east of Benning's Bridge and commanded the approaches to the bridge from Bladensburg via the Eastern Branch Road, and from Upper Marlboro by way of Benning Road.</p> <p>Over the next four years it underwent extensive repair and modification. The major problem with the fort was that it sat atop a rounded hill, and approaches to it were not visible from the parapet. To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator. In 1824, he graduated from West Point. He taught taught civil and military engineering at the Military Academy, and became an authority on military engineering. His works include: Complete Treatise on Field Fortifications (1836), Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works (1850), and An Elementary Course of Military Engineering (2 vol., 1866–67). </span></p>",

Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, Col. of Engineers, U.S. Army, was in charge of construction of the defenses around Washington. Barnard chose the location of Fort Reno for its strategic importance in guarding the Rockville Pike (present day Wisconsin Avenue). Being the highest elevation in the city (429 feet above sea level), Fort Reno also served as a forward outpost and signal station for detecting enemy movement near the northern part of the city.</p> <p>Constructed by the 119th Pennsylvania Regiment, the fort's name was later changed to Fort Reno in 1863 in memory of Major General Jesse Lee Reno, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of South Mountain, September 14, 1862. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Originally rather small, Fort Reno was enlarged and strengthened with an advanced battery 300 yards north from the highest ridge, across from what is now Fessenden Street and along 39th Street. This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Most people today know Hampton as a sedate Georgian mansion, elegantly furnished and settled amid gardens and shade trees. Built as a country seat just after the Revolutionary War by the prominent Ridgely family of Maryland, the house and its immediate surroundings are just a remnant of the Hampton estate of the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> In its heyday, Ridgely property equaled half the area of present-day Baltimore, land that made its owners rich through iron production, agriculture, and investments. Hampton is the story of a family business, early American industry, and commerce, the cultural tastes of the times, the deprivations of war, and the economic and moral changes that finally made this kind of life obsolete.<br /> <br /> Needing labor in abundance, the Ridgely family employed many types of workers. In just the last fifty years of the eighteenth century they bought over 300 indentured servants. They also employed free workers, British prisoners of war, and enslaved African-Americans. Slavery was part of the Hampton estate for over 100 years, ending only when Maryland State law ended the institution in 1864. Its presence predated the construction of the mansion and over its history over 700 enslaved people would come through the Hampton plantaiton. Enslaved people were instrumental in building the mansion, and their work supported the gracious lifestyle of the Ridgelys in the mansion.<br /> <br /> Slavery at Hampton was unusual for two reasons. First, the Ridgelys main prodcut from this labor was the harvesting and prodction of iron from their Northampton ironworks, unlike most of the agricultural South. Second, Hampton is very close to the slave free state of Pennsylvania and the city of Baltimore with its huge population of free blacks. Refuges for runaways were close by. Hampton is the site of one of the larges manumitions in history when the second owner of Hampton died with nearly 350 enlsaved people on the Hampton plantation. In his will he manumitted females between the ages of 25 and 45 and males between the ages 28 and 45. This is one of the largest manumissions in the history of Maryland, but it did not end slavery at Hampton. His son purchased some sixty or so more slaves and manumitted only one.</p> <h4>War of 1812 History</h4> <p>Hampton’s Northampton Iron Furnace, approximately a mile north of the current park location, played a significant role in the War of 1812. Enslaved African-Americans--the foundry's primary workforce--produced iron, cannons, shot and camp equipment for the war effort. Charles Carnan Ridgely, ironmaster and owner of the estate, also contributed funds and other supplies for Baltimore’s defense in 1814.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to restore and stabilize farm buildings at Hampton in 1999. </em></p>",
            "audioDescription": "The 64-acre property features a mansion, farmhouse, quarters for the enslaved, dairy, and ash house. The mansion is a large three-story stone mansion with two wings on either side of it, porches on the front and back, and a cupola on top. The front of the house faces down towards the farm side of the park with a large gravel driveway in front of it. The back of the house faces large decorative gardens that go down to the edge of the property. A two story white wooden house. The house has a front porch and multiple additions on it. On top of the house is a wooden bell cupola. A white wooden picket fence surrounds the yard around the house. The two standing slave quarter buildings are made of stone with wooden roofs. The buildings at two stories tall. They sit perpendicular to one another and each building has two units that families would live in. The first slave quarters building has exhibits about the enslaved people of Hampton, the second contains information on tenant farmers that worked the farms after slavery was over. The dairy is a one story white structure that is built below ground level. A set of stone stairs lead down to the base of the structure which is made of bricks. behind the structure a small opening where spring water comes from underground can be seen. Entering the structure the water runs around the edges of the building with a large elevated floor above the water line in the center. The ash house is a small stone structure located between the log house and the stone slave quarters. The structure is hollowed out and the area where a small door would be shows what the inside of the structure looks like.",

The trailhead is across the road. Parking space is limited and fills early on sunny summer days. Have an alternate hike in mind in case parking space is not available.<br /> <br /> From the parking lot, a short 0.1-mile trail connects to the Wonderland Trail, which branches off to the right and heads north towards the White River Campground. Keep straight and follow the Wonderland Trail as it ascends gradually through mature forest for several miles before entering the upper valley of Fryingpan Creek where hikers find good views of Mount Rainier. Shortly after crossing the creek at a small cascade, the trail climbs steeply for another 0.5 miles before reaching the open subalpine meadows of Summerland. The variety of subalpine wildflowers, panoramic views of Mount Rainier and Little Tahoma, and frequent sightings of mountain goats and other wildlife make this hike extremely popular. This is one of Mount Rainier's most crowded trails, hosting several hundred hikers per day on a nice summer weekend. Round trip, the trail to reach Summerland is 8.4 miles long with 2,100 feet of elevation gain. The trail is dirt, with sections of log or rock steps.<br /> <br /> Please hike only on the constructed trails and rest on nearby rocks. Minimize your impact on these fragile meadows so they remain beautiful. Campsites at Summerland are some of the most popular in the park and often fill early on summer days.

On clear days, look for Mount Adams to the south and Mount Baker to the north. Landscape architect Ernest A. Davidson, who helped design Sunrise Point, noted that \"even the most jaded, scenery-weary tourist cannot help but be thrilled by the magnificent panorama that greets the eye\". Sunrise Point is an overlook along the Sunrise Road, which was built specifically to enhance views and connect visitors with the natural landscape. At Sunrise Point the road naturally bends around the tip of a lava ridgeline. Crenulations along the rock walls around the overlook roughly mimic the peak of Mount Rainier. Construction on the road started in 1927 and the road opened to the public in 1931. During the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) improved the road, including work at Sunrise Point.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Two trails can be accessed from Sunrise Point. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/palisades-lake.htm\">Palisades Lakes Trail</a> begins on the eastern side of Sunrise Point, while the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/day-hiking-at-mount-rainier.htm\">Sourdough Ridge Trail</a> heads to the west, following the ridgeline in parallel to the road towards the Sunrise developed area with a spur trail to Dege Peak along the way.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Sunrise Point</b><br /> The Cascade Range consists of volcanic and metamorphic rocks established over millions of years. Prominent volcanoes like Mount Rainier and Mount Adams are much younger. They have grown on a basement of older uplifted rocks that formed the Cascade Range. Modern Mount Rainier began growing about half a million years ago but it is not the first volcano to be located here. An ancestral volcano grew at about this same site between one and two million years ago. The ancestral volcano has almost entirely eroded away during the past million years, so that only a few remnants of it exist today.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Sunrise Point is perched on the terminus of a lava ridge that radiates out from the east side of Mount Rainier. The Sunrise Road ascends east along the southern flank of the ridge, before turning in a sharp hairpin shape to travel west along the top of the ridge back towards Mount Rainier. There is a small, paved parking lot in the center of the road hairpin, bordered by low rock walls. Sidewalks with stone curbs wrap around the outside of the road along the edge of the overlook. Low rock walls around the overlook are interspersed with crenulations in a triangle shape that roughly mimic the surrounding mountain peaks. On the eastern side of the overlook the sidewalks lead up to a slight rise framed by low rock walls. A wayside exhibit panel on the west side overlooks Sunrise Point road and parking area. In the center of the rise is a bench constructed of massive rock slabs. A trail descends the ridge to the east. Wayside panels are also attached to the rock wall on the southern side of the overlook. Views to the south include Mount Adams and the White River Valley, while to the north Mount Baker can be glimpsed on clear days. Look down from the north side of the point to view Sunrise Lake surrounded by trees.",

This neighborhood also once boasted the mansion of George Pullman (torn down in 1922, following the death of his widow, Harriet.) Prairie Avenue was known as “the Fifth Avenue of the Midwest,” and was home to the Who’s Who of Gilded Age Chicago, including Pullman, “Merchant prince” Marshall Field and meatpacking magnate Philip Armour.<br /> <br /> The Glessner House was built between May 1885 and December 1887 for farm machinery manufacturer John J. Glessner. The house is now a museum, offering visitors a chance to step back in time.<br /> <br /> The Glessner House was notable among the homes on “Millionaires’ Row” due to its departure from the ornate style of his neighbors. According to the museum’s website, the house was “[a] radical departure from traditional Victorian architecture, the structure [serving] as an inspiration to architects such as Louis Sullivan, Mies van der Rohe, and the young Frank Lloyd Wright.”<br /> <br /> The style can be described as an urban townhouse mansion, integrating perfectly with its environment. This contrasted with the Pullman mansion, a brownstone chateau described as “reminiscent of the Grand Opera in Paris”.<br /> <br /> With the end of the Gilded Age, Prairie Avenue declined and many of the mansions were torn down. The Glessner house is one of the few remaining period homes. The Glessner house was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1970, and opened for tours in 1971.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to restore the Glessner House</em><em> and install a new HVAC system in 2000. </em>",

The battle, which lasted two days (July 11-12, 1864) marked the defeat of General Jubal A. Early's Confederate campaign to launch an offensive action against the nation's capital.</p> <p>The Battle of Fort Stevens also gained notoriety as being the only military action in which the commander-in-chief, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Abraham Lincoln</a>, came under direct fire from the enemy. With a combined total casualty figure of over 900 killed or wounded during the engagement, 40 of the Union soldiers who fought and died bravely in defense of the capital. Four civilians related to the cemetery's first caretaker were buried after the Civil War. A veteran of the battle was interred in 1936, closing the cemetery to future burials. </p> <p>Battleground National Cemetery, located one-half mile north of Fort Stevens, is one acre in size, and one of our nation's smallest national cemeteries. The entrance to the Cemetery is flanked by two <span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">Civil War vintage</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> 6-pounder, smoothbore guns.

This poem, as well as the words of the Gettysburg Address in bronze found on the side of the caretaker's lodge, are reminiscent of many national cemeteries.</p> <p><span>The center of the cemetery is marked by a central flagpole, surrounded by 41 regulation marble headstones, marking the remains of the honored dead of Fort Stevens. Behind these headstones and to the east, stands a marble rostrum used to conduct yearly Memorial Day services.

            "audioDescription": "(337 words) Battleground National Cemetery is located in the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, DC. The one-acre park is on the east side of Georgia avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south.<br />The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery. To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building. The northwest corner of the building features a three by one-foot bronze plaque engraved with the Gettysburg Address. The entrance walkway is lined with two black signs on stakes on the left side and on the right two waysides about two by three feet each. Directly back seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones. Forty-foot tall shade trees are set on the east and west sides of the flagpole area. Further to the east behind the flagpole is a marble rostrum. Raised at a three-step elevation, the structure spans thirty feet across, twelve feet deep, and features eight white columns, four in the front, and four in the back that have a marble block wall running between them. In the northeast corner of the cemetery sits a one-story, red brick building with a flat roof. It features a green door and two windows, along with a wooden sliding barn door. END OF DESCRIPTION",

            "bodyText": "Blackdom, New Mexico was the most important black homesteader colony in New Mexico.<br /> <br /> Blackdom was located fifteen miles south of Roswell. The town was incorporated in 1903 by thirteen African Americans. This group formed the Blackdom Townsite Company with $10,000 in combined assets. The group named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/francis-boyer.htm\">Frank Boyer </a>as their president.<br /> <br /> After some false starts, settlement began in an area of desert prairies around 1909. The region receives around 12 to 13 inches of precipitation annually. Underground reservoirs and artesian wells offered hope of bolstering poor rainfall with irrigation.<br /> <br /> Homesteaders may have been attracted to the area by a string of wetter years. They may also have been reacting to whites’ increasing hostility toward blacks living in Roswell (and elsewhere).<br /> <br /> Prominent families of Blackdom included the Boyers, Herrons, Proffits, Collins, Eubanks, Wilsons, and Smiths. Many of these families were intertwined through kin and marriage relationships.<br /> <br /> The community’s exact population is unknown, but estimates suggest around 150 persons. At least twelve women homesteaded, several on their own. One of those women was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mattie-moore-wilson.htm\">Mattie Moore Wilson</a>; she owned 640 acres of land under two different land laws.<br /> <br /> By 1929, Blackdom residents had received homestead patents on sixty-four claims. Some residents filed for 160 acres under the Homestead Act. Other people filed for 320 acres under the Enlarged Homestead Act, Stock Raising Homestead Act, or the Desert Lands Act. Together these residents owned 13,056 acres; averaging 204 acres per claim.<br /> <br /> The residents of Blackdom established a community school, initially housed in the church. The school ensured that Blackdom’s children would be educated. The residents understood the importance of education and its connection to power and influence.<br /> <br /> Many lived on farms, but Blackdom also developed a small village that gained its own US post office in 1912. The village opened a store, a new church, a pumping plant, and an office building (likely containing land sales and legal offices).<br /> <br /> Blackdom’s prosperity depended on adequate precipitation. From 1911 through 1923, rainfall in the area averaged 13.5 inches. This prosperity was marred only by the dry years of 1917, 1918, and 1922. Rainfall in the 1920s, however, was less plentiful and highly variable. The disastrous decline in crop prices after World War I badly damaged Blackdom’s farmers.<br /> <br /> Blackdom’s post office closed in 1919. Blackdom began to empty out in the 1920s, though current records do not allow us to say by exactly how much.<br /> <br /> National oil companies and local oil speculators discovered oil in the Roswell Basin. These companies began buying leases and sinking exploratory wells. Blackdom residents pooled their lease rights and formed the Blackdom Oil Company. The company was formed to make their land more attractive to major lease buyers and strengthen their bargaining power. The Company controlled lease rights to perhaps 10,000 acres.<br /> <br /> By March 1920, the Blackdom Oil Company entered a contract for 4,200 acres with the National Exploration Company in a deal worth up to $70,000. Unfortunately, the fields were not commercially viable, prompting oil activity in the Roswell Basin to come to an end.<br /> <br /> The community of Blackdom did not survive the Great Depression.<br /> <br /> Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/home/black-homesteading-in-america.htm\">Black Homesteading in America</a>.",

From this overlook one can see both north and south along the bighorn lake as well as up Devil Canyon which enters the lake directly in front of the overlook. In addition to the spectacular canyon views visitors often also see a variety of wildlife including but not limited to Bighorn Sheep, Pryor Mountain Wild Mustangs, Eagles, and Peregrine Falcons.<br /> <br /> To access Devil Canyon Overlook, turn north onto Hwy 37 from 14A near Lovell, WY. Remain on Hwy 37 for approximately 15 miles. The road is paved all the way to the paved parking lot and is easily accessible. Shortly after you enter the Recreation Area you will see a \"Entering Wild Horse Range\" sign. Slow as you cross the cattle guard and keep your eye out for our first band of wild horses we call the \"greeters\" because they frequently hang out just inside the boundary! As you climb up rolling hills look for Bighorn Sheep along the road banks. Follow the brown and white signs to turn right to go to Devil Canyon Overlook.",

The trailhead is located across the road. Parking is very limited and can fill early on sunny summer days. Have an alternate destination in mind. <br /> <br /> The trail climbs steadily for 3.5 miles through the forest on a series of switchbacks to reach the lakes. According to legend, these lakes were named after Yakama Chief \"Owhi,\" who loaned horses to Theodore Winthrop (after whom the Winthrop Glacier was named), when Winthrop was on a trek across the cascades in the mid-1850s. Although this hike offers no views of Mount Rainier, it does offer an array of secluded mountain lakes and meadows aglow with wildflowers in mid-summer. The jagged cliffs of Governors Ridge rise high above the lakes to the east while Tamanos Mountain lies directly west.<br /> <br /> Return back to White River, or the trail continues and descends down into the Ohanapecosh River Valley where it connects to the Eastside Trail at Deer Creek, an additional 4.9 miles. From Deer Creek, a trail (0.4 miles) connects to SR123 where a second vehicle can be parked. If returning to White River, the trail is 7 miles round trip with 1,350 feet of elevation gain.<br /> <br /> Tamanos Creek Camp is located among the trees three miles from the trailhead, 0.5 miles short of the lakes. Although the creek is often dry by late summer, Owyhigh Lakes provide a reliable source of water. Treat water before drinking. A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm\">wilderness permit</a> is required to camp. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Owyhigh Lakes Trailhead parking area is a paved pullout along the White River Road, with the trailhead on the opposite side of the road from the parking. The trail is dirt, often broken by log or rock steps and varying degrees of slope. Some sections are steep switchbacks.",

            "bodyText": "<figure> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure> <p><strong><u>An Oasis</u></strong><br /> Driving down the sagebrush, mountain mahogany, juniper, lined dirt road to the Lockhart Ranch, it is hard to imagine a green oasis as far away from civilization, it seems, as one could get. However, that is exactly what Caroline Lockhart wanted when she purchased the L/♥ Ranch in 1926. Starting with 160 acres, she added land through purchase, homesteading and leases until she controlled over 6,034 acres.</p> <p>From the previous owners, Caroline inherited a two-room cabin, a few run-down sheds, and 20 acres of cultivated ground. Lockhart added onto and landscaped the area around the cabin with irises and hollyhocks, cottonwood trees for shade, and stone pathways. She constructed fences, corrals, and irrigation systems and added up to 15 structures, some reassembled from acquired property.</p> <p>The buildings were clustered at the main ranch according to their functions. The barn, corrals, stables, coops, blacksmith shop, garage and storage sheds are grouped in the north side of Cottonwood Creek in the working area of the ranch. They face onto a commons yard that provides access to some of the irrigated pastures. The main house, guest cabin, root cellar/generator building, Crow’s Nest, storage sheds, springhouse, and bunkhouses are located on the south side of the creek.</p> <p><b><u>The Cattle Queen</u></b><br /> Life on the ranch was mostly self-sufficient. Potatoes, apples, onions, carrots, dried beans and peas, along with beef, pork, and wild game were stored in the powerhouse/storage building. Milk, butter, and eggs from ranch cows and chickens went from the milk shed and chicken coop to the spring house for chilling. A small apple orchard was also an important part of the ranch agriculture.</p> <p>Keeping equipment running, repairing or building items, and shoeing horses made a blacksmith shop a necessity. Most important to a cattle operation were corrals where livestock was branded, doctored, and separated for sale. When three loads of Lockhart steers topped the market in Omaha in1935, Caroline must have indeed felt she was the “Cattle Queen”.</p> <p><b><u>For Future Generations</u></b><br /> In 1952, Caroline moved to her home in Cody, Wyoming. Being in her eighties, her eyesight was failing and life on the ranch was just too hard. She sold the ranch to Isaac Tippetts in 1955. Issac would later grant the ranch to his son, Ivan. By 1980, the National Park Service acquired the property.</p> <p>Today, the buildings remain intact with minor alterations from the time Lockhart had the ranch. Along with restoration and stabilization of the buildings, irises, hollyhocks, and apple trees have been replanted to bring the ranch landscape back to the way it was when Lockhart was living in her oasis in the desert. The Lockhart Ranch provides visitors with a window into the past with an example of regional architecture that represents the Dryhead frontier during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>",

The Lockhart Ranch is representative of life for western ranchers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The gentle flow of Davis and Cottonwood Creeks provided the life force of the ranch. Ditches running from Davis Creek took advantage of the natural topography of the land by using gravity to irrigate the surrounding pastures.<br /> <br /> You can take the half-mile loop through the ranch or you can take an extended two-mile hike along the historic county road. The trail begins at the two-track road east of the corrals near the garage. Follow the road along the northern edge of Caroline Lockhart’s livestock pastures. This path leads to Davis Creek. Following the two-track along Davis Creek will bring you to an old metal gate and the dirt road. Instead of going through the gate, follow the inside of the fence to the crossing at Davis Creek. Continue following cowpaths along the inside of the fence over the hill to a corner post. Seven fence posts south of the corner post a faint two-track turns southeast. Follow the two-track to loop back to the ranch.",

            "bodyText": "The Nebraska School for the Deaf (NSD)  in Omaha, Nebraska was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 2019.  The school grew from its founding in 1869 to a 23-acre campus with 11 buildings. The campus can be split into two subdistricts based on the time frame of construction and architectural style of the buildings. The ‘northern’ grounds contain buildings that were predominantly constructed after World War II in the Mid-Century Modern style while the ‘southern’ area contains buildings built during the 1920s and 1930s. The southern campus dominant voice is that of Gothic Revival, more specifically Collegiate Gothic.<br /> <br /> The history of the school follows the controversy of teaching methods for deaf students. Until 1817, the United States had no formal institutions to educate deaf children. Deaf children often never went to school, remaining at home where they developed “their own idiosyncratic gestural systems in order to communicate” with their families. An informal solution for the wealthy was to send their deaf children abroad to study. A growing number of schools for the deaf established before the Civil War used methods of education employing sign language—known as “manualism”—at the core of their curriculums. Many schools for the deaf also utilized other methods of instruction, including finger spelling and writing while pairing these with sign language. Deaf schools brought together deaf children in larger numbers than ever before, and, as these children received a formal education, they informally began to learn about themselves. This process hinged on the creation of a shared linguistic identity informed by sign language. As most antebellum deaf students could attest, they overwhelmingly “preferred the sign language to English,” often assuming sign language as their primary language and means of communication and English as a second language. Sign language, manualism, and schools for the deaf were foundational in the process whereby deaf people became Deaf. <br /> <br /> To cultural reformers following the Civil War, the Deaf community existed outside a larger national collective. These reformers targeted and subsequently attacked sign language as the most visible expression of Deaf culture and insisted on “oralism,” a method of education that taught deaf people how to appear like hearing people via lip-reading and speaking. Both manualists and oralists predicated their understanding of deaf education along paternalistic and patronizing ideas of deaf children, and deaf people generally, as disabled and inferior to hearing people. Oralism, however, was far more devastating to deaf education than manulism. Oralism stunted early language and educational development; only a few deaf individuals were ever successful under oralist methods of education while the vast majority of deaf children met frustration and repeated failure. <br /> <br /> This contentious terrain formed the backdrop of efforts to create a school for the deaf in Nebraska. NSD staked out a middle ground between manualism and oralism, advocating for the combined method—a form of deaf education that borrowed from both manulist and oralist methods.  At the same time NSD sanctioned the combined method to educate deaf students, school officials aggressively pursued the implementation of a vocational program. Such a vocational program hoped to provide Nebraska’s deaf students with skills “essential to success in life” by teaching printing, drawing, and other trades skills to increase the marketability and employability of NSD’s graduates. NSD stood at the forefront of deaf education in the United States, aligning with schools across the country in reinforcing a commitment to vocational training in conjunction with a traditional educational curriculum.<br /> <br /> As the nineteenth century wore on NSD’s efforts to find balance between manualism and oralism became increasingly fraught as proponents of oralism, most notably Alexander Graham Bell, overwhelmed and exerted influence on the national deaf educational establishment. The organizing effort against sign language alarmed members of Nebraska’s adult Deaf community and Deaf instructors at NSD. Sign language was used throughout NSD at student gatherings, sporting events, and chapel services and was likewise sanctioned by school officials as an appropriate means of communication between and amongst students and faculty. NSD maintained the combined method of instruction within classrooms at NSD. Students and instructors—Deaf and Hearing alike—understood that this approach sustained “the deaf subculture that had developed in nineteenth century America” at NSD and ensured deaf students at the school received a high-quality education.<br /> <br /> However, the Nebraska legislature pressed on in their mission to eradicate sign language at NSD. On February 1, 1911, Senate File 173 was introduced to the Nebraska legislature to instruct students in the “oral, aural, and lip-reading method to the exclusion of the deaf alphabet and sign language…” Students at NSD decried the law as a threat to their “educational welfare,” reaffirming that they preferred the combined method. The adult Deaf community in Nebraska and throughout the United States echoed these fears, warning against such an “unwise law.” But “Nebraska oralists undercut the Deaf community’s power to influence educational policies and to preserve its culture within the schools. These oralists largely ignored Deaf pleas…” and in May of 1911 Governor Charles Aldrich signed Nebraska’s oralism bill into law. By the turn of the century, roughly 40 percent of deaf schools in the United States banned sign language and replaced manulist curriculums with oralist curriculums. After World War I, nearly 80 percent of all schools followed these trends. <br /> <br /> Despite efforts to ban the use of sign language in the classrooms at NSD, students and faculty continued to use sign language, subverting and resisting the 1911 law in an attempt to sustain cultural and linguistic sovereignty throughout the twentieth century. The hallways, dormitories, grounds, athletic facilities, and vocational classrooms served as the backdrop for these efforts; throughout the NSD campus, deaf students wishing to tap into and learn of Deaf culture could find sympathetic students and faculty. Athletics and extracurricular activities emerged as a primary arena where Deaf students could sustain cultural and linguistic sovereignty at NSD. Like NSD’s vocational department, athletics and extracurricular activities were led or organized by Deaf instructors or graduates from NSD. Within sporting activities students and coaches engaged in sign language, reinforcing solidarity and cultural identity while working together as teammates.  While NSD administrators may have viewed deaf students patronizingly, on the field or court, NSD students proved themselves as capable (if not more so) than any hearing person.NSD’s 1931 victory as Class A champions in the Nebraska State Basketball tournament showed Nebraska’s hearing population, as well as its Deaf community, that Deaf students had significant abilities as athletes.<br /> <br /> Ultimately, these students’ attempts to connect with and maintain Deaf culture at NSD triumphed. In the fall semester of 1970, sign language was gradually reintroduced into NSD’s curriculum. In March of 1977, the Nebraska Legislature repealed the law barring the school from teaching sign language methods.<br />  ",

One of the blocks is featured on the side of the Mission-66 Visitor Center within Fort Donelson NB. Many of the other 90 quilt blocks are found on businesses, churches, and private homes.  It took nearly five years for a few volunteers and history enthusiasts to create and hang these beautiful pieces of art. <br /> <br /> The quilt trail was inspired by local artist Carolyn Walter Darke, who owned her own archtectural rendering business in Atlanta, and returned to her hometown. She was inspired by her own family's story, which was intertwined in the battle of Fort Donelson. More research led Darke and fellow art lover Betsy Tumelson to highight how Americans remembered the Civil War, how quilts commemorate the veterans who served, and how art and history unite to tell a story.<br /> <br /> Quilting is one of the oldest forms of American folk art. In the 19th century, women and young girls knew how to piece quilt blocks. Quilts were not really artwork, they were utilitarian, offering comfort and warmth for families. As the war began, quilts were taken by Confederate soldiers to training camps. Quilting provided a way to support the war effort too. Groups of women made quilts to raffle off as fundraisers or sewed soldier's cot quilts to cover coffins of deceased veterans (one may be found in the historic Dover Hotel). Newspaper journalists and sketch artists recorded the stories and images of thousands of Confederate soldiers, now prisoners-of-war at Fort Donelson, who wrapped themselves in homemade quilts and blankets to await their trip to Northern prisons.<br /> <br /> This auto tour consists of four separate driving tours. Some of the tour can take you approximately 25 -miles outside of the city of Dover. Plan for at least three-four hours to view all blocks. Don't be disappointed if some quilt blocks have been moved; it's entirely a voluntary agreement to display the quilt block for the visiting public.  <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/964736f6-13de-49b9-bba1-26ea2cfbefc5?branding=NONE\">NPGallery Asset Detail (nps.gov)</a><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Archeology tells us that Hunt House may not have been the first home at this site. At one time, a larger building stood in front of the one you see today. The property here changed hands a few times in the 1800s. Martha and Norman Hunt bought it in 1867. Sometime during their ownership, the larger house was lost, perhaps to fire. The Hunts quickly converted their backyard outbuilding into living space. During the Hunt years, this was mostly a grain farm, producing winter wheat, Indian corn, and oats.<br /> <br /> William and Nelle Fiedler purchased the property in 1919. Although William held many jobs through the years, farming was his love. He ran a “truck” farm, selling produce from a stand along the road. In 1920, the Fiedlers welcomed a new baby girl, Helyn. Throughout her life, Helyn cherished the memories and friendships of her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/kidsyouth/helyn-fiedler-toth.htm\">Everett childhood</a>.<br /> <br /> The exhibits outside Hunt House were developed from family photos and oral and written histories shared by Helyn and her school friends. Imagine being a young girl growing up in Cuyahoga Valley. Flip through her album, listen to their stories, and take your photo with her calf and chickens.<br /> <br /> Hunt House has <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">seasonal hours</a>. When it is open, you can explore the hands-on nature exhibits inside and pick up park information. The restrooms are open all year. That barn between the restrooms and the house is a former schoolhouse that the Fiedlers relocated from Botzum.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Hunt House. 449 words. As you face this wayside graphic panel to the left is a small, white farm house. A ground-level covered porch extends across the front of the house with a bench next to the front door. At this end, under the peak of the roof is a window. Below an extension has been added to the house with a shed-style roof and a chimney at this end. The Towpath Trail runs past the house on the far side. Between the house and the graphic panel are touchable exhibits of farm animals. Nearest the panel is a life-size brown and white calf lying down, head up and alert. To the left of that is a hay bale where you can sit beside the two hens perched on the left end. One is brown and the other is speckled black and white. To the right of the panel is an audio station, a metal post with four push buttons on top to select the short programs. Farther to the right are two white buildings. The closer one is a two-story barn. The other one is smaller and has public restrooms. Behind you is a wide grassy lawn next to a street with a parking lot on the far side. Text on the panel reads in part, “Growing Up in Everett. […] Helyn was born in 1920 in the house to your left. She lived here through the 1940s with her parents and brother. Her father, William, held various jobs to support the family, but he loved farming. The Fiedlers raised vegetables in the fields behind the house. They had ‘a little roadside stand.’ Often vegetables and fruit were picked on demand as the customers waited. Helyn kept up friendships with her Everett classmates and neighbors until her death in 2013. Is there a place where you feel a strong sense of community?” At the bottom left is a photograph of Helyn’s father, William Fiedler, at the farm in the late 1940s, a cornfield in the background. The calf grazing to the left of him is the model for the touchable calf exhibit. At the middle top of the panel is a 1938 photograph of two 18-year-old girls, Helyn on the right with her friend Irene. Below them is a photograph of the farmhouse, looking much as it does today. At bottom right of the panel is a flipbook with more pictures and information about Helyn. The audio station to the right has childhood memories of Helyn and her friends. From left to right the audio segments are: Working Our Land, 60 seconds; One-room School, 40 seconds; Szalay’s Farm Next Door, 70 seconds; and Time for Fun, 70 seconds. End of description.",

            "bodyText": "The Rosa Parks (McCauley) and Raymond Flat, in Detroit, Michigan, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2021. The building is significant as the home of civil rights icon Rosa Parks, who lived in the first floor flat with her husband Raymond from 1961 to 1988. The property is located at the southwest corner of Virginia Park Street and Wildemere Avenue in what is currently known as the Wildemere Park (sometimes known historically as Virginia Park) neighborhood.  <br /> <br /> The flat is within the Twelfth Street neighborhood, one of the first of Detroit’s neighborhoods that opened to middle class Blacks in the post-World War II era. Two blocks east on Linwood Street is the Shrine of the Black Madonna, where Reverend Albert B. Cleage, Jr. led the militant Black Nationalist movement. New Bethel Baptist Church, where Reverend C. L. Franklin preached and his daughter Aretha Franklin sang, is several blocks north of the Shrine, also on Linwood Street. To the south is the Northwest Goldberg neighborhood, where a number of prominent Black businesses, including Motown Records, relocated in the 1950s and 1960s as Black Bottom and Paradise Valley were razed for urban renewal. Southwest is one of the original Black neighborhoods of the city, the West Side, settled by middle-class Blacks in the 1920s.<br /> <br /> Rosa Parks is most well known for her refusal to give up her bus seat to a White man in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. That moment forever fixed Parks as the “mother of the civil rights movement” and as a powerful symbol of resistance, strength, and freedom. Parks’ actions launched the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which ultimately ended in the desegregation of public buses. Since that day, Parks’ symbolism has often overshadowed her work, both in Detroit and nationally. The significance of Rosa Parks cannot be limited to one day, nor one action. Her work for equality began well before December 1955 and continued well beyond. The flat at 3201 Virginia Park Street is the property best able to illustrate the importance and contributions of Rosa Parks during her time in Detroit.<br /> <br /> After meeting Raymond Parks, who was already a civil rights activist, Rosa married him in 1932, and began working for the Montgomery, Alabama, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) by traveling throughout Alabama working on voter registration drives and documenting instances of racism and persecution. After the bus boycott of 1955 Rosa and Raymond were subjected to hate and harassment. They left Alabama for Detroit in 1957. However, in their first years in Detroit the couple experienced economic and health struggles.  At one point in 1960 the Pittsburgh Courier had featured a story describing their need. By 1961 their situation had improved somewhat and they were able to move into the first floor of this flat, where Rosa stayed until 1988. <br /> <br /> In Detroit, Parks found “(t)he northern promised land that wasn’t,” where racism “was almost as widespread as Montgomery.” It may not have been as overt as the segregated buses and schools of the South, but in Detroit Blacks were definitely second class, and the excuse that “this is not the South” was used to dismiss charges of discrimination. She almost immediately encountered the inequalities faced by African Americans in securing equal employment and housing, as evidenced by her difficulties in finding a job and a permanent place to live.<br /> <br /> Parks was aware of her status as a symbol, she was often a part of significant events, yet did not have a prominent role. Rather than a reflection of her significance, she identified the cause of this as the result of a patriarchal system. It was a time, she observed, when “women’s rights hadn’t become a popular cause yet.” At the same time, Parks did not seek a prominent role and did not care to a be a public figure. In August of 1963, Parks traveled to Washington D.C. to participate in the March on Washington. Although she was prominently featured on the dais at the Lincoln Memorial and was among the six women honored in the “Tribute to Women” at the event, Parks and her fellow women activists were shunted into a different march route, and it was not lost on her or the other women that they were being marginalized despite their prominent role in the movement. <br /> <br /> After nearly twenty years in the civil rights movement, Parks secured her first paid political position when newly elected Congressman John Conyers hired Parks to work in his office in March 1965. Conyers later said that Rosa Parks was the first person he wanted to hire for his congressional staff, considering her the most important civil rights activist in the state. While Parks was officially an administrative assistant, and she did perform tasks like filing and answering the telephone (greatly surprising some constituents), she also served as an informal legislative aide, traveling around the city to visit constituents, gather information, and represent Conyers at meetings. As a Black Congressman, Conyers often received communications from constituents reporting discrimination in housing and employment, and his office was reported to be a “hotbed of local and national black political organizing,” an atmosphere that may have appealed to Parks from her days working for the NAACP in Alabama.<br /> <br /> According to biographer Douglas Brinkley, “The Parkses’ flat functioned as a bit of a salon in Virginia Park, filled with robust discussion and debate. Many of the young men who came by greatly admired Malcolm X, like the Parkses did, and shared their feelings about the importance of the continued struggle.” The flat was just a few blocks from Reverend Cleage’s Central Congregational Church, where in October 1966 she attended Stokely Carmichael’s speech on Black Power; during that speech, Carmichael singled her out as his hero. Edward Vaughn, a leader of the radical Black Consciousness movement, later remembered that Parks was highly active in the movement. “Honest to God, almost every meeting I went to, she was always there,” he said. Vaughn had opened the first African American bookstore in Detroit not far from the Parks flat, and it became the intellectual center of the movement. Parks and her husband supported the bookstore and often participated in the intellectual and political discussions held there.<br /> <br /> The role of Rosa Parks in the civil rights movement before and after the Montgomery bus boycott has often been overshadowed by that event. Her image has, in the collective conscious, been fixed by that moment and solidified by the fact that those who interviewed her or wrote about her in the decades between the boycott and her death focused almost exclusively on her experience and the legacy of that event. Yet, as her biographers have pointed out, Parks spent more than half her life in Detroit, not Alabama, and she used the fame she had acquired following the boycott to bring attention to racial inequality in employment, housing, and public accommodations in Detroit and across the country. From the March on Washington in 1963 to boycotts in the 1980s, from the NAACP to the Black Power movement to anti-apartheid, Parks made her presence felt as a leader of the civil rights movement. Throughout those years, she lived at 3201 Virginia Park Street.<br />  ",

Canning fruit was a major task for the enslaved kitchen servants in the summer months, overseen by the mistress of the estate or plantation. In 1850 John McMurran received a dozen small peach trees. His law partner, John Quitman, provided them for the Melrose orchard. Today, the orchard holds figs, peaches, pears, apples, and cherries, just as it did during the McMurran era. Cattle grazed around the trees to keep the grass down. The McMurrans also grew peaches and nectarines at their Louisiana plantations, Killarney and Moro.</p> <p>George and Ethel Kelly installed the iron gate at the orchard entrance. It came from Cherokee, a house they owned in downtown Natchez.  </p> <p>The wooded area on the far side of the orchard holds a cemetery. The McMurrans buried their enslaved servants there. They planted evergreen trees like cedar around the area. In 1844 a young woman named Laura became the first burial. She had “quite a large funeral.” Marice died of dysentery in 1861. Wesley died in 1853. The carriage driver Charles died in 1855. Today, there is no above-ground evidence of the cemetery remaining. However, a letter written in 1887 mentioned a brick wall surrounding the Melrose graveyard.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Fort Jefferson was built to protect one of the most strategic deepwater anchorages in North America. By fortifying this spacious harbor, the United States maintained an important \"advance post\" for ships patrolling the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida. Nestled within the islands and shoals that make up the Dry Tortugas, the harbor offered ships the chance to resupply, refit, or seek refuge from storms.<br /> <br /> The location of the Tortugas along one the world's busiest shipping lanes was its greatest military asset. Though passing ships could easily avoid the largest of Fort Jefferson's guns, they could not avoid the warships that used its harbor.<br /> <br /> In enemy hands, the Tortugas would have threatened the heavy ship traffic that passed between the Gulf Coast (including New Orleans, Mobile and Pensacola) and the eastern seaboard of the United States. It could also serve as a potential staging area, or \"springboard\" for enemy forces. From here they could launch an attack virtually anywhere along the Gulf Coast.<br /> <br /> <b>A powerful deterrent</b><br /> <br /> Poised to protect this valuable harbor was one of the largest forts ever built. Nearly thirty years in the making (1846-1875), Fort Jefferson was never finished nor fully armed. Yet it was a vital link in a chain of coastal forts that stretched from Maine to California. Fort Jefferson, the most sophisticated of these, was a brilliant and undeniable symbol that the United States wanted to be left alone. Though never attacked, the fort fulfilled its intended role. It helped to protect the peace and prosperity of a young nation.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, Union warships used the harbor in their campaign to blockade Southern shipping. The fort was also used as a prison, mainly for Union deserters. Its most famous prisoner was Dr. Samuel Mudd, the physician who set the broken leg of John Wilkes Booth.<br /> <br /> Abandoned by the Army in 1874, the fort was later used as a coaling station for warships. In 1898, the USS Maine sailed into history, departing the Tortugas on its fateful mission to Havana, Cuba. Though used briefly during both world wars, the fort's final chapter as \"Guardian of the Gulf\" had long since closed.</p>",

By the time the lighthouse was removed and approval for the new one was authorized, Fort Jefferson had been under construction for 30 years. The light was mainly used as a beacon, since the much stronger light on nearby more adequately, Loggerhead Key guided ships around the treacherous reefs.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{79cb2a76-75e8-467b-9ecf-a06abb90c42c}{170}\" paraid=\"1806915891\">Iron was used since brick could shatter and spread flying debris into the fort if hit by cannon fire. The use of iron also made it possible to build a sturdy, yet comparatively lightweight structure that required minimal surface area- important factors considering the tower’s location. The light house stands 37 feet above the terreplein and just over 80 feet from ground level below. The iron light house was built in a hexagonal shape with an observation deck midway up and a windowed room at the top.   <br /> <br /> Harsh marine conditions of Dry Tortugas have affected the structural integrity of the harbor light. General maintenance and repairs were completed in 1930s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s. In recent months, the lighthouse has been disassembled and removed to an off-site facility for repair and complete rehabilitation.</p>",

Williamsport is now the only place in North America where visitors can view a variety of canal features in one place, including an operational lift lock and refurbished lockhouse, a railroad lift bridge, a canal turning basin and warehouse, and now a watered aqueduct. <br /> <br /> The Conococheague Aqueduct, second largest of the eleven aqueducts on the 184.5 miles of the C&O Canal, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nearly 97 years ago, in April of 1920, the upstream wall of the Conococheague Creek Aqueduct gave way, crumbling into the creek below. The C&O Canal Company temporarily repaired the aqueduct with a wooden wall, but the canal only operated for three more seasons before being abandoned in the spring of 1924. <br /> <br /> The restored Conococheague Aqueduct provides a watered section of the canal to allow for canal boat operations and other public uses between Lock 44 and approximately 450 feet upstream of the existing aqueduct (approx. 0.70 miles). The $10.2 million project took two years to complete, and was funded through federal, state, local and private dollars including national park entrance fees and Maryland's Transportation Alternatives and Bikeways programs. <br /> <br /> The National Park Service would like to acknowledge and thank those involved for their support with this projects.

Built from 1833 to 1835, the Conococheague Aqueduct is the fifth of eleven such \"works of art\" on the canal. It consists of three equal 60' arch spans extending 196' between abutments. In August 1863, Confederate soldiers damaged the Conococheague Aqueduct in an effort to stop the canal's transportation of coal to Georgetown where it was used by the Union. Repairs took four days and the canal returned to operation. In April 1920, a canal boat broke through the upstream wall of the aqueduct, falling into the creek below. This shut down the canal for over four months. Repaired with a timber wall, this version of the aqueduct functioned until two 1924 floods closed the canal for good. <br /> <br /> <strong>What was the need for the project? </strong><br /> The Conococheague Aquedcut is perhaps the most publically accessible aqueduct on the entire C&O Canal. It was in poor condition and would have continued to deteriorate without stabilization and additional repairs. This project completion will provide visitors with a nationally unique experience of being able to enjoy an interpretive boat tour across a watered aqueduct or to paddle their own boat through the aqueduct. <br /> <br /> <strong>How long did the project take to complete? </strong><br /> The project began August of 2017 and was completed August 2019. <br /> <br /> <strong>What did the project include? </strong><br /> The project included constructing cofferdams within Conococheague Creek and rebuilding the aqueduct piers; rebuilding and lining the aqueduct prism so that it is safe, sustainable, and watertight; repairs to the stone work; installation of a period-appropriate guardrail; clearing the canal prism upstream including constructing a berm; and removal of the existing berm on the downstream side so that entire stretch could be re-watered. <br /> <br /> <strong>How does this project benefit park visitors? </strong><br /> Completion of this project provides park visitors an opportunity to experience a watered transportation canal aqueduct. The project also restores a significant historic resource and provides unique opportunities for visitors. <br /> <br /> <strong>How can I access the towpath at the Williamsport Visitor Center?</strong><br /> Pedestrians and cyclists are able to cross the canal at the historic railroad lift bridge (adjacent to Rt. 11). Parking is still available by the Cushwa Warehouse. <br /> <br /> <strong>What is the railroad lift bridge? </strong><br /> Originally used to allow trains to cross the canal, visitors are now able to cross the bridge on a newly constructed stairway, which includes a low bike rail. (This is a great spot to get a view of the canal and aqueduct!). <br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I find accessible parking near the towpath?</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Parking is also available close to the towpath at Lockhouse 44 parking lot and from the Bollman Bridge at River Bottom Park. These are the best access points for visitors with bike trailers, strollers, or wheelchairs. Dam 5 is the next closest location along the towpath that also has parking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Who can I contact if I have further questions regarding the restoration? </strong><br /> For more information, please contact the C&O Canal Williamsport Visitor Center by calling 301-582-0813.</p> <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "(153 words) The Conococheague Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Williamsport, Maryland. It has three, 60-foot arches and is 168 feet long. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 12 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. To get to the Conococheague Aqueduct, start at the Railroad Lift Bridge. Cross over the bridge to the towpath. Turn right (Northwest) onto the towpath and walk one-tenth of a mile to the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct you will be walking on the elevated towpath. On your right, the canal waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. There is no barrier between the towpath and the drop. On your left you can see Conococheague creek flowing into the Potomac River. There is a metal rail between the towpath and the river.",

The Valley also had larger plantations with many enslaved people. White residents of the Valley were all economically connected to slavery. Therefore, their culture, like that of the rest of the United States, was part of a system of race-based slavery and they used racism, violence, and fear to maintain it.<br /> <br /> Betheny Veney, was an enslaved woman from Luray, Virginia. Bethany achieved her freedom in Massachusetts in the 1850's and later compared her treatment as a slave to a white child, \"She was kind to me, as I then counted kindness, never whipping me or starving me; but it was not what a free-born white child would have found comforting or needful.\" <h3>BELLE GROVE PLANTATION ENSLAVEMENT</h3> When Major Isaac Hite Jr. married Nelly Madison in 1783, her father, James Madison Sr. gifted the couple 15 enslaved people. By the time the 1810 census was taken, there were 103 enslaved people at the plantation. Enslaved labor was used for farming as well in the plantation's industries that included a blacksmith shop, gristmill, sawmill, distillery, and lime kiln and quarry. <h3>SLAVE HIRING IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY</h3> By the early 1800's slavery in the Shenandoah Valley adapted to meet the needs of local communities. Capitalistic slaveholders leased enslaved workers to local farms for periods of time. A Northern visitor to the Valley in 1847 wrote:<br /> <br /> \"The system of hiring, feeding, and clothing colored people...is to collect at that place - for that County - on the first of January, those to be hired and to put them up to the highest bidder for the ensuing year, or to bargain with more generally by individual arrangement. The person hiring gives his bond with good security to pay the hire at the end of the year, and the universal custom is to give two good summer suits, and one winter suit of clothing to pay the tax bill, which is assessed by the Court, so much for each slave of both sexes over 16 years.\"<br /> <br /> Annual hiring was most common for farming and industrial jobs, like iron forges. <h3>VIRGINIA AS AN EXPORTER STATE</h3> The United States abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1808.<br /> <br /> At the same time cotton farming expanded in the Deep South, and the value of enslaved workers rose sharply leading many Virginia slaveholders to sell people south. This 1853 Lewis Miller drawing shows two mounted white men and a group of twenty enslaved men, women, and children who are being forced to walk barefoot from Staunton to Tennessee. The Shenandoah Valley became a corridor for moving enslaved people from Virginia to southern states.<br /> <br /> The Staunton Spectator ran a weekly advertisement during the fall of 1836 proclaiming, \"1,000 Negroes wanted - I wish to purchase one thousand likely negroes, of both sexes for Southern Market, for which I will give the highest cash prices.\"",

Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain. These regulars remained together until the close of the war.</p> <p>After the Civil War ended Fort Marcy was returned to its original owners, the Vanderwerken family. The land remained in the Vanderwerken family until after World War II, when the DeLashmutt family purchased the property.</p> <p><span>\"</span>Thoughts on Fort Marcy,<span>\" is a poem written by Lillian Money-Read that was published in the </span><em>The Washington Post</em><span>, April 12, 1936. The poem is an eloquent tribute to not only Fort Marcy, <span>but the other forts in the Defenses of Washington system that have, over time, been covered by deciduous forests of American elm, yellow-poplar, and white ash. <span>Today these remnant earthworks</span><span> are a silent reminder of the protective shield that surrounded the nation’s capital during the Civil War years. </span></span></span></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong> </strong></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Thoughts on Fort Marcy </strong>by Lillian Money-Read:</p> <p align=\"left\">The woodland drips with sun-warmed April rain,<br /> The trees are colorful with new–oped leaves,<br /> With half-blown buds the dogwood trees are snowed,<br /> The maple-tassels, green with scarlet cleaves.</p> <p align=\"left\">May apple flings its sweetness on the air,<br /> Translucent stemmed, the big dark violet<br /> And pied spring beauty, bride of early morn<br /> Bloom in the vivid moss with shy bluet.</p> <p align=\"left\">My dog bounds down and leaves a darkened trail<br /> Along the silvered hillside, wild with mirth,<br /> His mouth is spread, his limpid eyes a-shine,<br /> His muzzle wet with brown, sweet-smelling earth.</p> <p align=\"left\">On fair Fort Marcy, thus I dream today.<br /> And hear the swollen creek rush to the river,<br /> With muffled roar like a dreadful battle din<br /> Which made, of old, these frightened forests shiver!</p> <p align=\"left\">Ah, bright the ferns that clothe these silent moats,<br /> And sweet the lanes where walked the sentinel,<br /> Yet scarce a flower springs on this haunted ground<br /> But marks the place where some young soldier fell!</p> <p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The tobacco barn which now stands at the National Colonial Farm is arguably one of the most significant known remaining pieces of agriculturally related 18th-century architecture in eastern North America. This tobacco barn was originally the property of William Hall of southern Anne Arundel County. He had two such barns, and they were the largest and most important structures on his property. Built well, these barns survived all manner of weather, but one of the barns, at last, was endangered by development plans. Efforts by the National Park Service and the Accokeek Foundation secured the relocation of this tobacco barn to the National Colonial Farm. The barn features fascinating construction techniques and was carefully reconstructed to preserve early agricultural messages. The original designers had made use of pieces from earlier barns. The basic construction technique is known as “Tidewater framing” and consists of plates, rafters and corner braces connected by pinned mortise and tenon joints. Hand adzed oak, walnut and chestnut timbers predominate. The roof is steeply pitched at about 54 degrees, and the eves rest on a false plate (where the soffit would normally fit) allowing for increased ventilation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The frame was covered with clapboard siding in approximately 4-foot lengths. The open spaces, where clapboards have been left off, serve to increase ventilation as well.  All siding and roofing were secured with completely hand-forged nails made in the 18th century. The tobacco barn is capable of housing 12,000-18,000 lbs of tobacco. At a time when most people have lost connection to land and agricultural roots, visitors are invited to enter the tobacco house, stand under the curing leaf and weathered beams and experience the rhythms of our agricultural past that continue to inform the present day.  </p>",

However the log bridge over the river to reach the main trail often washes out during the fall and winter.  <br /> <br /> Carter Falls is a horsetail-shaped waterfall about 50 feet tall. It was named in honor of Harry Carter, builder of much of the trail between Longmire and Paradise. Carter Falls can be viewed 1.1 miles up-river from the Cougar Rock Campground on the Wonderland Trail. Cross the Nisqually River below the campground and follow the trail toward Paradise. Continue past Carter Falls about 100 yards to view Madcap Falls, a short waterfall cascading down about 34 feet. For a longer hike, the Wonderland Trail continues to climb towards Narada Falls and eventually connects to Reflection Lakes or Paradise. Or, instead of crossing the Nisqually River, head southwest from the Carter Falls trailhead along the Wonderland Trail to reach Longmire.<br /> <br /> The Carter Falls trailhead also provides easy access to the Nisqually River. Explore the wide, rocky braided riverbed and stop to enjoy lunch next to the river. There is an excellent view of Mount Rainier from the riverbed. A log footbridge crossing the Nisqually River can wash out during the fall or winter. Check conditions before proceeding. Pets are not allowed on trails or along the Nisqually River. Parking can be limited at this popular trailhead.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The trailhead starts from the Paradise Road across from the Cougar Rock Campground. A large paved pullout on the east (uphill) side of the road provides parking, with a wayside exhibit panel in a metal frame on the north side of the pullout. The dirt trail descends steeply down log steps from the pullout down to the Nisqually riverbed, which is wide and rocky. The trail weaves around large rocks and boulders with sections of trail that are loose and sandy to cross the riverbed. The trail crosses the Nisqually River using a single log footbridge with a railing on one side only. Across the river, the trail climbs up the Paradise River valley through forest to reach an overlook with views of Carter Falls. The trail is dirt, broken by sections of rocks and rougher terrain.",

The trailhead is located four miles east of Longmire on the road to Paradise. Parking space is limited and often fills quickly. There is no additional parking nearby, so have an alternate hike in mind. The trail can be treacherous in spring, with ice and snow lingering well into June or July.  <br /> <br /> For 1.8 miles the dirt trail climbs steadily uphill, with sections of log steps. Just before reaching Comet Falls, the trail passes by Van Trump Falls, a tiered waterfall. Continue to reach the base of Comet Falls. Many hikers then return the same route back to the trailhead, but for a longer hike, the trail continues to Van Trump Park. Van Trump Park honors P. B. Van Trump who, with Hazard Stevens, was one of the first people to stand on the summit of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> From Comet Falls the trail switchbacks 0.8 miles uphill to the junction with the Rampart Ridge Trail, which connects to the Wonderland Trail and Longmire. Approximately half a mile along the Rampart Ridge Trail is a 0.5-mile spur trail that climbs to Mildred Point. From the junction, a trail to Van Trump Park is to the right, climbing through subalpine meadows until the maintained trail ends in 0.5 miles. There is 900 feet of elevation gain to reach Comet Falls, and 2000 feet of total elevation gain to reach Van Trump Park. From Van Trump Park, Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens are visible to the south while the Kautz and Van Trump Glaciers dominate views of Mount Rainier to the north. Look for marmots, pikas, and goats on rocky open slopes.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Comet Falls and Van Trump Park trail is steep and strenuous, with numerous sections of log steps and rocks.

            "bodyText": "<strong>The Ceremonial Center</strong><br /> Located about 10 miles northeast of Natchez, Mississippi, Emerald Mound is the second-largest Mississippian Period ceremonial mound in the United States, surpassed only by Monk’s Mound near Cahokia, Illinois. Built and used between the years 1200 C.E. (current era) and 1600 C.E., this 35-foot-high mound covers eight acres and measures 770 feet by 435 feet at its base. Two secondary mounds sit atop the primary mound, bringing the total height to approximately 60 feet. The larger one at the west end measures 190 feet by 160 feet by 30 feet high. Early records suggest there were six, smaller mounds located along the sides of the primary mound, but visual evidence of these smaller mounds has long since disappeared.<br /> <br /> <strong>Building the Mound</strong><br /> The builders of these flat-topped mounds are called Mississippians, named for the concentration of their villages and mounds in the Mississippi River Valley.<br /> <br /> Imagine groups of people walking with empty baskets, looking for the perfect location to collect soil for building the mounds. Once found, they may have used digging sticks or their own two hands to collect soil, load up their baskets, and walk back to their village. Baskets would have been emptied, soil stomped down, and the process repeated over and over again to create a mound that was 35 feet high. How many people, how many hours, days, or even years of labor were put into creating this mound?<br /> <br /> There are many mysteries that remain regarding mound construction.<br /> <br /> <strong>Social Significance of the Mounds</strong><br /> The villages of the Mississippians are marked by flat-topped earthen mounds that are scattered throughout the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. Sometimes a single large mound dominated the village or ceremonial center. More often, the mounds were arranged around a rectangular plaza. At Emerald Mound, however, the village ceremonial center was on top of the mound. There is evidence of a village site near the mound that was destroyed by cultivation. <br /> <br /> The mounds of the Mississippians were used for burials, temples and ceremonial structures. Archeologists believe the mounds were the setting for elaborate civic processions, ceremonial dances, and intricate and solemn religious rituals.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "A large green 35-foot-hign mound that covers eight acres with two secondary mounds that sit atop the primary mound, bringing the total height to about 60 feet high. There is a wooden rail fence that lines the outer edge of the semi-circle shaped parking lot leading to a wooden and metal gate that takes you to up an established trail that allows you to climb to the top of the primary mound. At first the trail is paved and then transitions to grass once you reach the top.",

Vail & Vickers managers chose to rid the island of sheep and slowly restock with cattle, giving time for the overgrazed vegetation to recover adequately in order to run a viable cattle operation. Vail & Vickers reached this goal by 1910.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers traditionally raised Hereford cattle, first bringing herds from their Empire Ranch in Arizona, later buying young cattle from the Santa Cruz Island Company and all over the west. During the last years of ranch operation, they changed to a crossbreed that provided lighter beef as called for by modern tastes.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers ran a stocker ranch, where calves were fattened on the ranch with island grasses and then sold directly to packing plants as \"finished\" cattle or, in later years as corn-fed beef became the standard, sold to feed lots for additional fattening. A stocker ranch differs from the common cow/calf operation in that cows were not bred to produce newborn calves to raise; they brought calves to the island for feeding, \"stocking\" the island with six-month-old calves.<br /> <br /> Weaned calves destined for Santa Rosa Island arrived at Wilmington (1902-1939) near Los Angeles or Port Hueneme (1939-1998) in train carloads or by truck and were deposited into corrals at the harbor (occasionally in the early days they were shipped from Santa Barbara). Often the stock would be \"stopped\" at a mainland ranch where they would receive some or all preparation-branding, dehorning, vaccinating, and feeding. Stopping cattle allowed ranch owners to wait for the best island grass conditions. This preparation was also occasionally done on the island.<br /> <br /> The cattle were marked with various brands. \"V/V\" didn't last long because it was graphically too complicated. After the war the managers used \"VR\" (Vail-Rogers), reflecting Ed Vail's partnership with Jimmy Rogers (son of the famous Will Rogers) on the Jalama Ranch near Lompoc. A heart-slash was the standard brand on the ranch for the last decade of the operation.<br /> <br /> From the harborside corrals, vaqueros loaded the calves through chutes and ramps onto a vessel, either a barge, Vaquero, or Vaquero II. The vessels had pens aboard to regulate the number and weight of animals. Loading typically occurred in the dark. After a voyage of about five hours the livestock were unloaded onto the pier at Bechers Bay. After about three days in pens at the ranch house, where they would be fed and observed, calves were distributed to one of the six pastures on the island.<br /> <br /> The total number of cattle depended on the weather, abundance of grass, and general range condition. During some dry years managers kept the ranch half stocked; the usual stocking level would reach about 6,000 to 7,000 head at the \"spring peak.\" The largest number of cattle on the island at one time, consisting largely of calves, was about 9,000.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers stocked the island using a double season strategy, where an overlap occurred between new calves and finished cattle that gave them two green seasons. From a new 300- to 450-pound calf arriving in the winter and early spring to a 750- to 1,000-pound feeder steer ready for shipping the following late spring and early summer, a steer spent roughly eighteen months on the island, gaining about 600 pounds.<br /> <br /> While the herds could wander freely throughout the large pastures on the island, they tended to stay in groups in particular areas. The cowboys kept an eye on them but didn't interfere unless necessary, to doctor them or improve pasture utilization. Even at roundup time, the cowboys avoided roping cattle; instead they kept the cattle gentle by not \"running â€˜em.\" No supplementary feed was necessary. If the range conditions became poor, cattle were shipped off the island rather than import feed, which was expensive and labor intensive.<br /> <br /> At roundup and shipping time the island came alive. The roundup followed a 100-year-old tradition of vaqueros tending cattle on horseback. The roundup, an icon of the romance of the West, is in reality a hard, dirty job that requires concentrated preparation, precise execution and judgment-and a good spell of rest when it is all over. The art of the roundup has been fully understood only by those who have participated in the activity. It requires a sure horseman or horsewoman on a good horse, possessing both agility and endurance; a knowledge of the land being worked, coupled with a good eye and a sense of how a steer thinks; and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to work as a team with little direct communication.<br /> <br /> The island cowboys and their families spent three months in the spring on roundups around the island. Before the 1960s, cowboys gathered cattle to roundup grounds across the island mostly without the benefit of corrals. The eventual use of corrals throughout the island made roundups easier and faster and cut the number of cowboys needed. After being rounded up, the cattle were moved to smaller pastures close to the ranch in Bechers Bay and then eventually to the pens at the ranch, where they were carefully weighed in the scale house and assigned pens for shipment on the boat or barge.<br /> <br /> During the Vail & Vickers years, a variety of vessels were used to ship the cattle to the mainland, including the Mildred E., Santa Rosa Island, Vaquero, Santa Cruz, barges and landing crafts, and, beginning in 1958, the Vaquero II. What follows is a ranger's account of the loading operation:<br /> <br /> \"The boat used for this unusual operation, the Vaquero II, is basically a shallow-drafted, floating cattle pen built especially for this purpose. The original Vaquero was pressed into service during World War II and never returned to Santa Rosa. The Vaquero II, a smaller boat, holds 100 head ... I watched the boat pull alongside the dock one morning. It was 4:00 am, dark and cold. An overhead light illuminated the end of the pier. Silhouettes of the cowboys could be seen against the morning sky. The voice of the foreman rose above the crashing of the waves on the beach.<br /> <br /> When all was ready the overhead light was switched off then on, a signal to the cowboys to start the first group of 15 down the pier. Three vaqueros on horseback galloped behind the stampede. When the cattle reached the first planks of the pier they tried to stop, but the vaqueros cracked their whips and yelled, as their horses reared in the air. The herd was pushed reluctantly down the pier into a chute, forcing them to go single file. They were encouraged to keep moving with electric cattle prods or hot shots. Finally, each steer scrambles down the rusty ramp to the boat, where they were packed in so tightly they could not move.<br /> <br /> As dawn broke, the Vaquero II, low in the water, began its journey, a journey it and the Vaquero before it had completed hundreds of times for more than 90 years. From Santa Rosa Island the Vaquero II lumbers the 55 miles to Port Hueneme where the cattle are sold at auction.\"<br /> <br /> The sale price of a steer or cow was based on weight on the island at the time of shipping. Cattle lost some weight on the boat trip to the mainland and even more during shipping to feed lots. Vail & Vickers shipped cattle by rail in the early years and later by truck, to feed lots all over the West, including the Rocky Mountain states and the Midwest. Vail & Vickers owned a feedlot at Walnut, California, until around 1984. After 120-150 days of feeding on grains and supplements, the cattle were slaughtered and sent to markets as choice beef.<br /> <br /> Cultural changes in the country after World War II helped raise public awareness of the importance and fragility of the resources on the Channel Islands. The booming post-war economy brought increased visitors and residents to California, especially to the scenic coastal areas, which saw greatly increased development. Events like the Santa Barbara oil spill and the discovery of the effects of DDT on seabird populations heightened environmental awareness and calls for protection of coastal resources.<br /> <br /> On March 5, 1980, President Jimmy Carter designated the Channel Islands National Monument islands of Anacapa and Santa Barbara as a national park and added Santa Cruz, San Miguel, and Santa Rosa Islands.<br /> <br /> In 1986 the National Park Service acquired Santa Rosa Island from Vail & Vickers for nearly $30 million. The ranching operation continued until 1998 when the final roundup brought a close to the last working island cattle ranch in the continental United States and an end to a truly unique way of life.<br /> <br /> For almost a century, Vail & Vickers operated one of the largest and most productive beef cattle ranches in California. Four generations of family members acted as stewards of the land managing the ranch in the traditional system of vaqueros (Spanish for \"cowboys\"), tending cattle on horseback, and preserving the last intact large Mexican land grant rancho in California. Their commitment to ranching traditions preserved an undeveloped, historic landscape that greatly contributed to Santa Rosa Island's inclusion in Channel Islands National Park.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Cowboy Life</strong></p> <p>The life of a cowboy, as personified in tales of the old west, had perhaps its ideal venue on Santa Rosa Island. Although without a saloon to saunter down to in the evening and lacking in shoot-outs, island cowboys were isolated from mainland progress and hence hung on to a passing way of life for a few extra decades. Once left at the Bechers Bay pier, the cowboy did almost nothing but be a cowboy, day and night. Life revolved around the bunkhouse, tack room, and range, as the men herded cattle, fixed fences and cared for their tack and horses.<br /> <br /> Al Vail, for 25 years a cowboy then 36 more as ranch manager, described the life of a Vail & Vickers employee: \"A cowboy does a little o' everything. You know, the reason for the island is to run cattle . . . in between when we're shipping cattle there's lots of other work, like fence building, breaking colts, do anything that comes along as far as maintaining a ranch.\"<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers needed six or seven men to handle the day-to-day ranch duties and, before building corrals around the island in the 1950s and 1960s, required even more for roundups. Most cowboys tended to be happy with the island life, and the managers were lucky to have steady crews, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. Vail spoke on the hiring practices at the ranch:<br /> \"Most of the personnel we have we get through word of mouth . . . We never had any luck going through an appointment agency . . . If the guy's a good cowpuncher and he says his friend is a good cowpuncher then you hire him.\"<br /> <br /> Many cowboys followed the Vail family from their ranch in Arizona to Santa Rosa Island in the years after the island was purchased. One of the most storied of the old Arizona cowboys was Juan Ayon, who spent over 50 years chasing cattle, building fences, cooking, and keeping gardens on the island. Ayon was born in 1887 in Mexico and worked at the Empire Ranch for many years, forming a bond with the Vail family that lasted three generations. He is thought to have arrived at Santa Rosa Island around 1911. It has been written that:<br /> <br /> \"Juan, who was heavy-set with a short, stocky build, had great physical strength, and possessed many talents. He was not only an experienced cowboy, but also a good ranch hand as well-he milked cows, built fences, broke horses, nurtured the island's garden, and occasionally worked as the island cook (he always gave that assignment a fight and often ended up cooking only for himself!). Apparently his reputation of having a curmudgeon-like personality combined with a slightly humorous nature was well-deserved.\"<br /> <br /> Many of the cowboys, like Jesus Bracamontes, came from Mexico. Jesus was born in January 1925 in Sonora, Mexico, and spent his whole life as a cowboy in Mexico and the United States; he worked for more than 35 years on Santa Rosa Island. During WWII the Vails enrolled in the Bracero Program, created by the Farm Security Administration and the Mexican government to help staff agricultural operations at a time when labor was short. The program granted temporary visas to 2.6 million Mexican citizens and helped find them work in the United States.<br /> <br /> Cowboys worked seven days a week, sunrise to sunset. They were allowed four days paid leave on the mainland every six to eight weeks, or every month if not working cattle (vaqueros were also given longer vacations to go home to Mexico). It was an isolated life, where you couldn't run to town when you wanted. Office manager Tom Thornton took care of supplies for the cowboys:<br /> <br /> \"They'd send us a shopping list or call over after the phone became a very common and very easy thing to use. A simple matter. They would hope that [the clothes] fit. They always buy their shoes large so they can get thick socks or thinner socks. Buy their leather to make their chaps and to make saddles and buy their rope for their lassoes etc. You are dealing with a real family over there. \"<br /> <br /> The risks of isolation, of getting injured or seriously ill out on the island, didn't seem to bother many of the cowboys. Bill Wallace, who was hired in 1948 and was ranch foreman from 1968 to 1999, probably put it best when he said, \"I've been out here just about fifty years. Well, once you get out here, it's damned hard to find a reason to ever go back. I only go into town when I absolutely have to. That's about once or twice a year. And that's too [expletive deleted] much.\"<br /> <br /> Tom Thornton speculated on why Vail & Vickers was so successful in getting and keeping good cowpunchers on the ranch:<br /> <br /> \"[T]he Vail & Vickers cowboys are probably the best fed cowboys in the world. They get what they want. Al has no restrictions on . . . reasonable foods. So they eat very well. Probably that's one reason they stay so long. They are probably the best paid cowboys in the country. There is nothing \"pickey-unish\" about Santa Rosa people.\"<br /> <br /> anta Rosa Island provided a unique backdrop for ranch life. While it was not the life for everyone, many of the cowboys and foremen stayed on for much of their working lives, dedicated to the island traditions and their employers. Those traditions contributed to the preservation of the \"old ways\" on Santa Rosa Island, a place almost untouched by the hurry of city life and pressures of development from nearby suburbs. The end of ranching in 1998 brought to a close a truly unique way of life in coastal California.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Horses</strong></p> <p>Santa Rosa Island's herds of horses served many purposes. Foremost, they worked at the most critical times of ranch operation: roundups and moving cattle. They also provided transportation, labor, and recreation for visitors and family.<br /> <br /> Ranch managers kept about forty head of riding horses as well as twelve to fifteen brood mares. Additional horses, including yearlings, resting, and retired horses, brought the number to well over a hundred. The horses, mainly quarter horses, were bred and raised for ranch use. Known around southern California as a fine herd of cattle horses, each was trained by the cowboys and foremen to perform the jobs unique to the island.<br /> <br /> Diego Cuevas spoke of the ranch philosophy on horses:<br /> <br /> \"Important part of the island was the horses, was number one . . . you gotta learn from the horses, teach â€˜em to lead, got to teach â€˜em so you can walk to and touch and play with their feet and make them gentle. That's one of the most important parts. So you have the job, the cowboy gotta do all those things like that. You know, train the horses from beginning from baby to three or four years old. So you can drive it and then you start teaching it how to respond to the reins. Once you do that you start teaching it how to work cows. And you try your best to make a good gentle horse at the same time. Working horse and gentle horse. Lot of the horses they see that they begin to get to be gentle and nice, you can play with them and they make good kid horses, because on the island you always have somebody that never ride a horse and then you can put him on the horse and you can trust him.\"<br /> <br /> A cowboy would be assigned five or six horses to ride and care for. Usually he would break his own horses, train them, and use them exclusively during roundups.<br /> <br /> Working island horses spent their time in the House Field, roughly 640 acres west of the ranch complex. Yearling and older horses were turned out onto the Soledad and Green Canyon Flats. Ranch workers sowed oat fields in the flat areas east and south of the ranch house to produce feed for the horses; ranch workers cut and baled oat hay in May, weather permitting.<br /> <br /> Earlier in the century, horses performed most of the transport labor, hauling wagons of materials to various parts of the island. The first ranch vehicle, a Fordson tractor, arrived in 1939, and island managers started to use trucks in the 1950s, but horses remained the favored mode of transportation. The Vail children and their friends looked forward to island visits, which afforded the freedom of riding horseback in the hills, searching out pigs, and having picnics in favorite spots.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Hunting Pigs, Deer, and Elk</strong></p> <p>Hunting had a long tradition on Santa Rosa Island, with the earliest reference dating back to 1853. Nonnative pigs, deer, and elk were all privately and commercially hunted on the island.<br /> <br /> <u>Pigs</u><br /> The origin of pigs on the island has not been determined, although it is known that sometime after 1844 Alpheus Thompson raised \"a lot of hogs.\" Since then, pigs had become a source of delight to the hunter and a bother to the rancher. Charles Holder wrote in 1910 that \"years ago wild pigs were placed on the island and are now â€˜wild hogs' . . . dangerous to approach or hunt on foot.\" Al Vail stated that hogs inhabited the island long before Vail & Vickers took possession of the island in late 1901. In the early 1930s, according to Vail, they traded hogs for Catalina Island quail, shipping them over on the Vaquero.<br /> <br /> Arthur Sanger, who hunted hogs on the island between 1910 and 1917, described \"wild hogs weighing as much as 150 and 200 lbs. with curved tusks six inches long. They have the appearance of large hyenas, high heavy shoulders and low rumps.\" He continued, \"Many times they charged us with their teeth snapping with a grinding noise as if they wanted us to know what to expect if they reached us, but they never did. At the time I will admit that I felt more like running than shooting. We had some exciting experiences and we learned that if you corner or wound a tusker, he will always charge you.\"<br /> <br /> Not only was pig hunting a popular sport on the island, it also became a necessary means to keep the population in check and slow the damage caused by their voracious rooting. Vail claimed that the hogs ate the cattle's molasses blocks and dug up valuable soil, which caused erosion, encouraged weeds, and reduced pasture productivity.<br /> <br /> The NPS decided to eliminate the feral pigs, citing soil disturbance and the nonnative status of the approximately 500 to 4,000 animals (the population varied wildly depending on island conditions). The 1984 supplement to the General Management Plan noted that feral pigs, not to mention livestock, elk, and deer, would be removed from Santa Rosa Island. A major eradication effort in 1991 and 1992 eliminated all pigs from the island.<br /> <br /> <u>Elk and Deer</u><br /> The elk and deer herds originated with the desire of the ranch owners to make the island \"a sportsman's paradise.\" Walter Vail's sons, N. R., Mahlon, and Ed were ranchers and businessmen and worked to import elk and deer as a source of income and for their pleasure and that of visitors.<br /> <br /> The first record of elk on the island came from a writer that visited the island in 1892 and reported on an ill-tempered pet female elk that \"weighed as much as an ordinary horse.\" N. R. Vail wrote that around 1905 they obtained three elk from Oregon and a few years later a bull. One story goes that around 1908 an old elk that had been the mascot for the Elks Club in Long Beach was retired and taken to the island. Other family members recalled that the elk were imported in the 1910s. In 1911 a local newspaper reported on a herd of nine elk on Santa Rosa Island, stating, \"it is an ideal range for them, and the day may come when the island may be well stocked with this species of game, now becoming extinct in other portions of the continent. Absolute protection is guaranteed them on the island.\" By 1994, the elk population had grown to approximately 900.<br /> <br /> Margaret Vail Woolley said that the elk \"were brought over with the idea that someday they'd be hunted, or at least they'd be meat producers and be profitable.\" Difficulty in getting fresh meat to shore, the depression, and refrigeration problems hindered those plans, and the elk were hunted only sporadically.<br /> <br /> Family members and friends of the Vails and the Vickers enjoyed elk hunting. In the 1950s, under Ed Vail, a number of prominent men came to the island to hunt not only elk but also deer and pigs, including Governor (and later Chief Justice of the Supreme Court) Earl Warren, Bing Crosby (who had a ranch in Nevada and sold cattle to the Vails), and newspaper publisher and More descendant Thomas Storke.<br /> <br /> Deer have been reported on Santa Rosa Island as early as 1880. The Vails brought deer over from Arizona's Kaibab National Forest in 1929-30. By 1994, the deer population had grown to approximately 1,000.<br /> <br /> The Vail family began hosting commercial hunts for elk, deer, and pigs as early as 1979. Multiple Use Managers Inc. was hired to help manage the herds and to operate the commercial hunts. This business relationship lasted for the entire 32 year run of the commercial hunting program on Santa Rosa Island.<br /> The federal government purchased the island in 1986 and Vail & Vickers retained a 25 year right to use and occupy most of the ranch complex at Bechers Bay. The NPS also permitted the hunting operation for that period. The deer and elk were eliminated in 2011.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a sandy dirt road, more than 300 feet long, running roughly east to west, from the ocean side near the landing dock road, toward the ranch barns. There are 6-foot high wooden fences on the north and south sides, creating a long, narrow corridor. To the east is a glimpse of the ocean. Toward the southeast, just beyond the fence, a long line of eucalyptus trees form a windbreak. The fences on the north side of this road, and some of the south side, are part of a series of ranch corrals. The corral fences are constructed of posts, with four wooden plank rails, each about one foot by twelve. <br />As you walk west along the road, toward the ranch buildings, on your left, you will see a long pen that parallels the eucalyptus windbreak. About half-way down the road, on the left is another pen with a large water trough. At the far end, straight ahead, is a large corral, adjacent to a blacksmith shop barn. A little to the right, farther away, is a larger horse barn with a large corral connected to it. Turning around to return east, back along the same road toward the ocean, this larger pen feeds into smaller pens, ending with a row of six small pens connected by a narrow fenced corridor",

The site contains little evidence of cargo and, like most of the historic wrecks in Biscayne National Park, the ship was likely salvaged after sinking. The ship’s stone ballast is basalt, though its exact origins are unknown. Ballast is not a unique marker for a ship’s origin or even for its last port of call, as it was commonly loaded and offloaded as needed. Ballast was often moved from one ship to another and was frequently shared after offl oading between two or more ships for ongoing voyages.<br /> <br /> The presence of rigging elements and iron fasteners throughout the site, as well as the size of the ballast piles and remaining wooden structural elements, points to a small to medium sized sailing vessel from the 19th century. She probably represents a fairly typical working sailing vessel from the Florida Keys. Her port of origin, destination, and the fate of those on board are, at this point, unknown.",

The British Navy sailed unopposed all the way up the Chesapeake Bay to Fort McHenry in Baltimore, burning Washington DC along the way. After the war, President James Madison hired a French engineer- Brevet Brigadier General Simon Bernard- to design a network of coastal defenses to protect the nation from future attacks. The construction of Fort Monroe began in 1819. During the early 1820’s construction required the delivery of 800,000 bricks a month. Most were produced within a mile of the fort. Large quantities of granite were brought in from quarries along the Susquehanna River in Maryland. The main fortification was completed by 1834.<br /> <br /> <strong>A Frenchman Comes to Help:</strong> Brevet Brigadier General Simon Bernard designed Fort Monroe. He was a member of the French Army’s Engineer Corps and former aide-de-camp to Napoleon. Bernard arrived in the United States in 1816 after being recommended to President James Madison by the Marquis de Lafayette. Madison placed Bernard at the head of the Board of Engineers, which was charged with constructing coastal defenses, forts, roads, and canals. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image description:</strong> 1831 color design drawing of Fort Monroe with caption reading: By 1831, construction of the fort was well underway, including some of the interior structures like those shown here.

            "audioDescription": "Friends Meetinghouse Interior 187 words Friends Meetinghouse Interior. 1 ¼ minutes. A wooden partition runs down the center of the meetinghouse, dividing the space into two equal halves. Large un-paned windows are cut into the partition. The windows can be closed off with sliding panels, but they’re usually left open. The walls are plain white, with milk-chocolate-brown wainscoting at the front of the room. The same brown color trims the doors, window frames, and central partition. The wood floors are painted grey. On each side of the partition, six rows of unadorned wooden pews face forward. Two more rows of pews are situated on risers at the front of the room, facing the other benches. A wide aisle runs down the center of each side. Please be careful, as there is a small step up from the aisle to the pews. Two square black heating stoves sit on the far left and right of the room, about halfway toward the front. Ten narrow rectangular windows illuminate the space with sunlight. A doorway on the left-hand side of the room leads to the porch. End of message.",

The road crosses the former Kautz Creek immediately to the west of the parking lot. The creek jumped to a new channel in the floods of 2006 and now crosses the road to the east of the parking lot. Restroom facilities (vault toilets), picnic tables, and a short interpretive trail leading to an overlook of the mountain are available at Kautz. The trail is also an access point for the 97-mile round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail, Indian Henrys, and Devils Dream backcountry camp. A camping permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry.<br /> <br /> The interpretive trail tells of the influence of dynamic glacier-covered Mount Rainier on the landscape at Kautz. Follow the trail to learn about how mudflows and floods have scarred the area, and how vegetation heals the scar after each major event. Staying on trails allows forests to recover naturally. This forest will continue to recover until the next disturbance occurs. The boardwalk is approximately 0.10-mile-long, 5.5 feet wide, and starts by crossing the road at the crosswalk. It has a flat surface with two sloped sections.<br /> <br /> When visiting this area be aware that debris flows, and glacial outburst floods can occur at any time and without warning, eroding stream banks and scouring everything in their path, including rocks and trees. If an earthquake occurs or you hear a prolonged rumbling, move quickly uphill, at least 100 feet above the riverbed.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The approach to Kautz from either direction is through old-growth forest that towers over the road. Upon arrival towering old-growth trees give way to younger, smaller trees and an expanse of sky is revealed. The parking area is on the south side of the road with parking on the west end of the lot, restrooms on the south edge in the center of the lot, and picnic tables at the east end. A crosswalk across the parking lot from the restrooms leads to a short boardwalk. Approximately 80 feet from the boardwalk trailhead, a dirt trail on the east side of trail leads to the park backcountry. The boardwalk continues on to an overlook of Mount Rainier. Five wayside exhibits on the boardwalk and one at the overlook related the history of mudflows in the area. The overlook is approximately 100 feet long by 16 feet wide and has a hardened natural surface. Much of the area is lined by benches. When not hidden by clouds, Mount Rainier can be seen up the original riverbed to the east. Across from the end of the boardwalk, large rocks, approximately 1.5 to 2 feet high on average, line the edge of the riverbed. Caution should be used near the edge of the riverbed to prevent falling.",

Interestingly enough, lighthouse construction was well underway at that sight, and the steamship narrowly missed the platform where several workers were encamped. The crew attempted to de-water the ship for three days, after which point they manned their lifeboats and headed ashore. The nearby<em>Tappahannock</em> rescued the captain and all 24 of his crew. By March 12, foul winter weather had made the coal-laden ship a total loss.</p> <p>Today, the wreck of <em>Arratoon Apcar</em> lies in ten to twenty feet of water near Fowey Rocks. The coral-encrusted lower hull and iron beams of the vessel can still be seen, along with some evidence of other structures, including remnants of the rudder and mast. The shallow depth of the wreck and the abundance of fish make it an attractive site for diving or snorkeling.</p>",

Early nineteenth century Indian Agents such as John C. Calhoun and Thomas McKenney used Christian missionaries to mold indigenous people into what they felt was the model American society. While this policy aimed to negate the traditional beliefs of the Choctaw people, the tribes saw the benefits of learning reading, writing, and arithmetic, knowing these skills would aid them in doing business with the ever-increasing numbers of settlers.  <br /> <br /> Bethel Mission was a half mile northwest of the pull-off.",

The 350,000-acre fertile Black Belt Prairie has been interrupted by human development leaving most of the remaining natural sections at only 10-20 acres. The Natchez Trace Parkway is actively protecting and restoring portions of prairie, returning it to a natural grassland that sustains native flowering plants and wildlife. <br /> <br /> The calcareous soil underlying the prairie was formed when the ocean receded after eons of depositing the remains of calcium rich shells. The resulting rich soil supported grasses like bluestems, switchgrass, Indian grass, and others. The prairie contained more than grasses. A diverse array of wildflowers, forbs, and legumes, oak forests, short leaf pines, glades and wetlands were common in certain areas depending upon the terrain.<br /> <br /> Long ago bison could be found on this prairie along with other common wildlife that still exist here in reduced numbers. Over time, the soil that once supported the lush prairie flora eventually supported the needs of planters who moved into the area. In an effort to sustain their families, the prairie was turned into farmland. <br /> <br /> Take a moment, stop and listen. Can you hear the call of the common prairie bird, the bob-white quail? Use your imagination to transport yourself back in time and listen for the bellow of a bull bison. ",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Cape Florida light at the southern tip of Key Biscayne was built in 1825. Fifty years later, the light served little purpose and was extinguished. Ships did not need to be warned of the island, but rather of the knife-edged reef that lay 5 miles offshore. Iron-pile lighthouses further south in the Keys had been quite successful at marking the reef, so the Light House Board contracted to have one built at Fowey Rocks, southeast of Cape Florida.</p> <p>Construction began in 1875 when a staging platform was built at the site. Materials were initially delivered to Soldier Key, then ferried out to the site as needed. Severe weather hampered the construction of the light for many months. Workers frequently stayed in tents on the staging platform in order to avoid wasted travel time. Twice during construction, workers became keenly aware of how important the light would be when ships headed straight for their camping platform suddenly ground to a halt on the nearby reef! <em>Arratoon Apcar</em> was one of these ships, and it too is now part of the Biscayne National Park Maritime Heritage Trail.</p> <p>The most time-consuming part of the construction was building the foundation and lower decks. Due to the aforementioned weather delays, this part of the process took over a year. The keeper's dwelling itself is a two-story octagonal building in the Second Empire style. It was painted white with green shutters. Rising from the center of the house is a 50' tall enclosed spiral stairwell leading up to the service room, the watch room and the lantern room. The tower is capped with a copper roof and ventilator ball. <br /> <br /> Fowey Rocks Lighthouse is within sight of both the park's northern islands and Cape Florida. The original Fresnel lens is now on display at the U.S. Coast Guard's National Aids to Navigation Training Center in Yorktown, Virginia, and it has been replaced with a modern solar-powered light visible some 17 miles out to sea. Though now part of Biscayne National Park, the light itself is still maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard as the \"Eye of Miami.\"</p>",

When Herbert Hoover was a boy, it was just an unnamed small stream of water trickling through marshy wetlands. Young Herbert and the neighborhood kids took their willow fishing poles about a quarter mile downstream to catch sunfish and catfish in the main creek.</p> <h2>Bridge on Downey Street</h2> <p>In March 1875, the citizens of West Branch petitioned Cedar County to build \"a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-downey-street-bridge.htm\">bridge on Downey Street</a>, near Jesse Hoover's blacksmith shop\" so wagons could get across. Twice constructed out of wood, it was finally rebuilt in 1917 as a steel beam and concrete span.</p> <h2>Flooding</h2> <p>Over time, farmers plowed the rain-absorbing prairie into cultivated fields, and as urban pavement increased rainfall runoff, the creek suffered from too little water in dry seasons and too much water in wet seasons. In 1993, floodwaters nearly reached the foundation of the nearby Friends Meetinghouse where the Hoovers once worshipped.</p> <h2>Erosion</h2> <p>Studies by the National Park Service revealed that floods have cut a channel in the streambed. That means when floodwaters come, soil is carved from the stream banks. This erosion is threatening the park's historic structures, artifacts, and documents. The National Park Service is looking for ways to control the force of the stream and reduce this erosion. These efforts will help prevent the loss of vegetation that supports native wildlife and anchors this protective green space.</p> <h2>Hoover's Legacy of Water Conservation</h2> <p>As Commerce Secretary for President Warren Harding and later as President, Herbert Hoover supported several environmental conservation measures, especially in regard to water resources development and fisheries management. Perhaps these viewpoints got their start in a young boy's memories of sun-dappled streams and the joy of exploring with his childhood friends the waters of Wapsinonoc Creek.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge 211 words Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge. 1 ½ minutes. The Hoover Creek meanders east-west through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The creek is just a few feet wide, with shrubs and a few trees along its banks. At Downey Street, the creek flows beneath the South Downey Street Bridge. Downey Street is a gravel road about 12 feet wide with a wooden boardwalk on either side. Elsewhere, there’s a strip of grass separating the boardwalks from the roadway, but at the bridge, the boardwalks come right up alongside the road. Boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. The bridge is about 25 feet long, bordered on each side by a four-foot-high wooden post-and-rail fence. It’s about ten feet down from the bridge to the creek below. From the east side of the bridge, the view is toward Parkside Drive, which runs north-south alongside the park. The Friends Meetinghouse is about 60 feet away, at 2:00 on the clock face. The visitor center is about 200 feet away, at 10:00. If you’re facing west from the bridge, the Presidential Library and Museum is at 11:00 and about 200 feet away. The Birth Cottage is at 2:00, about 60 feet from the bridge. End of message.",

This barkentine-rigged steamship had a 34 foot beam and displaced 2178 tons. The ship’s name is an English translation of the German <i>Erlkonig</i>, which was a mythical mischief-making elf in German literature. <i>Erl King</i> was primarily a cargo ship, but also had first-class accommodations for 50 passengers.</p> <p>Robertson and Company of London were the first owners, but <i>Erl King </i>sailed for several other firms under charter, and was captained by John Pinel while trading between China and Australia for the first few years of service.</p> <p><i>Erl King</i> ran aground at Tennessee Reef on January 18, 1881, but was removed, repaired, and returned to service. On December 16, 1891, she ran aground on Long Reef while on the way to New Orleans from Swansea, England. The steamer <i>Feliciana</i> noted that she was “afloat with two anchors out,” apparently while the crew was attempting to conduct repairs. Insurers from Key West reported that cargo was being salvaged, but the ship itself was doomed. Some of her machinery, as well as 200 tons of cargo were saved. Hull plates were reportedly used as scrap metal during World War II.</p> <p>The outline of <i>Erl King’s</i> hull and remains of its cargo can now be seen in 18 feet of water on Long Reef. All that remains of its cargo are barrel-shaped concrete objects that were once wooden barrels filled with dry concrete mix. The wooden barrels have long since been consumed by shipworms, leaving the concrete casts we can see today.</p>",

Today, Fort Hill is maintained as an open grass field as it would have looked in the mid to late 1800s when Captain Edward Penniman owned the land as a farm. There is a one-mile loop trail around the open field with two parking lots. The upper parking lot overlooks Nauset Marsh, a grassy, open marsh land that changes with the tides. There are some log stairs and slopes along the one-mile trail. This is a great habitat for birds with many marshy bushes surrounding the landscape.",

If you can capture that energy with a waterwheel, you can use it to grind grain and make a living. About 1853, the Alexander family built a grist mill here. In time, they replaced the waterwheel with more efficient turbines. Around 1900, the Alexanders sold the business to the Wilsons. After 70 years of using waterpower, the Wilsons switched to electric motors. Today, the family sells pre-bagged feed and fertilizer. Crank the handle on the audio player to hear “Skip” Wilson talk about the mill’s history.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Alexander/Wilson Mill. 453 words. Across the canal from this wayside graphic panel is a group of white, frame buildings. A long, low building with a metal roof lies alongside the canal. Beyond that are two taller buildings, both with green metal roofs. The one at the left lies parallel to the canal and has a small cupola with a flag on top; the other sits perpendicular to it. On the other side of the buildings is the scenic byway. A gravel parking lot lies to the right of the group of buildings with palettes of sacks stacked along the edge. Behind the buildings, to the left, a shallow spillway diverts excess water around Lock 37. Text on the panel reads, “Adapting with the Times. For generations, two families have made their livelihoods in the gristmill at Lock 37. The Alexander family built the mill about 1853 to grind wheat into flour. Water from Lock 37’s spillway turned the mill’s wooden waterwheel and grindstones. In the late 1800s the family replaced the waterwheel with smaller and more efficient turbines. The Wilson family bought the mill about 1900 and focused on milling feed for farm animals. They used water power until 1970, when they switched to electric machinery. Now their business consists mostly of animal food and fertilizer already bagged by suppliers.” The background of the panel features an 1890 colorized image of boat crew families stopping at Alexander Mill during a Sunday excursion. The image shows a long boat in the canal with the white mill building behind. The boat has cabins at the front and rear, with a flat deck in the middle. A woman, three men and three girls stand or sit on the boat. At the lower left is a black and white photograph of a man wearing work clothes and a billed cap lifting a cloth bag over a large, square funnel. The caption reads, “Thomas G. Wilson at work in the mill in 1940. Listen to his grandson “Skip” on the nearby audio station.” To the left of the graphic panel is a metal post with four push buttons on top. A small panel reads, “Life Along the Canal. “Skip” Wilson grew up in his family’s feed mill across the canal. Listen to him describe his experience, buttons 1-3. While traveling by canal boat in 1838, William Case wrote a funny journal entry. Was the incident here at Lock 37? Button 4.” The buttons are labeled: 1, The Finest Bread Flour, 50 seconds; 2, Swimming in Kernels of Corn, 25 seconds; 3, The Legger Elevator, 40 seconds; and 4, A Hubbub All Night, 60 seconds. The audio is powered by a hand crank on the front of the post. End of description.",

They are very social animals and usually congregate together in groups of up to ten members. As with human beings, communication and cooperation are hallmarks of the species. There is a dolphin \"language\" that consists of noises resembling whistles, whines, groans, and jaw claps. They use their vocalizations to coordinate feeding behavior; sometimes by corralling fish close to shore, making them easier to catch, or by herding schools of fish into a sort of \"ball\" that then serves as easy prey as each dolphin takes a turn swimming through and grabbing a bite to eat. For anyone who has been to a dolphin show at an aquatic park and seen the amazing tricks and stunts they have been trained to perform, fish ball feeding comes as no big surprise!<br /> <br /> Another extraordinary trait dolphins possess is their ability to echolocate using sonar. Using air sacks in their nasal cavities, they make clicking noises that are amplified in a structure called the melon located in their foreheads. These clicks (projected ahead of the dolphin at a rate of up to 2,000 per second!) bounce off objects (such as prey), return, and are funneled to the animal's inner ear and brain by way of the lower jaw. Besides making instantaneous sense of information produced by sonar-echolocation, the dolphin's brain is remarkable in another way. While sleeping, it effectively shuts down one half of its brain while the other half maintains a low level of alertness. In this way the dolphin retains its situational awareness and is able to keep rising to the surface for breaths of air. It will carry on this way for about two hours before switching and resting the other half of its brain. This is quite an evolutionary adaptation on the part of dolphins and other marine mammals which allows them to sleep at sea without drowning!</p>",

One of the joys of a visit to the shore is sighting a flotilla of these large, distinctive birds, silently gliding up or down the coastline with an occasional beat of their strong wings. Or watching them perched on dock pilings, looking like ambassadors for a sub-tropical lifestyle that winter-weary human snowbirds look forward to on each and every visit. Indeed, pelicans are so associated with the Florida coastal environment that we sometimes take them for granted, forgetting that we once almost lost them to the black hole of extinction.<br /> There are two species of pelicans in Florida, the more common brown pelican, which is a year-round resident, and the migratory American white pelican that spends its winters in Florida and the rest of its time in the northern states and Canada. Their common names describe them pretty accurately, and if seen side by side it would be hard to confuse them, though the brown pelican does have a good bit of white on its head and neck to go along with its grayish-brown body. They can grow upwards of 50 inches in length, weigh around nine pounds, and sport an impressive seven foot wingspan. Their most distinctive anatomical feature is doubtless the pouch which hangs below their long, lower bill. These elastic pouches can hold up to three gallons of water- three times as much liquid as can be contained in their stomachs! The ability to hold so much water at one time comes into play when it's time for the pelican to catch its main food source- fish.<br /> Pelicans require up to four pounds of fish (and perhaps some shrimp) per day to survive. So as they are flying at up to 70 feet high above the ocean, with their long necks folded backwards and their heads resting on their backs, their keen eyes are looking below for schools or even single fish in the water below. When they spot a likely meal, they dive straight down on their unsuspecting quarry and use their pouches to gather up as many fish as they can, along with a large amount of water. However, the water is squeezed out of their mouths, and the trapped fish are then swallowed. If the fish are not located right at the surface of the water, no problem, as pelicans are strong swimmers and can dive as deep as 30 feet. Striking the water at great speeds, as well as surfacing from many feet below, is made possible by the existence of air sacs beneath the bird's skin that cushions impacts and provides buoyancy.<br /> The pelican's pouch is useful for more than just feeding. It is also used as a cooling mechanism in the heat of the summer when water evaporates off the skin surface. But its use as a feeding trough is most appreciated by young pelicans when the parents bring them back a meal to the nest! While as adults they can live up to 30 years in the wild, they reach their breeding stage at about four years of age. Gregarious creatures by nature, they nest in large colonies, sometimes located in mangrove forests, primarily during the months of March through May. The male dutifully gathers and delivers reeds, grass, straw, and sticks to the female, who takes on the chore of building the nest in intertwined branches. She subsequently lays two to three eggs, and both parents will trade off incubating them for about one month. When the chicks are born they are altricial, meaning they are blind, featherless, and completely dependent upon their parents. They develop quickly though, and typically fledge about 75 days after hatching.<br /> Not too many things in nature pose a threat to healthy, adult pelicans as long as they have access to adequate amounts of fish and nesting habitat. It was not until the late 19'th century that their population numbers began to drop, and that was because their feathers suddenly become fashion items in the millinery trade and were in great demand to decorate ladies' hats! Additionally, many pelicans were killed by fishermen in the early 20'th century who thought that the birds were competing with them for fish. (The type of fish eaten by pelicans actually tend not to be the commercial species targeted by fishermen.) Because of these twin threats and their effect on pelican numbers, President Theodore Roosevelt set aside what would become the first National Wildlife Refuge- Pelican Island, near Vero Beach, Florida, in 1903.<br /> Though early protections for pelicans helped, widespread use of the pesticide DDT beginning in the 1940's led to decimated pelican (and other bird) species by the 1960's. (DDT causes birds' egg shells to thin to the point where they can be crushed even by the weight of a mother bird incubating them in the nest.) Pelican numbers had dropped so low that the federal government listed them as an endangered species in danger of extinction throughout their range in 1970. DDT was banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1972, and consequently pelican populations began to rebound. In fact, pelicans made such a comeback that in 1985 the populations in Florida and other eastern states were removed from the federal list of threatened and endangered species.<br /> While pelicans are once again a common sight in Florida and elsewhere, they still warrant our protection. They need wild, undeveloped habitat to nest in, and unpolluted waters from which to catch fish. Discarded fishing line entangles many birds each year and subjects them to a slow and unnecessary death. But the birds are a sign of hope that when people care and act, extinction of wildlife is not inevitable, and that we can share our fast growing state with its wild creatures, including one of Florida's best loved- the pelican.<br />  </p>",

They dug the foundation, made the bricks, and framed in the building using local materials. The design was inspired by illustrations in Asher Benjamin’s popular 1806 stylebook, The American Builder’s Companion. The Frazees chose elements of the Federal style, something that was familiar to them. This style emphasizes balance and symmetry. For the Frazees, the house symbolized success. Although they initially had financial losses when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> cut through their property, this new transportation route ultimately was a benefit. They went from living in a wilderness outpost to being established farmers. They may have used part of their settlement from suing the state of Ohio to purchase the hardware and glass used inside.<br /> <br /> Minor changes have been made to the house during the past two centuries. The second owner, John Hynton, added a kitchen “ell” in the back, with a woodburning stove. The Frazees had most likely cooked on the hearth. Later residents added electricity and a toilet. However, the room layout has changed very little, a testimony to the timeless Federal style.<br /> <br /> More recently, the building has shown signs of shifting. In 2011 the National Park Service closed the Frazee House to monitor cracks in the foundation and assess damages. The building remains closed pending funding to stabilize and re-open the historic building.<br /> <br /> To learn more, cross Canal Road to the Towpath Trail where there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/frazee-house-towpath-panel.htm\">second graphic panel</a> about the Frazee family. A short distance north, additional exhibits explore life at the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/alexander-wilson-mill.htm\">Alexander-Wilson Mill</a>. For a more rugged hike, pick up the Sagamore Bridle Trail at the base of the driveway and turn left to follow it northward. To head south, go straight across the wooden bridge and beyond before veering off to the left.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Frazee House. 392 words A wayside graphic panel sits at the back, right corner of this red brick house. The house is in the shape of an “L” with the longer front being two stories and the smaller rear wing being one story. The front part has a pair of chimneys at either end. The rear wing has a single chimney at the back. A granite slab forms a step at the door into the back wing. Paved paths lead from the panel to the door and around the back of the house to doors on the other side of the rear wing and into the main house. A parking lot is to the left of the panel. At the back of the parking lot is a small restroom. The graphic panel shows a picture of the house from the front, showing the central door with windows on either side and along the upper story. Text on the panel reads, \"Symbol of Success. This house reflects Stephen and Mahitable Frazee’s transition from being subsistence pioneers to successful farmers. They may have come to the Cuyahoga Valley as tenant farmers as early as 1811. Within 10 years they were able to buy more than 600 acres. The Frazees built this substantial brick house in 1825-27 on a prominent hillside site. Both were signs of success – this family was here to stay. The Frazees based many of the house’s Federal-style features on Asher Benjamin’s book ‘The American Builder’s Companion.’ A popular 1806 style guide, the book did not include how-to-do-it instructions. Ultimately the Frazees built their home with bricks they made themselves using local materials and local knowledge.” A quote from the book reads, “Strength, convenience, and beauty, are the principal things to be attended to.” At bottom right is a façade and floorplan from the book, showing a plain, rectangular house with small wings at either end. The caption reads, “The Frazees were inspired by Asher Benjamin’s plan for a country house. What similarities do you see? Notice the boxy shape and how the windows, chimneys, and roofline are balanced and symmetrical.” At top right are images of two fragments from dishes, both covered in decorations including flowers and classical-shaped vases. The caption reads, “Fragments discovered by archeologists indicate the dishware was imported, probably on the canal, and typical of the middle class.” End of description.",

Here they raised their family, farming to put food on the table. Initially they probably lived in a log-style cabin further up the hill along the former road. Early tax records indicate that the Frazee family had horses and a cow. After the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> was built here in 1825, we see a shift in the Frazees’ practices. Tax records after 1827 show Stephen Frazee had up to 8 “milch” (milk) cows—about 7 more than a subsistence family. They probably shipped out excess milk and dairy products on the canal, getting paid in cash. In time they became respected members of their community, raising children who become teachers, ministers, and farmers.<br /> <br /> The house has been a home to a farming family for most of its existence. Stephen Frazee sold it to John and Elizabeth Hynton. After John’s passing in 1865, Elizabeth and a son-in-law nurtured and grew one of the more profitable farms in the area. After Elizabeth Hynton passed, the house only changed hands a couple of times before being purchased by the National Park Service. In the 1980s, preservationists and historical carpenters stabilized the house. Time is beginning to take its toll though, resulting in the temporary closure of the house in 2012. It waits again, for more work, as it stands guard over the valley.<br /> <br /> Cross Canal Road to get a closer look at the architecture, use the vault toilet, and read a second graphic panel.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Audio Description: Frazee Family. 307 words Across the canal and scenic byway from this wayside graphic panel is a plain, red-brick, two-story house. It has a brown shingled roof with a pair of brick chimneys at each end. A white door sits in the middle of the front with a pair of white-trimmed windows on either side. The upper story has five windows. The canal in front of the panel has water in the bottom and is crossed by a flat wooden bridge at the right. Trees surround a field on the other side of the towpath with a horse trail along the edge of the field. The panel has an illustration of the house from the right side, revealing a one-story wing at the rear with another chimney at the back. The winter scene features snow and bare trees. A man in a jacket and hat carries a bucket at the rear of the house. Text on the panel reads, “Impact of the Canal. Stephen and Mehitable Frazee experienced both the challenges and benefits of the Ohio and Erie Canal. They arrived in this area in the early 1800s, when it was sparsely settled. They lived in a log cabin, cleared forests for farmland, and were mostly self-sufficient. Canal construction in 1825 flooded their fields and destroyed their crops. The family had to buy feed, flour, and seeds for several years. Stephen sued the State of Ohio and won a settlement of $130. The Frazees built the brick farmhouse across the road about the same time the canal opened. The canal provided the Frazees and all the local farmers with an effective means to send their products to market. “Both the house and canal symbolized greater prosperity. What are positive and negative consequences of public works where you live? “Cross the road and explore the Frazee House’s exterior.” End of description.",

Across the road at the left is a two-story, stone house. The front is painted cream and it has a gray shingled roof. Long porches with white railings extend across the front at both the ground level and along the second floor. Wide steps lead up to the main entrance on the second floor. A dormer window extends from the roof above the front door. To the right of the house along a side road is a long red barn with a metal roof. The other side of the towpath is lined with trees with fields behind. The right side of the graphic panel has a photograph of the Gleason House from around 1900. The house is missing the dormer above the door and it has a chimney at the right end. A tall-sided wagon sits on the sloped, unpaved road in front of the house. The caption explains that the owners of the house were part of the extended family that ran a store and tavern at the Canal Exploration Center. At lower left is a photograph showing the front of the house covered with scaffolding. The caption reads, “The National Park Service rebuilt the house’s foundation and restored stonework and woodwork in 2005.” Text at top left reads, “Preserving Rural Scenery. The 1850s house and barn across the road remained in the Gleason family for over 100 years. Edmund Gleason ran a sawmill in Bedford and by 1854 owned over 300 acres here. Records indicate he may not have farmed the land himself but leased it to others. Today some of the Gleason acreage is farmed as part of the Countryside Initiative. This program preserves rural scenery and revitalizes the valley’s farming heritage. Farmers lease historic properties and use sustainable practices to limit their impact on the environment.” End of description.",

            "audioDescription": "Lock 39 Trailhead. 470 words A three-sided, covered kiosk sits at the side of the smooth, unpaved Towpath Trail next to a small bench. One side has a bulletin board with current news, while the other two sides have graphic panels. On the other side of the path is the canal, water at its bottom and a steep, brush-covered bank on the other side. A wooden post next to the canal has a small sign that reads “Lock 39, Towpath Trail.” Going left on the path leads to Cleveland Metroparks. Going right leads to the Canal Exploration Center. Trees and bushes line the side of the path opposite the canal. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location at the northern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Lock 39 Trailhead. The Rockside name probably comes from the many small quarries that once dotted this area. Travel by foot, bicycle, or rail to learn about Ohio’s transportation history. Canal Exploration Center is 1.75 miles south on the Towpath Trail. The CanalWay Center of Cleveland Metroparks is about four miles north. From the nearby trailhead parking lot, cross the footbridge to reach Rockside Station. This is the northern starting point for the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

Businesses often sprang up at these spots, making use of the stopped traffic or the power of the falling water. Here at Lock 37, there was a tavern and a store. During the mid-1800s, the Alexanders built a mill across from this tavern. In time, that mill was sold to the Wilson family, who still own the business today. Regulating a constant four feet of water in the canal is a challenge. From the beginning, engineers struggled with too much or too little water. Near this busy lock is a flood gate that allows excess water to be released from the canal into the nearby Cuyahoga River. Even today this lock remains busy—being near the Towpath Trail, the Wilson Feed Mill, and the access road to the Fitzwater Trainyard. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Audio Description. Lock 37 and Water Control Gate. 432 words. At this point on the Towpath Trail near the concrete marker for mile 14 there are two small graphic wayside panels. On the canal side is one titled “Lock 37” which sits next to the old lock which has water at its bottom. The sides of the lock are weathered, worn concrete covering the upper part and the underlying blocks visible below. The gates are gone, but there is a stationary barrier, stone at the bottom, wooden beams above, which blocks the downstream end. There is no guardrail at the edge of the 10-foot-deep lock. The graphic panel features an artist’s illustration of a freight boat in the lock in 1863. A large white building beyond the lock on the left is the Alexander/Wilson Mill, still there today partially hidden by trees. The illustration shows several buildings on the right, now gone, which were the Vanoucek tavern, store, house and barn. Text on the panel reads, “Family Businesses. Canal locks attracted businesses to serve canal boat crews, locals, and farmers. Here at Lock 37 the Vanouceks ran a tavern and general store and the Alexander family operated a gristmill. A spillway allowed excess water to flow around the lock. The mill used the spillway’s waterpower to grind grain into flour and livestock feed.” The other wayside panel, titled “Floods and Repairs,” is down the path to the right as you face the lock. It sits on the other side of the path near the river which lies close to the canal at this point. Just past the panel is a wooden bridge without railings that crosses a small channel which carries water between the canal on the left and the river on the right. Four gear-like mechanisms line the right side of the bridge which control openings in a gate below. Text on the panel reads, “Regulating Water Level. Canal engineers did not foresee the intensity of valley floods and later added structures to control water levels. Here a National Park Service worker adjusts a floodgate built in the early 1900s. Look closely at the actual structure. Can you see the small gates below where the worker is standing? Gates are opened to drain off water so canal repairs can be made here or downstream. During floods, excess water is diverted to protect the canal from being damaged. A waste way takes the water to the Cuyahoga River.” The photograph on the panel shows a man in a National Park Service uniform using a long metal rod to turn one of the gear mechanisms.

On summer weekends when conditions allow, volunteers demonstrate how a lock operates. Canals were designed as waterways without waterfalls or a current. Locks were built to raise or lower canal boats wherever there was a significant change in elevation. A lock works much like a toy in a bathtub. If a boat needs to go up, water is let in through butterfly valves in the upstream gate. The chamber is filled until it is level with the upstream water. If the boat needs to go down, water is let out through butterfly valves in the downstream gate. When the water is low enough to match the downstream level, the downstream gates can be opened. To fit inside the locks on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>, boats could be no more than 75 feet long.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Lock 38. 470 words This wayside graphic panel sits at the downstream end of the lock. Behind the exhibit, a small wooden footbridge crosses to the other side. To the right of the bridge are the heavy wooden gates that close this end of the lock. Each gate has a long wooden beam attached along its top and extending out to the side. A similar pair of gates sit at the upper end of the lock to the right. On the other side of the towpath is a white-frame building that held a tavern and store. To the left of the lock is a road and bridge crossing the canal. That road ends at the scenic byway on the far side. The inside walls of the lock are made of concrete-covered stone blocks. The tops of the walls are even with the ground and there is no guardrail. At the left side of the panel, text reads, “Lock 38 is one of the few restored, working locks along the historic Ohio and Erie Canal. Locks are like elevators – they raise and lower boats between levels. State engineers designed 44 locks to deal with a 395-foot rise in elevation from Cleveland to Akron. Heavy wooden gates enclose the boat-sized stone chamber. Lock operators added water to the chamber to raise a boat headed upstream. They drained out water to lower a boat headed downstream.” The right side of the panel has a drawing of one of the wooden gates with its beam extending over the lock wall to the right, a man pushing on the end. Arrows indicate features of the diagram. The caption next to the end of the beam reads, “Balance beam. A long beam balances out each heavy gate. The beam makes it possible to open and close the gate by hand.” At the bottom of the gate is a small door called a wicket. The caption reads, “The gates cannot open unless the water level is the same on both sides. A valve at the bottom of each gate, called a wicket, lets water in or out.” At the top of the gate is a long shaft called a wicket stem connected to the wicket below. The caption reads, “Boatmen opened and closed the wicket using a large wrench to turn the wicket stem and pivot the wicket.” The gate itself is called a whaler gate. The caption reads, “Two gates at each end keep the water in the chamber.” At lower left is a photograph of the lock empty of water, showing the smooth vertical walls and a flooring made of wooden beams. The caption reads, “In the 1980s National Park Service workers restored Lock 38 to how it looked in 1907. This was just after the state lined locks with concrete. Notice the wooden floor.” End of description.",

Its waters originate in the melting snow of Yosemite's high country in the southeastern portion of the park. The river plunges over Nevada and Vernal Falls, then meanders across the flat Yosemite Valley. It continues its journey down the Merced River Canyon and spills into the San Joaquin Valley.

            "audioDescription": "The Sentinel Bridge Parking area is a prime spot to experience Yosemite Falls. The north side of the parking lot is lined with a wooden fence that separates the sidewalk from the large open meadow that shows views of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. Bus stop #11 stands at the southeast side of the parking lot. Four benches, a green recycle bin, brown trash bin, and a small, wood, shelter are all by the bus stop. Further south from the bus stop, a crosswalk leads across the street to the Sentinel Bridge. A few wayside exhibits are located in the parking lot, along the meadow. <br /><br />The first exhibit panel is titled Ecotones: Life on the Edge, and has a faint background photo of a small patch of meadow, containing long grasses and sedges, surrounded with pine trees. Panel text reads, the zone where two habitats merge is called an ecotone. The meadow/forest ecotone is visible here. The water-saturated meadow gives way to the oaks and towering conifers, which can't survive in flood-prone areas. The greatest diversity of wildlife exists in these transition areas where a variety of food and shelter is present. <br /><br />The Changing Landscape - By the 1860s, hotel owners were converting meadows to pastures, gardens, orchards, and hay fields. They suppressed fires because they threatened wooden buildings. They also channeled the Merced River to control flooding and drained boggy areas of the Valley. <br /><br />Black and white photo: Black and white spotted cows graze in an open meadow with towering cliffs surrounding them. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley, 1918.<br /><br />Meadows in Peril - Only a century ago the meadows of Yosemite Valley were far more extensive than they are today. With the right balance of water, fire, and soil conditions, a meadow can survive indefinitely. But with the altercation of the water table and fire cycle in the Valley, the natural balance was lost. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: An aerial view of a meadow below the iconic Half Dome shows larges patches of open meadows with trees scattered here and there. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley Meadows, 1899<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: An aerial view of a meadow below the iconic Half Dome shows dense stands of trees with only a few small patches of meadow showing.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley Meadows, 1991<br /><br />Next to the first wayside exhibit, a second one is titled Meltdown, and has a faint background photo of a waterfall coming over a tall, granite rockface. Panel text reads, the high-country snowpack is Yosemite's reservoir. As the snow melts in the spring, torrents of water cascade over Yosemite Falls (on the cliff before you) and over dozens of other waterfalls.<br /><br />Upstream, shallow soil on granite slopes absorbs very little water, Once the snow is gone, usually by late summer, most of Yosemite's waterfalls quickly dwindle. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: A close up view of a wet rock face. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Autumn<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: A thin stream of water falls over a large granite rock wall. White ice has built up on the rock face on both sides of the thin waterfall. At the bottom of the fall, a pile of snow has built up. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Winter<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 3: Two waterfalls are stacked on top of each other. The upper fall is full of water and the lower fall has a slightly more narrow, shorter, stream of water.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Spring<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 4: The two waterfalls that are stacked on top of each other have dwindled down to a think, hair-like strand of a waterfall.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Summer<br /><br />Quote: \"You should stop a while...a little below the head of the fall beside the enthusiastic throng of starry, comet-like waters to learn something of their strength, their marvelous variety of forms, and above all their glorious music, gathered and composed from the snow-storms, hail-, and rain- and wind-storms that have fallen on their glacier-sculptered, domey, ridgy basin.\" - John Muir, The Yosemite, \"How Best to Spend One's Yosemite Time\"<br /><br />Lost Arrow - Seasonal changes affect more than just the waterfalls. Water seeping into cracks and fissures in the cliff face freezes and expands in winter, wedging off blocks of stone. This action constantly reshapes Yosemite Valley. Lost Arrow, the isolated granite pinnacle to the right of Yosemite Falls, was once a part of a solid wall of rock. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A granite spire is shown from above, rising up like a tower. <br />Caption: Lost Arrow from above<br /><br />A nearby sign reads, flood water level, 11pm, January 2, 1997. A double-sided arrow points from left to right. The sign itself stands over six feet high. <br />",

            "audioDescription": "Mudcatcher. 241 words The towpath here winds between the canal and the river with woods on either side. On the canal side is a graphic wayside panel titled “Mudcatcher, Filtering the Flow.” On the far side of the canal, a stream runs down between two steep slopes towards the canal and river. Between the slopes is a dam-like structure made of large stone blocks. An opening in the middle allows the water to fall in a short waterfall into a pool below when the stream is running. Text on the panel reads, “Soil washing into the canal created an ongoing problem. Storms eroded upland fields and hillsides left treeless by farmers. Engineers usually built culverts under the canal to carry streams into the Cuyahoga River. Here the intermittent Galley Run flows directly into the canal. A mudcatcher – the stone structure in front of you – held back the soil in a basin. Crews dug out the mud and debris during the dry season. “With its basin full of muck, the mudcatcher no longer functions. Do you see sediment building up in the canal today? The National Park Service periodically needs to dredge this watered section.” The panel has a photograph of the scene in front of you with the parts labeled. Arrows indicate the steep sides of the ravine cut by the stream, the historic dam-like mudcatcher structure itself, and a pile of dirt and gravel between the mudcatcher and the canal.

All around are thick woods, deciduous trees mixed with evergreen hemlocks. A sign post tells us that the Ledges Shelter is one-quarter mile to the left as you face the graphic panel, the Octagon is one-third mile straight ahead, while going in the other direction leads to the Ledges Trail, a long loop which circles this entire geologic formation. At the opposite side of the crossroads is a bench. The panel has a map of the entire Ledges, an oval shaped area with your current location a third of the way from the right end. The Ledges Shelter lies to the left with the Overlook and a trail to Kendall Lake at the far left. At top of the map is the trail to the Octagon. At bottom, a trail passes the Ice Box Cave and skirts the rocky cliffs along that edge. At far right, a side trail leads to the Happy Days Lodge. Text on the panel reads, “As you wander through the unusual environment of the Ritchie Ledges, you will encounter evidence of an ancient landscape, one that has witnessed great changes in climate and terrain. You will be exploring the remnants of primeval stream beds deposited when the area was a steamy swamp 320 million years ago. Over time, these sand and pebble sediments were compacted into rock, now called Sharon Conglomerate. Erosion has carved the rock into the form you see today. Life on the Ritchie Ledges is fragile.

A moment of thoughtless rock climbing can erase years of growth.” At upper right is a drawing of small hemlock branches with seed cones at the tips. The caption reads, “The Ledges are cooler and moister than the surrounding area, attracting plants and animals adapted to this microenvironment. Evergreen eastern hemlocks, shown here, are perhaps the most striking of these. They hint of a time when their kind thrived in the cooler, moister climate that followed glacial retreat 14,000 years ago.” End of description.",

You may notice the broad, elevated coastal plain stretching in front of you, one of six on the island. These plains are remnants of what geologists call \"marine terraces\"-ancient shorelines carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created today by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in the folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today-Santa Barbara Island, as well as the other Channel Islands, continues to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, the Channel Islands have been separated from the mainland. And unlike the four northern islands, which were once joined as a single, \"super island\" known as Santarosae, Santa Barbara Island has never been connected to another neighboring island.<br /> <br /> For decades, however, scientists assumed that the northern islands (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands) were connected to the mainland by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <strong>Santarosae</strong><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing near a steep coastal cliff, with an ocean cove below. If you are facing the cove, you are facing west. In the distance, a flat, grassy plateau slopes down into two points that stretch out into the sea, creating another distant cove, but its shoreline is obscured by the closer landform. To the right, or north, and just off shore, is Shag Rock-a large sea rock with a steep shoreline.<br />A wooden bench, with two \"legs\" and a wooden plank seat, is near the edge of the cliff providing a splendid view of the right side of the cove. Be careful if you decide to sit on it, as it is covered with white bird droppings. In front of the bench, low wooden railroad tie planks lie on the ground, marking the edge of the cliff<br />At your feet, the gritty soil has tiny fragments of broken shells and white rocks. Much of the ground is covered with this bare earth, but there are patches of coastal sagebrush, ice plant, and Greene's dudleya, a pale grey-green succulent with thick, fleshy leaves clustered in a rosette shape.<br /><br />To the east and west are stands of coreopsis, on thick stalks with feathery green leaves and mounds of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers in the spring, and brown, shaggy clumps or dried leaves and blooms in late summer and fall. <br />",

A rustic log cabin sits on a small hilltop, overlooking Tuolumne Meadows, the river, and the granite landscape that surrounds it. The front of the cabin has a wooden door with a window, offcentered to the right, and a window with shutters on each side end of the building. There are now windows in the back. The nearby wayside exhibit is titled, The McCauley Cabin, and has a black and white photo on the left, two-thirds of the panel. The photo shows a man, a woman, and two young blonde girls standing in front of them. The young girl to the left is shorter than the girl on right, who is wearing checkered pants. A log cabin home is in the background, with boulders and trees surrounding it.<br /><br />Caption: The campground caretakers stayed in the McCauley Cabin. As a young girl, Margaret Eissler (in checkered pants) lived here with her family for six summers (1956-1961). Her childhood experience instilled a love for Tuolumne Meadows that influenced all aspects of her life. She later returned as a ranger-naturalist.<br /><br />Panel text reads, Following Jean Baptiste Lembert's death, the McCauley brothers bought his land for pasture in 1897 and built this cabin. When the land was again put up for sale, Sierra Club members raised money to purchase it in 1912 to keep it uncommercialized. <br /><br />The Sierra Club opened a small campground, and summer after summer campers returned here to renew their connection with these meadows and mountains. In 1973, the National Park Service bought the Sierra Club property. <br /><br />Tuolumne Meadows has found its way into many people's hearts. Follow the river. Take some time to explore. Discover for yourself the wonders of these high meadows.",

Boats carried timber and farm products to Lake Erie and returned with manufactured goods and specialty foods.<br /> <br /> Unlike Ohio’s rivers, canals offered a consistent depth for boats to travel and no current. Yet the land they travel through is not flat. Water is travelling north from a high point near Portage Lakes in Akron, down 395 feet to the level of Lake Erie at Cleveland. Whenever the drop of water or land was significant, a lock was installed to move boats up or down. In effect, locks acted as elevators for boats. Water would be let in from the higher side to raise the water level, or let out on the lower side to lower the boats.<br /> <br /> Originally locks were made of carved sandstone, and often lined or “puddled” with clay to keep them from leaking. But water takes its toll. During 1905-1906 renovations, this sandstone lock was refaced with a new concrete surface, now also wearing away.<br /> <br /> Along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>, a graphic panel describes the function of the locks.

            "audioDescription": "Here on the canal is an old lock structure. At the side of the towpath near the lock a graphic panel describes the function of the locks. At the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile of the 44 stair-step locks between Lake Erie in Cleveland and the portage summit in Akron. To the right of the panel is a bench made of wooden beams between two concrete bases. Across the path from the canal is an overgrown field backed by woods.  The canal and lock contain water. The sides of the lock are made of stone and concrete. At the left, or northern end, a small footbridge crosses the lock to a grassy area on the other side. The end of the lock closest to the graphic panel is closed with a thick, wooden barrier keeping the water level feet below ground level. On the northern side of the barrier gate, the water is ten feet below the ground level. Exercise caution near the lock as there is no guardrail. Water trickles under the barrier to fall into the deep lock.  The background of the graphic shows a black and white photograph of a functional lock. The view up the lock shows the block walls and water splashing through the partially open, heavy wooden gate at the end. A note tells us that “Canal managers covered the blocks with concrete during a 1905-1906 renovation.” Along the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile with braille labels of the lock system. The edges of the profile can be sharp. Lake Erie at 573 feet is at the left end. Forty-four locks form stair steps up to 968-foot-high Portage Summit at the right end. In between are Boston at Lock 32, Peninsula at Lock 29, and Mustill Store at Lock 15. Text on the panel reads,   “Stepping Up and Down. Locks act like elevators, raising and lowering boats. Most locks along the Ohio and Erie Canal had a lift of about nine feet. It took 44 locks to manage the 395-foot elevation rise between Cleveland and Akron. Canal engineers numbered locks in both directions from Akron’s Portage Summit. In operation from 1827 to 1913, the canal turned the sleepy village of Cleveland into a major port. Boats carried timber and farm products to Lake Erie and returned with manufactured goods and specialty foods.”  End of description. ",

Documents reveal that Ma Parker had her tavern on or near this location by the time of canal construction. Artifacts uncovered here also suggest this was a pre-canal tavern. The original building was the southern half of the structure. By 1841, Moses Gleason bought the property and sold it to his son. Isaac Gleason added the southern part of the building, turning it into a store serving travelers waiting at Lock 38. The Gleason family continued to live here until the early 1900s. After that, the building became a residence and later housed a blacksmith shop. As the building wore down, it became a multi-resident structure.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service purchased the property and began historic reconstruction in the early 1990s. In 1996 it opened as Canal Visitor Center. Today it operates as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a>, where visitors can explore <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> history through hands-on exhibits.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Tavern and Store. 390 words At the side of the wide towpath, to the right of a graphic panel, is a two-story, white-frame building that looks like two houses stuck together. Each side has a peaked gable over its front and dark green shutters at the windows. The left section of the building had a covered porch along its front with a double door in the middle and a window on either side. On the left side of the porch is a bench. A barrel sits to the right of the doors. The ground slopes down along the left side of the building, revealing a stone basement. In front of the left end of the building is a lifesaver ring hanging from a post. The right section of the building has a single door at its left side and two windows to the right. A water-filled lock is on the other side of the towpath with large, functioning wooden gates. Exercise caution near the lock as there is no guardrail. Text on the graphic panel reads, “Canal Rest Stop. In the mid-1800s, the Gleason family ran a tavern and store in this building. Here boat crews and passengers could get something to eat and drink. They also could buy supplies such as tea, sugar, tobacco, needles, and thread. Tour the exhibits in the old tavern-store. Decide for yourself whether building the Ohio and Erie Canal was worth the tax dollars.” The lower right of the panel shows a color illustration of a canal boat approaching the tavern and store on the left. The lock gates stand open to receive the boat. At the rear of the boat is a dark-skinned man in a top hat and long black coat. The caption reads, “John Malvin, a free black from Virginia, became a businessman and civic leader in Cleveland. This scene shows Malvin in about 1853 as the captain of the ‘Auburn.’ His crew included both blacks and whites.” At the bottom left is a photograph from around 1910 of the tavern and store building, looking much as it does today except for a smaller building at the back-left corner. The caption reads, “After the canal era, the building became a residence and later housed a blacksmith shop. Notice that the building on the left – probably a barn – is no longer there.” End of description.",

The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> was maintained at a depth of four feet. Here the canal must cross the Cuyahoga River’s largest tributary, <a href=\"https://www.tinkerscreek.org/about-us/\">Tinkers Creek</a>. Using technology first developed by the Romans, canal engineers made an aqueduct to carry the built waterway over the natural stream. Originally it was a bit farther north. However, shortly after the canal was constructed, Tinkers Creek flooded the aqueduct, proving how unpredictable it can be. The aqueduct was re-built at its present location, but in time suffered more flooding, debris, and leakage. The previous aqueduct was built by the King Iron Bridge Company, but even iron cannot stand against floodwaters. In 2011 the national park replaced it with this concrete one.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Tinkers Creek Aqueduct. 319 words This wayside graphic faces Tinkers Creek which flows through woods and fields to the right to reach the Cuyahoga River. To the left of the panel is a wooden footbridge with metal railings that carries the Towpath Trail over the creek. Farther to the left is a concrete aqueduct which allows the canal to pass over the creek. The aqueduct and the canal have water at this location. To the left of the aqueduct is a modern concrete bridge with guardrails on the scenic byway. Near the graphic on the left is a bench alongside the path. The right side of the panel features a black and white photograph of a worker using a long pole to measure water depth in the creek next to the aqueduct after a flood in 1916. At that time the aqueduct was made of steel truss. The man stands on the outside of the aqueduct balancing on two steel girders. To the right of where he is standing a stream of water is leaking from the aqueduct. The creek bed below has broken logs and smaller debris in it. The caption notes that the steel span lasted nearly 90 years. At lower left is an aerial photograph from 1980 showing the former steel aqueduct. At that time the Canal Road bridge was also made of steel truss. In 1993 the Towpath Trail was built and the Canal Road truss bridge was replaced. Text on the panel reads, “Bridge over Flooding Waters. Aqueducts solve a problem but create other problems. An aqueduct – a water-filled bridge – was built here to carry the canal over Tinkers Creek, the Cuyahoga River’s largest tributary. But the aqueduct leaked and was vulnerable to flood damage. It needed constant repairs. It had to be moved or replaced four times. The present concrete span, built in 2011, replaced the steel aqueduct shown in the two photographs.” End of description.",

            "audioDescription": "Waste Weir. 300 words Here on the canal is a graphic panel titled “Mud and Muskrats.” To the left of the panel is a concrete spillway, called a weir, along the edge of the canal. A concrete slab along the top passes over openings. During floods, water can flow through the openings, down the spillway and through a culvert that passes under the towpath. The scenic byway passes close to the canal on the far side, so you may hear vehicles passing. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canal needed never-ending maintenance. To keep a four-foot depth of water, crews had to patch leaks. Floods and burrowing muskrats were common problems. Crews also had to remove mud from the bottom with shovels and wheelbarrows. Later they used steam-shovel-like dredges. After the canal was built, State of Ohio engineers added special water-control features to handle problems with floodwaters. Here excess water spilled over a dam-like waste weir. A waste way carried the water to the Cuyahoga River. More complex weirs in other locations had gates, but this one did not.” The background of the panel shows a late 1800s photograph of a work crew after dredging mud from the canal bottom. They sit and stand on a canal boat with a steam-shovel extending from its front. At the lower left of the panel is a map showing the log weir and waste way as they appeared in the late 1800s. The current concrete weir was built in the 1906. Originally an open waste channel snaked from the canal to the nearby Cuyahoga River in the lower left of the map. In the upper right of the panel is a photograph of a common muskrat. It has fur in shades of brown with silver tips and a hairless tail. End of description.",

They brought their cultural customs, languages, and belief systems with them. Enslavement on isolated island and coastal plantations in the lower Atlantic coast created a unique culture with deep African retentions. Descendants of these enslaved people and their traditions are known as Gullah Geechee.<br /> <br /> Following the Revolutionary War, fourteen plantations were established on St. Simons Island, including the land that is now Fort Frederica National Monument. Owners used enslaved people to work the land. Burial sites were typically located on land unsuitable for farming or other commercial pursuits. The burials at Fort Frederica were discovered in the summer of 2019. Research is ongoing to discover more details about the lives of the individuals found here.<br /> <br /> The use of seashells, while not unique to Gullah Geechee culture, has been described as a connection to the water that transported them and would hopefully take them back to Africa after death.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

When gabbro was melted with bog ore, the impurities in the ore latched onto elements in the gabbro.

One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park, and six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm one often sees harbor seals or other pinnipeds (seals and sea lions). The island's expansive and isolated beaches offer sea lions, harbor seals, and elephant seals an ideal combination of safety from predators and freedom from human disturbance, making the beaches an ideal place to rest, breed, and pup.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds, along with a variety of other marine species, also depend on the extensive kelp forests found in these cold waters. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of alga that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but also those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use toothpaste are all using a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine algae and plants such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, research, and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including two on Santa Rosa Island-around Carrington and Skunk Points), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Protecting the Islands</b><br /> In 1980 Congress established Channel Islands National Park to protect, preserve, and teach us about the islands' fragile resources and unique past, including the Island Chumash and those who came after them, the island fox that recovered from the brink of extinction, the restoration of the islands' native plants, the complicated geologic story, the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine that occurs nowhere else on Earth, the kelp forest and its inhabitants that depend on these isolated islands for survival, and the wide variety of other natural and cultural resources not mentioned in this trail guide. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, we can help preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Rosa Island and the rest of the Channel Islands. But don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to safeguard-to preserve-the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park,</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a long curve of sandy beach, at the bottom of Water Canyon, near the middle of Bechers Bay. At your feet, scattered across the sand are tiny broken shells, driftwood, a few small rounded rocks, and broken pieces of kelp stalks and leaves.<br /><br />The ocean water near the shore is light turquois blue in color, growing darker blue further from the shore. <br /><br />On the inland side, the beach rises up into shallow, sandy dunes, mounds covered with small green plants. These curve up to meet the base of rock cliffs that tower almost 50 feet above the beach. Tall grass grows at the top of those cliffs.<br /><br />The cliffs follow the curve of Bechers Bay. If you are facing the ocean, to the left, or north, in the distance, is the wooden pier. It is a long narrow platform, supported of tall upright poles, extending a couple of hundred yards out into the ocean. <br /><br />To the right, or southeast, just past the top of the cliff, is a hillside covered with a dark green stand of Torrey pines. Beyond that is Skunk Point, a sandy spit of beach in the far distance. <br />",

From November 1942 through December 1943, Ike’s diplomacy and determination created a multinational headquarters that controlled British and American units. His forces liberated North Africa, Sicily and Southern Italy which weakened Nazi Germany’s strategic position.<br /> <br /> The culmination of Eisenhower’s success in building an allied force was the amphibious assault from the southern coast of England to Normandy, France. [second sentence removed] On the night of 5\\6 June 1944, British and American airborne personnel landed behind enemy lines and they secured the flanks of the beaches from German attack. After an air and sea bombardment that morning, British, Canadian, and American troops stormed ashore from small landing craft to defeat Germans in fortified positions. American commandos, known as Rangers climbed up the one hundred foot tall cliff at Pointe du Hoc where they destroyed a dangerous German artillery position.<br /> <br /> Eisenhower’s forces then made great sacrifices along a broad front that moved across Western Europe into Germany. Many of them were buried in a series of military cemeteries on the continent. For the rest of his very active life, Eisenhower remembered the high price that his personnel paid to preserve humanity’s right to choose their own governments. On the twentieth anniversary of D-Day, he visited one of the Normandy cemeteries and said, “These people gave us a chance… so that we can do better than we have before.”",

It is located .4 miles off the island's southwest coast.<br /> <br /> It is named by the Geographic Board for the ship, <em>Sutil</em>, of the Dionisio AlcalÃ¡ Galiano (1760-1805) Spanish expedition of 1792. Galiano was sent by the viceroy of New Spain, Juan Vicente de Güemes, Count of Revillagigedo to explore and claim the Pacific coast of North America north of California. He sailed in the schooners <em>Sutil</em> and <em>Mexican</em> a from San Blas, Mexico. This expedition went as far as the Strait of Georgia between Victoria and the British Columbia mainland, looking for the Northwest Passage. Afterwards Alcalá Galiano wrote an account in which he claimed no such passage existed. It is located 0.4 miles southwest of Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> The island is an important wildlife habitat, particularly for seabirds. On August 24, 2019, seabird biologists with Channel Islands National Park and the California Institute for Environmental Studies confirmed the first record of a brown booby chick from an active nest on Sutil Rock off Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> This successful nest signifies a northward expansion of their known breeding range in the Gulf of California and along the Pacific coast of Mexico. The closest current breeding colony is located on the Coronado Islands off Northern Baja California, Mexico.<br /> <br /> Brown boobies, once considered a rare visitor to the Channel Islands, were observed only 16 times in the 30 years between 1984 and 2014. They were first seen roosting in small numbers on Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands in 2013. There was a dramatic rise in their numbers in 2015 with over 170 individuals observed at Santa Barbara Island. Since that time, they have been seen consistently on both islands with fewer sightings occurring on Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> \"Seabirds rely upon the rich marine resources and the isolation of these offshore islands to provide food and undisturbed nesting grounds safe from predators,\" said Channel Islands National Park Superintendent Ethan McKinley. \"With this successful brown booby nest, there are now 14 breeding seabirds that rely upon this vital habitat.\"<br /> <br /> Brown boobies, generally considered a tropical or subtropical bird, appear to have been extending their range northward since the 1990s when they first migrated to the Coronado Islands of Baja California from the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Mexico. This expansion of their range coincides with shifts in oceanic conditions with warmer waters and changes in prey availability.<br /> <br /> An impressive seabird species, brown boobies are known for making spectacular plunge dives from heights of up to 50 feet to feed on surface fish. They nest on islands, lay their eggs on the bare ground, and make nests with sticks, rocks, bones, and vegetation to protect them. They winter far out to sea.<br /> <br /> Worldwide, brown booby populations have declined due to habitat degradation on islands where introduced predators have reduced their nesting success.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Set atop the hill at the center of the park is Hampton Hall. As Captain Charles Ridgely&#’;s expanded, he chose to establish a new seasonal retreat on the property. Construction of the five-part Georgian style mansion began in 1783 under the oversight of builder and master carpenter Northampton Howell (died 1787). Local craftsmen, enslaved African-Americans, and indentured servants labored to complete the massive undertaking. At its completion in 1790, with 24,000 square feet and 31 rooms, Hampton Hall was believed to be the largest private home in country, and currently the mansion stands as one of the best surviving examples of Georgian architecture in the United States.<br /> <br /> The architecture of the mansion and landscape design are characterized by proportion, balance, and symmetry, and were intended to recreate a traditional European villa with an English aesthetic. Hampton Hall’s relationship to the space and structures around it illustrates a sharp contrast in the history and culture of the surrounding landscape. Domestic service buildings surround the mansion to support the Jehu family's lifestyle. Formal gardens, designed for leisure and recreation adorned the south side of the estate, while fields of hay, corn, and other crops were planted for profit and tended and harvested through the work of enslaved African Americans and indentured servants on the north side. By design, all these activities fall within site of the cupola of Hampton Hall and its owners, and the siting of the mansion clearly illustrates social hierarchy and relative status of those occupying the highlands and lowlands of Hampton.<br /> <br /> The interior of the mansion is accessible by guided tour only, or virtually on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hamp/learn/photosmultimedia/virtualtour.htm\">park website</a>.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "One of the trailheads for the Everglades Paddling Trail is located at the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Everglades Paddling Trail is 120-miles long from the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch to the Flamingo marina in Everglades National Park. Wilderness permits are required for any overnight stay. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

The Rotunda boasts ¼ acre room. Early visitors did not get the opportunity to experience rooms this large. When they would write about their experiences they would often refer to the cave system as mammoth. After a while, that became the name everyone recognized, The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{166}\" paraid=\"727826648\">Why are there no cave formations?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{178}\" paraid=\"818144110\">Mammoth Cave is considered a dry cave. Above all the layers of limestone rock there are two more layers of sedimentary rock, sandstone and shale. These <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/rocks-of-mammoth-cave.htm\">layers of rock</a> were created long after the development of the limestone. A river flowed over this area leaving behind sand, silt and mud. These deposits solidified to form the sandstone caprock of Mammoth Cave. Unlike the soluble limestone, water can not penetrate through this type of rock. The insoluble rock layers keep Mammoth Cave dry. It is this feature that allows Mammoth Cave to be world’s longest cave system and allows all the artifacts in the cave to be preserved. </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{212}\" paraid=\"1372615239\">There are a few places where that caprock is weakened or absent and water can slowly make its way through the layers. In this locations we do find the classic <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/stalactites-stalagmites-and-cave-formations.htm\">cave formations</a> such as; stalactites, stalagmites, draperies, soda straws, cave bacon, cave grapes, cave popcorn and rim stone dams to name a few. All of these formations are typical of a wet cave.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{252}\" paraid=\"1694744471\">Tours to see wet formations: Frozen Niagara, Domes and Dripstones, Gothic Avenue, Violet City [lantern tour], Grand Avenue, Great Onyx [lantern tour], Introduction to Caving [crawling tour], Wild Cave [crawling tour].<br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{25}\" paraid=\"806533793\">How often do rocks fall?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{33}\" paraid=\"161328481\"><em>Only Once, lol.

This is a legit question that comes up quite often. The truth of the matter is that it does occur occasionally. These stone passages stabilized themselves long ago and there aren’t many outside forces acting on them. Sometimes there are changes in the environment that affect the rock layers. Areas next to entrances or ventilation shafts experience sufficient temperature change to create ice wedging between the layers. In areas where water is still flowing freely the cave experiences changes as rocks are dislodged by the water. </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{252}\" paraid=\"1694744471\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{89}\" paraid=\"1215130733\">Are people still exploring the cave?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{95}\" paraid=\"394914924\">Cave exploration is still active and headed up by the Cave Research Foundation. The group is comprised of scientists, cave enthusiasts and members of the <a href=\"https://caves.org/\">National Speleological Society</a>.  The <a href=\"https://www.cave-research.org/\">Cave Research Foundation</a> (CRF) expedition leaders schedule excursions into the cave on holiday weekends when the members are off from their everyday jobs. Pushing their limits down in these depths trying to find those unexplored passages to add to length of this system. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{155}\" paraid=\"275997700\">How much of the cave was enlarged by people? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{165}\" paraid=\"830585508\">Mammoth Cave is what is considered a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/how-mammoth-cave-formed.htm\">solution cave</a>. Which means it was formed in soluble rock through a chemical reaction that caused the rock to dissolve thus creating passages. The cave is naturally formed by the underground rivers flowing against the limestone walls. The cave walls and ceiling have not been altered by man. The rivers that flowed through left behind large amounts of sediment and displaced rocks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{187}\" paraid=\"229064473\">Throughout the use of the cave the floor has been altered. That is to say, loose rocks have been moved around and dirt has been removed in some areas to allow for more clearance between the floor and ceiling. In the Rotunda, the floor has been built up by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre</a> processing. After the nitrates were removed from the sediment, mine workers would shovel the wet mud from the leeching vats. The spent dirt was piled up along the sides of the chamber. This caused the floor of the room to rise almost eight feet in some places.<br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{231}\" paraid=\"597022712\">How many entrances are there?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{243}\" paraid=\"1429546519\">So far, we know of 27 entrances. The Historic Entrance is the largest natural entrance. A total of six entrances are used by visitors to access different guided tour experiences. The Great Onyx entrance is not counted among those because the connection of these two cave systems has not been found yet.  <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{6}\" paraid=\"2085965807\">Is there gold or gems in the cave?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{18}\" paraid=\"1412894393\">No. The limestone rock is not ideal for discovering gold or other gems. However, aside from calcite formations, the cave does have a variety of minerals that can be found on its walls. Salts such as gypsum, epsomite, and mirabilite can be found within the cave. Some of these were harvested by prehistoric <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/historyculture/native-americans.htm\">Native Americans</a>.<br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{51}\" paraid=\"506643395\">What is the black stuff on the walls? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{57}\" paraid=\"64555320\">As the limestone is drying out pushing moisture from its pores, it is picking up other minerals along the way. Here, when the moisture evaporates from the surface of the rock it leaves behind gypsum. The build up can take on various forms depending on the shape of the pore it traveled through. Through small pores a sugary crust will develop along the surface. It sparkles like fresh fallen snow. Naturally it is white in color but also appears light brown due to interactions with impurities found here. If the gypsum is forced from a larger pore, sugary lilies and clusters of delicate flowers will bloom on the walls and ceilings. These fragile formations are rated a two on the Mohs hardiness scale (Diamond being a 10 and talc being a one). They are about the same sturdiness of dried up cake icing. In early tourism visitors were allowed to pluck these beauties from the walls to take as souvenirs. With the creation of this national park, beautiful places like this are now protected for future generations. </p> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{89}\" paraid=\"1605357060\">In this section of the cave, the thin crust has been blackened by the smoke of bonfires and from lanterns. Native Americans harvested gypsum in the main cave. </p> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{103}\" paraid=\"1147832460\">Tours to see dry formations: Great Onyx [lantern tour], Cleveland Avenue, Accessible, Grand Avenue, Violet City [lantern tour], Wild Cave [crawling tour], Introduction to Caving [crawling tour].<br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{115}\" paraid=\"1756035765\">Why is the ceiling flat? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{121}\" paraid=\"1599476800\">Limestone is naturally formed in layers, like the layers of a cake. The limestone in the Mammoth Cave area was created when there was a salty sea covering this area of Kentucky. In this sea was a vast ecosystem of aquatic life. Many of these creatures had hard parts, such as shells. When one of these organisms died, the hard parts accumulated as sediment on the sea floor. This sediment continued to build over time and eventually solidify creating <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/fossils.htm\">fossil</a> rich limestone rocks. When you gaze at the expanse of a flat ceiling in the cave, you are essentially looking at the bottom surface of an exposed layer of limestone. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{192}\" paraid=\"1209508542\">Where is the water that formed the cave now? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{198}\" paraid=\"208636599\">Over thousands of years the Green River has been cutting deeper into the valley. At the same time water in the cave is striving to be at the same level as the river on the outside. As time passes water is finding cracks in the limestone and seeping deeper creating layers of twisting passages. <br /> <br /> Once you leave the cave, you can hike the River Styx Spring trail 0.4 miles from the Historic Entrance to the Green River. This is one of many locations where the water is leaving the cave system and joining with the Green River. That will be deepest point of the subterranean labyrinth. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{254}\" paraid=\"800426675\">Do earthquakes effect the cave? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{5}\" paraid=\"1006150961\">The closest major fault is the New Madrid, located almost 200 miles away. Seismic activity in South Central Kentucky does not occur often, but on the occasion shock waves may reach this area. The areas most impacted by the tremors will be on the surface. To understand this, imagine a rock being thrown into a pond. A duck swimming on top would feel the ripple and waves on the surface of the pond, but a fish swimming at some depth beneath would not be as aware. So while earthquakes can and have caused some impact in the cave, it is relatively a safer environment when compared to the tremendous impacts earthquakes can have on the surface. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{53}\" paraid=\"1264985633\">Where are the bats?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{61}\" paraid=\"981413756\">The bat population has taken a very hard hit with the introduction of White Nose Syndrome and urban development. Bats have been losing much of their natural habitats. This causes them to be found in places they shouldn’t be, such as attic spaces. Food sources are also diminishing due to the increased use of pesticides. Many bat species are now considered endangered or threatened. </p> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{71}\" paraid=\"628125661\">Throughout the year the are about 13 different species of bats that will take up residence in this area of Kentucky. Not all of the bats will come into the cave. During the warmer season many bats opt to sleep in the hollow of trees or the thick canopy. When dusk falls and the insects begin to swarm, the bats are much closer to their food source. These nocturnal creatures like to consume what we call “M&Ms” but that isn’t the good kind we like to eat. Their M&Ms are moths and mosquitos. So think about that the next time you see them flying around at night. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{85}\" paraid=\"490132172\">What is White-nose Syndrome? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{91}\" paraid=\"2138848472\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bats/white-nose-syndrome.htm\">White-nose Syndrome</a> is disease created by a fungus. It effects the bats echolocation when it grows on their faces. This can cause the bat to starve or fly into obstacles. When the fugus develops on the wings it can create holes that make it impossible for the bat to fly. During hibernation the bats normally slow their body systems to allow them to burn through fat reserves slowly. The growth of the fungus on their body causes an irritation that prevents them to go into hibernation for the full season. Infected bats will sometimes wake before the spring season. This can lead to many issues such as freezing to death or starvation. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{111}\" paraid=\"1436025296\">Why do we walk on the mats after the cave and not before we go into the cave? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{117}\" paraid=\"398467897\">We clean our shoes after going into the cave to stop us from spreading the White-nose fungal spore from Mammoth Cave. Since the fungus is already here we can not stop visitors from reintroducing it.

Intrigued, they set off to explore. We find evidence they traveled over 19 miles with river cane torches to light their way. They journeyed into the cave for about 3,000 years before the exploration stopped... Why do you think they stopped coming into the cave?<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until the late 1700s, that a local legend says a young boy, named John Houchin, rediscovered the cave. According to the legend, this young boy was hunting along the ridge line with his father’s Kentucky long rifle. He spotted a large black bear, a mammal we no longer find in the park. Raising the rifle to his shoulder he took aim and fired. BOOM!... When the smoke cleared, he realized he had only wounded the bear. The injured bear took off down the hillside and deep into the cave. Not wanting to come back empty handed, the boy took off after the bear. Do you think he ever found that bear? What we do know is that this story spread and cave travel began once more.<br /> <br /> As you walk down the steps into the entrance, notice the water cascading from the limestone layers of the entrance. This feature will play an important role in one of our future stops.</p>",

Constructed with rubble stone with a brick dome roof covered with earth, the Hampton Ice House was designed and built to last for generations. It was larger and deeper than typical commercial ice pits during the historic period. The underground space was cylindrical and tapered towards the bottom. On the north side of the structure, a short passage opened up to the space below for loading ice. On the south side of the structure, a wider, tunneled passage with steps provided access for ice retrieval.<br /> <br /> For years, every winter enslaved people would go out to ponds to cut up large cubes of ice and stack inside this structure seperating each piece with hay. With the storage being below ground and covered by both stone and earth, the ice created a natural refrigeration that would allow ice to be stored far into the summer. When entering the icehouse, visitors should use caution due to narrow steps and low visibility. </p>",

The Halfway Creek Canoe Trail is 7.3-miles long from the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch to the Big Cypress Swamp Welcome Center in Big Cypress National Preserve. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

The bas-relief global background depicts a map of the world symbolizing Eisenhower's role as a world statesman and preeminent internationalist pursuing universal peace.<br /> <br /> The 1950s was a time of sweeping change as nations adjusted to a new world order. Above it all hung the cloud of the Cold War and its threat of mutual destruction. As president, Eisenhower worked to ease that threat and bring about peace.<br /> <br /> He began his presidency in 1952 by seeking an end to the Korean War. In 1955, with Cold War tension at a breaking point, he made a breakthrough with the Soviet Union with his Open Skies proposal. In his time in office, Eisenhower de-escalated crises worldwide with great diplomacy and tact.<br /> <br /> On the domestic front, Eisenhower oversaw great expansion. A moderate Republican, he continued many of the New Deal programs of his predecessors. He raised the minimum wage, expanded Social Security, established the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and improved the nation's infrastructure with the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956.<br /> <br /> The 1954 Brown v Board ruling by the Supreme Court declared public schools were to be desegregated. Eisenhower made sure the law was carried out, even if it meant using a measure of force. He further broke the yoke of Jim Crow when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This protected African Americans at the voting booth and was the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction.<br /> <br /> In 1957, the Soviet Union became the first nation to reach space with its satellite Sputnik. In response, Eisenhower signed off on legislation to create what is now known as NASA. The space race had begun, and, building from this foundation, would be won by Eisenhower's successors.<br /> <br /> Eisenhower’s public approval numbers remained high during his two terms. People believed in his integrity, sincerity, and sense of duty. For his part, Eisenhower believed in the people and what they could do for the country, the world, and each other. As he said in his first inaugural address, “Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.”",

In more recent times, the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service have administered the land. The historic High Bridge Ranger Station was built by the U.S. Forest Service as a base for fire and trail crews working in the high country. The buildings and horse corral were constructed in 1933-34 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The main house is used as a residence for National Park Service staff during the summer; please respect staff privacy.<br /> <br /> The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT) crosses High Bridge, with the route south to Stevens Pass one-quarter miles up the road and the route north to Rainy Pass just behind the horse corral. The Pacific Crest Trail winds 2,650 miles from the border of Mexico to Canada.<br /> <br /> From High Bridge, the dirt road continues for approximately two miles to the backcountry camps of High Bridge and Tumwater; permit required for overnight stays. The road ends at a washout at Carwash Falls, though hikers and stock may connect to the Old Wagon Trail and the PCT beyond.</p>",

Pipes carried water from the waterfall at the entrance of the cave to these leeching vats. The water slowly seeped through the layers of dirt, pulling with it the nitrates from the soil. The muddy solution would travel through the filter made by the interlocking logs at the bottom, separating debris from the nitrate rich water. The mixture was piped to the surface and placed in large cauldrons where workers would add some ingredients and then boil it down until all that was left was a crystal known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre</a>. This crystal is the number one ingredient of black gun powder. America was still young at the time of this operation and the saltpetre created here became very important during the War of 1812. By the end of the war in 1815, America had maintained its freedom. Unfortunately, the majority of the workers in the saltpetre production were enslaved men who would not reap the benefit of freedom for themselves. <br /> <br /> With the end of saltpetre production a new means of industry would develop here at Mammoth Cave. A steel door was installed in the Houchin’s Narrows barring entry. Curious bystanders would now need to purchase a ticket to gain entry into the darkness. Parties were led by local guides that had knowledge of the cave. By 1816, tourism would become the new business model for Mammoth Cave. What do you think it was like for those early visitors?</p>",

            "audioDescription": "The trailhead for the Sandfly Loop Paddling Trail is located at the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Sandfly Loop Paddling Trail is 5-miles long. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

            "bodyText": "<p>A small dilapitated shed located next to the Gambrill Mill Trail boardwalk contains the remnants of equipment that was used to pump water to the Gambrill House on the hill. The land the pump house sits on was part of a large land holding originally owned by James Marshall. In 1830, Araby Mill, was built by the following owner, John McPherson. <br /> The mill was purchased in 1855 by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/the_gambrills.htm\">James H. Gambrill</a>, who had been an assistant miller to George Delaplane, who owned the mill for several years after McPherson. Shortly after Gambrill purchased the mill, he went into business with neighbors John Wheatley and T.A. Ball to operate a distillery built at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/tour-stop-4-gambrill-mill.htm\">Gambrill Mill</a> complex. The distillery failed in 1860. The mill itself was very successful until 1897, when Gambrill faced financial hardship and had to sell the property. </p> <p paraeid=\"{daf0f68a-1b88-4e4e-a01c-5918dfdf7d24}{197}\" paraid=\"1303599976\">At its peak, the mill could produce up to sixty barrels of flour per day. James Gambrill employed three mill hands to manufacture the flour, along with two coopers to produce barrels for its transport. A contemporary newspaper account gave the following description: </p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{daf0f68a-1b88-4e4e-a01c-5918dfdf7d24}{211}\" paraid=\"2054083444\">By far, the Gambrill's mill did the most extensive business of all. The neat, well-appointed mill was up-to-the-minute...it was a pleasure to accompany the big wagon team on its slated trips to Gambrill's. The squat, neat old mill, the more than comfortable atmosphere of the place, and last, but not least, the handsome jolly miller, all combined to make one's visits a genuine pleasure. </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{daf0f68a-1b88-4e4e-a01c-5918dfdf7d24}{227}\" paraid=\"26157549\">James and his wife Antoinette were married in 1860 and lived with their growing family in a house next to the mill. In 1864, James Gambrill purchased land to build the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gambrill-mansion.htm\">Gambrill house</a>, which was completed in 1873. The house was a richly ornamented, okra-colored brickhouse built in the Second Empire Style. One of the modern amenities associated with the house was hot and cold running water for the indoor plumbing. The equipment in the pump house made this modern marvel possible. </p> <p paraeid=\"{11cba6a7-4ec7-4781-85b7-d5898631bcf1}{36}\" paraid=\"1733679695\">When the house was first built, toilets, located on the first and second floors at the southeast end of the ell, were enabled to work by pipes which ran from a hydraulic ram positioned at a spring at the pump house, to a cistern atop the ridge behind the house, several hundred yards to the southeast, and then downhill to the house. The downward race of the water created enough power to propel water to a ceiling tank on the second floor. Another length of pipe, almost half a mile long, took the sewage northeast to empty into Bush Creek.  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Pump House is located approximately 25 feet to the right of the Gambrill Mill Trail boardwalk. Today it contains the remnants for equipment that was used to pump water to the Gambrill House on the hill. It is also part of the Gambrill Mill Picnic Area sits just south of the parking area, four miles south of Frederick on Route 355. Parking is available with two handicap accessible spaces. The pump house is a 10 by 8 foot wood structure with a metal roof. The building is quite dilapidated with much of the wood siding gone. The door is missing on the front so one has a view directly into the building and out the back of the building where additional wood siding is missing. To the left of the open door, just below the roof a piece of rusty equipment is sticking out of the building. Below, more than half of the wood siding is missing, and you can see that is attached to a long rusty pole that rests on the floor. You cannot see if there is a floor to the building as there is a layer of debris, both from the building materials, and surrounding woods. There were no windows to the structure as it was a utilitarian building specifically housing the hydraulic pump. The interior of the structure is full of debris and old machinery. The structure itself is located on a wood line that parallels the boardwalk trail and remnants of the mill race behind the structure. Beyond the wood line and stream is a meadow of native grasses that provide habitat for ground nesting birds and a variety of other animals. Also, beyond the structure to the left is the Gambrill pond. There is a bench and depending on the time of year there will be one or two picnic tables. To your left is a wooded area that continues to the river, approximately one-quarter of a mile north. The mill trail that began on the northwest corner of the parking lot to the right of the structure, continues for one-half mile in a circular route taking you toward the river, then follows Bush Creek to the historic wagon road that leads back to the Gambrill Mill and parking area. To your right is the parking area for the Gambrill farm and stone path that leads to the Gambrill Mill. There is an interpretive sign in the parking area and a picnic table in the grassy area between the parking area, mill, and service road.",

He became fascinated with the preservative qualities of the cave environment and thought the cave air might be the key to curing this disease. <br /> <br /> Inside the cave two stone huts and eight wooden huts were built, to function as a sanitorium where patients could “take in the airs.” Sickened individuals lived in the cave for up to five months without seeing the light of day. In the beginning the patients claimed to be feeling better but it was simply the improved morale. Long exposure to cooking and heating fires in the cold clammy cave wrecked havoc on their weakened conditions. The cure for consumption would not be found in the depths of Mammoth Cave. <br /> <br /> The eight wooden huts are no longer standing due to development of tourist trails and people venturing too close to the historic buildings. The second stone building in the distance had to be stabilized. The reconstruction of the shelter left some of the walls incomplete.</p>",

Natural bridges are formed by the movement of a stream or river cutting through rock.

A more weathering-resistant layer of rock protects the softer rocks below from more rapid erosion, while ice, rain, and wind slowly open the arch wider and wider.<br /> As the edge of the plateau has eroded back, a small gully has formed that flows with rain and melting snow (now more than 125 feet below the arch). Undoubtedly some day the top of the arch will collapse, leaving behind new hoodoos on either side.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>No trails depart from this area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>View the eroded and forested edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Here the iron-oxide colored limey mudstones of the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon are being weathered and eroded by rain and melting snow to form a bowl-shaped amphitheater separated from amphitheaters to the north and south. Within this amphitheater, Natural Bridge is being formed by the same process as all hoodoos: walls or fins are formed by the presence of harder, more erosion resistant cap layers as the plateau rim erodes backwards through the action of rain and melting snow. Windows then form as rain and melting snow trickle into cracks within these fins. Overnight freezing temperatures cause this water to expand as it turns to ice, breaking the rock apart from within and creating windows--of which Natural Bridge is a very large example. Eventually, the caprock will collapse, leaving behind rock spires on either side of the window known as \"hoodoos\".</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>View the eroded and forested edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p>",

There were 31 one-room schools located in Gillespie County.<br /> <br /> The Junction School was a typical one-room school. A wood stove sat in a sand box in the center of the school and was the only source of heat. Two kerosene lamps suspended from the ceiling at opposite ends of the room provided light. The teacher's desk and a chair were in front of the classroom. A small brass bell on the teacher's desk summoned the students. Students sat at double desks which had wooden tops with holes for the glass inkwells. The desks were arranged in rows facing the teacher's desk; the boys in one row and the girls in another.<br /> <br /> The Junction School opened on November 21, 1910 and served the area for 37 years.

            "audioDescription": "Junction School. 197 words. This school is a simple, block building. It is covered in tin pressed to resemble stone blocks and painted gray. The back of the building faces the small parking area. A low wooden porch at back may be reached by three steps in the rear or a short ramp to the left of the steps. From the porch a door leads into a small exhibit area where the interior has been furnished to show how it might have looked around 1912. A push button mounted to the exhibit wall may be pressed for an audio recording about the school and its connection to Lyndon Johnson. The front of the building has a double door made of wood and a flag pole to the left. A long set of concrete steps leads down to the road, where a large, brown park service sign reads, \"Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. LBJ Ranch.\" There are four, double-hung windows on each side of the building and the peaked roof is covered with wood shingles. A single metal stove pipe sits on the ridgeline. When standing at the rear, facing the building, a round, covered well sits to the right. To the left, along the side of the building is a wooden table, which has a graphic panel on its top. Another sign is located at the side of the road in front of the building. End of description.",

            "audioDescription": "This three-panel sign at the edge of the parking area is covered by a small roof. Beyond the sign a wide, flat dirt and gravel path leads through the meadow towards low, tree-covered hills with the Teton range rising steeply behind. On the other side of the path from the sign is a single, unisex vault toilet.The center panel on the sign shows a map of the range from Mount Owen on the right to Buck Mountain on the left. In the middle Taggart Lake lies at the end of Avalanche Canyon between Mount Wister on the left and South Teton on the right. Your current location at Taggart Lake Trailhead is at the bottom center of the map at the side of Teton Park Road. Dotted lines show the trails that can be accessed from this location. The panel reads, \"Explore Your Park. This popular trailhead leads to two glacially carved lakes. Take a short walk to Taggart Lake, and if you have time, visit Bradley Lake for excellent views. A fire burned this area in 1985. As you hike look for burned trees and notice how the forest has regenerated. This successional forest supports a variety of animals and plants.\"DID YOU REMEMBER?- Sunscreen: The sun burns quickly at this elevation.- Clothing Layers: Weather can change suddenly.- Plenty of Food & Water: Avoid the dangers of dehydration and fatigue.- Bug Spray: Don't let mosquitoes ruin your trip.- Map & Watch: Avoid spending an unplanned night in the backcountry with careful planning and routefinding.- Bear Spray: Both grizzly and black bears thrive in Grand Teton National Park.\"RECOMMENDED ROUTES- Taggart Lake - Hike to the lake and back on the same trail. Walk through an old burn to see how plants and animals now thrive in this open forest. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 3 miles; DURATION: 2 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 400 feet; DIFFICULTY: easy.- Taggart Lake Loop - Hike to Taggart Lake and then continue south on the loop over a glacial moraine through forest and sagebrush meadow, returning along Beaver Creek. Watch for black bears. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 3.9 miles; DURATION: 2 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 500 feet; DIFFICULTY: easy to moderate.- Taggart Lake - Bradley Lake - Hike to Bradley Lake then follow the trail along the eastern shore of Taggart Lake. Follow the Taggart loop trail south and east along Beaver Creek to the trailhead. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 5.9 miles; DURATION: 3 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 900 feet; DIFFICULTY: moderate.\"* Duration and degree of difficulty will vary individually. For more trip suggestions ask at a visitor center.\"Stock Users - Inquire at a visitor center, ranger station or entrance station for regulations and trails open to stock.\"Emergencies - The nearest telephone is located at the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center in Moose, about 3 miles southeast of here.\"Did You Know? Glaciers flowing out of Avalanche Canyon carved Taggart Lake ending 15,000 years ago. This lake bears the name of W. Rush Taggart who was a geology assistant for the 1872 Hayden Expedition. In 1911, homesteader James Manges built a distinctive cabin located near this trail, likely the first two-story structure built in this area.\"The left hand panel has a photograph of a climber on the side of a rock face with a jagged peak visible in the background. Text reads, \"Protect the Backcountry. \"HIKING, CAMPING & STOCK USE- All overnight stays require a backcountry camping permit. Permits are available year-round at the visitor center in Moose, and during the summer at Jenny Lake Ranger Station and Colter Bay Visitor Center.- Pack out all trash. Keep the park litter-free for all to enjoy.- Stay on established trails. Shortcutting switchbacks damages plants and causes erosion.- Backcountry campfires are allowed ONLY at designated lakeshore sites and must be confined to metal grates or with a permit below the Jackson Lake high water line.- Backpackers must use park-approved bear-resistant canisters or food storage lockers when camping below 10,000 feet.- Saddle and pack animals must stay on authorized trails and may not graze in the park. Find out more at a visitor center.\"CLIMBING & MOUNTAINEERING- Registration is not required for technical climbing or mountaineering; however, a permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry.- Tell a friend or family member your plans and when you expect to return.- During summer visit the Jenny Lake Ranger Station for details on climbing routes and current conditions.- Follow low impact climbing ethics. Leave the rock in its natural condition. Avoid placing permanent protection. Motorized drills are prohibited.- RESOURCE PROTECTION & FIREARMS- Leave the park as you found it for others to enjoy. Picking wildflowers or collecting any object is prohibited.- Hikers must be prepared for wildlife encounters. Do not approach or harass animals. Stay at least 300 feet from large mammals such as moose, bison, elk or bears for your safety and theirs.- Wildlife often bite the hand that feeds them-do not feed any animal, including squirrels, chipmu",

            "audioDescription": "On the east side of a large paved parking area are two wooden picnic tables, a food locker, a brown facility holding four vault toilets, and a wayside exhibit, placed among tall trees. In the east corner of the parking lot are two large brown trash dumpsters, and one large green dumpster for recycling. The wayside exhibit panel is blue and is bolted to a frame made of thick wooden posts, and is titled, welcome to Tenaya Lake. Half of the panel background is a two-toned picture of a lake that is surrounded by domes and peaks. The other half of the panel is a map. The caption reads, caught between immense granite domes and the clear High Sierra sky, Tenaya Lake is the largest lake in Yosemite National Park. Here, at its eastern end, Tenaya Creek forms a series of braided streams before flowing into the lake. Text reads, if you have a few hours, stroll the flat, paved trail (less than a quarter-mile, round-trip). You'll be rewarded with glimpses of the glacially carved peaks and domes and a spectacular view of the lake emerging through the trees. If time permits, take a picnic to one of the tables on the beach and enjoy a lazy High Sierra afternoon exploring or relaxing in the smooth granitic sand. While hardy souls may be tempted to jump in, remember...Tenaya Lake is fed by snowmelt and stays quite cold!If you have half a day, don't miss the boardwalk, a picnic, or the beach, but (if conditions permit) cross the Tenaya Creek inlet at the southeast end of the beach and follow the trail west along the shore of the lake. This mostly-level stroll takes you toward the Sunrise Lakes Trailhead, joining back with the Tioga Road. Here, you can retrace your steps back or hop on the free shuttle at Stop #10, and ride one stop back to your car (stop #9). It is possible to walk all the way around the lake (2.8 mi/5.2 km), but requires walking along the shoulder of busy Tioga Road. A full-day hike to Tuolumne Meadows - Pick up a trail heading east from Tenaya Lake. This 9-mile one-way hike parallels the Tioga Road, leading to Tuolumne Meadows. At Tuolumne Meadows, pick up the free shuttle for the short ride back to Tenaya Lake. Shuttle Information - The free Tioga Road shuttle runs between Tuolumne Meadows and Olmsted Point. Shuttle schedule changes seasonally and as conditions permit. Check local postings for current schedule. During times of high water, unbridged river or creek crossings can be hazardous. Take extra time and use good judgement when crossing rivers and creeks. Check the weather! Be especially aware of the potential for thunderstorms. If you are hiking, take a map and compass. Tell someone where you are going and when you'll be back. Avoid exhaustion and dehydration. Carry plenty of water and high-energy snacks. The altitude at Tenaya Lake is just over 8,000 feet above sea level. Signs of altitude sickness can include nausea, dizziness, and headache. Descending to a lower elevation can help alleviate symptoms. Scrambling or climbing on rocks can be dangerous. Remember, coming down can be much harder than going up, and wet rocks are slippery. Be prepared to pack out what you pack in; garbage and recycling receptacles are located near the parking area. Map: The map shows Tenaya Lake, indicated by a large, blue, oval shape, slightly tilted, in the center of the map. A white line extends diagonally across the map, from the bottom left to the top right, passing by the north shore of Tenaya Lake. A trail, indicated by red dotted lines, passes by the south shore of the Tenaya Lake and partly follows a few creeks, indicated by a blue solid line, before splitting off into different trails to the left and right. To the left of the lake, icons indicate the start of hiking trails, restrooms, and parking. To the right of the lake, a red dot indicates you are here, and icons indicating trailheads, parking, restrooms, and picnic areas are shown. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. A flat dirt path leads into the forest with several wayside exhibits along the way to the Tenaya Lake shoreline. The first wayside exhibit is titled, disappearing wetlands. Text reads, wetlands like this one have likely been here for the last 10,000 years, providing homes and food for a great variety of plant and animal species. In Yosemite, wetland areas make up only about 3% of the landscape, but are estimated to harbor up to one-third of all the plant species in the Park. They also capture, store, and release melting snow, extending the availability of life-giving water during the dry summer months. Here in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and across the globe, wetlands are disappearing rapidly. Effects from trampling, development, and climate change threaten to alter the delicate wetland ecology forever. In Yosemite National Park, park managers work to prevent loss of wetlands by preserving and restoring wetland areas and building boardwalks to help minimize damage from visitors. Photo:",

For information about camping contact the Marin Headlands Visitor Center at (415) 332-1540. Don't expect to be able to book a site the day of your visit.</p> <h3>Animal Friends</h3> <p>Tennessee Valley is home to many animal friends. If you're a bird-lover, bring your 'binos (binoculars). Birds of a feather from predatory raptors to common swallows abound in the valley. On the ground, deer and coyotes stalk the land. Keep your eyes peeled and you may even see a bobcat.</p> <h3>Plant Friends</h3> <p>In the spring, Tennessee Valley is positively bursting with blossoms. You'll spot checker-bloom, blue-eyed grass, California buttercup and California poppy. In summer, the grasses turn golden, and by late summer you can find fennel, lizard tail, sagebrush, sticky monkey flower and blackberry bushes. In winter and early spring, rains turn the golden hills green again.</p> <h3>Marincello: The City That Wasn't</h3> <p>Marin County is famously committed to keeping its land open and undeveloped, but in the 1960s, there were plans to the contrary. When Pittsburgh land developer Thomas Frouge came out west, he saw something in the Headlands: a city for 30,000 Californians waiting to be built. Fifty apartment towers. Hundreds of homes. A shopping mall. And the cherry on top: a luxury hotel at the highest point in the Headlands.<br /> <br /> These were the plans for Marincello, the city that wasn't. The story goes that the plans, which the county approved, were fought tooth and nail by a small cadre of Marin's citizens. After bulldozing part of the landscape and building garish gates announcing the entrance to the community, development was halted due to a legal injunction. One thing led to another and the legal troubles against Marincello multiplied. In 1972, the land was sold to the Nature Conservancy and handed over to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Locals often liken the story of Marincello to a David and Goliath tale; an example of the underdog coming out on top. Today, the site where the main boulevard to Marincello was supposed to be is nothing more than a footpath, aptly named \"Marincello Trail.\"</p>",

This hydrothermal feature does change seasonally, depending on the height of the water table beneath the surface. When the water table is high, it bubbles as a mudpot. When the water table drops, it reverts back to its origins as a fumarole.</p> <h2>Mudpots</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Enjoy the backcountry and help keep it clean for others to enjoy. Bury human waste and toilet tissue in a 6–8 inch (15–18 cm) deep “cat hole” at least 100 feet (30 m) from water and trails. River Crossings. Park waters are swift and cold. Swimming in park rivers is not recommended. River crossings are hazardous. Lightning Safety. During thunderstorms, descend to lower elevation, avoid open areas and isolated tall trees. Assume lightning position: feet together, crouch on foam pad or sit on pack, hands over ears. Regulations.

Avoid surprising a bear by calling out and clapping your hands at regular intervals to make your presence known. Carry Bear Spray. Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Keep it immediately available, not inside your pack. Hike in Groups. Travel in groups of 3 or more is recommended. Stay with your group at all times. What to do if you encounter a bear. Stay calm, do not run. Quietly detour or back away; stop if this seems to agitate the bear. Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals. What to do if a bear charges you. Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge. What to do if a bear makes contact. Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.",

Family oral history suggests that James' father was possibly a member of the Carter family of Pittsylvania plantation. In 1840, James purchased 170 acres of land on Henry Hill. Within a decade, he had built a modest one-and-one-half story log dwelling and assorted outbuildings. Robinson was the third wealthiest free black man living in Prince William County prior to the war.<br /> <br /> Nine family members, spanning three generations, resided here in 1860. During the First Battle of Manassas, the family took refuge in a neighbor's cellar, and James reportedly hid under the turnpike bridge over Young's Branch. Despite its location amidst the fighting, the house escaped major damage. The farm remained safely behind Union lines through most of the Second Battle of Manassas, although General Franz Sigel established his headquarters on the property.<br /> <br /> The family dismantled the original structure in the 1920s to expand their post-war dwelling. The post-war house burned in 1993.  ",
            "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the Robinson House Site is 171 words total. The Robinson House Site is the location a Civil War-era structure owned by an African-American freedman named Jim Robinson. The house survived the First and Second Battles of Manassas and stood here until the family dismantled the original structure in the 1920s to expand their post-war dwelling. The postwar structure later burned in an arson fire in 1993. A stone foundation outlines the dimensions of the postwar house and is approximately thirty-seven-feet-long in the east-to-west dimension and approximately sixteen-feet-long in the north-to-south dimension. The postwar structure was one room deep and three rooms wide. The width of the foundation varies in places due to the fact that it is only one stone wide in most places and the stones are of various sizes. The site is located in a well-manicured grassy area atop Henry Hill approximately four-hundred-yards northeast of the Henry House. A gravel driveway extends north approximately one-hundred yards from the Robinson House site to U.S. Highway 29.",

Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The sandy coastline and adjacent wind-protected valley of Thornton State Beach are good venues for picnicking, beach walking, surf fishing, and flying remote-control gliders. Take in views from this site include the Farallon Islands, Mount Tamalpais, Point Reyes, Mount Diablo, the Montara Mountains, and San Pedro Point.</p> <h3>Trails at Sweeney Ridge</h3> <p>There are several ways to access the 5.7 combined miles of trails at Sweeney Ridge. Most of the trails are totally exposed, so bring sunscreen! If it's cold and cloudy, bring an extra layer of clothing and expect windy conditions.<br /> <br /> <em>Note:</em> It is common for weather to change over the course of an afternoon.<br /> <br /> Take the Notch Trail from Skyline College and hike south to the ridge where you can take the Sweeney Ridge Trail further south or head west along Mori Ridge Trail.<br /> <br /> You can also begin at the trailhead adjacent to the Shelldance Orchid Gardens near CA-1 and hike up to the ridge using the Mori Ridge Trail. From San Bruno, take Sneath Lane to the Sneath Trail.</p> <h3>Portolá Discovery Site</h3> <p>The San Francisco Bay Portolá Discovery Site monument marks the place where Captain Juan Gaspar de Portolá and 60 Spanish soldiers of the Portolá Expedition became the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay. The expedition members were hungry, lost, and sick after a six months' journey. They were assisted by the local Ramaytush Ohlone people along the way, and the Aramai tribe of modern-day Pacifica accompanied the explorers to the top of Sweeney Ridge.</p> <h3>Nike Missile Site SF-51</h3> <p>During the tense years of the Cold War, from 1953 to 1979, the United States Army built and operated close to 300 Nike missile sites in the United States. Nike Site SF-51 at Sweeney Ridge housed the radar targeting station for one of these anti-aircraft defense sites, while the launch area was located at nearby Milagra Ridge. By the 1960s, soldiers were ready in a minutes' notice to launch nuclear capable Nike Hercules missiles from these ridgetops. Obsolete by 1974, SF-51 was abandoned.</p>",

Osage-orange (Maclura pomifera) is native to parts of Texas and Oklahoma but was commonly planted as hedgerows in Nebraska and other Midwestern states. When woven together these fast-growing trees produced a \"pig tight, horse high, and bull strong,\" fence. One bushel of seed would yield 30,000 plants, enough for 6 miles of fence!

Castle is a name given by archeologists – no kings or queens lived here. The farmers who did live in the canyon may have used this large structure as a dwelling, a community center, spiritual center, or perhaps all three.</p> <p>Hovenweep Castle was top levels of a much larger complex that stair-stepped into the canyon, as evidenced by remaining rubble. Access among the levels was either carved hand and footholds in the rock or wooden ladders. The main entrance to Hovenweep Castle appears to be a rectangular doorway on the canyon rim. During the solstices and equinoxes, light enters the castle doorway and marks corners and doorways on the interior.</p> <p>The unique stone towers and other buildings at Hovenweep are extremely fragile.

Approximately 10 miles on a paved road will take you from Gustavus' airport to the Glacier Bay park headquarters in Bartlett Cove.<br /> <br /> In the summer months, jet service is available between Juneau and Gustavus, with smaller planes flying to Gustavus daily, year-round. A ferry terminal offers periodic ferry trips to Hoonah and Juneau.</p> <h4>Lodging in Gustavus</h4> <p>Various lodging options are available in Gustavus. For more info <a href=\"https://www.gustavusak.com/\">see the Gustavus Visitor Association website</a>.</p> <h4>How to get to Gustavus?</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.flyalaskaseaplanes.com/destinations/Gustavus/\">Alaska Seaplanes</a> provides year-round air service between Gustavus, Juneau, and the Southeast Alaska region.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.alaskair.com/\">Alaska Airlines</a> provides seasonal flights to Gustavus in the summer months.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://dot.alaska.gov/amhs/\">The Alaska Marine Highway system</a> connects many Southeast Alaska communities via a ferry system. Take the scenic route on the ferry, or bring a vehicle with you to Gustavus!</p> <hr /> <p>Gustavus spreads across a large plain created by receding glaciers and is completely surrounded by the distant mountains and icefields of Glacier Bay National Park on three sides and the ocean on the fourth.</p> <p>As the glaciers that covered the area 200 years ago have receded, the land in Gustavus has risen quickly –over an inch each year -- and longtime residents have witnessed phenomenal changes. Land that once was within the tidal zone is now high and dry. Where grasses once predominated, spruce trees now tower. Early settlers called the town Strawberry Point.</p> <p>Historically, the area was used by the Tlingit people for seasonal harvesting and smoking of salmon. The first successful homestead patent was issued in 1923, although settlers were present here as early as 1917. According to historical records, through \"hope and hard work,\" several families successfully homesteaded here. The U.S. Postal Service renamed the town in 1925, when the first Post Office was established here.</p> <p>Today, the community of Gustavus spreads across the rising flatlands, with the hub of the spokes at Four Corners. A unique community of interesting people, Gustavus offers a full range of accommodations and plenty of adventures for travelers.The surrounding mountains make a wonderful backdrop to the surprisingly flat terrain. With a year round population of approximately 450 people, Gustavus is a small Alaskan town surrounded by breathtaking scenery and extensive wilderness.<br /> <br /> <em>*Location Note:</em> The lat/long location chosen for this point is the Gustavus airport. However, you may arrive at the Gustavus dock/ferry terminal if traveling by the ferry.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p> Horse Collar Ruin is one of the best-preserved ancestral Puebloan sites in the area. The overlook is the easiest and best way to view the site. Horse Collar was named after two structures with doorways that resemble horse collars. We believe people left the area over 700 years ago and the site's remarkable state of preservation is due to the isolation of Natural Bridges. Few visitors made the journey down the canyons, so Horse Collar Ruin's kiva with original roof and interior were not disturbed. The site was rediscovered by an archeological expedition in 1907, seemingly forgotten, and rediscovered again in 1936 by Zeke Johnson, the park’s first custodian.</p> <p>Not much has changed since Zeke Johnson's day. The ladder into the kiva is gone, and much of the debris inside has been removed. Sadly, one can no longer find pottery or arrowheads here anymore--practically everything has been taken away by other visitors.</p> <p>The round structures are also much as Zeke Johnson first saw them. No one knows the exact purpose of these unusual structures. Why are they so perfectly round, and why did their builders not use the back of the alcove as a wall and save themselves a great deal of work? Were they ever roofed? If not, why bother constructing plaster floors? Were they used for storage? If so, why were fires lit inside them? What do you think?</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The natural sandstone cliff edge is lined with metal railing for safety. In the canyon below, a small alcove is carved out of the opposite canyon wall toward the base. In this alcove sits a line of ancestral Puebloan stone structures and stone rubble. Wayside: Horsecollar Ruin Located below and across the canyon, Horsecollar Ruin is a well-preserved ancestral Pueblo village. Inhabited between A.D. 1050 and A.D. 1300, this site is unusual because it contains both round and square kivas (domestic and ceremonial rooms) that represent two different architectural styles. The round kiva is associated with the Pueblo people of the Mesa Verde area of southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah, while the square kiva is indicative of the Pueblo people in the Kayenta area of northern Arizona. Pottery found at this site also reflects these different influences, indicating likely trade partners. Horsecollar Ruin exhibits a strong Kayenta tradition during the early period of occupation, with a Mesa Verde influence dominating the later period of use.

            "audioDescription": "Wildcat Beach stretches from northwest to southwest along the southern end of Drakes Bay for about 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers). About eleven miles (18 kilometers) to the west, the Point Reyes Headlands rise above Drakes Bay. At the north end of the beach, a medium-sized rocky headland, Miller Point, reaches into Drakes Bay. A few guano-covered sea stacks rise above the bay off of Miller Point. Steep, brown-colored bluffs rise all along the length of the beach, limiting safe places to descend onto the beach to the small valley through which Wildcat Creek flows, about two miles (3.2 kilometers) south of Miller Point. On a low, flat area north of Wildcat Creek is Wildcat Campground, a backpacker campground with eight campsites. Near the south end of Wildcat Beach, Alamere Creek cascades over a 40-foot-tall bluff, forming Alamere Falls, which varies in volume through the year. At the far south end of the beach, a 400-foot-tall (130-foot-tall) headland named Double Point rises abruptly above the water. Depending on the tide level and the season, there may be much sand along the entire beach (summer and fall) or very little (winter and spring).

            "bodyText": "<p>Isaac Peirce built Peirce Mill on Rock Creek in 1829. Using the moving water as a power source, the mill ground corn, wheat, and rye. Succeeding generations further developed the mill, sawmill, orchard, and tree nursery. In 1890, an act of Congress incorporated the mill and 350 acres of the property into Rock Creek Park. The mill operated until the turbine's shaft broke in 1897. At the turn of the century, park managers went to work improving the site, improving roads and bridges and adding a new dam that provided a nice aesthetic for picnickers. In the 1920s, the mill was converted into a tea room complete with electric lights. In 1933, New Deal legislation transferred Rock Creek Park to the National Park Service. The National Park Service restored the mill and grounds to their historic layout by 1936.<br /> <br /> The mill is open seasonally.

It is constructed of blue-grey and brown stone granite.<br />The mill is approached from the northwest by a forty-foot long stone path. The front door is painted brown and is flanked on either side by a double hung window with wooden sashes and sills painted white. The three windows of the second story are of the same design. Two five-foot long log benches are set on either side of the front door.<br />Moving clockwise from the front, the left side of the building has two windows on each of three levels. Facing the back, a forty-five-foot cement walkway leads northwest from the bike/walkway path to the wooden back door. Three windows line the second and third stories, and windows sit on either side of the back door.<br />On the remaining side, sets of two windows are on the second and third levels. The first floor has windows on either side of a wooden dutch door. A ground-level door is set at the back corner of the building.<br />Along the left side of the building to the northeast, a fifty-foot stone water channel runs from the northeast and turns left as it approaches the building, diverting water under a ten-foot tall wooden water wheel connected to the structure. The channel continues southeast and runs another seventy-five feet downhill and under the bike/walkway as it returns water to Rock Creek.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Perhaps this is greener than you were expecting to see at a place with a name like White Sands. Here towards the front of the drive is a meeting point of two unique ecosystems that allows a diverse community to thrive. On Dune Life Nature Trail just up the path from the parking lot, you’ll find yourself in another world where snow white dunes are dotted with dune adapted plants such as soaptree yuccas, Rio Grande cottonwoods, and hoary rosemary mint. Across the park road towards the Sacramento Mountains to the east, you will see the Chihuahuan Desert scrubland full of low-growing, thorny fauna such as creosote bush, mesquite, ocotillo, and varieties of cacti. In the dunes, you’ll find full-time residents like kangaroo rats, bleached earless lizards, and over 60 species of moth found nowhere else on earth that have become color adapted to the blindingly white environment. The largest predator that lives full time in the dunes is a kit fox which weighs in at a whopping 4 pounds! Animals residing in the dunes are small, compact, and efficient with their water, never taking a drink in their life. But the White Sands community is more than just what’s found in the dunes. On the edge of the dunefield where the sand meets the desert scrubland, the park receives some interesting visitors. Larger mammals like bobcats, coyotes, badgers, and even porcupines that couldn’t survive in the dunes year-round make their way into the dunes to get the resources they need and then return to their homes in the scrubland. These temporary visitors to the dunes are no less of a part of the dunefield community whether their impact is big or small. Your visit to White Sands today is also a temporary one where you might come to hike, sled, or enjoy a picnic and then return home with memories to last a lifetime. Whether you’ve come from near or far to be here today by taking the time to explore White Sands you have become part of the White Sands community!",
            "audioDescription": "From the parking lot, the hard-packed dirt trail leads through the split-rail fence, past a three-sided kiosk with informational signs, and then across flat grassland to the white dunes. The trail then ascends up the sand between two dunes to a wayside sign, where the loop trail then splits to the left and the right. The trail is marked by flat, four-inch wide, blue posts marked with a three-leaved clover symbol. The trail meanders up and down the dunes, which are dotted with a variety of grasses, bushes, and the occasional small tree. The footing varies from hard-packed dirt to soft sand. The parking lot is a loop and is adjacent to the vault toilets. At the beginning of the trail near the parking lot, a brown sign reads, “Dune Life Nature Trail. This one-mile loop trail winds through the edge of the white sands, where dune life is most abundant. Watch for the tracks left behind by various desert animals as they hunt for food among the dunes. Two steep climbs will be encountered on this walk. Summer temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Take plenty of water and protect your skin from the sun. Please lock your car.” Further down the trail, another sign warns, “Stop – Stay Alive. Water is required for this trail. Take 64 ounces or two liters of water for each person in your group. When your water is half gone, return to your car. Warning Dangerous to hike above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.” End of description.",

            "bodyText": "Pigeon Roost Creek is a reminder of the millions of migrating passenger pigeons that once roosted in trees in this area. The species has been completely destroyed.<br /> <br /> One mile east where the Natchez Trace crossed the creek, Nathaniel Folsom of New England and his Choctaw wife had a trading post before 1790. Their son, David, later operated it and accommodated travelers. When the Reverend Thomas Nixon stopped there in 1815, David's wife \"prepared suitable nourishment... and would have no pay.\" <br /> <br /> David Folsom, strong supporter of Christianity and American Indian education, was elected chief of the Northeast District of the Choctaw Nation in 1826.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br />  ",

Below the title is text that reads “This trail loops through one of the most varied habitats in the park. The surrounding sawgrass is a single habitat; this pine island is many. Here the plants are clues to contrasting worlds, from cactus on high ground to the jungle tangle at the edge of a hammock. Pinelands habitats have no fixed borders. Fires and hurricanes shift them and enable these temperate islands to survive in the damp, subtropical environment. Look for charred pine bark and wind snapped trunks.” A picture of a Pileated Woodpecker bird and a picture of a Devil’s Potato plant sit side-by-side below the text. On the opposite side is a map of the trail indicating it is a 0.4 mile trail. The trail should take the average visitor about 30-minutes to complete.

This was followed by the ejection of gas-charged matter through vents in fractures around the mountain which weakened and ultimately caused the upper mountain to collapse. Rather than rising upwards, the volvanic matter ejected through vents flowed rapidly downhill, filling surrounding valleys to a depth of 300 ft (100 m). Once the flows stopped, trapped gases escaped through fumeroles, and surrounding material hardened. As the streams reclaimed the valley the erosion-resistant spires were exposed.  <h4>Where can I see them?</h4> The classic view is located in Wheeler Creek Canyon at the end of Pinnacles Road from East Rim Drive. A 0.8 (1.3 km) trail is an easy walk along the rim of the valley where the pinnacles are visable.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">These can only be seen when East Rim Drive and Pinnacles Road are open.</span> When the roads are closed, look for the pinnacles in the Annie Creek watershed and canyon from several view points along South Hwy 62.  ",

A large vertical sign announces the trailhead. The trail has 10 ft (3 m) of elevation gain and is accessible to all-terrain wheelchairs. There are multiple vantage points to stop for views of the spired pinnacles. These appeared after a stream reestablished its valley and removed lighter and less-resistant vocanic material, leaving many prominent pinnacles along the canyon walls. Vies also reach across the deep canyon and tree tops. To",

A large sign in a wooden frame provides information about the Vision Fire that burned much of the surrounding landscape in October 1995. From the west end of the parking lot, the Inverness Ridge Trail—which is a single-lane dirt-gravel service road closed to visitor vehicular traffic—heads to the north along the ridge crest. A ten-foot-long metal gate blocks vehicular passage onto the Inverness Ridge Trail, but there is sufficient room on either side of the gate for pedestrians, bicyclists, and horse riders. The single-track Bayview Trail ascends from a wooded valley to west, enters the parking lot near its southwest corner, crosses the paved road, and then parallels the road along its south side as it winds to the east along the ridge crest. Trail signage near where the trails depart from the road or parking lot provide information about what uses (i.e., pet walking, camping, building fires, riding bicycles) are prohibited on which trails and the distances to other trails or points of interest.",

The first U.S. Life-saving Service station at Point Reyes was built in 1889 along the unprotected Point Reyes Beach to aid ships that were stranded or wrecked along the shores of this peninsula that stretches 10 miles (16 km) into the Pacific Ocean. In 1927, operations were relocated to the new lifeboat station on the more protected Drakes Bay near Chimney Rock. From 1927 to 1968, the Pacific Area U.S. Coast Guard officers and crew members used motorized lifeboats to aid ships. However, during the World Wars, with the militarization efforts of the West Coast, the primary operations of the life-saving station shifted to coastal defense and harbor patrol.</p> <p>In 1968, the property was transferred to the National Park Service and Point Reyes National Seashore, which used the lifeboat station for park housing until it was restored in 1976. As a result of further restoration to the historic district, Point Reyes possesses the only surviving lifeboat station on the Pacific Coast with an intact marine railway.</p> <p>Visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/stories_maritime_lifeboatstation.htm\">Lifeboat Station History at Point Reyes</a> page for more information.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/parkregulations.htm\">Park Regulations</a></h2> <ul> <li>Vehicles over 24 feet (7.3 meters) in length and vehicles pulling trailers with a combined length in excess of 24 feet (7.3 meters) are prohibited on Chimney Rock Road.</li> <li><strong>Take only pictures; leave only footprints:</strong> Almost everything one finds at Point Reyes is protected by law, including shells, rocks, fossils, flowers, and artifacts.</li> <li>Please only travel on authorized trails, respect posted signs, and practice <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">Leave No Trace principles</a> when recreating in the park.</li> <li><strong>Pets</strong> are <u>not</u> permitted on any of the paths, trails, or driveways in the Chimney Rock area.

From the parking lot, follow \"Boathouse\" signs that direct you down the driveway. At the Y, follow the paved path/driveway to the right. The first white building on your right is the original Officer-in-charge Quarters. Section of the pathway to the boathouse involve steep descents.</p> <p>During weekends and holidays from late December through early April, docents may staff the lifeboat station's boathouse and would be available to answer questions and offer tours of the station.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The historic lifeboat station's boat house is a two-story building measuring about 40 feet by 60 feet (12 meters by 18 meters). It is painted white with green trim on the windows, and a red gabled roof. One of the 40-foot-wide sides faces Drakes Bay to the north-northeast. Drakes Bay is a semicircular body of water stretching about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from west to east and about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from north to south, opening to the Pacific Ocean to the south. The northwest side of Drakes Bay is line by beige-colored bluffs that rise above sandy beaches. The boathouse is located near the southwest end of Drakes Bay along a narrow peninsula that stretches east from the west end of the much larger Point Reyes Peninsula. Immediately to the south of the lifeboat station and boathouse, grass covered hills rise steeply about 200 feet (60 meters) in elevation, before dropping abruptly into the ocean. A long wooden marine railway, designed to lower a lifeboat into the water, extends into the bay on wooden piers from the north-northeast-facing side of the boathouse. Next to the building is a small area for cars to park, and wooden railings painted white marking the parking area and deck of the building. A small beach edges Drakes Bay on both sides of the building. A one-lane-wide driveway leads steeply up and over a headland to the west-northwest toward a two-story-tall white house, a couple garages, and other out buildings associated with the Lifeboat Station. Coniferous trees surround the buildings, shielding them from wind.",

Hinrik's son, Captain Peter Henry Claussen, arrived at the ranch in 1871 after a short career at sea, and became an active dairyman, served on the school board, and, after 1890, was very active assisting United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) personnel during many maritime emergencies.

            "audioDescription": "Marshall Beach is a 400-foot-long (366-meter-long) sandy beach on the west side of Tomales Bay in the northern part of Point Reyes National Seashore. Tomales Bay a narrow ocean inlet that is over 10 miles (16 kilometers) long and averages about one mile wide (1.6 kilometers), stretching from its mouth at the north-northwest end to its head toward the south-southeast. The east side of the bay is lined with many building (mostly residences) of the small community of Marshall. Rising above Marshall to the east is a pasture-covered ridge that runs parallel to the bay. A forested ridge parallels the bay on its west side, with trees descending to the water's edge along most of the western side of the bay. Along the west side of the southern end of the bay are the small communities of Inverness and Inverness Park. The northern end of the western side of the bay is lined with small bluffs and headlands which separate sandy beaches of varying lengths. Marshall Beach is located about halfway between the bay's head and mouth, due west from the community of Marshall. It stretches along the northern end of a small circular cove and is one of the bay's longer beaches.",

Legend has it that the places their feet touched in their ceremonies caused the grass to wither away and never grow again. <br /> <br /> While these stories are simply local legends and folklore passed down through generations, keep a lookout as you explore the area. Who knows, you may come across some areas of bare ground! <br /> <br /> Witch Dance has two shaded picnic areas, one at the horse trailer parking (5 tables-shown in photo), and another upper picnic area 150 yards past the horse trailer parking where horses are not allowed. The upper picnic area has nine tables and grills, including an accessible picnic spot, spread around a shady 250-yard paved loop with parking for cars and RVs. <br /> <br /> The two trailheads near the horsetrail picnic area enter Tombigbee National Forest and lead to a horse camp and the fifteen miles of loops and cross-over trails maintained by US Forest Service.

A small open field is adjacent to the trailhead to the south. Another trail runs from the southwestern portion of the parking lot to the north. This trail leads to several picnic tables with forest on either side of them. The trail continues on to loop back to the northern part of the parking lot. At the center of the parking lot to the east is a brown restroom facility that has light posts outside of it. The entrance to the restrooms is facing west and in between the entrances is a bulletin board for the National Park Service where map brochures can be obtained. To the south of the restrooms is a stairway leading up to a parking lot on the eastern side of the restrooms, and on the southern side of the staircase is a large sign telling of the folklore of Witch Dance. The parking lot that the stairs lead up to is the second exit that can be taken for Witch Dance. The parking lot is a paved pull through parking lot that loop through behind the restroom facility.",

The original Wolf pole has been preserved and now stands in Totem Hall. This pole is 22 feet tall. The bottom figure is a salmon, facing downward. The eyes of the salmon are round with a blue green ring around them. Below that is a wolf, recognized by his pointed ears. The inside of the ears and around the eyes are painted green blue, the lips and tongue are red. The wolf and salmon may represent clan crests or may symbolize characters from a legend of a boy who was captured by the Dog Salmon people. The top figure is a man, perhaps the Village Watchman or the pole’s owner. It has a red hat with a black stripe. The original pole was acquired by Alaska territorial governor John Brady from a village near Prince of Wales. The exact location or from whom it was acquired may not have been recorded. Prior research indicated that the pole originated from the Haida village of Howkan, which is located on Long Island near Prince of Wales Island. Newer research indicates that this pole likely originates from the Tlingit village of Tuxekan on Prince of Wales Island, because its carving is more similar to other poles seen in historic photos of Tuxekan.   This is most likely a <b>crest pole</b>. The figures on this pole are very life-like and distinct as compared with the highly interconnected and overlapping design of many Haida poles. Tlingit poles typically have figures isolated from one another and present a more rounded and sculpted appearance, which can be seen on this pole.

            "audioDescription": "Declaration House. This brick house sits on the corner of the street. Three stories high, it is a narrow rectangle with the long side facing Seventh Street. The paneled door is near the right end of this side with a single window between it and the end of the house. Left of the door there are three windows. The door has a triangular pediment over it, projecting out slightly from the wall. The windows on the first two floors are multipaned with wood paneled shutters. The third-floor windows are smaller with no shutters. All the windows have a stone lintel above them with a keystone accent. Above the third floor, two more of the smaller-size windows are in the gable of the peaked roof. Under each first-floor window there is a small angled cellar access panel. Entrance is not through the main door, but through a door to the left on the back end of the house. This end of the house is only two windows deep with a dormer window sitting on the roof above. Here, there is a courtyard garden paved with brick with plantings around the perimeter. Along the street the courtyard is enclosed by a low brick wall with an iron rail fence on top. The entry to the house is through an iron gate along this low brick wall. On the concrete wall across the courtyard from the gate raised lettering reads, \"On this site stood the house where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.\" The right end of the house, facing Market Street, is similar -- two windows deep, but with no door. Two larger cellar access panels are below the first-floor windows on this side. To the right is a small triangular garden enclosed by an iron rail fence. On the right side of the garden large panels on a concrete wall display the well-known opening of the Declaration of Independence which reads, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. July 4, 1776.\" End of Description.",

The first structure is a stone farmhouse with an exhibit detailing the significance of the farm and the families that lived here. The wide dirt trail continues east through grasses and desert scrub to a small grove of mesquites with a shaded bench, then proceeds to the second structure, La Casita.<br /> From here, the trail ascends a moderately steep hill. At the top of the hill, the trail forks. What remains of the Sublett house is to the right (this area is especially fragile - stay on the trail). The left fork leads to the Dorgan house, where the fireplace and part of the walls are still standing. Take a look through the windows and enjoy a spectacular view of several Big Bend landmarks - the Chisos Mountains, Emory Peak, and Mule Ears to the north and east; Santa Elena Canyon to the southwest. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The trail is rock and sand with portions crossing sandy washes. This short path has one climb of 56 feet from the second adobe structure to the two structures located on top of the hill. <br /> A dirt pullout at the trailhead provides parking for two vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",
            "audioDescription": "At the parking area is a sign describes the Dorgan Sublett Trail. The surrounding landscape is dotted with plants such as cacti, creosote bushes, and mesquite trees. Further along the trail a stone structure and exhibit signs explain the history of the farming in this area. Continuing on, another stone building is visible along the dirt trail as you rise into higher terrain at the top of the hill. The wide dirt trail continues east through grasses and desert scrub to a small grove of mesquites with a shaded bench, then proceeds to the second structure. At the top of the hill, the trail forks. To the right, a cement slab marks the location of the Sublett house (this area is especially fragile, please stay on the trail).

Later they built an impressive adobe home on top of the mesa. Roof width in the Castolon area was limited by the length of vigas (wood ceiling beams), which were typically from the small local mesquite or cottonwood trees. Dorgan used his expertise as an architect to design this atypical house. The petrified wood fireplace in the center of the house was more than just decoration; it provided a place for the vigas to meet in the center of the room, making his house twice as wide and deep as other Castolon homes.<br /> <br /> Dorgan owned pumps and irrigation equipment, which he leased to James Sublett for several years. Dorgan also sold vegetables and employed several area families, including the Garcia family of La Coyota, to crate and ship vegetables.<br /> <br /> The Dorgan’s left their Big Bend property in 1938 due to business and health issues. The Dorgan and Sublett business partnership also dissolved. In 1941, Dorgan leased the property to A.F. Robinson who intended to open the “Mexitex Resort”, evidently hoping to benefit from the national park which was being established in the area at that time. The resort failed, and Dorgan sold his holdings for inclusion in Big Bend National Park.",

In the 1930s , Dorgan and his wife, Avis Ann, built this adobe home on the mesa, with large windows at the front and a double fireplace that opened into the central living area. The Dorgans vacated their Big Bend property in 1938. In 1941 they leased to the property to A.F. Robinson, who opened the “Mexitex Resort”, hoping to benefit from the new national park.

En la década de 1930, Dorgan y su esposa, Avis Ann, construyeron esta casa de adobe en la mesa, con ventanas grandes en el frente y una chimenea doble que se daba a la gran sala central. Los Dorgans desocuparon su propiedad en Big Bend en 1938 y en 1941 la alquilaron a A.F. Robinson, quien abrió el hotel “Mexitex Resort”, con la esperanza de beneficiarse del parque nacional cual pronto se establecería ahí.

The building represents the everyday life of the many families who lived and farmed along the Rio Grande. This building was constructed around 1901 by Cipriano Hernandez, one of the Hispanic settlers who farmed near Castolon. He raised vegetables and grain for sale to the mining camps. Corn, beans, squash, tomatoes, and melons were common crops grown by families along the Rio Grande. <br /> <br /> As the population grew, Hernandez enlarged his home and used the space to open a small store where he sold supplies to his neighbors. In 1918, Alvino Ybarra moved into the house. In 1922, Alvino married Teofila Luna and raised three sons and three daughters in the house. Even in this remote area, education was a priority, so the Ybarra children attended school for four months in Castolon, then four months in Terlingua, as there were not enough teachers to keep both schools open for an entire school year.<br /> <br /> Alvino earned his living by operating the engines that powered the cotton gin and the water pump that brought water from the Rio Grande to irrigate the fields. He worked from 5 a.m. to sundown, earning premium wages for the area of $1.50 per day. This was further supplemented by working as a La Harmonia Company tenant farmer. The Alvino House also served as a civil center for area residents. Alvino’s family set aside a room as a religious shrine, where a priest performed masses, baptisms, and weddings several times a year. The community also celebrated holidays at the Alvino House, coming together as friends and family.<br /> <br /> Teofila Ybarra died in 1936, but Alvino continued living here until 1957, when he moved to Alpine. Several of their grandchildren still live in the Big Bend region.The Alvino House affords a close look at a recently repaired and stabilized adobe structure. Adobe masons from Santa Helena, Mexico used their expertise to restore this structure in 1994. The men manufactured adobe bricks on the site, shored up the sagging roof, and repaired the walls. The berm around the foundation of the structure was built in 2008 to protect it from floodwaters.",

According to one American Indian tradition: <br /> <br /> “The Great Spirit called the warring nations together in the valley of the pipestone. There he pulled a piece of pipestone from the earth, formed a pipe and told them that it was the flesh and blood of their ancestors. He smoked the pipe over them and admonished them to lay down their arms. Here is a place where different tribes can quarry side by side together in harmony. While he was speaking, a waterfall poured from the rock nearby.” -Original storyteller unknown <br /> <br /> **Please do not attempt to go into the water. It is contaminated and unfit for consumption or recreation.**",
            "audioDescription": "Nearing the waterfall (Winnewissa Falls), the sound of cascading water is audible. Just before reaching the waterfall, a metal banister stands approximately 3 feet high on the left-hand side and indicates where the trail splits to later rejoin itself approximately 30 feet below. The left fork, bordered by the banister almost until the point where the trail rejoins, provides a ramped surface, a brown public bench (approximately 8 feet in length), and two brown trash cans on the righthand side of the trail. The right trash can is intended for recyclables, while the left trash can is intended for garbage. The right fork of the trail offers a more direct approach down a set of four stone stairs that vary in height and length. At the point where the trail rejoins, the waterfall becomes visible and a hand railing approximately 4 feet high begins on the righthand side where the cliff face gives way to the stream channel. The total length of this railing is approximately 20 feet, and it extends partway across a textured-surface bridge before terminating at a set of large Sioux Quartzite boulders that serve as a natural border for the bridge’s remaining distance. Another set of handrails is provided on the left-hand side of the trail, beginning at the start of the bridge and terminating at a large tree that stands approximately ten feet from the end of the bridge (also a trail junction). This handrail measures approximately 35 feet in total distance. Please take caution as the viewing platform and bridge can be very slippery when wet or icy. When standing on the bridge directly before Winnewissa Falls, the waterfall is about 40 feet upstream. The falls are bounded by the pink Sioux Quartzite cliffs on either side. The water drops from a height of approximately 10 feet and many boulders of varying sizes are strewn throughout the water below. Fish can sometimes be seen swimming in these waters. Mosses and lichens cover the rocks, and the area is protected by numerous trees growing both above and below the falls. Downstream from the bridge, the water stills in a natural pool before flowing over a small cascade of boulders and then flowing parallel to the pathway. This portion of creek bed continues to be littered with cobbles and boulders and lined by trees and other vegetation. The water in this creek, though beautiful and peaceful, is degraded in quality due to agricultural sources located upstream; visitors (and their pets) should not drink or enter the water due to its bacterial and chemical loads. Where the bridge terminates, there is a brown sign on the left-hand side that reads “Winnewissa Falls” and the trail comes to a T. To the right, a side loop of the Circle Trail leads to a steep, rocky staircase located approximately 50 feet up the trail; it contains 22 unevenly-spaced stairs leading up the cliffside through a low-clearance natural rock archway. Continuing along this route will lead to a viewpoint from the top of Winnewissa Falls, a top-down view of the historical pillar known as Leaping Rock, the site of the inscriptions left by the Nicollet Expedition of 1838 (including informational waysides), and a staircase leading back down to the main trail while showcasing some of the park’s geologic features. To the left of the T, the trail slopes gently downward and roughly follows the creek and cliff line. The base of Leaping Rock is visible along this portion of trail and there is a brown public bench (approximately 8 feet long) provided on the left side of the trail (approximately 75 feet down the trail). The side loop rejoins the main trail approximately 120 feet below the T junction at a pair of brown signs for “Old Stone Face.”",

            "bodyText": "In the early 1920s, the La Harmonia Company began farming cotton in the floodplain of the Rio Grande. This steam engine was used to pump water from the Rio Grande to irrigate the cotton fields and other crops. The Morse engine was used to run the cotton gin. Originally, cotton was hauled to Marathon to be ginned, which proved costly and impractical. To save money, in 1923, a gin was built in Castolon. Ginning cotton removes the seeds, which decreases the weight and shipping costs.<br /> <br /> In the first year of operation, 146 bales of cotton were ginned from cotton grown by La Harmonia Company tenant farmers. Later, when cotton was found to be a viable crop, farmers from Johnson’s Ranch to Lajitas were bringing their cotton to Castolon to be ginned. In 1925, the gin had its best year with 251 bales. The arrival of the Pink Boll worm in 1927 was the beginning of the end for cotton in the region. By 1942, La Harmonia Company was ginning its last cotton crop of a mere 54 bales.<br /> <br /> This gin stood near Cottonwood Campground until 1978 when a flood swept most of it downstream. The foundation for the warehouse and remnant scraps of metal are still visible near the amphitheater.",
            "audioDescription": "A steam engine and several pieces of large metal machinery used for pumping water to crops and cotton ginning are on display. Around the exhibit are several adobe and wooden Castolon Historic District buildings, most from the 1920s. Text on the Exhibit Panel Cotton Boom in Castolon: \"Before the 1920s, no one along this part of the Rio Grande had ever planted cotton. In 1922, businessman Wayne Cartledge began to sow that high-dollar commercial crop in these river-bottom fields. Cartledge also introduced steam and gas-powered irrigation pumps that boosted his harvests. After 1923, he increased the value of his cotton by “ginning” it before he sold it- that is, by mechanically separating the tiny seeds from the fibers. By 1942, mounting costs and falling prices ended La Harmonia’s cotton venture. Only the machines you see here today are left to remind us of this foray into large-scale farming.\" Spanish translation on sign: Bonanza algodonera Antes de la década de los 1920 nadie jamás cultivaba el algodón en este sector del río Bravo del Norte. En 1922 el empresario Wayne Cartledge empezó a sembrar este provechoso cultivo comercial en sus campos aluviales. También Cartledge introdujo bombas de riego con poder de vapor o gasolina para aumentar su producción. Después del año de 1923, La Harmonía agrandaba el vapor de su algodón por su desmotarlo antes de venderlo- es decir separar mecánicamente las semillas minúsculas de los copos fibrosos. Peso de gastos crecientes y precios disminuidos se acabó su aventura de algodón en 1942. Hoy sólo la maquinaria que se ve aquí nos recuerda de esta aventura en la agrícola de gran escala.",

This recarving was completed in 1982 by Nathan Jackson (Yéilch Ya’di) and Steve Brown (Kaajísdu.áxch). Notice the difference in adzing style and carving technique between this recarving and the recarving of the first twin. Although the design is the same, each carver executes the design with an individualized touch. As with the First Twin, previously seen along Totem Trail, the crests on this pole represent the clan lineages of the family who owned the pole.<br /> Starting at the bottom is the bear which holds an animal in its mouth. Atop the bear is Raven, followed by Raven sitting in human form. On the top of the pole is the Village Watchman.<br /> A figure of the Village Watchman at the top is unique to Haida crest poles and has no significance or relationship to the crests. It is intended to let the people know that they are being watched over and will be protected. The carved hat worn by the Town Watchman is intended to represent the conical chief’s hat that is carved of wood or woven of spruce roots and topped by a series of rings carved into the wood or cylinders woven of spruce roots and attached such that the cylinders sways as the wearer of the hat dances. It is believed that in the past each cylinder or ring indicated the number of potlatches that have been given. The greater the number of potlaches that an individual had hosted, the greater the status of the clan.  A “Potlatch” among Native people of the Northwest Coast is an opulent ceremonial feast at which possessions are given away or destroyed to display wealth or enhance prestige.</p>",

Dotted with sagebrush and bunch grass that crunches underfoot during the hot dry summers, this arid landscape is the improbable home to beavers, osprey, salmon, and other iconic wildlife of the Pacific Northwest. Sustaining human and animal life in the dry shrub steppe of eastern Washington for millennia, the Columbia River also provided water to cool the plutonium production nuclear reactors during the Manhattan Project and Cold War.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbc5f220-9922-4149-89a4-3e486878b031}{195}\" paraid=\"12021545\">Millions of years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch, the ancestral Columbia River laid down the deposits that became the white bluffs. Around three million years ago, plate tectonics raised the area, and the Columbia River began cutting down through the deposits. These deposits were further shaped by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/iafl/index.htm\">Ice Age floods</a>, a series of cataclysmic floods at the end of the last Ice Age some 12,000 to 17,000 years ago. These floods left lasting dramatic and distinguishing features on the landscape in parts of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbc5f220-9922-4149-89a4-3e486878b031}{224}\" paraid=\"1943127275\">The Nez Perce, Umatilla, Wanapum, and Yakama tribes have called the Hanford area home since time immemorial. Fur trappers arrived in the 1820s to purchase pelts from area tribes. White settlers began arriving about 30 years later, displacing many Native American communities. Settlers relied on extensive irrigation to grow a wide array of agricultural products, including cherries, asparagus, alfalfa, peppermint, and many other marketable commodities.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbc5f220-9922-4149-89a4-3e486878b031}{252}\" paraid=\"1461050986\">On January 16, 1943, General Leslie R. Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production displacing tribal and settler communities. The federal government appropriate 670 square miles (1740 sq kilometers) of land for the Hanford Site. Atomic Energy Commission, which assumed management of the nation’s nuclear weapons program from the Army Corps of Engineers at the end of the World War II, greatly expanded Hanford’s plutonium production capacity during the Cold War. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site ended in 1987. Since then, the area has been the focus of extensive environmental cleanup work. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{735b4091-559d-402c-9336-789958dd852c}{181}\" paraid=\"1461050986\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{735b4091-559d-402c-9336-789958dd852c}{185}\" paraid=\"1211366847\">At the White Bluffs Overlook, you may walk across the white bluffs themselves.

The federal government has operated the Hanford Sites since 1943, maintaining its isolation and limited commercial development. The size of the Hanford Site and its relative isolation helped fuel a new scientific project almost 50 years later.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{623d9d06-3522-43ef-a63d-20ae3a4e61db}{218}\" paraid=\"1652898836\">In 1992, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was built near Hanford Site to detect gravitational wave vibrations from outer space. Its instruments, called interferometers, have arms that stretch to about 2.5 miles (4 km) long. The instruments are very sensitive to local vibrations like those from human activity. LIGO selected the Hanford area for one of its two interferometers because Hanford is still relatively isolated from a lot of human activity. The Hanford area also has the required space for the massive scientific project. Scientists use the instruments to help study major stellar events like the collision of black holes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{623d9d06-3522-43ef-a63d-20ae3a4e61db}{224}\" paraid=\"629932519\">LIGO is a modern example of Hanford’s history of high-technology research and scientific discovery that dates to the Manhattan Project and the construction of the B Reactor.

McClellan Memorial is located on a triangular median at the intersection of California Street, Connecticut Avenue, and Columbia Road, N.W. in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, DC. The Washington Hilton is across Columbia Road to the east.<br />The memorial stands amid busy traffic, though there are three walkways to access the triangle at its NW, NE and southern corners.<br />The thirteen-foot tall bronze equestrian statue faces south down Connecticut Avenue towards Dupont Circle, and downtown Washington beyond. McClellan is dressed in full military uniform including gauntlets, hat and sash and his sword hangs at his left side. He holds his horse's reins with his left hand and his right hand placed on his hip. The horse's right front hoof is raised, and its head curled downward.<br />The eighteen-foot tall, nine-foot long oblong granite pedestal rests on a forty-four-foot long, thirty-foot wide base. On either side of the pedestal is a bronze relief featuring an array of armaments - spears, axes, eagle-capped staffs, and a pair of crossed cannons draped in a shroud. An inscription on a bag at the bottom left corner of the east side relief reads: 57. An inscription in the lower right corner reads: Mac Monnies.<br />Encircling the pedestal base is a bronze oak and laurel garland that runs between bronze eagles standing atop spheres in each corner. Bronze shields line the top of the pedestal and are inscribed with the names:<br />Yorktown<br />Malvern Hill<br />Fair Oaks<br />South Mountain<br />Antietam<br />Williamsburg<br />Rich Mountain<br />Gaine's Mill<br />An inscription on the front face of the pedestal reads:<br />MAJOR GENERAL<br />GEORGE BRINTON McCLELLAN<br />1826-1885<br />Six granite steps lead up to the memorial from all four sides. Lush foliage and overgrowth line the front and back of the memorial and a tall evergreen tree sits at its east side.<br />Featured in back of the statue is raised lettering and the words:<br />Erected by the<br />Society of the Army of the Potomac<br />And the<br />Congress of the United States<br />1907<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Each bench is about six feet long and 1.5 feet high.<br />Just on the west side of the plaza, opposite and facing the steps, is a four-foot tall bronze bust sculpture of Muhlenberg displayed on an about eight-foot high limestone pedestal with a two-step, octagonal cement base and surrounded on three sides by a low 1.5-foot tall concrete wall. Trees line the back and both sides of the low wall.<br />The sculpture depicts Muhlenberg in civilian dress, with his hands resting on an open Bible before him. The bust faces to the east, toward Connecticut Avenue.

Mr. Helsom’s land eventually became the White Bluffs cemetery for several decades, until the arrival of the Manhattan Project.  <br />  <br /> Removed from their homes in 1943, along with other settlers in Hanford and Richland, White Bluffs residents hastily gathered their belongings and uprooted their lives to provide land for the Manhattan Project. On May 6, 1943, 177 caskets from the White Bluffs Cemetery, were moved from their original resting place to a section of the Prosser Cemetery dedicated to the reinterred remains by the Manhattan Project personnel. Later, the remains of five additional White Bluffs residents were found and reinterred in Prosser. These graves, which descendants paid for after the move, are a space where the descendants of White Bluffs settlers can commemorate their loved ones and connect with their displaced community. <h2>Continue Your Journey </h2>   <p paraeid=\"{7098596e-d9b8-4ace-925b-0567ee33212e}{228}\" paraid=\"26269694\">The Department of Energy offers tours of the <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">B Reactor</a> and the  <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites Tour</a>  that visit sites such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bruggemann-ranch.htm\">Bruggemann Ranch,</a> the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-bank.htm\">White Bluffs Bank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford High School</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/allard-pumphouse.htm\">Allard Pumphouse</a> where local people lived, worked, and came together as a tight-knit community prior to the arrival of the Manhattan Project. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8f88595c-75eb-4bdd-8306-546052164b7f}{13}\" paraid=\"1301443833\">If you are unable to attend one of these tours you, can see the former White Bluffs community from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-overlook.htm\">White Bluffs Overlook</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school-overlook.htm\">Hanford High School </a>from the White Bluffs trail on the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument. </a>  </p>",

Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, directed Lieutenant Colonel Franklin T. Matthias to search the United States for a place to produce plutonium. After viewing several locations, Matthias visited Hanford on December 22 and knew he found an ideal place to produce plutonium. Groves wanted a large, sparsely populated area with ready access to water and electricity. The towns of Hanford, White Bluffs, and Richland were near the site, but all were small farming communities. The Columbia River could supply the water needed to cool the nuclear reactors. The project could get the massive amounts of electric power required for plutonium production from Grand Coulee Dam, which began operating in 1942. Upon seeing this area, Matthias believed he “found the only place in the country that could match the requirements for a desirable site.” On January 16, 1943, Groves approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production.  <br />  <br /> Still, the Hanford Site presented challenges as well as opportunities. Heavy windstorms inundated workers’ homes with sand. These storms were known as “termination winds” because they drove workers to resign. The site’s isolation enabled the Manhattan Project to maintain secrecy while limiting the health and safety impact of plutonium production on nearby residents. The Hanford Site’s rocky soil protected large industrial facilities safe from earthquake damage. These favorable conditions led the Atomic Energy Commission, which assumed management of the nation’s nuclear weapons program from the Army Corps of Engineers at the end of the World War II, to greatly expand Hanford’s plutonium production capacity during the Cold War. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site ended in 1987. Since then, the area has been the focus of extensive environmental cleanup work. <br />  <br /> Today, Saddle Mountain lies within the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hanford_reach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument</a>, administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Hanford Reach preserves the last free-flowing (not dammed) section of the Columbia River. From the top of Saddle Mountain, you can see the foundations of the military barracks where soldiers guarded the Hanford Site from potential aerial attack. These barracks were later abandoned when three Nike missile sites were built on the valley floor. Though no maintained trails exist to the summit of Saddle Mountain, hiking on informal trails and cross-country travel is permitted. Hiking, watersports, and other outdoor activities are available at numerous other locations within the national monument. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{df85ef5e-f04b-41f1-b7a9-bfc227362966}{148}\" paraid=\"326202942\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{df85ef5e-f04b-41f1-b7a9-bfc227362966}{148}\" paraid=\"326202942\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{7d11dbda-b945-4fd8-8cf9-7bba561c7b5e}{54}\" paraid=\"1350751819\">The Department of Energy offers tours of the <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">B Reactor</a> and the  <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites Tour</a>  that visit sites such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bruggemann-ranch.htm\">Bruggemann Ranch,</a> the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-bank.htm\">White Bluffs Bank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford High School</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/allard-pumphouse.htm\">Allard Pumphouse</a> where local people lived, worked, and came together as a tight-knit community prior to the arrival of the Manhattan Project. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7d11dbda-b945-4fd8-8cf9-7bba561c7b5e}{96}\" paraid=\"1731835376\">If you are unable to attend one of these tours you, can see the former White Bluffs community from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-overlook.htm\">White Bluffs Overlook</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school-overlook.htm\">Hanford High School </a>from the White Bluffs trail on the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument. </a>  </p>",

Newlands<br />Along the top of the fountain wall at its south end is an inscription carved into the wall that reads:<br />Newlands Memorial Fountain <br />On the east side of the circle, just outside the bench area, is a five-foot tall, one and a half-foot wide cement boundary stone monolith sitting on a white base. On its southern face is a nine by twelve-inch design of the Maryland flag, featuring a checkerboard and cross design in alternating corners. Beneath is inscribed: Maryland. The opposite, north face has an equal-sized design of a man standing on a pedestal and woman below him to the right. Beneath is inscribed: District of Columbia. The monolith has a ribbed design of horizontal and vertical lines surrounding the emblems, though the pattern appears on all four sides.<br />An identical five-foot tall cement monolith sits on the west side of the circle, just outside of the bench area. This monolith has a darker tone due to black soot on its surface. Here the order of emblems alternates compared to the monolith on the east, with the District of Columbia emblem on the south, and Maryland on the north.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

            "audioDescription": "This site features bunker-style structures with exposed fronts made of weathered concrete. The sides and backs of the structures are covered with soil. As you face the structures, the long front wall on the left has two entrances, one for TA-8-3 at the far left and one for TA-8-1 near the middle. To the right is a third structure, TA-8-2. Between the two structures is a narrow gravel road leading up a wooded slope behind the buildings. The section at the far left has a set of wooden steps leading up to a wood porch that stretches a third of the way along the section. At the right side of the porch is a set of wooden double doors. At the left side is a single-door-sized opening covered with a sheet of plywood. The wall around the doors is painted a cream color. There are four metal grills surrounding the double doors, two on either side at floor-level and the other two directly above those, just above the height of the doors. Higher up on the wall above the doors are two rusty cylinders. Pipes come out of the wall below each, enter the base of cylinder and exit out its top. The entrance in the middle of the building has a raised concrete porch in front of it with wooden steps on the left. The rectangular opening in the concrete is filled with a wooden wall section painted turquoise. On the left side of the wall is a wooden door with four panes of glass on its top half. The door is painted dark green. Signs posted near each of the entrances identify each building as a Manhattan Project National Historical Park Historic building. On the right third of the building is another door-sized opening, this one covered by a sheet of plywood. To the right of that door, there is a long, horizontal window, about six feet long and two feet tall. A long, two-foot-high concrete curb sits on the gravel in front of the door and window. The next building on the right side of the gravel road extends back into the hill. The narrow end towards us is rounded. On the far side, away from the road, is another concrete porch with two sets of green metal doors. End of Description.",

            "audioDescription": "This site features three structures, each with an earthen berm covering the roof and three sides with only the front uncovered for access. All three buildings have signs in front designating each as a Manhattan Project National Historical Park Historic building, a historic facility eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, and a sign with the arrowhead-shaped logo of the National Park Service. Building TA-11-1, the control building, has a concrete front wall with a heavy wooden door in the middle. The door has very large hinges down the left side. To the left of the door is a metal electrical box with metal conduit extending out the top. To the right of the door is a piece of metal duct work curved downward to point to the ground. At either side of the wall are retaining walls extending out towards us, slanted from the top of the building down to the ground, with the earthen berm on the other side. All the walls and the door are painted pinkish-tan. The tops of the walls are capped with metal flashing painted blue. The other two structures sit back-to-back, with the space between filled by the earthen berm. Structure TA-11-3 is the Cloud Chamber. Like the control structure, its entrance is set back between slanted retaining walls with a narrower opening between them. In addition to the heavy door on the front-facing wall, there is another door on the left retaining wall. A flat roof extends over the back half of the alcove. Above the back door there is metal ductwork and vertical metal piping. On the right wall are electrical boxes. Along the left retaining wall is a metal staircase leading to a small platform above the entrance. The third structure, TA-11-2 housed the betatron. The structure is a small building with vertical metal siding painted brick red and a flat roof that slants upward over the rear of the structure that extends into the earthen berm behind. The door is gray metal. A fire extinguisher hangs to the left of the door. A chain link fence extends out from the front left corner. End of Description.",

Sadly, he didn’t live to see Boston become a bustling canal town.<br /> <br /> His oldest son, George, no doubt profited from the canal. He built this Greek Revival house in 1843 and expanded the family farm to 283 acres by 1853.  Over time, the family had sheep, dairy cattle, orchards, timber, and grain. Besides farming, George and his son ran a lumber business on the property.<br /> <br /> Today, the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a> offers overnight accommodations for individuals and groups in a restored Stanford House. The building’s interior reflects its historic character while also featuring furnishings crafted locally from sustainable and reclaimed materials.

            "audioDescription": "Stanford House. 313 words This white frame house is in the shape of an “L.” The section at left is two stories with two rows of three windows with green shutters. A smaller window is under the peak of the gable at top. The section of the house that stretches to the right is lower, the peak of its roof just fitting under the eaves of the other section. There are half-height windows on the upper floor just under the roofline. In the corner of the “L” is a covered porch leading to the door. A wayside graphic panel is located at the right end of the sidewalk which leads from the driveway to the porch. To the right of the house is a small garage building with a parking area in front. To the left, the driveway runs down a slight slope to the road. Behind you as you face the panel is a large grassy lawn with a very large barn at the side away from the road. The background of the panel shows a drawing of the Stanford farm circa 1870s. The house is shown at an angle, paralleling the road. A plain, white rail fence surrounds the house and barn. A man and a woman play croquet on the lawn. Text on the panel reads, “James Stanford – one of the original settlers of the Western Reserve and surveyor for the Connecticut Land Company – claimed this land in 1806. His oldest son, George, built this house in 1843 and expanded the family farm to 283 acres by 1853. Besides farming, George and his son ran a lumber business on the property. “Today, the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park offers overnight accommodations for individuals and groups in a restored Stanford House. The building’s interior reflects its historic character while also featuring furnishings crafted locally from sustainable and reclaimed materials.” End of description.",

Forbes June 1864 Map inset on right: Hand drawn map of Jordan house in center encircled by earthworks and rifle pits. Caption reads: US Army map detail of Jordan plantation July 1864 Main text reads: Before you is the foundation of “Clermont” the center of a 500 acre plantation where Josiah Jordan III’s family lived before the siege. Behind you and to your left were the quarters of sixteen enslaved Black men and women owned by Jordan. Starting in 1862, slaves and Confederate troops built a wall around Petersburg. Going from your right and running behind you it split the Jordan property. If war came to Clermont the wall may have meant protection to the Jordans but perhaps freedom to the enslaved. By the time war arrived here on June 15, 1864, the Jordans had left. At war’s end there is no evidence the freed Blacks returned here, and nothing is known of their post-Civil War lives. The Jordans returned to their destroyed house and chose to rebuild. Clermont’s story played out in different ways in post-war Petersburg with people uprooted in terms of loss, in terms of a new-found freedom, or both.",

The cottage is located in an area known as Blackhawk Island in Sumner, Wisconsin. It is a simple 20 foot by 20 foot, single story, wood frame building with painted split-log vertical siding, resting on an elevated concrete foundation. Lorine Niedecker lived in the cottage from its construction in 1946 until she moved away in 1963. The floor is of plywood panels, and the walls are of exposed wood composed of the back of the horizontal wood exterior sheathing. The interior of the cottage is spare and parts of it are unfinished. It was in this cabin, where at a small desk placed in front of a window, Lorine wrote most of her poetry.  <br /> <br /> Niedecker is widely considered to be one of the seminal modern Objectivist poets of the mid-twentieth century. Niedecker's influence extended far outside of the small community where she lived. Niedecker’s poetry owes much to her life and the place where she lived, and the subject matter of much of her work- in the Objectivist tradition directly references her home and its environs. While her work was largely unknown during her lifetime, she took part in the discourse on modern poetics from the 1930s through the 1960s, her work was more frequently published later in her life, and posthumously she has been published and has received critical acclaim. Her work, often focusing on the concept of place, biography, and the subconscious, is considered some of the finest examples of objectivist, surrealist, and folk poetry of the period.<br /> <br /> Lorine Faith Niedecker was born on May 12, 1903 in a small summer cottage associated with the Fountain House on Blackhawk Island Road. As a child, Lorine Niedecker quickly developed a reputation as being studious and literary, and earned excellent grades. Her high school teacher, Daisy Lieberman, is credited with inspiring Lorine’s love of poetry. Lorine graduated at the top of her high school class and was accepted to the private liberal arts focused Beloit College. With a reputation as a progressive and arguably feminist school at the time, Beloit College was only 40 miles away from home. She maintained her interest in poetry, joining clubs, writing, and attending lectures. She left college after only two years likely due to financial troubles back home. She was married in 1928, however Lorine did not like being a housewife and the marriage ended in 1929. Lorine started corresponding with the poet Louis Zukofsky and later traveled to New York to stay with him for two years living a bohemian New York lifestyle and meeting many other poets, writers, and editors. Their relationship changed and Lorine moved away in 1934 but they remained friends. <br /> <br /> Lorine returned Wisconsin and worked in various writing positions. In 1938 she moved to Madison to work for the Wisconsin Federal Writers Project. She returned to Blackhawk Island in 1942 when her odd writing jobs in Madison ended. Lorine was isolated and unemployed from 1942 to 1944. Eventually she found work as a stenographer and proofreader in addition to helping to take care of her father. Biographies of her life describe her unhappiness during this time 1945 to 1948. In 1946, Lorine told her father she could not live with him and take care of him anymore. Her father built this small wood frame cottage set back from the river as a precaution against flooding and had a small kitchen and heater, an outhouse, and no telephone. She moved into the cabin after its completion and lived there until the end of 1963.<br /> <br /> Once back in Wisconsin, folk origins became important to her again. The common tales of her mother were updated, objectified, and made subversive in Niedecker’s poetry. In 1946 her work <i>New Goose</i>, was published, to critical, but not commercial, success. <i>New Goose</i> was an updated take on traditional rhymes and folktales made modern and cutting with topics including poverty, threadbare coats, farmers, destitute women, Audubon, and Van Gogh. The short collection was considered good and especially musical by her peers. The collection placed Lorine Niedecker within the contemporary poetry scene. To some extent Niedecker was consciously creating her own style that, while it borrowed from accepted schools such as Objectivist and folk poetry, it was not easily categorized. These post war years included well known poems and collections such as <i>For Paul and Other Poems</i>, <i>The Years Go By, In Exchange for Haiku</i>, and <i>Home/World</i>.<br /> <br /> Traditional lyrical expression emphasized personal imagination, culture, emotions, and memories of the author. For Modernists, it was essential to move away from the personal, and toward an intellectual statement that poetry could make about the world. Questions of impersonality and objectivity were crucial to Modernist poetry. Objectivist poets were a group of second-generation Modernists who emerged in the 1930s. They were mainly American and were influenced by early Modernist poets such as Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. Louis Zukofsky, one of the most prominent Objectivist poets, helped define the movement by stating that the principals of Objective poetry was to treat the poem as an object, emphasize sincerity, intelligence, and the poet’s ability to look clearly at the world. The core group of Objectivist poets were Americans Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, and the British poet Basil Bunting. Lorine Niedecker became another of the group’s most prominent members. These poets generally suffered critical neglect early in their careers, which was the case with Lorine; however, over time they were to become highly influential for later generations of Modernist poets. Almost all of these poets were urban, many from immigrant backgrounds, and all were men, except Niedecker, who was obviously none of these things. It is important to keep in mind that in literary critique of the time, much of the discussion of her work, and the placement of her in the canon of American poetry, unfortunately dealt with whether she was subordinate to some her male contemporaries (or men in general), such as Zukofsky, despite her arguably being the superior poet.<br /> <br /> An Objectivist poet regards the poem as an object apart from its meaning, typically paying more attention to images, structure, and syntax than to a specific theme. It is a radical approach, taking away the traditional ways that language is constructed to convey meaning. Words, phrases, and clauses are intentionally altered; an act of removing words as a direct treatment of the thing (poem), reinforcing the belief that words can lie or only approximate truth. Niedecker, for example, was always condensing her work so that it was simple in appearance and spare in its expression. The linking verbs were often left out to leave more “space” and “quiet” as Niedecker described it, often with the danger of alienating the reader. Niedecker felt her job was to “condense” life into art. Objectivists were interested in the visible world, the object, as a contribution to modern poetry. She often wrote about her family, sometimes taking the voice of one or both of her parents in her poetry, which reflects a respect for her mother and admiration for her father. She also drew on the natural world, specifically around her home on Blackhawk Island.<br /> <br /> During her life Niedecker expressed a preference, like many poets, for smaller presses, but was often let down by their lack of resources and abilities to reproduce her work. The list of poetry published during her lifetime is short and only becomes frequent in the 1960s. Only four books, <i>New Goose, My Friend Tree, North Central</i>, and <i>T&G</i>, were published before her death in 1970. Niedecker’s output of completed and recorded work is not large, including only 378 poems of varying length, five radio plays, five short works of prose, and 3 reviews of other works of poetry.<br /> <br /> Niedecker was full of contradictions, at least in regards to labels. She was both urbane and isolated, a folk poet and intellectual, a surrealist and objectivist, a Marxist landlord; Niedecker was interested in the commonplace and outside of professional networks. Her poetry can be understood in periods as well, each one representing a different favored mode of work, from modernist folk poetry like <i>New Goose</i> in the 1940s, to haiku like forms in the 1950s, to longer complex poetry like <i>North Central</i> by the late 1960s. Because of these changes and because of her lack of full dedication to any one ideological school, her work is often difficult to label, though it can be contextualized within the wider world of contemporary modern poetry.Although often overlooked during her lifetime, three volumes of poetry have been published since her death in 1970: <i>Blue Chicory</i> (1976), <i>From This Condensery: The Complete Writings of Lorine Niedecker</i> (1985), and <i>The Granite Pail: The Selected Poems of Lorine Niedecker</i> (1985). Niedecker has posthumously come to be recognized as one of the best Objectivist modern poets of the mid-twentieth century.",

He asked Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. to supply 6,000 tons of silver for this new top-secret undertaking. Stimson wanted assurances that it would be discreetly supplied and discreetly returned at a later date. The Manhattan Project secured approximately 13,540 short tons (395 million troy ounces) of silver from federal government vaults at West Point, New York. It cost over $300 million in contemporary dollars, but a key component of the calutron magnets was now available.<br /> <br /> Beta 3 (9204-3) continues to house the original calutron arrays, or beta “racetracks” used during the Manhattan Project era, operated in conjunction with the alpha racetracks at the neighboring Y-12 Pilot Plant .

These women helped provide enriched uranium-235 for use in Little Boy, the world’s first atomic bomb. The final product of enriched uranium used in Little Boy came from these beta racetracks.

Where would Burnside cross the Rappahannock: right there at town, further upstream, further downstream? Lee was not prepared to face the larger US Army of 120,000 men because he had divided his forces, sending Stonewall Jackson to the Shenandoah Valley and James Longstreet to Culpeper.<br /> <br /> From this hill, Lee was able to see both ends of his line: the north end above the stone wall and the south end on Prospect Hill.

They imagined how irrigation and hard work could transform the Columbia Plateau’s sandy soil into fertile farmland. Howard S. Amon settled in Richland in 1904 and became a pivotal leader in Richland’s establishment and growth. His vision and legacy live on in this lush park that offers an abundance of outdoor recreation activities for local residents and visitors alike.  <br />  <br /> Howard Amon platted the land that became the city of Richland. He also created an irrigation company to entice farmers to settle on his land and brought telephone service to the Richland area. In 1911, Howard Amon deeded this land to the city of Richland as a public park. It has been a popular destination since that time.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{140}\" paraid=\"7713520\">Generations of Richland residents, including many Manhattan Project workers, have enjoyed spending time in Howard Amon Park. Over the course of the 1920s, numerous improvements were constructed in the park, such as a swimming pool, bathhouse, and bandstand for concerts and celebrations. Richland was a small, tight-knit community remembered by a pre-war resident as “an interesting place to grow up because you were involved in all the activities,” which included boat races and concerts in Howard Amon Park. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{144}\" paraid=\"952343919\">In 1943, as the Manhattan Project transformed the community, the park’s name changed to Riverside Park. By 1968, though, community leaders decided to honor Amon’s contributions to Richland by renaming the park after him. This park was one of the premier centers for community events such as Fourth of July celebrations and outdoor recreation. For Manhattan Project workers who had moved to Richland from towns and cities across the country, this park provided a sense of community.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{144}\" paraid=\"952343919\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{144}\" paraid=\"952343919\"><br /> Several buildings nearby are from the pre-war town of Richland. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/dyer-building-gallery-in-the-park.htm\">Dyer Building</a> (Gallery at the Park), and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gresss-meat-market-frost-me-sweet.htm\">Gress’s Meat Market</a> (Frost Me Sweet) were also part of Richland as it changed from a small farming town to a secret city.</p>",

Although the Manhattan Project officially ended in 1947, the Hanford Site continued producing plutonium throughout the Cold War. The mall exemplifies the type of prosperity that the US Atomic Energy Commission promised to nuclear industry workers during the Cold War. Today, an atomic-age design enlivens the center’s walls.  <br />  <br /> Before the Manhattan Project, Richland was a small settlement consisting mainly of farmers and ranchers, with few choices for shopping and services. Selection of the Hanford Site for plutonium production changed Richland almost overnight from a small village to a secret city of scientists, engineers, and army officials. People did not expect the Hanford Site to operate beyond the end of World War II. Early city planning reflected this short-term vision and emphasized building new homes as quickly as possible.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{183}\" paraid=\"253340764\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{187}\" paraid=\"1727397623\">Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Richland grew from 250 to about 15,000 residents. The government built approximately 2,500 standardized homes to house the thousands of new residents. Richland’s existing downtown was reconfigured into a modest shopping district for this new, walkable village.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{193}\" paraid=\"105068225\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{197}\" paraid=\"1536706714\">Although additional retailers came to Richland during the Manhattan Project, the temporary nature of the project, coupled with limited planning for retail space, led to complaints. Many residents spent their money in Pasco or Walla Walla’s more extensive shopping districts. Then the Cold War changed everything, creating a long-term demand for plutonium to fuel the US nuclear weapons program—and for a wider selection of shopping options for the thousands of new workers who moved here to make this plutonium. Unlike wartime Richland, the Uptown Shopping Center contained a variety of local restaurants, national chain stores, and independent retailers. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{203}\" paraid=\"2082875523\">Continue Your Journey  <br />  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{209}\" paraid=\"1592602972\">To better understand what came before the Uptown Shopping Center, you can visit a few sites remaining from the farming village of Richland and the Manhattan Project years.

Since the beginning of time, the Nez Perce have called this place home. On August 9, 1877 gun shots shattered a chilly dawn on a sleeping camp of Nez Perce. By the time the smoke cleared on August 10, almost 90 Nez Perce were dead along with 31 soldiers and volunteers. Big Hole National Battlefield was created to honor all who were there.</span></p> <p>Big Hole National Battlefield is part of Nez Perce National Historical Park that has thirty-eight sites spread over four states (Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington) that touch on many of the threads that make up the Nez Perce story. Join us in commemorating the history of a culture that has left a distinctive mark on the history of the west and continue to make contributions to the tapestry that is the American experience. A visit to Big Hole should begin at the visitor center. A film, museum, and book store provide an overview of the events that took place on the battlefield in August of 1877. </p>",

In March, most residents received eviction notices giving them just 30 days to leave their land and crops. While the majority moved on, others wanted to return to their orchards and fields by day to harvest their spring crops—generally their only source of income. Focused on building the plutonium production facilities, the US Army saw these requests as both a logistic and a security impossibility and denied the requests.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{9525f346-02ff-423f-bdb0-d4816859df9c}{231}\" paraid=\"1509830267\">Farmers protested. Their concerns reached President Franklin Roosevelt just as his administration became concerned about the nation’s food supply. A bipartisan committee led by Senator Harry S. Truman to investigate waste and fraud in wartime spending sent a letter to the Department of War, questioning the military’s need for “such an extensive tract of farmland.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{9525f346-02ff-423f-bdb0-d4816859df9c}{239}\" paraid=\"1001240640\">Colonel Franklin Matthias, commander of the Hanford Engineer Works, reacted to this political pressure by negotiating a contract with Federal Prison Industries, a US government agency responsible for finding uses for and deploying inmate labor. Under the contract, the army would build and maintain a prison camp on the Hanford Site. Federal Prison Industries agreed to provide inmates and undertake the maintenance of “all good orchards, vineyards, and some of the better farm lands . . . and retain all harvested fruit and produce.” The army would supply “all necessary automotive and fencing equipment and would furnish power and coal for the camp.” Minimum security prisoners from McNeill Island, a federal prison in Puget Sound, transferred to Camp Columbia.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{8}\" paraid=\"712839569\">When it opened on February 1, 1944, the camp consisted of 11 wooden buildings salvaged from a former Civilian Conservation Camp in Montana. They served as offices, a hospital, mess hall, and storage buildings. The inmates lived in Quonset hut barracks identical to those that housed construction workers at Hanford. Later, an additional dozen smaller Quonset huts housed administrators and prison guards, plus their families. There was no security fence because there was no need for one. There was no place to go. Most men served their time without incident. Twelve prisoners escaped from Camp Columbia but were quickly apprehended.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{16}\" paraid=\"1947923370\">The prisoners harvested crops from 550 acres (222.5 hectares) of orchards, 280 acres (130 hectares) of hay and potatoes, 125 acres (50.6 hectares) of vineyards, and 73 acres (29.5 hectares) of asparagus. Altogether, they harvested nearly 5,669 tons (5,142.8 metric tons) of produce.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{22}\" paraid=\"132858765\">Camp Columbia closed October 14, 1947, after America’s nuclear program transitioned from the army to the Atomic Energy Commission. Camp facilities continued in use until 1950, briefly housing men who worked on the Hanford Site railroad, Columbia River levee projects, and McNary Dam. No structures from Camp Columbia remain on the site. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{28}\" paraid=\"1952825262\">Today, Camp Columbia is <a href=\"https://www.co.benton.wa.us/pview.aspx?id=860&catid=45\">Horn Rapids County Park</a> operated by Benton County. Visitors can camp, grill, picnic, hike, mountain bike, or launch a watercraft on the Yakima River from this site.

Miners extracted some of the world’s richest uranium ore from this mine and shipped it to Canada for refining. After refining, the ore arrived at one of several plants in the United States that processed the uranium ore into pure uranium metal and shaped the uranium into billets. Workers loaded the billets onto railcars and shipped the billets to Hanford where they arrived at the fuel fabrication site, also known as the 300 Area. Here, machines milled the uranium billets into cylinders and sealed the uranium cylinders in aluminum jackets creating fuel slugs for the nuclear reactors. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9e8fb5e4-2009-41a9-8688-fcedc05b85c8}{224}\" paraid=\"944978060\">Workers drove the fuel slugs across the Hanford Site to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a> and its two siblings, D and F reactors, for irradiation. After irradiation in a nuclear reactor, workers carefully loaded the highly radioactive fuel slugs into shielded, water-filled casks on train cars for transportation to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/t-plant.htm\">T Plant.</a>  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9e8fb5e4-2009-41a9-8688-fcedc05b85c8}{240}\" paraid=\"518970519\">At T Plant, the fuel went through a series of complex chemical process to separate plutonium from uranium and other radioactive byproducts. Scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico, assembled the core of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/trinity-site.htm\">Trinity Test</a> device and the Fat Man atomic bomb using Hanford’s plutonium. The chemical separation process created millions of gallons of toxic waste that is stored in underground tanks. Safe disposal of this waste is the biggest challenge at Hanford today.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a2d7978b-50c4-4737-b5b3-2b9da5c4f40c}{2}\" paraid=\"1679476392\"> Construction and operation of fuel fabrication facilities began in 1943. The 300 Area also contained experimental and laboratory facilities where scientists tested their theories and conducted experiments that enhanced their understanding of plutonium production. At one time, six small-scale test reactors operated in the 300 Area. Like other Hanford Site Manhattan Project facilities, the 300 Area remained a critical component of the United States defense program during the Cold War and operated into the 1970s. Many of the buildings in the 300 Area have been demolished as part of the US Department of Energy’s cleanup efforts.   </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{68d95b83-737d-43ce-9fce-aaa7da1a162a}{194}\" paraid=\"167794074\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{68d95b83-737d-43ce-9fce-aaa7da1a162a}{194}\" paraid=\"167794074\"> The Department of Energy offers <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">tours of the B Reactor,</a> the world’s first full-scale nuclear reactor.

The rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union led both nations to rapidly increase their stockpile of nuclear weapons. Consequently, the US needed more plutonium for its nuclear weapons. This increased demand for plutonium led to the construction of additional reactors and processing facilities, a constant influx of new workers, and a need for more housing. The Gold Coast Historic District is one of the neighborhoods that sprang up in Richland at the start of the Cold War.  <br />  <br /> Constructed in 1949, these early Cold War era homes retained the standardized design and minimalist architecture familiar from the earlier alphabet homes built during the Manhattan Project. The homes’ easy construction enabled the Atomic Energy Commission, which took control of the Hanford Site after the war, to comfortably house workers moving into this booming community. Like earlier <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/richland-laundry-and-alphabet-homes.htm\">alphabet homes</a>, these houses initially were government property, and residents were renters who were strictly limited in their ability to renovate or alter their residences.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{52dadcff-f39e-400f-899f-7e66dbc44356}{134}\" paraid=\"1441275063\">This area near the Columbia River was known as the “gold coast” because the homes were larger and more expensive than earlier homes and tended to house professionals. It is still a sought-after neighborhood, demonstrating the enduring impact of the Manhattan Project in the Tri-Cities region and how postwar Richland continued to grow in tandem with the United States’ atomic energy program. </p> <h2>Continue Your Journey</h2> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/uptown-shopping-center.htmm\">Uptown Shopping Center</a>, one of the first car-friendly shopping malls constructed in the postwar United States, was also built during the same boom period as the Gold Coast alphabet homes. It was a marked contrast from the Manhattan Project era’s pedestrian-friendly shopping district <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-parkway.htm\">The Greenway</a> (Richland Parkway), which was situated so that workers in the earlier alphabet homes could reach it by foot.

            "bodyText": "<p>With an elevation of 110 feet, Bunker Hill is one of the tallest hills near Boston. Like other hills around Boston, Bunker Hill is a drumlin, or elongated hill, formed by a retreating glacier eons ago. George Bunker, an early resident of colonial Charlestown, once owned the land that included this hill. Provincials used Bunker Hill for agricultural purposes.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/april-19-1775.htm\">Battle of Lexington and Concord</a> in April 1775, the Provincials, or colonial forces, looked at Bunker Hill and other hills as military positions. These hills provided high ground with panoramic views and placements for cannon. Provincials planned a Siege of Boston to drive out the British military that had been in Boston since 1774 as part of the British Coercive Acts.</p> <p>British military leaders in Boston saw the advantage of occupying both Bunker Hill, located north of Boston, and Dorchester Heights, located in the south, to break the Siege of Boston. Before the British could act, the Provincials took Bunker Hill for themselves on the night of June 16, 1775.</p> <p>A Provincial force of about 1,000 militiamen took Bunker Hill and built a redoubt, or earthen fort, on the adjacent smaller hill, sometimes called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/breeds-hill.htm\">Breed’s Hill</a>. People have since debated the decision to build a redoubt on Breed’s Hill rather than the more prominent Bunker Hill but both hills played a role in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>.</p> <p>In the early hours of June 17, 1775, the British Navy tried to dislodge the Provincials from their redoubt on Breed’s Hill with a two-hour barrage of cannon fire from ships in Boston Harbor. This failed and over 2,000 British Regulars tried to remove the Provincials from both hills. The Regulars ferried across the harbor from Boston to Charlestown.</p> <p>The Provincials built an elevated, fortified position that spread across sections of both Bunker and Breed’s Hills. With effective musket fire volleys, the Provincials drove back two assaults by the British Regulars. The Regulars pursued a third assault that dislodged the Provincials from both Breed’s Hill and Bunker Hill. The British victory came at a big cost as they suffered over twice the casualties as the Provincials. Also, the Siege of Boston to drive out the British remained intact.</p> <p>Nearly fifty years after the Battle of Bunker Hill, people from Boston and beyond became inspired to formally commemorate the battle. The Bunker Hill Monument Association (BHMA) formed in 1823 with the goal of preserving the battlefield and building a monument. The BHMA decided to build the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bunker-hill-monument.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument</a> on Breed’s Hill since that is where most of the Provincials died.</p> <p>It took over fifteen years to complete the monument, mainly due to the unexpected cost of the endeavor. In 1840, the BHMA almost resigned itself to a 160-foot monument, until <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sarah-josepha-hale.htm\">Sarah Josepha Hale</a> offered to run a week-long fair in Boston’s Quincy Market. Hale’s “Ladies’ Fair” raised the large sum of $30,000 and with other last-minute contributions, the 221-foot obelisk was completed in 1842.</p> <p>The BHMA owned and managed the Bunker Hill Monument and its surrounding four acres for nearly seventy-five years but passed the complex over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1919. As the mid-1970s approached, BHMA members, local, state, and federal officials decided that the National Park Service take over this significant national site as the nation’s Bicentennial approached in 1976. The Bunker Hill Monument became part of the National Parks of Boston in 1975. It became a stop on the Freedom Trail in 1977.</p> <p>Today, Bunker Hill is a residential area with a church on top of the hill. Bunker Hill still offers a great panoramic view of the surrounding area.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "Turning off of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, one travels along a narrow, 1400-foot-long, asphalt-covered driveway that is lined on both sides by fifty-foot-tall cypress trees, which create a \"tree tunnel.\" The \"tree tunnel\" is surrounded by tree-less pastureland. At the north end of the \"tree tunnel\" are four white structures. The first structure on the right is a one-story garage with four black-painted garage doors. On the left is a small one-story building with three doors on the east side. Behind this building is a larger workshop-style building with large garage doors. The main, two-story radio-receiving building is at the north end of the driveway beyond a roundabout covered with grass. The building, viewed from above, is shaped like a fat letter tee, with the foot of the tee facing the roundabout. Four concrete steps lead up to the main entrance door, located in the center of the first floor on the south side of the building. Two six-foot-tall light posts topped with globe-shaped light shades flank the main entrance. The building has an art deco design. Four vertical column-like structures protrude a couple inches out from the south side of the building, dividing the face of the building into three vertical sections. At the top of each \"column\" is a black-diamond-shaped design. Flanking the entrance door, which is in the center of the middle section on the first floor, are two six-foot-tall, three-foot-wide windows located at the center of the two adjacent sections. Three six-foot-tall, three-foot-wide windows are spaced equidistantly across south side of the second floor. Behind the receiving building, as well as in the pastureland to the west/left, are arrays of large antennae.",

            "audioDescription": "The Point Reyes Lighthouse is a three-story-tall tower. The exterior of the lower two levels of the cast iron tower is painted white with green trim and the walls are angled inward by about 15 degrees. The top level is more cylindrical in shape and is composed of 48 window panes within 16 columns with white-painted metal frames. The lighthouse is capped by a red low-profile conical metal roof. Doors on the northeast side of both of the lower and the middle allow one to enter the tower. Forty feet (12 meters) to the west and about 20 feet (6 feet) below the historic lighthouse is the modern lighthouse. It is roughly square-shaped and is only one story tall, with a red gabled roof. On top of the roof is a small concrete platform on which sit photovoltaic panels. A three-foot-tall post rises from the platforms east end. A small cylindrical light sits atop the post and serves as the current visual aid to navigation. Thirty feet (9 meters) to the northeast of and ten feet (3 meters) above the historic tower is a larger rectangular building with a red gabled roof that houses fog signal equipment and an office. Sixty-five feet (20 meters) to the east of the historic tower is a smaller shed-like structure made out of concrete. Narrow pathways made of concrete connect these structures and lead east to the base of a 3-foot-wide (0.9-meter-wide) concrete stairway that steeply ascends 240 feet (73 meters) in elevation along a narrow rocky ridge. At the top of the stairway is a concrete observation deck. Surrounding the human-made structures is largely windswept, mostly barren rock cliffs and steep slopes. Some areas are covered in sparse vegetation. The Pacific Ocean is 270 feet (82 meters) below the historic lighthouse tower and surrounds the peninsula to the north-northeast, to the north, to the west, and to the south and southeast.",

Henry, a member of a prominent Vassall family who owned plantations in Jamaica, died in 1769, leaving his widow in the house alone. Penelope Vassall fled to her family’s plantation in Antigua after the violence of the Powder Alarm in September 1774. Though her brother Isaac Royall of Medford was explicitly banned from re-entering Massachusetts after the Revolutionary war, Penelope returned and is buried in the Vassall Tomb in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-burying-ground.htm\">Old Burying Ground</a> next to Christ Church. The house was used as a medical facility during the Revolutionary War and it was here that Dr. Benjamin Church was confined under house arrest after he was accused of passing information to British General Gage. Today the house is a private residence.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "This grey colonial home sits on the corner of Brattle and Hawthorne streets, and so its north and west facades are easily visible from the road. It is a symmetrical, two story home, with grey clapboards, large dentil molding, a cupola and three brick chimneys on the roof. The entrance to the home is on the western façade and consists of a red door, white trim, rectangular pediment that extends a few feet off the façade, and is completed by two white columns. This side of the house has eight symmetrical windows with black shutters on each, four on each floor. The grey roof features four dormer windows with white trim. The front path is flanked by large green hedges. A smaller, modern two-story addition extends off the right wall on this façade. The north façade sits on Brattle Street and is separated by a stone fence over five feet tall from the red brick sidewalk. There are ten symmetrical windows with white trim and black shutters on this side, five on each floor. On this side of the house, a large tree shades the sidewalk, a good place to view it from. Often, an early form of the American flag with elements of the Union Jack is flown from this façade.",

Pinyon pines are known for the delicious and nutritious pine nuts nestled in their cones. Pine nuts aren’t just good in pesto; pinyon jays know they’re a treat eaten plain. Pinyon jays form noisy flocks of a few birds to a few hundred birds. They gorge themselves on pine nuts and store some for later in underground caches. An expandable esophagus allows them to carry 40 seeds at once! During a good crop year, a large flock can cache millions of seeds. Of course, not all are recovered, allowing some escapees to grow into new trees. One thousand years ago, the indigenous people known as the Fremont Culture harvested pine nuts as well. For many species, these little packets of fat and protein have been key to survival in this harsh environment.",

The hospital was served by a dedicated assistant surgeon, who was responsible for treating minor maladies, such as broken bones, fevers, and aches. For more major illnesses and injuries, convalescent soldiers were transported to the Royal Naval Hospital at the major naval base in Esquimault on Vancouver Island.<br /> <br /> Treatments available at this hospital reflected the medical knowledge of the time, when doctors had yet to understand the concept of germs and utilized medicines now recognized as toxic. For example, patients were often given such toxic substances as pneumonia and strychnine. The most striking problem in the opinion of the assistant surgeons were \"the extreme variability of climactic conditions\" in the Pacific Northwest which they believed increased \"the prevalence of Rheumatism (sic). In this country, heat, cold dampness, and dryness can always be found not only within days but within yards of each other.<br /> <br /> \"While it is unlikely that the Pacific Northwest’s climate was the direct cause of an epidemic of rheumatism, it was responsible for the majority of deaths at English Camp. Four of the seven men buried at the Royal Marines Cemetery drowned in the Pacific Ocean’s water, a cause of death likely attributable to its extremely cold water, which rapidly causes hypothermia.<br /> <br /> If you want to learn more about the Royal Marines and the history of the Pig War, check out the English Camp visitor center, located inside of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-barracks.htm\">English Camp barracks</a>, where you can talk to a ranger, watch our site film, and purchase books and gifts.

Highlighting such surnames as Domínguez, Armendariz, Apodaca, Peña, López, Nuñez and Holguin, the cemetery documents over a century of life and death in the 17th-century settlement of Socorro del Sur, located on the southern segment of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, locally known as the Mission Trail. The cemetery only tells part of the fascinating survival story of the Socorro Mission of Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception) and the community it has served for more than 300 years.<br /> <br /> St. Michael has since been widely revered as Socorro's protector -- especially after the mission's survival as another flood raged through the area in 1872. However, the end of commercial activity on El Camino Real when the railroad arrived in the 1880s did not spare the community. Nor was it spared the modern development of the 20th century that further fragmented the area. Yet in the 1990s, when years of trapped moisture and deterioration threatened to destroy Socorro Mission, various powers intervened to ensure its protection.<br /> <br /> The community launched a full-scale church restoration that resulted in the making of 22,000 adobes to stabilize walls, repairs to the bell tower, and conservation of cherished interiors. After seven years of work, St. Michael resumed his place beside the altar, and the doors of Socorro Mission opened to new generations. With every new baptism or graveyard burial at Socorro Mission today, the story of Socorro del Sur and the legacy of El Camino Real carry on.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(328 S.

It was originally utilized as a ship's chandlery or a retailer who specializes in providing supplies and equipment for ships. <h2>Origins of the Blue Duck</h2> <br /> The \"Blue Duck\" was also known as 'The Hadlock Store,\" \"the New Store,\" the \"W.E & G.T. Hadlock Store,\" and later as the \"Islesford Market.\" It was also run as a grocery store from a very early date (possibly from the date of its construction) both by Edwin Hadlock and later by his son's William E. and Gilbert T.. Thanks to the Hadlock family's consisten records, we can find detailed ledgers of the comings and goings of Islesfords residents and sailing vessels who purchased essential items from the Blue Duck. <br /> <br /> Edwin's father, Samuel (1770-1854) had moved to Little Cranberry island from Mount Desert Island around 1791, and opened a store in 1808 (This store was later removed in the early 1900s). Edwin was Master of the schooner <em>Samuel Hadlock</em> and as such he traded along the eastern coast between 1848 and 1853. Samuel Hadlock died in 1854. A Hadlock family genology remembers: <br />   <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>In 1854, at the age of 84, Samuel Hadlock died, having outlived all of his sons but Edwin and several of his nephews. He left considerable property which we distributed among his numerous heirs. The business was carried on by Edwin, the only son who did not die at sea or in a some foreign port. Edwin died in the \"sand beach\" house on Little Cranberry Island in 1875... </em><br />  </div> The store remained in the Hadlock family until 1916 when a George Hadlock sold the land on which the building sites to Lewis G. Stanley, who in turn sold the property to Archibald A. Stevenson and Professor William Otis Sawtelle. A Haverford College professor who had taken up summer residence on the island, William Otis Sawtelle (1874-1939), had become deeply immersed in its history and families, and collected a large body of objects and documents related to the island. He was approached by artists Scott White, Charles Kincaid, and Harold Warren (who would later call themselves the \"Three Islesford Painters\" about using the upstairs of the store building as a gallery. The artists suggested to Sawtelle that he set up his collection in the first floor during their gallery showing in 1919 and this seemed to have sparked Sawtelle's interest in establishing a museum. A dated photograph of the building indicates that by 1919 the first story of the building was being used as a museum, and continued to be used as such until the new <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/islesford-historical-museum.htm\">Iselsford Historical Museum</a> was opened in 1928.  <br /> <br /> In 1948 ownership of the structure was transferred to the National Park Service, who by 1951 was utilizing the building as a ranger station and comfort station. The bathrooms installed in the north half of the first story of the building date to 1953 while the rest of the building appears to retain its earlier configuration.   <h2>The Blue Duck Today</h2> Through the National Park Service Historic Leasing program the <a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/ii-solution/islesford-boatworks/\">Islesford Boatworks</a> provides summer shipbuilding classes to youth. Through its work keeping the shipbuilding skills alive in today's youth, Islesford Boatworks engages the entire community of Islesford and celebrates the important history of working waters and waterfronts in Maine island communities.  <h2>Building Architecture</h2> Architecturally, the store building is a simple structure, but changes over the years have made it difficult to determine the interior layout during its period of use as a store. Overall, the building is rectangular with a pitched roof, two chimneys, and doors and windows in all four floors. The exterior is painted clapboard on three sides and the south end and the roof are covered in wooden shingles, but those on the south elevation replaced earlier clapboards. With the exception of an additional chimney and doorway, and changes in the number and placement of the windows, the exterior of the building probably looks much as it it did in the 1850s. The most notable exception is that double doors were added in the north end of the building, which would seem to indicate some change in interior use. This change displaced a pair of windows which, in true New Englander fashion, were reused by placing them together to the west of the doors. The building shows various patches on its exterior due to its long period of consistent use <h2> </h2>",

The battle of Bunker’s Hill and the conflagration of Charlestown were witnessed from its upper windows by the general and his officers.<sup>2</sup></em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General George Washington</a> may have held a meeting with his officers at the house while General Thomas stayed there.<sup>3</sup> Thomas is perhaps best known for his leadership during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/dohe.htm\">fortification of Dorchester Heights</a>. On the evening of March 4, 1776, he led 3,000 men from Roxbury to Dorchester Heights with pre-made fortifications and cannon brought by Colonel Henry Knox form Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York. They successfully fortified the area in a single night, an accomplishment that “compelled the evacuation of Boston by the enemy, terminating the siege” a couple weeks later.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>After the war, the house’s ownership transferred to Charles K. Dillaway, an esteemed educator who later served as the superintendent of Roxbury schools. He and his wife, Martha, used the house as a “women’s day school and home for international students.”<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Almost demolished in 1927, the Roxbury Historical Society and local residents successfully fought to save and preserve the building. It became a museum in the 1930s and has undergone several renovations over the past century. In 1992, it became the headquarters for the Roxbury Heritage State Park.<sup>6</sup> The Dillaway-Thomas House continues to serve as a space for exhibits and community meetings, many of which center on Black history and issues.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Boston Preservation Alliance, “Dillaway-Thomas House,” <a href=\"https://www.bostonpreservation.org/advocacy-project/dillaway-thomas-house\">https://www.bostonpreservation.org/advocacy-project/dillaway-thomas-house</a>.</li> <li>Francis S.

In order to ensure your safety and make the most out of your hike, be sure that you understand the basics of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hiking-basics.htm\">hiking safety</a> before you set out on your adventure. Aside from these basics, there are a few more things that you need to know before hiking Old Rag:</p> <h4>Know Your Limits</h4> <p>Be sure that you are physically able to complete the hikes on Old Rag Mountain. Most hikes in this area are long, and there is significant elevation change with a strenuous rock scramble that requires good upper body strength. Often, children and shorter adults need assistance navigating the rock scramble.</p> <h4>Bring a Map</h4> <p>There are several different <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hikes-oldrag.htm\">ways to hike Old Rag</a>, so make sure that you pick the best route for you. Compare the different options and print or download the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/upload/OldRag_RoadTrail.pdf\">Old Rag trail map</a> so that you have it with you while you're hiking.</p> <h4>Pack Lightly</h4> <p>Although you need to be sure you have plenty of water and food, it is a good idea to pack as lightly as possible. Most hikers prefer fanny packs to backpacks, which can be difficult to maneuver through the rock scramble.</p> <h4>Avoid the Crowds</h4> <p>Planning your hike on a weekday will likely enhance your experience since Old Rag can become very crowded on weekends. At times, the parking lot will be full, and there can be long lines and substantial waits at some of the narrow rock scrambles. During periods of peak visitation (summer and fall), you may want to consider a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hikes-nocrowds.htm\">less-crowded hike</a>.</p> <h4>Leave Your Pets at Home</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Pets</a> are prohibited on the Ridge, Saddle, Ridge Access trails, and from Post Office Junction to Old Rag Shelter. </p> <h4>Know the Camping Regulations</h4> <p>Legal overnight camping sites are very limited in the Old Rag area as camping is prohibited above 2,800', so be sure to properly <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/backcountry-camping.htm\">plan your backcountry trip</a>.</p> <h4>Note the Numbers</h4> <p>You will notice numbers beneath the trail blazes on Old Rag. These are reference numbers for Search and Rescue personnel, so take note of the numbers as you pass them. If you need to report an incident, referring to the number you are closest to will help Park staff respond to you more quickly.</p> <h4>Tread Lightly</h4> <p>Old Rag is host to many rare and endangered plants that live in the rocky environment of the granite boulders. These plants are particularly susceptible to trampling, so please stay on the trail and observe all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/learn/nature/romp.htm#CP_JUMP_5704545\">rock outcrop management closure areas</a>.</p> <h4>Hiking Old Rag in the Winter</h4> <p>Be sure to carry microspikes or traction coil devices for your boots with you when you hike Old Rag. Even when it's perfectly clear in lower elevations, trails can be be icy and snow-covered during colder weather, and these devices can protect you from a nasty fall.</p> <h4>Parking</h4> <p>Although Old Rag Mountain is within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park, most people approach it from the Park's eastern boundary, instead of from Skyline Drive. You are still required to pay an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">entrance fee</a>, but parking at the lots operated by the National Park Service is free. Landowners with property adjacent to the Park are charging a fee for parking on their property, but <strong>paying a private citizen to park does not exempt you from the Park entrance fee. </strong>Parking is prohibited along the road shoulders.</p> <h4>Directions</h4> <p><em>Do not rely exclusively on your mobile GPS, Google Maps, or similar automated navigation systems to get to the Old Rag parking area. Routes can be misleading and incorrect, and cell service is unreliable</em></p> <p><strong>Sperryville to Old Rag Parking:</strong> From Route 211, turn onto Route 522 and follow it south for 0.8 mile.

Oglethorpe led the chase for two miles and then as he raced back to Frederica for reinforcements the armies re-engaged. When Oglethorpe returned down the Military Road: <br /> <br /> OGLETHORPE: <i>“I found the Spaniards entirely routed by one Platoon of the Regiment under the command of Lieut. Sutherland and the Highland Company under the Command of Lieut. Charles Mackay.” </i><br /> <br /> Rain ended the battle. The marsh around the battlefield was stained red with blood. The day’s action would be known as the Battle of Bloody Marsh, July 7, 1742. Manuel de Montiano was now in the position that Oglethorpe had been in at St. Augustine; in hostile country facing unknown odds. Montiano sent ships to scout the river. These were repelled by Frederica’s cannon, which at last fulfilled their destiny. After several days of indecision, Montiano sailed for home. Frederica had prevailed. Oglethorpe declared a day of Thanksgiving, thanking God:<br /> <br /> OGLETHORPE: <i>“For his great deliverance and the end it has put to the Spanish Invasion.”</i><br /> <br /> <i></i>Oglethorpe was vindicated. Frederica had fulfilled its purpose.<br /> <br /> Return now to the Visitor Center where you began the tour.</p>",

To succeed, he had to block Spanish supply lines and bombard the Castillo until Montiano surrendered. For three weeks, he kept up his cannonade. But his troops were scattered, and Montiano showed no sign of weakening. With no end in sight, Oglethorpe gave up. He had squandered men and money and had failed. Disgraced, exhausted and ill, Oglethorpe returned to Frederica to take up a different battle—a verbal skirmish with South Carolina over blame for the disaster.<br /> <br /> The first house after you pass Cross Street belonged to Daniel Cannon, a carpenter who built many of the houses at Frederica. The odd zigzagging shape of these foundations may result from additions to the original structure. Like Samuel Perkins, Cannon left Frederica, seeking wider opportunities in Charleston.<br /> <br /> CANNON: <i>“Look around you in any direction—a dozen houses I built, but why build a town for Florida to burn? In Charleston they say General Oglethorpe is dangerous!</i><br /> <br /> <i></i>Continue along Broad Street. The next house labeled, “A New House,” probably was built later in Frederica’s history, when the war with Spain had faded into memory. Keep walking past it to the next exhibit titled “Tavernkeepers”.<br /> <br /> Oglethorpe’s experiment was on the verge of crumbling. Settlers were leaving for better economic opportunities, Oglethorpe’s military strategy was questioned, the trustees halved his civil authority dividing Georgia into two counties. But Frederica’s greatest challenge was yet to come.<br /> <br /> Georgia’s spies reported that Manuel de Montiano was preparing to invade Georgia. Oglethorpe sent warnings to Savanah, Carolina, and England that unless help came soon, Fort Frederica could not survive. After months of futile petitions for aid, Oglethorpe wrote to the Duke of Newcastle: <br /> <br /> OGLETHORPE: <i>“…it is too late now to ask succors: before they can arrive the matter will be over. I hope I shall behave as well as one with so few men and so little artillery can.”</i></p>",

The museum also maintains a significant collection of fine art and crafts by local artisans from the whaling era. The museum hosts popular educational programs for school children. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{aad91d14-1657-48c2-99ee-536c1fbc1ffa}{27}\" paraid=\"84059238\">The Whaling Museum quickly outgrew its first home in the Masonic Building at Pleasant and Union Streets. In 1907 the museum moved into the Bank of Commerce, the first of what is now a six-building complex, on Water Street. In 1916 Emily Howland Bourne presented the Bourne Building to the Society. Named in honor of her father Jonathan Bourne, one of New Bedford’s most successful whaling merchants, the large, central building was built to house a half-scale model of Bourne’s favorite ship, the Lagoda, and other whaling artifacts. Sited across the street from the Seaman’s Bethel, the museum’s the 1916 building displaced brothels and taprooms on the eastern side of Johnny Cake Hill and overlooked littered streetscapes toward the harbor.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{aad91d14-1657-48c2-99ee-536c1fbc1ffa}{27}\" paraid=\"84059238\">Today the museum sits on a full city block campus of multiple structures. Since the 1916 addition of the Bourne Building, the museum has constructed the Wood Building (1934), the Cook Theater Complex (1973), the Jacob Wattles Education Center (2015). The museum has also incorporated the following existing buildings into its campus – the Sundial Building (1820) and the Eben Hirst Building (c.1820). </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma occupies a very special place along the great arc of the Mother Road. Here the densely populated and nuanced terrain of the Midwest meets the western road’s wide open plains country.<br /> <br /> At the creation of Route 66 in 1926, Oklahoma was not yet 20 years into statehood and was still developing a modern infrastructure, which the condition of its transportation and communication network at the time illustrates. As late as 1926, Oklahoma had more railroad mileage, the transport choice of the 19th century, than road miles. On the eve of the Mother Road, less than 12% of the State’s roads had hard paved surfaces. As a result, the first generation of Route 66 roadbed in Oklahoma was a patchwork of disparate and often primitive roads.<br /> <br /> This situation soon improved as the State, with Federal support, replaced Oklahoma’s various private highway associations as custodians of the roadway. This shift demonstrated a new level of State and Federal partnership in organizing human and material resources. From its very beginning, Route 66 in Oklahoma was a work in progress, constantly undergoing rerouting, widening, straightening, and resurfacing. The straightening and realigning of Oklahoma Route 66 shortened it by 47 miles between 1926 and 1951. <br /> <br /> Route 66 in Oklahoma offers a good example of how a road and its environment can be mutually sustaining. With the improvement of the roadbeds and the increase in local and interstate traffic, new commercial activity sprouted up along the Oklahoma roadside. These interconnected developments exposed many of the State’s isolated rural communities to a broader range of social, cultural, and economic contacts. In a sense, both Oklahoma and Route 66 grew together. The story of U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma is not exclusively a tale of uplift and progress, however. While many roadside communities flourished, others suffered when they lost the highway in one of its periodic realignments. For some, moreover, the coming of an exciting, wider world via Route 66 proved an unwanted experience. In addition, the trek of Dust Bowl migrants along the Mother Road during the 1930s continues to evoke vivid images and memories of human suffering. <br /> <br /> The postwar boom in tourism and transport catapulted Route 66 into its Golden Age but also nudged it closer to extinction, as Oklahoma opted to replace the eventually overburdened highway with a new generation of multi-lane, limited access thoroughfares. By 1957, the Turner Turnpike and Will Rogers Turnpike connected Oklahoma City to Joplin, Missouri, and after 1970, Interstate 40 spanned the entire western half of the State. These super highways relegated Route 66 to servicing local traffic. </p> <h3>The Road Segments</h3> <p>These five road segments total only about 26 miles, but they offer the traveler along historic Oklahoma Route 66 a vivid picture of the highway’s historical development. They are valuable artifacts that tell a story of evolving pavement design, traffic engineering, and changing patterns of social interaction. The Route 66 segments at Miami, West Sapulpa, Stroud (Ozark Trails), and Arcadia represent the earliest roadbeds, those that existed prior to their designation as part of the new national highway in 1926. These sections offer the traveler good examples of the road engineering and construction methods from the early 20th century. The fifth segment, the Bridgeport Hill-Hydro section, including the famous William H. Murray Bridge, is primarily a product of road improvement from the early to mid 1930s and represents conditions that characterized the second generation of Oklahoma Route 66. The road segments are in order geographically east to west.</p> <h4>Miami Nine-Foot Section (1921-1937)</h4> <p>At its inception, U.S. Highway 66 consisted simply of existing State routes across the continent pieced together. The result was a national highway composed of a disparate chain of road segments stretching from Chicago to Los Angeles. Of all these first generation roadbeds, the Miami Nine-Foot Section must rank among the most unique. Constructed between 1919 and 1921, this three-mile segment south of Miami stands out because it is only nine feet wide. The reasons for this odd gauge remain obscure. Legend explains it as a lack of funding; highway engineers had the choice of either paving a short distance with two lanes or a longer distance with one lane, which was what they chose. Despite its peculiar width, the road was of sound construction according to the technology and materials of the time. The original roadbed consists of large stone, Topeka asphalt over a concrete base, flanked with five-foot gravel shoulders. At two sharp curves in this otherwise straight segment, the road widened and banked. Originally part of State Highway 7, this segment became Route 66 between Miami and Afton in 1926. It remained Route 66 until the realignment and widening of the highway in 1937. Today, the original roadbed and curbing are still visible in places, despite the covering of its Topeka asphalt with a more recent layer of asphalt and loose gravel. The road continues to serve local traffic.<br /> <br /> Miami Nine-Foot Section: This three-mile long segment begins at the junction of E. 130th St. and South 550 south of the city of Miami, OK. From this point, it proceeds west for one mile, then curves to the south for one mile, before turning west for another mile. It terminates 50 feet from the present Route 66 Highway. See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86510417\">Miami Nine-Foot Section National Register nomination form.</a></p> <h4>West Sapulpa (1924-1952)</h4> <p>This 3.3-mile section of meandering country road was originally an unpaved part of the Ozark Trails, a private road network that spearheaded Oklahoma’s early road development. Built in 1924-25, the current roadbed was part of a county, State, and Federal partnership to connect the eastern Oklahoma towns of Sapulpa and Bristow with a modern, paved road. The construction materials and road design met the highest State and Federal standards in the 1920s. The two-lane roadbed of Portland Concrete was a standard 18 feet in width with graded three-foot shoulders on each side. After a long legal battle with the Frisco Railroad Company, the installation of a poured concrete railroad trestle allowed for a critical underpass about two miles into the road. This victory reflected the growing dominion of the automobile over the railroad. In addition to this trestle, other original features include Bridge No. 18 at Rock Creek, a 120-foot long steel truss bridge with red brick decking, and the Biven Creek Box Drain. This segment also features a two-mile stretch of original concrete guardrail and retaining wall. Designated as Route 66 in 1926, this heavily traveled road began to flourish commercially, sprouting numerous gas stations, motels and cafes along the route, as well as the now defunct Dixieland Amusement Park. A wider and straighter alignment constructed to the north replaced this road segment’s designation as Route 66 in 1952. Today, the road retains much of its original integrity. Patches of a later asphalt overlay cover the length of the road.<br /> <br /> West Sapulpa: This segment is currently designated Ozark Trail and is located approximately one mile west of Sapulpa, OK beginning at the junction of Ozark Trail and SR 66, one-quarter mile west of Sahoma Lake Rd. Traveling west, Bridge No. 18 at Rock Creek is located about one tenth of a mile from this point. The Biven Creek Box Drain, which appears to be a conventional bridge, is located along the roadside two miles west of the starting point. The guardrail, which is actually the visible portion of a concrete retaining wall, is located slightly over two miles from the segment’s starting point. The railroad trestle is located about one half mile to the west of the guardrail. See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86510017\">West Sapulpa National Register nomination form.</a></p> <h4>Ozark Trails Section (1915-1930)</h4> <p>The 1.3 mile Ozark Trails stretch of dirt roadbed does not automatically conjure up images usually associated with historic Route 66. This section has no asphalt, no neon signage, and no crowded roadside cafes, yet this short stretch of straight dirt road remains an important remnant of the Mother Road’s early history. The U.S. Highway 66 corridor created in November 1926 often took advantage of the pioneering work in road construction carried out in the early 20th century by private and local “good roads” associations from Missouri to Arizona. As part of the organization’s regional effort to modernize Oklahoma’s roads, a local subdivision of the Ozark Trails Association constructed this segment between 1915 and 1917. Today, this section remains in its original condition as a so-called “improved” dirt road--a dirt road that was occasionally graveled and graded. It is approximately 18 feet wide, but with variations, as there is no precise edging to the pavement. An old and rare Ozark Trails Monument--a 21-foot stone obelisk that marked the intersection of Ozark Trails roads--sits at the eastern end of the segment. On the western end was the Dosie Creek Bridge, a steel truss, wood-decked structure constructed in 1917, then demolished and replaced in 2004. In the middle of this segment are two original stone Box Drains probably built in 1917. After the road’s designation as Route 66, traffic increased and roadside businesses took root--a development cut short in 1930 with the construction of an improved alignment of Route 66 further north.<br /> <br /> Ozark Trails Section: This dirt road segment is located west of Stroud, OK. After the junction with State Highway 99, travel one mile and turn left on N3540 Rd. and go almost a mile before turning right at the obelisk and then passing over Dosie Creek with its now replaced bridge. The segment will reconnect with the 1930 alignment of Route 66. See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86510244\">Ozark Trails Section National Register nomination form.</a></p> <h4>Arcadia (1922-1952)</h4> <p>This original Route 66 two-lane roadbed, about nine tenths of a mile in length, follows along a wooded hillside approximately one mile east of Arcadia. Constructed as an unpaved section of State Highway 7 in 1922, it was paved during the years 1928 and 1929, shortly after the newly designated U.S. Highway 66 incorporated Highway 7. The surfacing of this roadbed in the late 1920s-–with the most up to date materials and standards--illustrates the impact of the national highway system as increased traffic volume accelerated modernization. It also underscores the impact of federal funding. This section of roadbed includes the meeting point of two separate Federal aid, paving projects, each applying a different type of surfacing. From the east, the 1928 project used a pure Portland Concrete, Bates Type surface, while the western part--paved in 1929--utilized a Modified Bates Type design, consisting of a two-inch asphalt surface over a five-inch concrete base with nine-inch concrete edgings. The more complex Modified Bates Type surfacing required an on-site chemist. Although the simpler Portland Concrete was cheaper, easier, and effective, the modified version shows the ongoing willingness to experiment as the steadily increasing volume and weight of traffic required better road surfaces. At the point where the two projects met (about midway in the road segment) stands the original three-foot high Federal Aid Project marker with its inlaid brass shields describing both projects. This section served as part of Route 66 until the construction of a multi-lane alignment to the north in 1952.<br /> <br /> Arcadia: This segment is located one mile east of Arcadia, OK at the intersection of Oklahoma State Highway 66 and Hiwassee Rd. From there it travels in a southeasterly direction for approximately one half mile before entering a banking, uphill left hand curve of about one tenth mile in length. It then turns east for about three tenths of a mile, where it reconnects with Oklahoma State Highway 66. See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86510371\">Arcadia Route 66 Roadbed National Register nomination form.</a></p> <h4>Bridgeport Hill to Hydro (1934–1962)</h4> <p>This 18-mile segment is largely a straight road of Portland Concrete that linked the western Oklahoma towns of El Reno and Hydro. Topographically, the road courses through a distinctive area where the open country of the West begins to emerge. A highlight of this segment is the famous El Reno cut off, a straightening, shortening and paving project begun by the State with Federal aid in 1930. When completed in 1934, this project created a more direct alignment of Route 66 between El Reno and  Hydro, eliminating an original dirt route that jogged north through the towns of Calumet, Geary, and Bridgeport. The new alignment in response to the ever-growing traffic along Route 66 hurt these bypassed towns. Bridgeport became a ghost town. The new alignment’s construction standards demonstrate the progressive adjustment of road design to increased traffic volume: the roadbed’s width adhered to the 1930s standard of 20 feet over the previous decade’s 18-foot allowance. The new roadbed also boasted a system to facilitate drainage in rainy weather, which included a parabolic crown, lip curbs, and gutters. This same project also replaced a private toll bridge, the Key Bridge in Bridgeport, with the public William H. Murray Bridge, which spanned the south Canadian River along the new alignment. This nearly 4,000 feet long, 38 span bridge was a 1930s engineering marvel. As was often the result with such modernizing projects, the new road soon was lined with commercial start-ups ranging from service stations and cafés to motor courts. This segment of Route 66 flourished until the construction of a new alignment further north in 1962.<br /> <br /> Bridgeport Hill to Hydro: This segment begins just east of Bridgeport Hill, OK as it intersects Spur Route 281 and ends at the turn north to Hydro on State Highway 58. The William H. Murray Bridge is located east of Bridgeport Hill.

            "bodyText": "<p>Milk Bottle Grocery in Oklahoma City is the type of historic Route 66 establishment that you can miss only if your eyes are closed. Constructed in 1930, the tiny, 350-square foot triangular commercial building of red brick is located on a speck of real estate smack in the right-of-way of a busy urban thoroughfare. It sits at an old streetcar stop along a line that ran diagonally across Classen Boulevard, which served as a segment of Route 66’s original Oklahoma City alignment. Subsequent realignments of the highway, first along Western Avenue and then on 23rd Street, remained only a stone’s throw from the site.<br /> <br /> If conducting business in a tiny brick store in the middle of a city street is not remarkable enough, the towering milk bottle perched on the store’s flat roof confirms that the Milk Bottle Grocery is a Mother Road must see. Built of sheet metal around 1948, the eye catching milk bottle was, and still is, a funky advertising gimmick for the dairy industry. The building’s tight spatial restrictions--hemmed in on all sides by roadway--no doubt determined the milk bottle’s rooftop locale. With only inches to spare beyond its walls, the only place left to go was up. <br /> <br /> The supersized milk bottle is representative of the mimetic tradition in commercial architecture, which seeks to mimic a commonplace object--often to grotesque proportions--to draw attention to a business or product. Yet, the milk bottle never directly connected to the business of its place. It has always been rented separately. Over the years, lettering and logos on this classic icon have been painted and repainted to accommodate a long line of milk related promotions. For those too young to remember what a real milk bottle actually looks like, this rendition is remarkably true to form, from its long, tapered neck up to its rimmed mouth and its clever, metal crenellated version of the traditional, folded paper bottle cap.  <br /> <br /> Aside from the big bottle, what is most memorable about the Milk Bottle Grocery is the primacy of its location for doing business in the automobile age. Over the decades, this modest but well-situated building has continued to draw a wide range of commercial ventures, including a cleaners, a realty office, the Classen Fruit Market, a barbecue “shak,” and the Triangle Grocery, and a Vietnamese sandwich shop. The Milk Bottle Grocery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. <br /> <br /> The Milk Bottle Grocery is located at 2426 North Classen Blvd in northwestern Oklahoma City, OK.<br /> <br /> See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86511608\">Milk Bottle Grocery National Register nomination form.</a></p>",

Fort Reno policed and enforced the government’s aims for the surrounding area. The fort provided support for its transition from Indian Territory to the State of Oklahoma before its location along Route 66 helped make it a military prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. <br /> <br /> Many American Indians, including most of the Cheyenne, fought against the government’s plan to confine them to small reservations. The U.S. Army issued an ultimatum to the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne bands to relocate onto reservations by January 31, 1876 and began attacking those who resisted. As part of that campaign, the army forcibly resettled many Cheyenne people near Fort Reno. Late in 1878, 300 American Indians escaped and fled for home, eventually making it to their ancestral land in southern Montana. Ably lead by Dull Knife and Little Wolf, they managed to evade the army.<br /> <br /> Soldiers at Fort Reno also supervised the conversion of Oklahoma territory to farms and ranches. Eastern opportunists began trying to claim and settle the area surrounding Fort Reno immediately following the 1876 ultimatum, and troops at Fort Reno worked to expel them. Fort Reno troops also supervised the race to stake claims in the 1889, 1892, and 1894 land rushes after the opening of the territory to legal settlement.<br /> <br /> Fort Reno served various purposes during the 20th century. In 1908, the fort shifted from a station for troops to a remount station raising horses and mules for army use, a function it served for nearly four decades. During World War II, Fort Reno continued to foster large-scale movements of people in support of the United States war effort. As defense-related traffic hummed along on adjacent Route 66, stimulating economies adjacent to military bases, nearly 100 acres of Fort Reno’s eastern portion became an internment camp for German prisoners of war. United States forces shipped more than 1,300 German soldiers, mostly captured in North Africa, to Fort Reno, where they became laborers for local farmers and construction crews for the chapel north of the parade ground. The bodies of 70 German and Italian soldiers who died while imprisoned throughout Oklahoma and Texas are interred in plots adjoining the western portion of the cemetery.<br /> <br /> After the station’s closure in 1947, Fort Reno hosted the Department of Agriculture's Grazinglands Research Laboratory. The laboratory continues to operate Fort Reno, which still suggests a frontier fort. Buildings cluster around a parade ground, and a walk around the site reveals mellow brick buildings from the 1880s, old sheds, living quarters, and a rock-walled military cemetery.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service recognized the fort’s historic significance in 1970, by listing it in the National Register of Historic Places. Historic Fort Reno, Inc. eventually formed to promote and care for the site. The Fort Reno Visitor Center opened in the summer of 1997 and has since greeted over 80,000 individuals. The National Park Service awarded the site a $598,000 Save American’s Treasures grant, and the Oklahoma Centennial Commission is another major supporter. Historic Fort Reno, Inc. uses the funding to stabilize and restore the fort’s buildings, which presently support education, special events, and the USDA operations. Future plans call for office space, public space, bed and breakfasts, a restaurant, a USDA information center, and a luncheonette.<br /> <br /> Fort Reno is located on Old Route 66/Business 40 four miles west of downtown El Reno, OK. The fort’s visitor center is located at 7107 West Cheyenne St.<br /> <br /> For more information, call 405-262-3987 or visit the <a href=\"http://www.fortreno.org/\">Historic Fort Reno, Inc. website.</a>  <br /> <br /> See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86510776\">Fort Reno National Register nomination form.</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Called Kewa (Khe-wa) in the native Keresan language of its inhabitants, and previously known as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, this traditional pueblo is located on the Rio Grande between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Despite major outside influences brought to the area by Spanish and US colonization, the railroad in the 19th century, and Route 66 in the 20th century, residents of the pueblo maintain many of their traditional religious practices and social structure. The pueblo has a long history of producing, trading, and selling crafts, especially jewelry and pottery. Visitors to the pueblo can still observe the traditional way of life there and attend ceremonial events, such as the internationally famous corn dance held every year on August 4.<br /> <br /> Upon the arrival of Spanish explorers and colonizers in the summer of 1598, many pueblo people initially aligned themselves with the Spanish as means of combating Apache and Comanche raiders. The Spaniards quickly designated Santo Domingo a provincial capital, and, by 1610, the pueblo was a headquarters in the Spanish colonial mission system. Because the alliance failed to stop the raiding and the Spanish proved oppressive, Santo Domingo became a staging area for Pueblo resistance to Spanish rule late in the 17th century. After the Spanish quelled the uprisings in 1700, violent interaction between the Spanish and Pueblo residents began to cease.<br /> <br /> Major floods from the Rio Grande in the late 1600s and 1886 were so destructive that residents had to rebuild the pueblo. Originally constructed around a central plaza, the pueblo, which residents rebuilt after the flood in 1886, has long blocks of adobe houses along a wide central street. Builders incorporated surviving structures into the new plan and extended the pueblo to the east. Two large kivas (circular rooms used for religious purposes) are within the pueblo, and a mission-style church from 1890 is located on the edge of the pueblo, a legacy of Spanish cultural influence.<br /> <br /> Agriculture has long been a central part of Pueblo life. Farming shaped local culture, and the indigenous religious system of Santo Domingo Pueblo stresses agricultural rhythms and products. The local belief system strives for balance not only between people but also between people and the cosmos. Group ritual knowledge and ceremonies are integral to achieving this balance. Key religious figures are Kachinas, entities who bridge the cosmic and worldly realms and bring rain to help produce crops. A February hunting dance and an August corn dance reflect the poles of the agricultural year. The Corn Dance, a very popular local tradition, is also part of the Pueblo’s railroad and Route 66 history, as the dance is a cornerstone of the Santa Fe Fiesta, an event created and promoted during the time when tourism first became such a force in the Pueblo.<br /> <br /> Once the area became part of the United States, the pueblo and its residents experienced new cultural influences, largely due to the pueblo’s location along the major transportation arteries of the Atcheson, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad in the 1880s and Route 66 in the 20th century. Railroad boosters and entrepreneurs promoted Pueblo people and crafts to 19th-century tourists via a stop at nearby Domingo Station. Many automobile tourists visited Santo Domingo Pueblo in the mid-1920s, after the completion of Route 66. Along the highway, tourists and Pueblo residents bought and sold crafts, particularly pottery and jewelry made for the tourist trade. Befitting the traditional culture of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, the pottery reflects ancient crafting techniques. Roadside stands offer travelers different types of pueblo crafts.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service listed Santo Domingo Pueblo in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In addition to the pueblo itself, a museum and cultural center provide opportunities to learn more about the area and its inhabitants.<br /> <br /> The Santo Domingo Pueblo (now Kewa Pueblo) is located approximately 35 miles north of Albuquerque and 25 miles south of Santa Fe, NM, via the Santo Domingo exit on Interstate 25.<br /> <br /> For more information, call 505-465-2214 or visit the <a href=\"https://www.newmexico.org/places-to-visit/native-culture/santo-domingo-pueblo/\">New Mexico Tourism Department's website.</a><br /> <br /> See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/77847486\">Pueblo of Santo Domingo (Kiua) National Register nomination form. </a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The historic roadbed of Route 66 runs through downtown Waynesville where the most prominent building in town is the Pulaski County Courthouse. The building has a museum inside where visitors can see exhibits about the Civil War, both World War I and II, and Desert Storm. Even better, the original courtroom complete with wooden jury box remains. Before going inside, visitors can take a look at the courthouse exterior. For heartland Missouri, the detailing is more than a little unusual. Built in 1903 in the Romanesque Revival style with Italianate features, the two story red brick courthouse is an illustration of undeniable civic pride and optimism on the part of the citizens of none-too-large, turn-of-the-century Waynesville.<br /> <br /> Henry H. Hohenschild, State architect at the time, designed the courthouse, one of many public buildings he designed in Missouri. The irregular shape of the courthouse is interesting, especially the distinctive, square Italianate tower, or campanile, with arched windows on each side. The east facade is dominated by the main entrance where a double door is topped by a molded and paneled hood decorated with wooden medallions and supported on giant wooden brackets. Six windows with rounded arches flank the door. These same arched windows are repeated on all sides of the courthouse. If you look up, you’ll notice that exposed rafters edge the bell tower’s roof. They are supported by a decorative corbel table - pieces of protruding, decorated stone provided to carry the weight of the roof above. This is worth noting for its lovely Italianate aspect right there in the middle of Missouri, the Show Me State.<br /> <br /> The south entry to the courthouse is the one most commonly used and the most elaborate. An open portico porch supported by brick piers is topped with a Queen Anne-style arch and a hard-to-miss decorative grill of wrought iron. Two stories up, the brick date stone is projected at the center of the attic level. Designed like a shield and showing the building’s construction date, 1903, the date stone is decidedly diagonal, as if standing against a stiff breeze.<br /> <br /> Inside, look for the original wooden frames around the windows and doors and the original Stromboli fan with wooden blades hanging in the old county clerk’s office. On the wooden stairway leading to the second floor, the original decorative spindle balustrade is just like it was in 1903. Once upstairs, visitors can see the original oak ceiling with exposed rafters and joints in the courtroom--an example of superb craftsmanship.<br /> <br /> The courthouse is the fourth in Waynesville’s less than two-century history. Built in two weeks in 1839, the first courthouse was a log structure with only one window. Only four years later, Waynesville became the county seat, necessitating a larger courthouse, one with more logs and bigger windows. That courthouse served the country through the Civil War when it became a hospital for Union troops. Soon after, the county condemned courthouse number two, because it was “unfit for the county and no longer safe due to damages during the war.” Built in 1872, the third Pulaski County Courthouse was two stories, brick, built at a cost of about $8,000, and barely used before being struck by lightning and burning to the ground in 1903. The current substantial Romanesque courthouse is the centerpiece of the square today. In January of 1990, Pulaski County moved government operations into a new building alongside the historic courthouse. The historic Pulaski County Courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 now houses the Pulaski County Courthouse Museum.<br /> <br /> The Pulaski County Courthouse is located on Old Route 66 on the Courthouse Square, between Benton and North Lynn Sts. in Waynesville, MO. <br /> <br /> For more information, call 573-855-3644 or visit the <a href=\"http://www.route66courthouse.com/home.html\">Pulaski County Museum and Historical Society website.</a>  <br /> <br /> See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/63820029\">Pulaski County Courthouse National Register nomination form. </a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Carl Ditmore built this two-story gas station in 1929 in a rural area approximately one-half mile south of Hydro along U.S. Route 66. Rural service stations, similar to the Provine Service Station, began springing up across the countryside in the late 1920s in response to increasing transcontinental automobile travel. This style of rural station was convenient for the traveler to get gasoline, pay the attendant, and be on his way. Like other rural, mom and pop-built stations of the time, this one was built with the owner’s living quarters located on the second story. Mr. Ditmore and his family used the upstairs as private living quarters while operating the station downstairs.<br /> <br /> The small station is a vernacular interpretation of the Bungalow Craftsman style. Its hipped roof has wide, overhanging eaves with exposed rafter tails. The projecting second-story covers the open service bay, supported by massive, tapered piers. <br /> <br /> The station changed ownership several times but continued to pump gasoline for Route 66 motorists. In 1934, W.O. and Ida Waldroup purchased the station and renamed it the Provine Service Station, the name it still goes by today. In 1941, the Hamons family took over its operation. Lucille Hamons ran the business and lived there for nearly 60 years. She quickly became one of the highway’s legendary characters. Her self-reliance and generous assistance to motorists earned her the nickname “Mother of the Mother Road.” The Provine Service Station is commonly known as Lucille’s Place.<br /> <br /> In 1971, the completed section of Interstate 40 a few miles to the south cut the station off from direct access to the new highway, but Lucille found a way to survive. She installed a beer cooler, and her best regulars were the boys at Southwest Oklahoma State University in nearby Weatherford (a dry town). She kept the station open until the day she died, August 18, 2000. Today, crosses commemorating Lucille’s life sit along the Mother Road across from the station.<br /> <br /> The Provine Service Station was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.<br /> <br /> The Provine Service Station is located a half mile west of the intersection of Highway 58 and Interstate 40 south of Hydro, OK on historic Route 66. The station is no longer operating, but visitors are welcome to stop and take photographs.<br /> <br /> See the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/86509951\">Provine Service Station National Register nomination form.</a></p>",
