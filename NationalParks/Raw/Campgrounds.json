The dry camping area consists of 3 separate loops (A-C) that have 80 concrete padded sites that can accommodate tent, trailers and RV’s. Each loop road is asphalt so 4-wheel drive or high clearance vehicle are not required. There are slight inclines in the road, but the Individual sites are mostly level with a paved driveway and gravel tent pad (may be challenging for wheelchairs). Each site has a charcoal grill and picnic table but because the sites are gravel and, possibly on an incline, maneuvering a wheelchair may be difficult. In the center of the campground (approximate 5 minute walk from furthest site) are accessible restrooms with flush toilets, sinks and showers. Pets are allowed as long as they are on a leash and under control at all times. Please call the Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas at 435-684-3032 for more information.",

      "audioDescription": "Over 2 million visitors annually come to enjoy the scenic beauty of Cades Cove and its many historic structures. Popular activities here include hiking, biking, touring the 11-mile Cades Cove Loop Road and observing wildlife. Whether blanketed in bright wildflowers in the spring or vivid colors in the fall, the scenery at Cades Cove never disappoints. Cades Cove is a broad, verdant valley surrounded by mountains and is one of the most popular destinations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It offers some of the best opportunities for wildlife viewing in the park. Large numbers of white-tailed deer are frequently seen, and sightings of black bear, coyote, groundhog, turkey, raccoon, skunk, and other animals are also possible. For hundreds of years Cherokee Indians hunted in Cades Cove, but archeologists have found no evidence of major settlements. The first Europeans settled in the cove sometime between 1818 and 1821. By 1830 the population of the area had already swelled to 271. Cades Cove Campground is open-year round and combines the feel of primitive camping with the modern convenience of flush toilets and drinking water. During peak season (May - October) a camp store provides visitors with basic necessities as well as bike rentals. Events like Interpretive Programs in the nearby amphitheater and Bicycle Only Days on the loop road provide visitors with a fun and unique experience. Reservations are now required year-round to camp in Cades Cove Campground. All campsites are drive-up. No more than two motor vehicles or one vehicle with trailer are allowed per campsite. Please keep wheels, including trailer wheels and guest cars, on the pavement. Park only in designated spaces. Overflow parking is available for excess vehicles. The maximum number of occupants, per campsite, is six. All tents must be pitched on the tent pad, where provided. Hammocks are allowed with the following guidelines: Hammocks must be within the footprint of the campsite and limited to trees 10 inches in diameter, adequate padding around the tree with only 2 hammocks suspended from the same tree. Check out time is 1:00 p.m. Check in time is 1:00 p.m. Your stay is limited to 14 consecutive days at a time. Longer stays require that you move to a different campground.

Reservations for campsites at Cades Cove Campground can be made 6 months prior to your arrival date online at www.recreation.gov or by calling 877-444-6777. Owners of an Interagency Senior/Golden Age or Interagency Access/Access Pass receive a 50% discount on individual campsites. The owner of the pass must occupy the site for which the discount is given. You must present your Pass and ID upon check-in. Photocopies or picture of the pass are not accepted. If you cannot present the pass you will be required to pay the full camping fee. There is no discount on group sites. There is no discount on camping fees for an Interagency Annual Pass ($80 pass). Pets are allowed in the campground but must be confined or on a 6’ leash. Pets should not be left unattended.
