            "bodyText": "George Crockett Strong was born in Stockbridge, Vermont on October 16, 1832.  He was raised by an uncle in Easthampton, Masschusetts, attended Williston Seminary and Union College, then entered the US Military Academy and graduated fifth in his class in 1857. He served as a lieutenant of ordnance on General Irvin McDowell’s staff at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861. Rising rapidly through the ranks, he served on the staffs of Generals George B. McClellan and Benjamin Butler. In 1862, he commanded two expeditions along the coast of Mississippi and was commissioned brigadier general of volunteers in November 1862.<br />  <br /> On June 17, 1863, Strong reported to Saint Helena Island to join the Department of the South commanded by Major General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/quincy-a-gillmore.htm\">Quincy A. Gillmore</a>. He was placed in command of one of the brigades designated to spearhead the upcoming assault on Confederate positions defending Charleston located on Morris Island at the mouth of the harbor. Strong met Colonel Robert G. Shaw, the white commander of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54th Massachusetts Regiment</a>, composed of African Americans and black Canadian volunteers. By July 8th, Strong’s brigade had moved from Saint Helena and was in position on Folly Island to launch the attack on the southern end of Morris Island. Under supporting fire from Union artillery on Folly Island and Navy monitors and gunboats offshore, the amphibious assault began the morning of the 10th. By the end of the day, Confederate forces had been pushed back to Battery Wagner near the northern end of the island. Two-thirds of Morris Island was now in Union hands.<br /> <br /> Despite the success of the attack, Strong did not order an attack on Battery Wagner until the next morning, July 11. Given time for the Confederates to receive reinforcements, who fought from a strong defensive work on a narrow front, the Union attack failed with considerable losses. On July 18, Strong ordered another assault on Wagner. This time he selected the 54th Massachusetts to lead the assault. It was dusk when the attack began. As the 54th advanced, it was met by murderous fire from Wagner. As those not cut down in the initial burst of fire reached the top of Wagner’s parapet, fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued. As Colonel Shaw stood on the top of the parapet, he was hit by several bullets and killed. As the 54th was beaten back, the two supporting regiments surged forward but were also repelled. Strong personally led the final attempt but was seriously wounded by grape shot in the thigh and was forced to pull the remnants of his brigade back. By 1:00 am on July 19, the battle was over. The second assault on Battery Wagner had failed with heavy Union losses. What followed was a siege that ended when Confederates abandoned Battery Wagner on the night of September 6, 1863.<br /> <br /> Brigadier General Strong was evacuated to New York City for treatment of his wound. During his trip, he contracted tetanus and died in New York on July 20, 1863. He was promoted to major general the day after he died. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. A monument dedicated to his memory stands there. <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Following in the footsteps of his father, Robert Dinwiddie began his adult life as a merchant. Through this profession, he accumulated comfortable wealth, which smoothed his transition into politics.</p> <p>Dinwiddie rose to the position of Lieutenant Governor of the colony of Virginia in July of 1751, serving in that capacity until January of 1758. Because of the absentee status of the governor, Dinwiddie was the de facto governor in his stead. </p> <p>Dinwiddie was firm in his resolution to protect and expand the British presence in the Ohio River Valley. Part of this resolve came from the fact that he was a partner in the Ohio Company, a private company with vested interest in acquiring land in the west. </p> <p>It was the Ohio Company that served to connect Dinwiddie with George Washington, as Washington had two brothers who were also members of the company. Dinwiddie recognized Washington's potential and would become his first mentor. In 1753 Dinwiddie sent Washington on a mission to deliver a letter to the French, in which he demanded the French leave the Ohio River Valley. Washington met with the French at Fort LeBoeuf, where the commander, not surprisingly, politely but firmly refused to leave.  He wrote a response to Dinwiddie saying, “As to the summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.” Washington hurried to deliver the French response to Dinwiddie. </p> <p>Dinwiddie placed Washington in a position of leadership again in 1754, sending him west as lieutenant colonel of the Virginia Regiment, leading over 160 Virginia soldiers. Dinwiddie instructed Washington, “You are to use all Expedition in proceeding to the Fork of Ohio, with the Men under Yr Comd & there You are to finish & compleat in the best Manner, & as soon as You possibly can the Fort which I expect is there already begun by the Ohio Compa.”  The fort that Dinwiddie was referencing was Fort Trent, at the Forks of the Ohio (Pittsburgh, PA). Washington and his men departed. Washington soon learned that the French had expelled the British from Fort Trent and established their own fort, Fort Duquesne.</p> <p>In these altered circumstances, Washington’s confrontation with the French arrived soon enough. He engaged with the French in a bloody skirmish at Jumonville Glen in May of 1754, and at the Battle of Fort Necessity in July of 1754. Washington’s mistakes and failures on this campaign would require further action on behalf of the British administration to secure land in the west. </p> <p>Dinwiddie left Virginia in 1758 and returned to England, where he died in 1770. However, it was his actions in colonial Virginia that were influential in the start of the French and Indian War. His strident defense of the colony helped increase the tensions between the French and British in North America. He was not opposed to using force to protect Virginia's territorial claims. It was while he was governor of the colony that the first shots were fired, in a skirmish involving his protégé George Washington.     <br /> <br /> Author: Catarina Hurtado<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Sources:</em></strong><br />  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dinwiddie<br />  Zimmerman, John H. “Robert Dinwiddie.” George Washington’s Mount Vernon.

Drawing from his extensive service, he wrote a two-volume history on the conflict. After serving in the Second Seminole War in Florida in 1849, he spent time with the Army on garrison duty. While stationed at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan’s Island, he met his future wife, Alicia Sparks. Having married a wealthy widow, Ripley resigned from the Army in 1853 and concentrated on managing his wife’s estates.<br /> <br /> Ripley returned to Fort Moultrie under a new flag when he took command of the South Carolinians and later Confederates who occupied it, leading up to the Civil War. After taking part in the bombardment of Fort Sumter and overseeing South Carolina’s coastal defenses, Ripley transferred to a field command in Virginia in 1862. He commanded men during the Peninsula Campaign at the battles of Mechanicsville, Gaines Mill, and Malvern Hill. This campaign successfully defended the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia from Union General George McClellan’s army.<br /> <br /> Ripley and his men followed that campaign with the invasion of Maryland under General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in the fall of 1862 at the battles of South Mountain and Antietam (or Sharpsburg) where he suffered a severe neck wound. Criticized for his performance at the Battle of Antietam, Ripley returned to Charleston where his artillery expertise could be put to effective use. Together again with his former commander at the outset of the war, General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/pgt-beauregard.htm\">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, Ripley directed the successful defense of Charleston from an April 1863 Federal ironclad attack. Ripley stayed in Charleston, despite attempts to remove him from command because of interpersonal difficulties with his superiors, until the Confederacy evacuated in February 1865. He later fought under General Joseph E. Johnston at the Battle of Bentonville in March.<br /> <br /> After the war, Ripley moved to England, residing there for twenty years. He returned to the United States in 1885, living in New York until his death in 1887. In accordance with his wishes, Ripley was buried in Magnolia Cemetery, in Charleston, South Carolina.",

            "bodyText": "Major Robert Anderson, a Kentuckian, famously commanded the US Army garrison of Fort Sumter at the outbreak of the American Civil War. A graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point, Anderson served as a colonel of Illinois volunteers in the 1832 Black Hawk War and as an assistant adjutant general on the staff of General Winfield Scott during the Second Seminole War. Anderson, like many experienced officers of the Civil War, fought in the Mexican-American War. He suffered a wound at the Battle of Molino del Rey in September 1847.<br /> <br /> In November 1860, Major Anderson took command of the Federal forces in Charleston Harbor, which totaled about eighty men. They were primarily garrisoned in Fort Moultrie as Fort Sumter was still under construction. Fort Moultrie, an 1809 brick fort on Sullivan’s Island, housed the First US Artillery. Fort Sumter, begun in 1829, still stood unfinished but commanded the center of Charleston Harbor. Castle Pinckney was manned by a lieutenant and a single ordnance sergeant with his family. Anderson had been selected for this difficult command, given the growing tensions since Abraham Lincoln’s victory in the 1860 presidential election, for his competence, southern roots, sympathy for slavery, and his loyalty to the Union.<br /> <br /> South Carolina’s secession from the Union on December 20, 1860 and resulting security risks at Fort Moultrie prompted Major Anderson to make the difficult decision to relocate his command to Fort Sumter. He successfully transferred his men to Fort Sumter under cover of darkness on December 26, 1860 and raised the Stars and Stripes over the fort the following day, a 20 x 36 foot garrison flag.<br /> <br /> Major Anderson led his men admirably during months of uncertainty until the Civil War erupted on April 12, 1861. After a thirty-four hour bombardment, which had set the fort aflame, Major Anderson agreed to evacuation terms and lowered the Stars and Stripes on April 14, 1861. Greeted a hero upon his arrival in New York City on April 19, Anderson was later assigned to command the Department of Kentucky, but his failing health compelled him to retire from active service in 1863.<br /> <br /> Brevet Major General Anderson returned to Fort Sumter on April 14, 1865 to participate in a victory ceremony. Before he raised the 33-star American flag that flew over the fort in 1861, he addressed the crowd: <blockquote>\"I am here, my friends and fellow-citizens, and brother soldiers, to perform an act of duty which is dear to my heart, and which all of you present appreciate and feel. Did I listen to the promptings of my own heart, I would not attempt to speak; but I have been desired by the Secretary of War to make a few remarks. By the considerate appointment of the honored Secretary of War to fulfill the cherished wish of my heart through four long years of bloody war -- to restore to its proper place this very flag which floated here during peace before the first act of this cruel rebellion -- I thank God I have lived to see this day, to be here to perform this perhaps the last act of duty to my country in this life.\"</blockquote> Hoping to restore his deteriorating health, Anderson sailed for France in 1869. He died in Nice on October 26, 1871; France honored Anderson with a military funeral, after which his body was sent to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York for interment. Despite his southern sympathies, Robert Anderson faithfully discharged his duty to the United States during a time of great turmoil. He was mourned as the first hero of the Civil War.",

            "bodyText": "Samuel Francis Du Pont, a Union admiral of the Civil War, commanded the Port Royal expedition in 1862, the Union navy’s first major victory over the Confederacy. The following year, his long and distinguished naval career ended with his defeat in Charleston Harbor.<br /> <br /> Du Pont was born in New Jersey in 1803 but grew up on the banks of Brandywine Creek in Pennsylvania. His uncle founded DuPont, which began as a gunpowder factory, and today is the famous multinational chemical corporation. His family’s political connections helped him receive an appointment as a midshipman in 1815, beginning a long naval career which included honorable service in the Mexican-American War.<br /> <br /> After his Mexican-American War service, Du Pont spent time ashore, modernizing the U.S. Navy and studying the possibilities of steam power. Du Pont was made commandant of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in 1860, expecting to retire in the post. However, the outbreak of the Civil War called him again to active duty.<br /> <br /> Du Pont helped plan naval operations for the Union at the start of the Civil War. He was then given command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the largest fleet ever commanded by a naval officer up to that time. On November 7, 1861 his fleet captured Port Royal, South Carolina, providing the Navy with a large natural harbor and perfect staging area for future operations in the area. This success was later overshadowed by his command of an unsuccessful ironclad attack on Fort Sumter on April 7, 1863.<br /> <br /> Nine Federal ironclads under the command of Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont faced an intense crossfire from Confederate-held Forts Sumter and Moultrie. Confederate guns hit the USS<i> Keokuk</i>, piloted by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-smalls.htm\">Robert Smalls</a>, ninety times. The vessel sunk off Morris Island the day after the battle. Predicting defeat before the battle even started, Du Pont lacked the will to aggressively lead the campaign, correctly predicting the strength of the forts against his ironclads.<br /> <br /> Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles later relieved Du Pont of his command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, writing “I do not find in this nor in any communication received from you since the 7th of April any proposition for a renewed attack upon Charleston, or suggestions even for active operations against that place...The government is unwilling to relinquish all further efforts upon a place that has been so conspicuous in this rebellion, and which continues to stimulate treason and resistance to the Union and the government, and whose reduction is so essential.”<br /> <br /> Du Pont returned home to Delaware and had no further significant role in the war. He died on June 23, 1865 during a trip to Philadelphia.",

            "bodyText": "Samuel Wylie Crawford, a US Army surgeon and a Union general during the Civil War, was one of the few individuals present at both the opening of the American Civil War at Fort Sumter and also at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865 when Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Potomac, effectively ending the war. Despite his medical background, Crawford commanded a battery in the defense of Fort Sumter on April 12-13, 1861, providing his first taste of commanding men in battle. Later, as a commissioned Army officer, he fought in some of the most significant battles of the Eastern Theater, including the Battles of Antietam and Gettysburg. In 1887, he published his work on the start of the Civil War, <em>The Genesis of the Civil War: The Story of Sumter, 1860-61</em>, featuring the political events which led to the opening shots in Charleston Harbor. <br /> <br /> Born in Pennsylvania, he studied at the University of Pennsylvania and later the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, graduating in 1850. In 1851, he joined the US Army as an assistant surgeon. Almost a decade later, on September 7, 1860 he received a telegram from the Adjutant General's Office of the War Department, directing that he \"proceed forthwith to Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, and report for duty to the commanding officer of that station.\" He left an assignment in Newport, Rhode Island for the hotbed of Charleston, South Carolina, the city that soon became the cradle of secession. His arrival also coincided with the threat of a yellow fever outbreak; his predecessor at Fort Moultrie perished of the disease. <br /> <br /> Of more concern than the danger of yellow fever for the US Army garrison at Fort Moultrie was the politics of South Carolina. After the election of President Abraham Lincoln, the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-anderson.htm\">Major Robert Anderson</a> to take command of Fort Moultrie, and finally the secession of South Carolina, Anderson recognized the indefensible state of Fort Moultrie, ordering his men to evacuate and transfer to Fort Sumter the evening of December 26, 1860. Crawford, along with the other members of the US Army garrison at Fort Sumter, anxiously watched the South Carolinians and later Confederates surround their position with batteries on Sullivan's Island, Morris Island, and James Island.<br /> <br /> When the Civil War erupted with Confederate fire on Fort Sumter in the early morning of April 12, 1861, Crawford commanded gun crews as they returned fire. A month after the fall of Fort Sumter, Crawford accepted a commision as a major in the 13th US Infantry. Later, as a brigadier general of volunteers in 1862, he led his men in the Department of the Shenandoah during Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. His men did not see action until they were transferred to the Army of Virginia under Maj. Gen. John Pope. At the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Crawford's men suffered heavy casualties after initially driving back the Confederate left, including the Stonewall Brigade. About one month later, during the Maryland Campaign, Crawford suffered a wound in the right thigh while taking temporary command of his division at the Battle of Antietam. He stayed on the field until his worsening condition demanded he be removed. Eight months of recuperation followed. He returned to the field in May 1863, commanding the Pennsylvania Reserves division in the defenses of Washington DC. <br /> <br /> In June 1863, his division would be transferred to the Army of the Potomac to help defend against another Confederate incursion into US held territory. The Gettysburg Campaign was at hand with Crawford, who had only commanded at the brigade level previously, commanding a division of men who had not seen combat for months. Fortunately for Crawford and his men, their role in the Battle of Gettysburg came at an opportune time and place. On July 2, he and his men arrived at Little Round Top to assist Col. Strong Vincent's brigade. Meanwhile Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's Corps had swept through Devil's Den, driving Union defenders back to a stream just west of Little Round Top. Crawford's division, along with the brigades of Colonels William McCandless and David J. Nevin, charged down the slopes of Little Round Top, driving the Confederates from the area. The successful charge met little Confederate resistance and led Crawford to believe he was the savior of the Battle of Gettysburg. During the charge, he personally took the division's colors from a sergeant to lead the division. Crawford's experience on July 2, 1863 stayed with him, contributing to his ego and spurring his leadership to preserve the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Crawford remained in command of the Pennsylania Reserves Division for the remainder of the war, commanding them during the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign. At the end of the Siege of Petersburg, Crawford's division got disoriented in the woods at the Battle of Five Forks, wandering away from the Confederate left which they were meant to attack. Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, commander of the V Corps, personally rode out to retrieve Crawford's division. Warren's absence during the attack and failure to control Crawford's movements led Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan to relieve Warren, ultimately resulting in a post-war inquiry into Warren's conduct. The inquiry took place in 1879 and found Warren's dismissal unjustified. <br /> <br /> Crawford retired from the Army in 1873 and spent his final years on his book, dying in 1892. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Truman Seymour’s early life mirrors that of many US Army officers before the Civil War: attendance at the US Military Academy at West Point, service in the Mexican-American War, service in the Seminole Wars, and coastal garrison duty. His last duty station before the crisis of secession was Fort Moultrie on Sullivan’s Island.<br /> <br /> At the outbreak of the Civil War at Fort Sumter, Seymour served under Major Robert Anderson in the First US Artillery Regiment as captain of company H. Seymour relieved Captain Abner Doubleday after four hours of commanding the guns firing at the Confederates. Brevetted a major for his service at Fort Sumter, Seymour then commanded the 5th Artillery Regiment at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> Seymour, promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in April 1862, was assigned to a brigade within the Army of the Potomac’s V Corps and commanded men during the Peninsula Campaign at the Battles of Mechanicsville and Malvern Hill. After the failed Union campaign on Richmond, Seymour commanded men at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), the Battle of South Mountain, and the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg).<br /> <br /> In November 1862, Seymour was reassigned and returned to Charleston Harbor. He landed the first Union forces on Folly Island and reconnoitred the Confederate defenses on Morris Island but was unable to advance further given lack of support from General David Hunter. Once General Quincy A. Gillmore took command of US Army operations in Charleston Harbor, Seymour found a commander willing to move forward and attack the Confederates.<br /> <br /> Gillmore’s plan of attack called for Seymour to lead his division across Lighthouse Inlet and land on Morris Island on July 10, 1863, which they executed after a fierce artillery bombardment. A strong Confederate battery, Battery Wagner, however still commanded the northern approach to Morris Island.<br /> <br /> Seymour wrote of his decision to use the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, an African-American regiment, in the July 18 assault: “It was believed that the Fifty-Fourth was in every respect as efficient as any body of men; it was one of the strongest and best officered, there seemed to be no good reason why it should not be selected for this advance.” None of the commanding Union generals expected the fierce resistance the Union soldiers faced and the resulting heavy casualties.<br /> <br /> The assault failed in part because additional support and manpower did not quickly follow once the 54th Massachusetts reached Battery Wagner. Seymour ordered and personally led a second advance on Battery Wagner, suffering a severe wound from a shell fragment. This assault also failed. Seymour recovered from his wound and later commanded the District of Florida where he was defeated in February 1864 at the Battle of Olustee, the largest battle in Florida of the Civil War. He was forced to retreat to Jacksonville. Following the battle, he was relieved of his command and sent back to the Army of the Potomac.<br /> <br /> He served during the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, part of the Overland Campaign in Virginia, and was captured. After being exchanged, Seymour commanded Union campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, during the siege of Petersburg, and finally during the Appomattox campaign. A captain at the start of the war at Fort Sumter, Seymour had risen to major general of volunteers and was present when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse.<br /> <br /> Seymour remained in the Army until 1876 and then retired to Europe, becoming an accomplished watercolor painter. He died in Florence, Italy in 1891 and is buried there.",

Various stories differ on exactly how a young Ann Pamela Cunningham learned about Mount Vernon. One historical account describes how Ann’s mother saw Mount Vernon when she rode a boat down the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pohe/index.htm\">Potomac River</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">. When she returned home to South Carolina, Mrs. Cunningham told Ann about how George Washington’s estate had fallen into disrepair. [2] A young Cunningham became passionate about restoring the property although she lived at Rosemont, her family’s South Carolina plantation, for the rest of her life. [3] While we can’t be sure who exactly cared for Ann at Rosemont, her family had a history of enslaving African people. In 1850, the Cunningham’s Rosemont property housed over ninety enslaved people. [4] Despite her physical pain and her difficulty traveling, Ann Pamela Cunningham dedicated herself to saving George Washington’s estate. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">She began her campaign by creating the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association in 1853, a group that lobbied Congress to acquire Mount Vernon as a historical site. When government representatives refused to support the preservation project, the Association appointed women in thirty states to raise money to buy Mount Vernon from George Washington’s great-grandnephew, John Augustine Washington III. After convincing the President’s descendent that the property warranted historical attention, the Association made a downpayment on the now-iconic home. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">As Cunningham and her colleagues continued raising money to restore Mount Vernon, she created a newsletter to inform contributors about their progress. This newsletter helped set the tone for historic preservation in the United States, establishing the field as a public engagement effort. When the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/index.htm\">Civil War</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> forced Cunningham to return to South Carolina, she ensured that women would take her place at Mount Vernon. Under Cunningham’s direction, women were directly responsible for keeping up and maintaining the landmark. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">After Cunningham died in 1875, her legacy continued. The Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association is among the oldest preservation organizations in the United States, as well as one of the first —if not the first— nationwide women’s organization. It continues to educate members of the public about George Washington’s home and life. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><strong>Works Referenced:</strong><br /> Arlisha R.

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Abner Doubleday, mistakenly credited as the inventor of baseball, served under Major Robert Anderson at the outbreak of the Civil War and later rose to the rank of brevet major general. Doubleday was born in Ballston Spa, New York in 1819 and worked as a surveyor for railroads before attending the US Military Academy at West Point.<br /> <br /> After graduating from West Point in 1842, Doubleday rotated through coastal garrison duties until the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, during which he served as an artillery officer, commanding a supply depot in Camargo, Mexico. His military career later took him to Florida during the Third Seminole War. His last garrison duty before the Civil War was Fort Moultrie, a sleepy base on Sullivan’s Island, South Carolina.<br /> <br /> Doubleday, captain of Company E, First US Artillery Regiment, wrote in his memoir that Charleston in 1860 “was far from being a pleasant place for a loyal man. Almost every public assemblage was tinctured with treasonable sentiments, and toasts against the flag were always warmly applauded. As early as July there was much talk of secession, accompanied with constant drilling, and threats of taking the forts as soon as a separation should occur.” After South Carolina’s secession, Major Anderson, commander of Fort Moultrie, decided to make a fateful move. Doubleday led the first detachment of men to row from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter on the night of December 26, 1860.<br /> <br /> A Republican and vocal opponent of slavery, Doubleday wanted to answer the insults to the Stars and Stripes. He advised Major Anderson to return fire when the Star of the West, an unarmed merchant vessel sent to reinforce and reprovision the Union garrison in January 1861, was fired upon by South Carolina militia. As a result of this insult to the U.S. flag, Doubleday urged Anderson to close Charleston Harbor using the fort’s guns. He also volunteered to fire the first shot at the Confederates on April 12, 1861, a 32-pound shot that bounced off the roof of the Iron Battery on Cummings Point. “To me,” Doubleday later said, “it was simply a contest, politically speaking, as to whether virtue or vice should rule.”</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">After four hours commanding the guns, Doubleday was relieved by Captain Truman Seymour. “Doubleday,” asked Seymour, “what is all this uproar about?”<br /> <br /> Doubleday replied “there is a trifling difference of opinion between us and our neighbors opposite, and we are trying to settle it.”</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">After the defeat at Fort Sumter, Doubleday commanded men in many battles from 1862-1863: Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), Battle of South Mountain, Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg), Battle of Fredericksburg, and most significantly at the Battle of Gettysburg. His stubborn defense and leadership on the first day of the battle delayed the Confederate advance and allowed more Union forces to move into commanding positions. Doubleday was relieved of command by General George Meade but still participated in the second and third days of the battle, commanding a division. He suffered a neck wound from a shell fragment in the aftermath of Pickett’s Charge.<br /> <br /> Doubleday’s remaining Civil War service consisted of administrative duties and briefly overseeing the defense of Washington DC when forces under Confederate General Jubal Early threatened the capital. Doubleday stayed in the Army until 1873, serving in New York, California, and Texas where he commanded an all-African American unit. Doubleday retired to New Jersey where he died of heart disease in 1893.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Quincy Adams Gillmore, named after President John Quincy Adams, graduated first in his class at West Point in 1849. Commissioned into the Corps of Engineers, Gillmore worked on coastal fortifications in Hampton Roads, Virginia. His application of his knowledge of engineering and artillery later brought him fame during the Civil War as an Union general.<br /> <br /> At the start of the Civil War, Gillmore served on the staff of General Thomas W. Sherman, accompanying him on the seizure of Port Royal, South Carolina in 1861. Afterwards, Gillmore received an independent command: the Siege of Fort Pulaski, a Third System coastal fort on Tybee Island, near Savannah, Georgia. Gillmore became the first general to use massed rifled artillery to reduce a masonry fort at long range. The fort surrendered after five thousand rifled shells breached its walls. Previously impregnable against smoothbore fire, rifled artillery made quick work of masonry. The days of brick fortifications were numbered.<br /> <br /> Gillmore’s triumph at Fort Pulaski catapulted him to brigadier general and the command of the Department of the South, which included South Carolina. The Union military, both the US Army and US Navy, set Charleston, the cradle of secession, in its sights in 1863. Gillmore commanded the Union army’s land campaign on Morris Island. Frontal infantry assaults against Battery Wagner failed to dislodge the Confederates, resulting in the fame of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment and thousands of casualties.<br /> <br /> Recognizing the human cost of additional assaults, the Union advanced by digging trenches and moving heavy guns closer to Confederate positions, pouring withering fire into Battery Wagner. The campaign on Morris Island foreshadowed the horrors of modern wars like World War I with the use of aerial reconnaissance from Confederate balloons, Union calcium lights illuminating nighttime bombardments, the use of wire obstructions, and the use of the rapid-fire Billinghurst Requa Battery gun. By early September 1863, the Confederates abandoned Morris Island.<br /> <br /> The momentum of the campaign stalled, and the Union failed to use Morris Island as a springboard to capture more land around Charleston Harbor. Gillmore did, however, use rifled artillery on Morris Island to bombard Fort Sumter and Charleston, prompting the protest of Confederate General Beauregard. Gillmore earned the dubious distinction of being one of the first military commanders to direct artillery fire at a civilian center.<br /> <br /> In May 1864, General Gillmore’s X Corps was transferred to the Army of the James in Virginia and fought in the failed Bermuda Hundred Operations. After the Union defeat, Gillmore asked to be transferred and found himself in Washington D.C., where he raised thousands of recruits to defend the capital in 1864 against Confederate General Jubal A. Early’s advancing army.<br /> <br /> After the war, Gillmore continued a successful career as an engineer. He died in New York in 1888.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Unlike the established trade route of the Chilkoot Trail, used by Alaska Native Tlingit, the White Pass Trail was less steep. This trail became a wagon road on more solid ground and attracted pack animals and horse traffic. The lucrative freight and passenger White Pass trail supported businesses and services for stampeders on their way to Lake Bennett. One of the bright little businesses located about 30 miles from Skagway was owned by Mollie Walsh. Mollie Walsh arrived with friends in Skagway in 1897 and got a job in a restaurant. A year later, she bought supplies, hired a packer to transport them beyond the Canadian border where she opened up a primitive \"grub tent\" café for freighters. She served basic meals to freighters passing through and gained a reputation for her home cooked meals served up with cheerfulness.</p> <p>When the railroad replaced the freighters and stampeders going over the White Pass Trail, Mollie moved to Dawson, opened a restaurant and married Mike Bartlett. Bartlett had been only one of her suitors; her other suitor was known as Packer Jack Newman. Mollie and her husband Bartlett enjoyed prosperity from his packing business and the couple re-located to Seattle. After several travels and various endeavors, the Bartlett's marriage ended a few years later when Mollie left him with another man, John Lynch. She took Bartlett's money and their 13 month-old son. Bartlett pursued the couple and in March 1902, forced reconciliation with Mollie in Seattle. The marriage again turned bad and Mollie had her husband arrested due to drunkenness and abusive threats against her life. A few days later, she withdrew her complaint which was a grave mistake. Bartlett chased her down an alley and shot her in the back. Mollie died. After a lengthy trial, Bartlett was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity.</p> <p>Mollie's gold rush suitor, Packer Jack Newman, had remained in love with her. He commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/kidsyouth/families.htm#molliewalsh\">statue of her in Skagway</a> which stands today with the following inscription:</p> <blockquote> <p>Alone and with help, this courageous girl ran a grub tent near Log Cabin during the Gold Rush of 1897-1898. She fed and lodged the wildest gold-crazed men. Generations shall surely know this inspiring spirit. Murdered October 27, 1902.</p> </blockquote>",

Bill was even able to begin reading by the age of three, thanks to Eddith's efforts.  <br /> <br /> Bill's grandfather, Eldridge, owned a grocery store in Hope. Hope was still mostly segragated at the time of Bill's birth, but Eldridge would serve anyone who shopped at his store regardless of their race or background. These ideals were taught to Bill as a child, and they played a major role in the policies and decisions that he would make as President.  <br /> <br /> \"<em>My grandfather just had a grade-school education. But in that country store he taught me more about equality in the eyes of the Lord han all my prefessors at Georgetown, more about the intrinsic worth of every individual than all the philosophers at Oxford; and he taught me more about the need for equal justice han all the jurists at Yale Law School.</em>\" — President Bill Clinton<br /> <br /> Bill grew up in small town in southern Arkansas, and was raised by a standard family. But the people in that family, and the desire Bill had to learn more about people, helped this young boy grow into a president of the United States.</p>",

Arches had no paved roads, campground, visitor center, nor designated trails. All of that changed during Wilson's tenure. By his retirement in 1972, Arches had doubled in size, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/management/public-law-92-155.htm\">become a national park</a>, and was well on its way to being the world-famous tourism destination of today.</p> <p>Back then, a park superintendent needed to be a \"jack of all trades.\" On any given day, Wilson was just as likely to dig a water line ditch or winch a visitor's truck out of Courthouse Wash as he was to write a budget report or hobnob with upper management. These excerpts from his January 1950 Superintendent's Monthly Report provides a glimpse of a very different Arches:</p> <p><em>\"Inspite of heavy snowfalls on both approach roads 60 people visited the area in 21 cars representing 8 different states. Only 14 people were contacted. Ranger Worthington gave 7 illustrated talks on his own time...</em></p> <p><em>\"A thorough investigation was made concerning the watering and crossing problems of Mr. James S. Westwood's cattle. His grazing permit expired last year and it is a little difficult to teach old cows new tricks without a fence. Our only solution to the problem, at present, has been to issue a crossing permit to water and enlist the cooperation of Mr. Westwood.\"</em></p> <h3>A new national park</h3> <p>During his superintendency at Arches, Wilson advocated the creation of a national park in the area surrounding the confluence of the Green and Colorado rivers. He led government officials on jeep tours featuring lengthy talks over campfires and hearty dutch oven dinners. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/stewartudall.htm\">joined one of these tours in 1961</a>, and began lobbying for the proposed park.</p> <p>These efforts came to fruition on September 12, 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/learn/management/pl88-590.htm\">Public Law 88-590</a> establishing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm\">Canyonlands National Park</a>. Bates became the first superintendent which, along with his role as chief advocate for the park's creation, earned him the title of \"Father of Canyonlands.\" In a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/bateswilson.htm\">1967 interview</a>, he recounts the journey from initial inspiration to the challenges of park management.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Mary Young Pickersgill was a gifted seamstress who carved a place for herself in history as the maker of one of America’s great icons.</p> <p>Mary Young was born in Philadelphia to William and Rebecca Young. Rebecca was a flag maker during the Revolutionary War, a profession and passion that she passed down to her daughter. Mary was married to Philadelphia merchant John Pickersgill in 1795, but widowed after 10 years of marriage at age 29, and eventually moved to Baltimore.</p> <p>Following in the footsteps of her mother, also widowed young, Pickersgill opened a flag shop and catered to a military clientele. In 1813, as the city of Baltimore prepared for an eventual British attack, Major George Armistead, the commander of the militia unit stationed at Fort McHenry, wanted to order a flag. He called for an ensign “so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance.”</p> <p>Commodore Joshua Barney recommended Mary Pickersgill as the ideal seamstress to create such a distinguished symbol. She was commissioned to make two flags: a 17 by 25 foot storm flag, and the stately banner that Armistead had envisioned, a 30 by 42 foot <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/historyculture/the-great-garrison-flag.htm\">garrison flag</a>.</p> <p>This was a huge undertaking, one that Pickersgill could hardly complete on her own. She hired help from her daughter, two nieces, two free women of color, seamstresses of her community in Baltimore, and likely her elderly mother. Working late into the night, this team of women was able to complete the order in a short six weeks.</p> <p>The garrison flag weighed 50 pounds and took nine men to hoist over Fort McHenry, but Armistead’s wish for a flag that could be seen far in the distance was realized. Both Armistead’s militia and Pickersgill’s flag would be ready for the Battle of Baltimore, which came nearly a year later. As Congreve rockets streamed the sky in the attack on Fort McHenry, not only could the British see Pickersgill’s flag, so could Francis Scott Key. Being held on a British ship in Baltimore Harbor miles from the fort, Key spotted Pickersgill’s flag in the morning after an evening of bombing, and was inspired to pen a poem that would become the National Anthem.</p> <p>The success that Pickersgill enjoyed as a businesswoman through her profitable flag making enterprise allowed her to purchase in 1820 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/baltimore/b27.htm\">the home</a> she had been renting, and eventually to become an activist for women’s social issues. She served as president of the Impartial Female Humane Society from 1828 to 1851, and championed causes such as providing housing and employment to disadvantaged women.</p> <p>Although well-respected for her work in the community, Mary Pickersgill was known to all as the creator of the Star-Spangled Banner, and a living legend of the War of 1812. </p>",

She was appointed justice of South Pass City, Wyoming after the previous justice resigned in protest after Wyoming Territory passed a woman suffrage amendment in December 1869.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">While many say that Esther Morris had a leadership role in the success of the woman’s suffrage amendment in Wyoming Territory, she never claimed credit. She credited William H. Bright instead, who was President of the Territorial Council and represented South Pass City in the territorial legislature.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Esther was born in Tioga County, New York in 1814. Prior to her first marriage, she apprenticed to a seamstress. Using the skills she learned, she ran a successful business making hats and selling other goods to women. She was also active in supporting the abolition of slavery.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">She married her first husband Artemus Slack in 1841. They had a son, Archibald, who they called Archy. Following Artemus’ death just three years later, Esther and Archy moved to property that Artemus owned in Illinois. Unable by law at the time to own or inherit property, she ran into trouble settling the estate.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In 1850, Esther married John Merchant in Peru, Illinois. John was a local merchant in Peru. They had twin sons, Robert and Edward, a year later. In 1868, Archy, and John moved to South Pass City, Wyoming Territory.[1] Originally a stage and telegraph station on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s, gold was found nearby in 1866. Drawn by the excitement, Archy and John opened a saloon and bought interests in several of the local mines. Esther, Robert, and Edward followed in 1869. They took the newly-completed transcontinental railroad and then a stagecoach to reach South Pass City. The family lived in a 24-foot by 26-foot, sod-roofed log cabin. These tight quarters must have felt even tighter for Esther -- her husband John had a reputation in town as a lazy drunk and brawler.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Business in the gold rush town was good in 1868 and 1869 when the town boasted a population of over 2,000. But the mines didn’t produce the riches people hoped for. By 1870, when Esther was appointed Justice of the Peace, the population had fallen to under 500 people; by 1875, there were less than 100 left. On the occasion of her appointment, the county clerk sent a telegraph along the wires: “Wyoming, the youngest and one of the richest Territories in the United States, gave equal rights to women in action as well as words.” (Wyoming Territory had granted women the right to vote in 1869).</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Morris served just over 8 months in office. Though she wanted to run for reappointment, neither the Republican or Democratic parties would nominate her. After she was no longer on the bench, Morris had her husband arrested for assault and battery. In 1872, Esther left her husband and South Pass City and moved to Laramie, Wyoming to live with Archy and his wife. They had moved after fire destroyed Archy’s business in 1871. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Esther was active in the struggle for woman suffrage. In February of 1872, she attended the American Woman Suffrage Association convention in San Francisco, and in 1876 served as the vice president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In July of that year, she was in Philadelphia to address the national suffrage convention. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">After a brief stay in Laramie, Esther moved to Albany, New York and then to Springfield, Illinois. For several years, she spent winters in Springfield and summers in Wyoming with her sons. In the 1880s, she moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming to live with her son Robert. She died in Cheyenne on April 3, 1902. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In 1960, a statue of her by Avard Fairbanks was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the US Capitol in Washington, DC.

Her father was a stone carver and sculptor. Her mother kept house. The family were devout Catholics, and Elisabet and her siblings attended parochial schools. As well as her father’s career working with stone, several other of her family members were also sculptors. Elisabet grew up hearing from her mother the story of Sabina von Steinbach who had worked on the Notre-Dame de Strasbourg cathedral in the 1400s. It should not have been a surprise, then, when 19 year old Elisabet announced her intention to study sculpture in Berlin. Her parents were against it. They felt it was indecent for a good Catholic girl to travel alone to Berlin; and besides, women were not accepted into the Berlin art schools. Elisabet countered her parents’ refusal by going on a hunger strike. Her parents called in the Bishop of Munster who mediated the conflict. Instead of moving directly to Berlin, Elisabet moved to Munich in 1852. The city was largely Catholic, and Elisabet began her studies there while staying with friends of her parents.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Rejected from the Royal Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Elisabet studied with a private teacher. She then reapplied to the Academy. Afraid that having a woman in classes would district the young men of the Academy, the school finally admitted Elisabet on a trial basis. Four months later, she became the first woman to become a regular student in the Academy’s School of Sculpture. She graduated in 1854 with highest honors. In 1855, with a scholarship in hand, Elisabet moved to Berlin to attend the Berlin Academy of Art. She studied with noted teacher, Christian Daniel Rauch.As his student, she met several “great persons of the world,” a goal of hers from a young age.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In 1863, she married Edmund Duncan Montgomery. He was a Scottish scientist and physician whom she had met while a student in Munich. An early feminist, she insisted on keeping her own name. Edmund referred to her their entire life as “Miss Ney.” They lived for a time in the Madeira Islands and then in Rome, where Elisabet worked on several commissions of political leaders and allegorical pieces. In 1867, the couple returned to Munich where Elisabet took a job as court sculptor to King Ludwig II of Bavaria (also known as Mad King Ludwig).</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In July of 1870, the Franco-Prussian War began. In December of the same year, Elisabet found out she was pregnant. On January 14, 1871 Ney and her husband left Germany and moved to the cotton-resort town of Thomasville, Georgia. They were inspired to move there -- and to move quickly -- after receiving two letters. One was a letter from a friend and former patient of Montgomery, who described the place as “Earth’s paradise.” The second was from the Prussian Embassy demanding Elisabet report at a specific time. Her associations with “great persons of the world” had brought her to the attention of those in power during the war.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Arthur was born in Thomasville in early summer, and Elisabet quit her artistic pursuits for the “more important art of molding flesh and blood.” Edmund’’s heath was faltering in the Georgia climate -- a result of tuberculosis he had contracted while a student. They went searching for a milder climate. Their second child was born in Red Wing, Minnesota while they were searching. In 1873, Elisabet set out on her own to find a home in Texas. She traveled from Georgia to New Orleans by train, and then took a steamer to Galveston, Texas. When she arrived in Galveston, she reached out to the German Consul for help in finding a place to live. The first place she was shown was the 1,100 acres of Liendo Plantation.[1] Falling immediately in love with the property, Elisabet is said to have stepped out onto the second floor balcony of the dilapidated plantation house and exclaimed, “Here will I live. And here will I die!” Her family joined her a few weeks later and Edmund purchased the plantation.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Their first son died shortly after their arrival in Texas. Elisabet worked to eke a profit from the plantation to allow Edmund to continue his research and writing. Her neighbors, however, were scandalized by this woman who wore bloomers (and not skirts and dresses) in public and used her maiden name. While Edmund thrived at Liendo, in 1891 Elisabet described it as a “lovely cursed retreat.”<br /> <br /> In 1890, she was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers of the Chicago World’s Fair Association to create sculptures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin. This was her first return to art in over twenty years. The Texas state legislature contributed $32,000 to fund her work, which were slated to be exhibited at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. Elisabet missed the deadline, and her work was not shown. Her sculptures of Houston and Austin are currently on display at the Texas State Capitol in Austin and in the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/us-capitol.htm\">US Capitol</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> in Washington, DC.[2]</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In 1892, using the money from her commission, Elisabet moved to a 2.5 acre piece of land in the newly-established Hyde Park suburb of Austin [3]. On the property, she built a studio that echoed a Greek temple, living quarters for servants, and a horse barn. Elisabet purposefully left as much of the land as possible in its natural state: rolling prairie, post oak, and wildflowers. She called her studio “</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/formosa-the-elisabet-ney-studio-and-museum.htm\">Formosa</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">,” the Portuguese word for “beautiful.” As well as a working art studio, Formosa became a center for cultural gatherings and conversations. People from around the world traveled to Formosa, including Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Elisabet lived and worked at her studio until her death there on June 29, 1907. She was buried on the grounds of Liendo Plantation When her husband Edmund died in 1911, he was buried next to her. After her death, Formosa was opened to the public as the Elisabet Ney Museum. It houses many of her works, archives, and personal effects.

In 1918, after learning and working in New Orleans with such people as Henry Allen, Sr., Richard M. Jones, Edward \"Kid\" Ory, and his own band, he went to Chicago to join a band led by fellow New Orleanian and clarinetist Lawrence Duhe. While playing with Duhe, Oliver also \"moonlighted\" in Chicago for a time in a band led by another New Orleanian, bassist Bill Johnson. A year or so after his arrival in Chicago, he took over leadership of the Duhe ensemble. Following a brief stint in San Francisco, Oliver returned to Chicago to lead a band at the Lincoln Gardens. In 1921 Louis Armstrong joined Oliver in Chicago. Known principally for his eight-piece ensemble, the Creole Jazz Band, Oliver fielded a larger, jump-band style ensemble called the Dixie Syncopaters in the mid-to-late 1920’s. That group worked for a couple of years at the Plantation Inn in Chicago subsequent to also working dates briefly in Milwaukee and St. Louis (John Chilton’s Who’s Who of Jazz). Ultimately however, Oliver’s larger ensemble would enjoy considerably less success than his earlier group.</p>",

Prior to his Civil War service he was a laywer and served in the Massachusetts state legislature.</p> <p>Union Major General Benjamin F. Butler, who had arrived at Fort Monroe only two days before, determined that the U.S. Constitution and the Fugitive Slave Act did not affect another country, which Virginia claimed to be. Given that the freedom-seekers were property of a rebel colonel and were about to be used against the United States, Butler resolved that he would hold the enslaved men, hence property, as he “would for any other property of a private citizen which the exigencies of the service seemed to require to be taken by [him], and especially property that was designed, adapted and about to be used against the United States.”</p> <p>Butler was a shrewd military leader and lawyer. His decision, which came to be known as the “Contraband Decision,” enabled thousands of enslaved people from states in rebellion to seek refuge behind Union lines. However, no existing law or policy supported his clever reasoning, which supplied the Union with able-bodied men capable and willing to support the Union. Despite the impact of his decision on slavery, Butler was not an abolitionist; he had voted for Jefferson Davis at the 1860 Democratic National Convention. Tellingly, his decision did not challenge the fundamental premise of slavery (people as property) and neglected a key question: Were these freedom-seekers now free?</p> <p>Enslaved men who found their way to Fort Monroe quickly became known as “contrabands,” a term that marked their provisional state of being neither free nor enslaved. In subsequent months “contraband” was adopted into common use and signaled changing views of slavery in America. In the following years, Butler’s decision had resounding military, political, and social implications as well. It served as a forerunner to the <a href=\"http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact1.htm\">First</a> (1861) and <a href=\"http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact2.htm\">Second Confiscation Acts</a> (1862), the <a href=\"http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/milact.htm\">Militia Act</a> (1862), the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/transcript.html\">Emancipation Proclamation</a> (1863), and, ultimately, the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#13\">Thirteenth Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution (1865), which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude throughout the United States.</p> <p>After the Civil War, Butler served as a Congressman and Chairman for the House Committee on Reconstruction.  As committee chair, he authored the Klu Klux Klan Act of 1871 and co-authored, along with Senator Charles Sumner, the Civil Rights Act of 1875.<br /> <br /> It was also after the Civil War he became the president and treasurer of the Board of Managers for the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. In 1870, he suggested a new branch be opened in the South to accommodate the U.S. Colored Troops and proposed that the location be near Fort Monroe. The Board of Managers’ search committee selected Butler’s land for the new branch. The Southern Branch is located at 100 Emancipation Drive in Hampton, Virginia. The Southern Branch has been documented by the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<h4>Early Life</h4> <p>Samuel Ringgold was born near Hagerstown, MD in the year 1800. Ringgold was the eldest son of Brigadier General, Samuel Ringgold, a veteran of the War of 1812.<br /> <br /> The younger Ringgold entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1814 and graduated near the top of his class in 1818. By 1822 he had risen to the rank of 1st Lieutenant and then earned the brevet of Captain in 1832. In 1836, Captain Samuel Ringgold took command of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment and served in the campaigns in Florida. While serving in Florida, Ringgold’s health became weakened.<br /> <br /> Ringgold went off to Europe in an effort to better his health and to study at the École Polytechnique in Paris and Sandhurst Royal Military College in London. It was there where learned the advantages of a light artillery system and its possible contributions in combat.</p> <h4>Return from Europe</h4> <p>Ringgold returned to the U.S. in 1838. However, upon his arrival, he learned his artillery company war ordered to disband. Consequently, Secretary of War Poinsett ordered Captain Ringgold to organize a company of light artillery. This was somewhat of an unusual request. At the time, light artillery was a novel component of the service. Nevertheless, in 1838, Secretary of War Poinsett ordered four light artillery companies to be mounted. Under Ringgold’s direction, each regiment of heavy artillery would have one company equipped with lighter cannons and horses.</p> <h4>Flying Artillery</h4> <p>The first company mounted as a horse battery was Company C, 3d Regiment of Artillery commanded by Samuel Ringgold. The company received new field guns and horses. Ringgold’s cannoneers were mounted on horseback making his company true flying artillery. The companies that followed were equipped as mounted batteries. Cannoneers in these companies tended to ride on the carriages or caissons or even walked next to their guns.<br /> <br /> “He established himself at Carlisle, PA, where, by constant practice, he brought both horses and men to such a state of perfection, that, when drilling they seemed to move by volition alone… with such rapidity that the eye could scarcely follow their movement…”<sup>1</sup> While at Carlisle, Ringgold received the brevet of Major, for his services in the Florida war;</p> <h4>U.S.-Mexican War</h4> <p>Ringgold’s brainchild would take center stage in the opening battle of the U.S.-Mexican War on May 8, 1846, on the prairie of Palo Alto. When General Zachary Taylor’s force arrived on scene, they found General Arista’s army already deployed in battle formation. In addition, they found themselves outnumbered by their opposing Mexican force by about 1,000 troops, making a frontal assault impossible. General Taylor decided to deploy his flying artillery instead. An artillery duel would decide the Battle of Palo Alto.<br /> <br /> The execution by the U.S. flying artillery not only made up for the manpower deficit but exacted a heavy toll on the Mexican battle line. Working in conjunction with a pair of heavy U.S. 18-pounder siege cannon, they wreaked havoc on Arista’s troops.<br /> <br /> The Mexican artillery was generally ineffective but it did manage to strike a devastating blow to Taylor’s army. A Mexican artillery round mortally wounded Ringgold while he was commanding his guns. Even at this moment, Ringgold put his men before himself. When they came to his assistance, he waved them off and reminded them of the work they still needed to do. Ringgold would succumb to his wounds on May 11th.</p> <h3>Legacy</h3> <p>The work Ringgold put into the U.S. flying artillery would serve the U.S. Army well throughout the rest of the Mexican War. The U.S. flying artillery saw action many times in the ensuing battles of the war and carried itself well. Ringgold’s tireless efforts to better the U.S. light artillery had a profound effect on the performance of the U.S. Army during the war and the success it enjoyed during the conflict.<br /> <br /> 1.

            "bodyText": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> <p dir=\"ltr\">Thomas M'Clintock (1792-1876) married <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/people/mary-ann-m-clintock.htm\">Mary Ann Wilson</a> in 1820. They had five children: Elizabeth (1821), Mary Ann (1822), Sarah (1824), Charles (1829) and Julia (1831). They lived in Philadelphia for the first 17 years of marriage.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Together they were long-standing active members of the Philadelphia <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/quaker-influence.htm\">Quaker</a> community and were recognized by their meetings as leaders. In 1827 they joined supporters of Elias Hicks and split from the Orthodox Quakers to become part of a group of Quakers called Hicksites. The Hicksites believed that an individual’s faith required social activism and individuals should be guided by their conscience to participate in reform as much as they felt compelled to do.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">After the split they found the religious atmosphere in Philadelphia less than friendly. In 1836 Thomas M'Clintock and his entire family moved to Waterloo, New York. The M’Clintocks had family connections to Waterloo. Thomas’ niece, Sarah M'Clintock (1807-1842) was the third wife of Richard Hunt They had three children: Richard (1838), Mary M. (1839), and Sarah (1841). After Sarah’s death, Richard Hunt married Jane C. Master in 1845.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The family joined the Waterloo Hicksite Quaker community, the Junius Monthly Meeting. In 1848, Thomas M'Clintock co-authored the “Basis of Religious Association,” which established him as a leader. In October of 1848 Thomas M'Clintock led a group of several hundred members of the local Hicksite community to form a new Progressive Friends or Friends of Human Progress. Among the group who followed were his wife Mary Ann, Jane and Richard Hunt, Isaac and Amy Post, George and Margaret Pryor.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Late in 1836, Thomas M'Clintock opened a drugstore and bookstore downtown Waterloo. At the store, Thomas, Charles, and Elizabeth circulated antislavery petitions, and in two rooms above the drugstore, held temperance meetings and ran a school. As members of The Free Produce Society, they sold only alternative products made from wool, honey, and molasses as a boycott of slave-made goods.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">William Lloyd Garrison wrote to Thomas M'Clintock in 1840:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">You have a soul, capable of Embracing the largest idea of humanity …I regard you as one of those whose country is not America, Europe, Asia, or Africa, but the world; and whose countrymen are all the rational creatures of God,…whether their complexion be white, black, red, or any other color…. When this spirit shall universally prevail among men there shall be no more wares, no more slavery, no more injustice.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1842 Thomas and Mary Ann M’Clintock became founding members of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society and helped write its constitution. When he moved to Rochester in 1847, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, joined Isaac and Amy Post, and the M'Clintocks in this Rochester based chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">On July 20, 1848 at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/report-of-the-womans-rights-convention.htm\">First Woman’s Rights Convention</a>’s second day, Thomas M'Clintock participated in a discussion of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/declaration-of-sentiments.htm\">Declaration of Sentiments</a>. Later that night he <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/convention-officers-and-committees.htm\">chaired</a> the evening session, read the minutes, and read several passages from Sir William Blackstone.</p> <br />  ",

Forty-five years later, in 1912, the US Congress voted to create the Territory of Alaska and establish the Alaska Territorial Legislature. The first session of the legislature met from March 3 to May 1, 1913 in the Juneau Elks Lodge.[1] Their first act of the all-male Territorial Legislature was to grant Alaska women the right to vote.<br /> <br /> House Bill No. 2, An Act to Extend the Elective Franchise to Women in the Territory of Alaska, reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>Be it enacted by the legislature of the Territory of Alaska: That in all elections which are now, or may be hereafter authorized by law in the Territory of Alaska, or any sub-division or municipality thereof, the elective franchise is hereby extended to such women as have the qualifications of citizenship required of male electors.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bill passed the House on March 14, 1913; passed the Senate on March 18, 1913; and was signed into law by the Governor of Alaska Territory, Walter Eli Clark, on March 21, 1913.[2]<br /> <br /> Excluded from voting were Alaska Natives, who were denied the vote and participation in elections by the Act that established the Alaska Territory. Activists from the Alaska Native Brotherhood and Sisterhood advocated for Native suffrage rights. In 1915, the Alaska Territorial Legislature recognized the right of Indigenous people to vote on the condition they gave up tribal customs and traditions.<br /> <br /> In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act was signed into law, granting US citizenship to all Native Americans -- including those in Alaska, and regardless of whether they gave up their culture. But states could limit who had access to the vote, and many states -- including Alaska -- excluded certain groups from the ballot. In Alaska, as in many of the Southern US states, the Territorial Legislature passed a literacy requirement for all new voters. While it seems as though the law was only selectively enforced, it remained in effect, and became part of the Alaska State Constitution.<br /> <br /> Alaska did not become a US state until January 3, 1959 and so was unable to vote to ratify the 19th Amendment before it became law in 1920.<br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> [1] First Territorial Legislature members were:<br /> <u>Senate</u>: Elwood Bruner, Conrad Freeding, Thomas McGann, B.F.

She was related to the Meriwether and the Lewis families. She studied for a short time at an academy for young ladies in Charlottesville, Virginia, and was schooled at home. She was known for her charm and beauty, and was described as being \"sweet and retiring-looking,\" with \"ladylike manners\" and an \"old-fashioned\" charm.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">On August 31, 1843, she married her distant cousin, Francis Minor, a lawyer and graduate of Princeton and the University of Virginia. They lived in Mississippi for a time, close to family members who had emigrated there, and then moved to St. Louis in 1844 where an even larger family group had settled. Just prior to the Civil War they bought a farm in St. Louis, in what is now the Central West End. During the Civil War Louisa helped at hospitals in the St. Louis area through the Western Sanitary Commission. She also provided produce from their farm to soldiers at Benton Barracks, a Union Army encampment three miles north of their home.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The Minor’s only child, a son born in 1852, died in an accident in 1866. That same year Virginia Minor launched the woman suffrage movement in Missouri, and in 1867 took an active role in founding the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri. She was elected the first president of this organization at their first meeting, held on May 8, 1867 in the Director's Room of the Mercantile Library in St. Louis.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">On October 15, 1872, as part of a nation-wide plan organized by the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association, </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/virginia-minor-and-women-s-right-to-vote.htm\">Virginia Minor tried to register to vote in the upcoming election</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">. She was refused by St. Louis' sixth district registrar because she was a woman. While other women, like </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">, were jailed for their civil disobedience of voting, Virginia and her husband sued the registrar. They argued that women were U.S. citizens under the 14th amendment to the Constitution, which \"nowhere gives [states] the power to prevent\" a citizen from voting. The case eventually was heard by the US Supreme Court. The judges ruled that citizenship did not guarantee the right to vote. The decision was a blow to woman suffrage, and suffragists changed their tactics to get women access to the ballot.<br /> <br /> Virginia Minor died on August 14, 1894, and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Since she regarded the clergy as hostile to equal rights for women, her funeral was conducted without a clergyman. Virginia Minor left $1,000 in her will to Susan B. Anthony for \"the thousands she has expended for women,\" and $500 to each of two nieces, provided they did not marry; if one married, her share would go to the unmarried niece.</span></span></span>",

Clarke. When he was appointed to oversee the creation of the Blue Ridge Parkway, Abbott was already well-known in the small circle of landscape architect professionals. He gave landscape work his highest priority when prioritizing the maintenance projects of the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps camp workers. Abbott, often described as a 'regionalist' found in Harold Ickes and others associated with the parkway design, an opportunity to extend his vision of an environmentally sensitive design plan that would preserve the cultural history found along the parkway route. His interest and expertise in park design and in land use planning can be seen in the early planning for the Blue Ridge Parkway.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br style=\"box-sizing:border-box; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; orphans:2; text-align:start; widows:2; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial; word-spacing:0px\" /> <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; orphans:2; text-align:start; widows:2; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial; word-spacing:0px\" /> <span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px\"><span style=\"font-variant-caps:normal\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"widows:2\"><span style=\"text-decoration-style:initial\"><span style=\"text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"float:none\"><span style=\"word-spacing:0px\">On June 30,1936, Congress formally announced the establishment of the Blue Ridge Parkway with the act [Public Law 848]. The Parkway was placed under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service and Stanley Abbott was officially named the Resident Landscape Architect and the Acting Superintendent in March of the following year, 1937. He was only 25 years old. He remained as the lead designer of the Parkway and its Superintendent until the outbreak of WWII when he was called into service for the war effort. Abbott was one of the founding members of the Society of Landscape Architects, the close circle of professionals. He was, by some accounts, an enlightened land manager and with R. Getty Browning, the North Carolina primary engineer, produced a parkway that remains one of the most significant examples of landscape architecture in the country. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; transition: all 0.15s ease-in-out 0s; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><font color=\"#555555\">Text excerpted from </font><a href=\"http://toto.lib.unca.edu/web_exhibits/BRP_not_so_back_exhibit/06_people/06_people.htm\">http://toto.lib.unca.edu/web_exhibits/BRP_not_so_back_exhibit/06_people/06_people.htm</a></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

As a child, Mott attended Nine Partners, a Quaker boarding school located in New York.[1] At school, she learned of the horrors of slavery from her readings and from visiting lecturers such as Elias Hicks, a well-known Quaker abolitionist. She also saw that women and men were not treated equally, even among the Quakers, when she discovered that women teaching at Nine Partners earned less than the men. At a young age Lucretia Coffin Mott became determined to put an end to such social injustices.<br /> <br /> In 1833 Mott, along with Mary Ann M’Clintock and nearly 30 other abolitionist women, organized the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. She later served as a delegate from that organization to the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. It was there that she first met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/elizabeth-cady-stanton.htm\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>, who was attending the convention with her husband Henry, a delegate from New York. Mott and Stanton were indignant at the fact that women were excluded from participating in the convention simply because of their gender, and that indignation would result in a discussion about holding a woman’s rights convention. Stanton later recalled this conversation in the History of Woman Suffrage:</p> <blockquote> <p>As Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton wended their way arm in arm down Great Queen Street that night, reviewing the exciting scenes of the day. Together, they agreed to hold a woman’s rights convention on their return to America. </p> </blockquote> <p>Eight years later, on July 19 and 20, 1848, Mott, Stanton, Mary Ann M’Clintock, Martha Coffin Wright, and Jane Hunt acted on this idea when they organized the First Woman’s Rights Convention. It was held in the Wesleyan Chapel, now part of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/index.htm\">Women’s Rights National Historical Park</a>.<br /> <br /> Throughout her life Mott remained active in both the abolition and women’s rights movements. She continued to speak out against slavery, and in 1866 she became the first president of the American Equal Rights Association, an organization formed to achieve equality for African Americans and women.[2]<br /> <br /> Lucretia Mott died of pneumonia at her home in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania on November 11, 1880. She is buried in the Fair Hill Burial Ground, a Quaker cemetery in Philadelphia.[3]<br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> [1] The Nine Partners Boarding School was affiliated with the nearby Nine Partners Meeting House and Cemetery. Their meeting house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 27, 1989.<br /> <br /> [2] You can read more about the connection between African American voting rights and women’s voting rights in “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/15th-and-19th-amendments.htm\">Suffrage In America</a>.”<br /> <br /> [3] The Fair Hill Burial Ground was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 7, 1998.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess and 2nd Earl Cornwallis, served as a general in the British army during the American Revolution. Cornwallis held commands throughout the the war, serving in campaigns in New York, Philadelphia, and notably commanding the southern theater in the field after Clinton's depature in June 1780. Best known for his surrender at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, which effectively ended hostilities and led to peace negotiations between Great Britain and the United States, Lord Cornwallis's postwar career demonstrated the resilience and power of the British Empire. Despite losing thirteen of their American colonies, Great Britiain emerged from the American Revolution with the foundation to build a new, more profitable empire from her victories in India. Cornwallis oversaw this expansion of British power, serving as Governor-General of India from 1786 to 1793 and again in 1805. <br />   <h4>Military Pedigree</h4> Cornwallis was the most aristocratic of the British commanders in America. Born in Grosvenor Square in London, he was the sixth child and oldest son of Charles, first earl Cornwallis, and Elizabeth Townshend. In his early twenties, he succeeded to the title and became a member of the House of Lords. His later advancement in the army owed a great deal to his family's status and connections. His family had a long military tradition as well: his uncle, Lieutenant General Edward Cornwallis, and his brother, Admiral William Cornwallis, both had notable careers. Cornwallis received a formal education at Eton College and briefly attended Clare College, Cambridge University. A lieutenant colonel at the age of twenty-three, a privy councillor at the age of thirty, Cornwallis's career enjoyed great success before the American war.<br /> <br /> In 1757, he obtained leave from the army to travel to Europe to attend a military academy in Turin, Italy. At the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, Cornwallis tried and failed to join his regiment in Germany. He, however, did secure a place on Lord Granby's staff as an aide-de-camp. Cornwallis was present at the battle of Minden when Lord George Germain, later Secretary of State for America in Lord North's cabinet, was disgraced and replaced by Granby. In 1761, Cornwallis became a regimental commander and served with distinction in Germany at the battle of Vellinghausen; the following year, he saw action at Wilhelmsthal and Lutterberg. An experienced veteran of European warfare before his arrival in America, Cornwallis proved a worthy foe for the Continental army. Cornwallis's opposition to British policies that triggered American unrest like the Stamp Act, which he voted against, did not prevent him from volunteering for service in America in 1775. Before his departure to America on February 10, 1776, Cornwallis was promoted to the rank of major general. As colonel of the 33rd Regiment, he sailed with his men from Cork, Ireland in February 1776 to reinforce General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-clinton.htm\">Henry Clinton</a>'s southern expedition. <br />   <h4>Southern Expedition & New York Campaign</h4> During the southern expedition, Cornwallis observed the quarrels between Clinton and Commodore <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-parker.htm\">Sir Peter Parker</a>, the naval commander. Unfortunately, Cornwallis left no recorded thoughts for posterity on the mismanaged campaign. After the attack on Charleston, South Carolina was abandoned, following the British defeat at the Battle of Sullivan's Island, Cornwallis and Clinton left to join Sir William Howe in the conquest of New York. The British capture of New York proved to be their biggest victory of the war, involving the most soldiers and sailors. After arriving on Staten Island in August 1776, Cornwallis participated in the British army's advance as they drove Washington's army successively out of Long Island, Manhattan, and finally New Jersey. Cornwallis commanded the reserve wing when Howe defeated Washington at the battle of Long Island. In the final stages of the battle, Cornwallis led the vanguard of Clinton's successful flanking maneuver through Jamaica Pass, defeating a patriot counteroffensive.<br /> <br /> Cornwallis exposed himself to mortal danger, leading his men visibly on the battlefields. Cornwallis played a role in the British landing and rout of patriot defenders at Kip's Bay when the British landed on Manhattan on September 15. In the early morning of November 20, he commanded the British detachment sent across the Hudson River to capture Fort Lee on the Jersey Heights. Unable to score a victory over the Americans as Washington's army had abandoned the fort, Cornwallis captured the fort and many supplies.<br /> <br /> Throughout late November and December 1776, Cornwallis pursued Washington's army across New Jersey. On December 1, he failed in his boast of \"bagging the fox\", Washington, as he stopped on the banks of the Raritan River in obedience to Howe’s orders to hold position. Retrospectively, this decision can be viewed as one of the greatest mistakes of the war as Washington’s army was at its weakest point and still managed to escape Cornwallis’s larger force. The British, believing the campaign season was over, established their winter quarters throughout New York and New Jersey as Cornwallis prepared to depart for London. Hearing of Washington's surprise attack on the Hessian garrison at Trenton, Cornwallis again took to the field and rode fifty miles to organize a British response. Commanding eight thousand men, Cornwallis's men engaged Washington's army on January 2, 1777 in the Battle of Second Trenton, or the Battle of Assunpink Creek. At the conclusion of the day's engagement, Cornwallis expected to defeat Washington's army the following morning, satisfied their backs were to the Delaware River and they could not evade defeat. Washington and his army, however, escaped under cover of darkness and defeated a British rearguard at Princeton.<br />   <h4>British Capture Philadelphia</h4> After the defeat at Princeton, Cornwallis spent the winter months in London before returning to America for the spring campaign. He was instrumental in the British victory at Brandywine (September 11, 1777) and the capture of Philadelphia two weeks later. At the Battle of Brandywine, Cornwallis performed the engagement’s decisive maneuver when he led eight thousands troops in a flanking attack that split the Continental army’s line, striking the forces of patriot Maj. Gen. John Sullivan. A few weeks later, Cornwallis took advantage of Howe's feint towards Reading, which Washington's army moved to counter, and marched into the city of Philadelphia without firing a shot. However, these victories were marred by the crushing defeat and surrender of General John Burgoyne’s army at Saratoga, New York on October 17, 1777. As the campaign season ended, Cornwallis again departed America for England. Cornwallis always remained loyal to Howe and acted as a supporting witness for him during a parliamentary inquiry into Saratoga.  <h4><br /> Southern Campaign</h4> Shortly after his return to America, Cornwallis traveled to South Carolina in the spring of 1780. By this time, the British had shifted their military efforts to the south. Promoted to lieutenant general and appointed second in command to Sir Henry Clinton in America, he joined Clinton as the British besieged Charleston and, despite their initial amicable meeting, the two quickly developed a poor relationship that affected future communications. On May 12, 1780 the two generals celebrated the surrender of the Continental army and the city of Charleston, which proved to be the greatest British victory of the war. After this victory, Clinton returned to New York and left Cornwallis with about eight thousand troops and the task of securing South Carolina for the British. Cornwallis’s southern campaign started with the spectacular victory over General Horatio Gates at the Battle of Camden on August 16. The British outmatched the army under Gates, which consisted in large part of militia, who broke and ran. This victory eliminated organized resistance by the Continental army in the southern theater for several months as it took some time for Gates’s replacement, General Nathanael Greene, to improve the situation. After the victory at Camden, Cornwallis set out to pacify the countryside, a task that proved difficult given stubborn resistance by patriot militia, incensed by Clinton's proclamation demanding fealty to the British crown.<br /> <br /> The British based their southern campaign on the idea that loyalists outnumbered patriots in the south and would flock to the royal standard. While loyalists did support British operations in the south, their numbers were never as high as the British government had hoped and been led to believe. The anticipated support of allied Cherokee and Creek Indians proved disappointing as well and only further alienated southern frontiersmen against the British. He separated his forces in order to target pockets of patriot resistance and control more of the southern interior and backcountry. After his subordinate commanders, Major Patrick Ferguson and Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, were both defeated at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens respectively, Cornwallis had the option to retreat to fight a defensive war in South Carolina or undoing the damage of Kings Mountain by resuming his offensive in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> With the situation growing dire, Cornwallis sought to strike one last blow to destroy Greene’s growing army. He had his army destroy their baggage and began a wild chase of their foe to the Dan River. Cornwallis eventually caught Greene, and the two armies fought the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781. The British won the battle, but at a very heavy cost and the Continentals under Greene managed an orderly escape.<br />   <h4>Campaign in Virginia & Siege of Yorktown</h4> Despite the losses his army suffered, Cornwallis decided to leave Wilmington, North Carolina and advanced into the poorly defended and heavily populated colony of Virginia. Meanwhile Greene’s Continental Army stayed in the Carolinas, gradually pushing the British back to coastal enclaves at Charleston and Wilmington. Cornwallis threw Virginia into chaos as he captured Richmond and Charlottesville. His feared commander of the British Legion, Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton led a raid on Monticello, the personal estate of Governor Thomas Jefferson, in an effort to capture the author of the Declaration of Independence. The British Army was still in a vulnerable situation after these successes, andClinton ordered Cornwallis to establish a naval post on the Chesapeake. Clinton had grown nervous with Cornwallis’s expeditions and ordered his troops back to New York.<br /> <br /> The Marquis de Lafayette and General Anthony Wayne, commanding Continentals in Virginia, shadowed and harrassed Cornwallis's march to Yorktown while a large French fleet under Admiral de Grasse approached the coast. The combined forces of the Continental Army and the French army under Washington and Rochambeau saw an opportunity and moved to trap the British army at Yorktown. Cornwallis expected support from Clinton but was unaware of the presence of the superior French fleet, which won the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, 1781, gaining control of the sea. Unaware of the circumstances, Cornwallis slowly fortified Yorktown throughout August before discovering on September 8<sup>th</sup> that Washington and the French were marching south.<br /> <br /> The allied forces began to bisiege the British at Yorktown on September 28, 1781. Cornwallis withdrew his outer defenses closer to the town of Yorktown as he faced a superior foe. The French and Americans initiated a steady bombardment of artillery fire and slowly dug their siege lines closer, eventually capturing two British redoubts that were critical for British outer defenses<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px;\">.</span> Cornwallis, left with no other option but to surrender, sent a flag of truce to negotiate the surrender of his army on October 17. Cornwallis sought to surrender with the traditional honors of war, but Washington demanded harsh terms as they had denied the Americans those honors at the surrender of Charleston in May 1780.<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px;\"> </span>The Articles of Surrender were signed on October 19, 1781. Cornwallis, unable to stomach the embarassment, did not attend the surrender ceremony, citing illness. Brig. Gen. Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the surrender field and attempted to hand his sword to the French General Rochambeau, who refused. He next offered it to Washington, who refused and pointed to General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-lincoln.htm\">Benjamin Lincoln</a>. Cornwallis’s loss at Yorktown led to the cessation of major hostilities. Peace negotiations between the British and Americans resulted in the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which recognized the independence of the United States.<br />   <h4>Postwar Career</h4> Cornwallis enjoyed the most successful postwar career of any of the British generals of the American Revolution. From New York, Cornwallis sailed to Portsmouth, England, joined by Benedict Arnold. Despite his surrender at Yorktown, the public greeted him as a hero upon his return to England. In 1786, King George III created Cornwallis a Knight of the Garter. Cornwallis largely ignored criticisms leveled by Clinton in Clinton's pamphlet, denouncing Cornwallis for the British defeat at Yorktown. Tarleton's criticisms of Cornwallis in his memoir of 1787, however, hurt the former commander. <br /> <br /> In 1786, Cornwallis was appointed to the position of governor general of Bengal and commander in chief of British forces in India. Commanding an army of twenty thousand men, larger than his southern army during the Revolution, he defeated forty thousand troops of Tipu Sultan during the Third Mysore War (1790 - 92). This campaign helped pave the way for British control of south India. Cornwallis implemented racial segregation of offices, with white imperial officials gradually gaining exclusive hold of senior appointments. He also worked to create an efficient imperial bureaucracy. Following his success in India, Cornwallis was appointed lord lieutenant and commander in chief of Ireland in 1798. <br /> <br /> Cornwallis, as a lieutenant general, led his troops into battle in Ireland, defeating a French invasion force of eleven hundred men commanded by General Joseph Humbert. While walking in Dublin in 1799, he was the victim of an attempted assassination when a disguised sentry fired at him and fled. Cornwallis returned to India in 1805 and died shortly after his arrival. The House of Commons voted a memorial and statue to his memory in St. Paul's Cathedral. The British inhabitants of Calcutta raised a public subscription to pay for a mausoleum on a bluff over the River Ganges for Cornwallis's remains. The inscription reads: \"This monument, raised by the British inhabitants of Calcutta, attests their sense of those virtues which will live in the remembrance of grateful millions, long after it shall have mouldered in the dust.\" ",

            "bodyText": "Not much is known about George Washington Créol, an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1830 to 1840, but a few historical records give us clues about his life and career in the fur trade. Hudson's Bay Company records indicate that he was originally from the United States; further descriptions of him suggest that he was African American.<br /> <br /> Washington began his career with the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1830, working as a \"general charge,\" meaning that he was probably doing a variety of jobs, at Fort Vancouver. Fort Vancouver was the HBC's most prominent post in the Pacific Northwest. The fort served as a headquarters and supply depot for a network of fur trading forts and supply ships coming to and from the fort.<br /> <br /> From 1831 to 1832, Washington worked as a cook aboard three Hudson's Bay Company ships that made frequent stops at Fort Vancouver: <em>Vancouver</em>, <em>Lama</em>, and <em>Dryad</em>. <em>Vancouver </em>was a schooner built at Fort Vancouver in 1826. It mainly traveled up and down the Northwest Coast, but also to the HBC's post in Honolulu, Hawai'i. During his time on the <em>Vancouver</em> in 1831, Washington may have been temporarily transferred to the <em>Lama</em>. <em>Lama </em>was an American brigantine that had also been trading on the Northwest Coast and Hawai'i. In 1832, the <em>Lama</em> was purchased by the HBC to replace the smaller <em>Vancouver</em>. Then, Washington cooked aboard the <em>Dryad</em>, an HBC brig traveling between Northwest Coast posts. From 1832 to 1833, Washington worked as a seaman based at Fort Simpson, then located at the mouth of British Columbia's Nass River.<br /> <br /> In 1833, Washington's contract with the HBC expired. He renewed, and was posted to Fort Vancouver as a \"middleman.\" The term \"middleman\" originally denoted a boatman paddling in the middle of a bateau, but came to refer to HBC employees who performed a wide variety of tasks, often manual labor. Washington remained in this position until 1840.<br /> <br /> Records kept by the Catholic missionaries at Fort Vancouver show that Washington was a witness at the funeral of Marie, a Chehalis woman who died on February 13, 1840, at the age of 18. Marie was the wife of Charles Proulx, a Hudson's Bay Company engagé (a general term for employees on contract to, or \"engaged by,\" the HBC). The Proulxs lived in Fort Vancouver's employee Village, a neighborhood of one- or two-bedroom homes located to the west of Fort Vancouver. It is likely that Washington lived there as well.<br /> <br /> Shortly before his retirement from HBC service, Washington was given a special task by Fort Vancouver's Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin: to help guide the American ship <em>Lausanne </em>into the Columbia River. The <em>Lausanne</em> was a barkentine that carried American emigrants and missionaries from New York to the Northwest, arriving at the Columbia River bar in May 1840. The passengers aboard this ship were meant to \"reinforce\" the Methodist missionaries already living in the region, and assist in efforts to convert the Native population to Christianity. Washington was one of the river pilots sent by McLoughlin to help bring the <em>Lausanne </em>past the treacherous bar and up the Columbia River. American missionaries Daniel Lee and Joseph Frost wrote in their account of the journey: <blockquote> <p>\"[On May 29] we were joined by a coloured man from Vancouver, bringing, as a foretaste of the kind reception which awaited us at that post, some excellent fresh bread and butter, from the larder of John Mc'Laughlin, Esq. The name of the coloured man was George Washington, who reported himself to be a good pilot, and that one part of his errand was to see the Lausanne safely up to Vancouver.\"</p> </blockquote> Unfortunately, the <em>Lausanne</em> collided with a sand bar shortly after this, and the piloting was taken over by a Chinook HBC employee, also named George, who explained to Lee and Frost that George Washington was a better cook than he was a pilot.<br /> <br /> In 1841, Washington retired and settled in the HBC's Willamette Settlement, a privilege awarded to well-regarded HBC retirees. In 1844, the American Provisional Government of Oregon established the first Black Exclusion law, requiring Black residents living south of the Columbia River to leave or face severe consequences. Like many other Black individuals and families, Washington moved north, apparently settling in the area surrounding Chinook Point, near the mouth of the Columbia River, where the Hudson's Bay Company operated a store. Several other former HBC employees also settled in this area.<br /> <br /> Washington - now also known by the name George Créol - married a Lower Chinook woman named Mary (1828-1877) with whom he had five children: Marthe, Joseph, two sons whose names are unknown, and Margaret. Marthe and Joseph were baptized at the Catholic Stella Maris Mission in Chinook, Washington. Their descendants still live throughout the state of Washington, and include Bessie Pickernell, a well-known Chinook basket maker.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Note</strong>: This George Washington was not the only African American George Washington living and working in the Northwest in the 19th century. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashingtonbush.htm\">George Washington Bush</a> (ca. 1790-1863) spent the winter of 1844 at Fort Vancouver, and went on to found the city of Tumwater, Washington.

            "bodyText": "Andrew Pickens, a famous patriot militia officer of the American Revolution, was born in Pennsylvania on September 19, 1739, the son of Andrew Pickens and Ann Davis. Of Scots-Irish descent, his family eventually settled on Waxhaw Creek, South Carolina, by 1752. The young Pickens commenced his military career as an officer in the Cherokee War of 1759 - 1761. After the hostilities, he moved to the Long Canes area of western South Carolina and married Rebecca Calhoun on March 19, 1765. The couple had twelve children. This union also forged ties with several prominent backcountry families. <br /> <br /> During the American Revolution, Pickens became one of the most significant leaders of patriot forces in the South Carolina backcountry. He initially served as a militia company commander for Ninety Six District and campaigned against loyalists in late 1775. By 1778, he had attained the rank of colonel of the Upper Ninety Six Regiment and had participated in expeditions against the British-allied Cherokees and in the unsuccessful American invasion of British East Florida. Pickens and his militia, together with Georgians under Col. Elijah Clarke, dealt loyalists in the backcountry a severe defeat on February 14, 1779 at Kettle Creek, Georgia. The victory demonstrated the fragile hold the British had on the backcountry. After the surrender of Charleston in May 1780, Pickens took British protection and was paroled to his home. He renounced protection, however, when the British failed to prevent a loyalist band from plundering his plantation. <br /> <br /> At the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781, Pickens commanded South Carolina militia during the decisive victory over Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton's British and loyalist forces. Afterward, Pickens was named a brigadier general by Governor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-rutledge.htm\">John Rutledge</a> and cooperated with General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanael-greene.htm\">Nathanael Greene</a>'s Continental Army as they targeted and captured isolated British posts in the South Carolina interior. Wounded at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September 1781, Pickens recovered to wage two punitive campaigns against the Cherokees in mid-1782. <br /> <br /> After the war, Pickens served as both a legislator and a negotiator with Native American tribes. He represented Ninety Six District in the state House of Representatives from 1776 to 1788 and Pendleton District in the state Senate from 1790 to 1793. He resigned his Senate seat upon his election to the US House of Representatives, where he served from 1793 to 1795. As a legislator, Pickens worked to establish schools, churches, and a legal system for the South Carolina backcountry. A recognized expert on Indian affairs, Pickens served as a federal commissioner to negotiate peace independently with the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Creeks in the late 1780s and eventually negotiated a firm peace with the Treaty of Coleraine in 1796. The following year, he and Benjamin Hawkins surveyed most of the southern boundary line between the United States and the Indian nations. <br /> <br /> Pickens served two more terms in the General Assembly from 1796 to 1799, representing Pendleton District. He retired to his plantation, Tamassee, in 1805, coming out only briefly in 1812 when elected to a final term in the General Assembly to prepare South Carolina for war. He died at his plantation on August 11, 1817. His grandson, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/francis-wilkinson-pickens.htm\">Francis Wilkinson Pickens</a>, was governor of South Carolina from 1860 to 1862, leading the state through secession and the early years of the Civil War.",

            "bodyText": "<p>On 14 December 1849, a group of emigrants from Iowa arrived in California's San Bernardino Valley, exhausted after navigating Cajon Pass. Luckily for them, they stumbled upon the homestead of Isaac Slover and his wife, María Bárbara Aragón Slover, who regularly assisted travelers on the Old Spanish Trail. Isaac opened his smokehouse and supplied the famished travelers with bacon and squashes, a feat of generosity that seems to have been a regular occurrence. New settlers found that the Slovers would help them survive until their own crops had been planted and harvested. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Slover's own history motivated them to be helpful. Born in Pennsylvania, Isaac made his way to Taos in the 1820s, where he met the widow María Bárbara Aragón (and her two children). The Mexican government was beginning to grow weary of outsiders, but Slover's eventual marriage to Aragón, his conversion to Catholicism, and his acceptance of Mexican citizenship provided him with the means to trap and trade freely along the Old Spanish Trail. They relocated to California's San Bernardino Valley in 1837, and--along with other New Mexican emigrants--founded the communities of Agua Mansa and La Placita de los Trujillos in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> In addition to hungry emigrants, established figures like Judge Benjamin Hayes and Captain Jefferson Hunt of the Mormon Battalion visited regularly. Hayes noted that Doña Bárbara’s home was a place that “one first comes to and never leaves without regret”; he also complimented her ability to make “the lightest tortillas, wheat or corn.” When Mormon emigrants entered the San Bernardino valley in 1851, the Slovers sent them two wagons loaded with enough food and supplies to get them through the winter; reportedly, Isaac and Bárbara visited them throughout that winter to look after their well-being. The Mexican-American War eventually disrupted trade and travel over the Old Spanish Trail, but the Slover homestead remained a beacon of hospitality on a restless and ever-changing frontier.<br /> <br /> <em>(Special thanks to University of New Mexico PhD candidate Angela Reinche for compiling this information)</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Quanah Parker was a man of two societies and two centuries: traditional Comanche and white America, 19th century and 20th. He was a respected leader in all of those realms.<br /> <br /> Born around 1848 in the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma, Quanah was the son of Comanche war chief Peta Nocona and his wife Nautda (“Someone Found”), a white woman originally named Cynthia Ann Parker. Cynthia Ann had been kidnapped at age nine during a Comanche raid on her family’s outpost, Fort Parker, located about 40 miles west of present-day Waco, Texas. She grew up as a daughter of the tribe, married Nocona, and gave birth to son Quanah (“Fragrant”), son Pecos (“Peanuts”), and daughter Tot-see-ah (“Prairie Flower”).<br /> <br /> The Comanches aggressively repelled trespass onto their domain, known as the Comancheria (today’s Texas, eastern New Mexico, and parts of Kansas and Oklahoma), attacking Texas towns, clashing with the US Army and Texas Rangers, and periodically shutting down traffic on the Santa Fe Trail. Quanah grew to manhood in that environment, the son of a war leader, in a warlike society, during a time of frequent warfare. He was just 11 years old when Texas Rangers carried off Cynthia Ann and little Prairie Flower, igniting in the boy a hatred of white men. (The rangers reported that they killed Peta Nocona in the same attack, but Comanche historians tell that he died years later from old wounds, still grieving the loss of his wife and daughter.) It is not surprising that, by his early 20s, Quanah emerged as a fearsome figure on the Southern Plains, terrorizing traffic along the Santa Fe Trail and raiding hunters’ camps, settlements, ranches, and homesteads across Texas.<br /> <br /> Forced to surrender to the US Army in 1875, Quanah settled with his people on a reservation in Oklahoma, assumed his mother’s surname, and began helping the Comanche adjust to their new way of life. Quanah Parker became a strong, pragmatic peacetime leader who helped his people learn to farm, encouraged them to speak English, established a tribal school district for their children, and lobbied Congress on their behalf. Parker welcomed new technology – he bought a car and owned one of the first home telephones in Oklahoma – yet held on to his cultural traditions, refusing to give up any of his eight beautiful wives, his magnificent braids, or his peyote religion. With help from Charles Goodnight and other friendly cattlemen that he once had raided, Quanah Parker became a wealthy rancher and built his stately, two-story Star House at Cache, Oklahoma. There he and his wives fed hungry families who thronged their door, and took in several homeless white boys to be reared with their own two dozen children. Parker also entertained many important guests at his Star House tables, paying a white woman to give his wives cooking lessons and hiring a white woman as a house servant.<br /> <br /> Through his hospitality, political activism, and speaking engagements, the one-time war chief emerged as a national celebrity with a reputation for wit, warmth, and generosity. When he died of heart failure in 1911, thousands of mourners, Indian and white, gathered at Star House to pay their respects. Quanah Parker is buried beside his beloved mother, Cynthia Ann, and young sister, Prairie Flower, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.<br />  </p> <h4>The Bank Robbery</h4> <p>Quanah Parker appears in the 1908 silent film, The Bank Robbery, which can be viewed free on YouTube. The near-absence of captions makes it hard to know what’s happening onscreen, and the unsteadiness of the camera and graininess of the film obscure the actors’ facial features. However, Quanah is recognizable late in the film, first at 21:00 minutes (thanks to a caption identifying him as “Juanah Parker”), at 21:27 as one of a group riding toward a Wichita National Forest Game Preserve gateway, and once more at 24:32 during what appears to be a celebration of the capture of the robbers. Wearing a long-sleeved white shirt, a vest, and a high-crowned black hat, Quanah sits tall and straight astride a white horse with a dark spot on its forehead. Watch the entire 25-minute movie to see if you can spot him earlier in the film!<br />  </p> <h4>The Saga of Cynthia Ann</h4> <p>Cynthia Ann Parker was about nine years old in 1836 when Comanche and Kiowa raiders attacked her extended family’s settlement, Fort Parker, killing several adults and taking five captives. The other captives were released for ransom over the next six years, but Cynthia was adopted, renamed Nautda, and reared by Comanche parents. She would have been around 20 years old when she became Peta Nocona’s one and only wife and began a family of her own.<br /> <br /> Young Quanah grieved when Nautda and his sister, Prairie Flower were captured by Texas Rangers during an attack on his band’s camp at Pease River, Texas, in 1860. He did not realize that Nautda was a white woman and would not learn of his mixed heritage until later in life. After being reunited with the Parker family, Cynthia tried repeatedly to return with her daughter to her husband and sons on the Plains but was caught and returned to her guardians each time. Prairie Flower died of pneumonia in 1864, and unhappy Cynthia Ann starved herself to death in 1871. Quanah and Nautda never met again after her capture, but Quanah took her name, cherished her photograph, and grew friendly with his white relatives. Quanah, Cynthia Ann-Nautda, and Prairie Flower today lie at rest on Chief’s Hill at the Fort Sill Cemetery, where their graves can be visited today.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Jacob Stroyer was born into slavery on the Singleton plantation near Columbia, South Carolina in 1849 and lived there until 1863. His father had been taken from Sierra Leone and enslaved when he was just a boy. His mother was born in bondage in South Carolina. As a child, Stroyer helped care for the plantation's horses and mules, which were sold soon after his master's death. He then worked briefly in a carpenter's shop and as a field hand.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, he was sent to Sullivan's Island and Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. According to Stroyer, older enslaved men were “to repair forts, build batteries, mount guns, and arrange them. While the men were engaged at such work, the boys of my age, namely, thirteen, and some older, waited on officers and carried water for the men at work, and in general acted as messengers between different points on the island.” Stroyer, in his 1879 memoir <i>My Life in the South</i>, described his time at Sullivan’s Island in Confederate service as easier than being on the plantation. However, in 1864 he experienced far harder duty at Fort Sumter.<br /> <br /> Stroyer, along with over three hundred other enslaved men, were assigned to Fort Sumter and conveyed there by rowboat from John’s Island. One young slave from Stroyer’s plantation died before even entering the fort, struck by a Parrott shell. The enslaved people faced great danger from Union artillery fire while repairing Fort Sumter. Stroyer estimated that the “mortar and Parrott shells rained alternately upon Fort Sumter every five minutes.” Based on casualty lists compiled from the official records, more than 20 enslaved people died while forcibly working on the fort. Stroyer’s memoir details several incidences of death.<br /> <br /> How did the Confederates keep these enslaved laborers at work in such dangerous conditions? Stroyer provides the answer in his description of Deburgh, the overseer. Stroyer wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">\"God only knows how many negroes he killed in Port (sic) Sumter under the shadow of night. Every one he reached, while forcing the slaves back into working position after they had been scattered by the shells, he would strike on the head with the piece of iron he carried in his hand, and, as his victim fell, would cry out to some other negro, 'Put that fellow in his box,' meaning his coffin.\"</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">In July 1864, Stroyer suffered a wound to his head at Fort Sumter when a mortar shell came down on his shelter. Transported to a hospital for treatment, he never returned to the fort; instead, he returned to the plantation. In 1865, he was freed when Union General William T. Sherman captured Columbia, South Carolina.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Following his release from slavery, Jacob Stroyer attended schools in Columbia and Charleston. He moved to Worcester Massachusetts in 1870, attending Worcester Academy for two years. He later settled in Salem, Massachusetts, and became minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church there.</p>",

He was the second son of a prominent attorney and merchant and spent most of his young life in Columbia, the state capital. At the age of seventeen, James left his college studies for the adventure of fighting in the Mexican-American War.<br /> <br /> After hearing news of the growing hostilities between South Carolina and the federal government, James ended his four-year career in the US Army by resigning his commission. He volunteered as a captain with the South Carolina Artillery in Charleston. During the tense standoff with Fort Sumter, one of his duties was to carry messages between General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/pgt-beauregard.htm\">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, commander of the Confederate forces in Charleston, and Major <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-anderson.htm\">Robert Anderson</a>, US Army commander of Fort Sumter.<br /> <br /> In the early morning darkness of April 12, 1861, Captain <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/stephen-d-lee.htm\">Stephen D. Lee</a> of General Beauregard's staff rowed out to Fort Johnson with orders to attack Fort Sumter. The honor of firing the first shot was offered to former Virginia congressman and Fire-Eater Roger Pryor. Pryor refused, and at 4:30 a.m. Captain George S. James ordered his battery to fire a 10-inch mortar shell, which soared over the harbor and exploded over Fort Sumter, announcing the start of the war.<br /> <br /> After the fall of Fort Sumter, James enlisted and was quickly elected the commander of the 3rd South Carolina Battalion. After service along the South Carolina coast for a year, his battalion was ordered to Richmond, Virginia under Confederate Brigadier General Thomas F. Drayton. They were not seriously engaged until September 1862 when they were ordered to reinforce General D. H. Hill in Maryland during the Battle of South Mountain.<br /> <br /> Late in the evening of September 14, Lieutenant Colonel James was twice warned by his second in command of his vulnerable position, and that death or surrender were inevitable if he persisted in holding his ground, but James ignored the advice. Just as the firing began to cease, Lieutenant Colonel James was pierced through the breast by a minie ball. The thirty-three-year-old James was presumed killed in action.",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Born in Ireland, Peter Parker was the third son of Rear Admiral Christopher Parker and Margaret Nugent. Part of a naval lineage, Parker was the father of Vice-Admiral Christopher Parker, the grandfather of Captain Sir Peter Parker, and the uncle of Admiral Sir George Parker. His grandson and namesake served under Sir George Cockburn in the Chesapeake during the War of 1812 and was mortally wounded on the night of August 30, 1814 when he led a party ashore in Maryland. <br /> <br /> Promoted to commander in 1735, Parker's first significant service came in a squadron under Admiral Edward Vernon in 1739 during the War of Jenkins' Ear. Parker later saw action again during the War of the Austrian Succession, notably in the British defeat at the Battle of Toulon in which a Franco-Spanish fleet broke the British blockade. Promoted to captain in 1747, he next saw significant combat action in the Seven Years' War. Commanding the <em>Bristol</em>, he participated in the invasion of Guadeloupe in May 1759. In the spring of 1761, he participated in the amphibious assault and capture of Belle Île, a French island off the Brittany coast. He retired from active service in 1763 at the end of the war.<br /> <br /> Knighted in 1772, Parker was given command of the <em>Barfleur</em> when he rejoined the service in 1773. In December 1775, Parker commanded a fleet, departing Portsmouth for Cork, Ireland to embark six regiments commanded by Lord Charles Cornwallis, destined for the shores of North Carolina to support loyalists. Learning of the defeat of loyalists at the Battle of Moores Creek Bridge, Parker directed the fleet south to attack Charleston, South Carolina. His relations with General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-clinton.htm\">Henry Clinton</a>, commanding army forces, worsened as the expedition continued. Clinton's comments on the British naval attack on Sullivan's Island explain the difficulties the Royal Navy faced:</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">\"<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The Materials with which Fort Sullivan is constructed form no inconsiderable part of its strength. The Palmetto Tree, of a spongy substance, is usd in framing the Parapet & the interstices fill'd with sand. We have found by experience that this construction will resist the heaviest Fire. -The Passage between Long Island & Sullivan's Island was represented as fordable at Low water, but this representation was founded in a mistake, there remain'd therefore no method of crossing but in Boats under the Fire of the enemys Cannon & breastworks...For any further particulars relative to this affair and for the motives which determin'd the Commodore (Parker) to make the attack in which he knew he could receive no assistance from the army, I must refer you to accounts from other hands - From this account it appears - that it would have been highly imprudent in the Land Forces to have attempted the passage; - That Sr P Parker knew at the time of his making the attack that they did not intend it, and yet had made no preparations to possess himself of the Fort, which otherwise he might have done during the time that the Fire was silencd, and the enemy had abandon'd it.”</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">Parker was wounded in the battle as patriot artillery fire raked the deck of the <em>Bristol.</em> His reputation emerged intact after the defeat as he and Clinton blamed each other for the defeat to their superiors in Britain. Afterwards, he led the fleet north and supported Lord Richard Howe's fleet in the New York campaign and commanded the squadron that convoyed Clinton to Newport, Rhode Island in December 1776.<br /> <br /> As military commander in chief of Jamaica, 1777-81, under Governor Dalling, he protected the prize of Britain's overseas possessions from French attack. Parker ignored Clinton's requests for naval support to protect Mobile and Pensacola against Spanish attack. In 1779, Parker dispatched forces on the Omoa campaign, a mission to capture Spanish treasure ships at a fortress on the Honduran coast. In May 1782, having been succeeded by Rear Admiral Thomas Graves in 1781, Parker left for England aboard the <em>Sandwich</em>, Admiral George Rodney's flagship which carried the defeated French Admiral Comte de Grasse and his officers from the Battle of the Saintes. <br /> <br /> Parker was created a baronet in 1782, served as member of Parliament for Seaford from 1784-6, and was promoted to admiral in 1787. In 1793, he was appointed commander in chief at Portsmouth, a prestigious position in the Royal Navy. He eventually succeeded Lord Howe as Admiral of the Fleet in 1799. Parker's final public service was the chief mourner at Vice Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson's funeral on January 9, 1806. He died at Weymouth Street, London, on December 21, 1811. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A distant cousin to George Washington, William Washington was an officer of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Washington earned a reputation as an effective cavalry commander in the southern theater. After surrendering at Yorktown, Lord Cornwallis commented that \"there could be no more formidable antagonist in a charge, at the head of his cavalry, than Colonel William Washington.\"<br /> <br /> William Washington was born on February 28, 1752 to Bailey and Catherine Washington in Stafford County, Virginia. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, he was elected a captain of Stafford County Minutemen on September 12, 1775, which was integrated into the Third Virginia Regiment in February 1776. The unit was ordered to join the main Army in New York in the late summer of the same year, where Washington led a successful charge against the Hessian artillery at the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776. Wounded in this action, Washington was rewarded with a promotion to the rank of major and assigned to the newly created Fourth Regiment of Continental Light Dragoons upon recovery.<br /> <br /> By the end of 1779, Lieutenant Colonel Washington commanded the Third Regiment of Continental Light Dragoons. While en route to join the besieged patriot army in Charleston, South Carolina, his weakened regiment was assigned to a detachment of light troops, commanded by Brig. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/isaac-huger.htm\">Isaac Huger</a>, outside of the city to reconnoiter and screen against the advancing British army. The British Legion, commanded by the feared Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, surprised and routed the patriots at Monck's Corner on April 14, leaving Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-lincoln.htm\">Benjamin Lincoln</a>'s Continental army in Charleston without a signficant cavalry force. Washington and the surviving troops fled across the Santee River after the engagement and were later defeated at Lenud's Ferry on May 6.<br /> <br /> After refitting in North Carolina, Washington's forces successfully captured Rugeley's Fort near Camden, South Carolina. On January 17, 1781, Washington shone brightest at the Battle of Cowpens by countering and routing the charge of the enemy cavalry. Congress awarded him a silver medal, one of only eleven to be awarded during the war, for his role in the battle. Washington also led his regiment at the Battles of Guilford Courthouse in March and Hobkirk Hill in April. At the Battle of Eutaw Springs, on September 8, 1781, Colonel Washington was severely wounded while leading a charge and was subsequently captured, ending his military service in the war. Military historians have questioned the wisdom of Washington's charge through thick vegetation at the Battle of Eutaw Springs.<br /> <br /> As a prisoner of war, William Washington spent the remainder of the war in Charleston. During the war, he met and married Jane Elliott, acquiring her Sandy Hill plantation, where he lived the life of a lowcountry planter. He had a friendly agricultural relationship with George Washington, sending seeds of local plants to Mount Vernon. He also hosted President Washington during his southern tour in 1791 at his plantation home south of Charleston.<br /> <br /> William Washington pursued public office at the state level after the American Revolution, serving as a representative from 1787 to 1791 and then senator from 1792-1794, and again from 1802-1804 to the state assembly. In 1794, he was appointed to the command of a brigade of the state militia. During anticipated hostilities with France in 1798, he was appointed a brigadier general in the regular Army. After a prolonged illness, Washington died on March 6, 1810.</p>",

When an enemy shot brought down the fort’s flag, Jasper restored the banner while under the fire of the Royal Navy, reattaching it to an artillery sponge staff. President John Rutledge presented him with his personal sword for his bravery and offered him an officer’s commission, which Jasper declined.<br /> <br /> In 1779, he led dangerous guerrilla raids against British pickets and patrols. At least once, he passed through enemy lines by posing as a deserter. During the Franco-American assault on the British defenses of Savannah on October 9, 1779, Jasper received a mortal wound while rescuing one of his regiment’s flags.

            "bodyText": "Arthur Middleton was born on June 26, 1742 at Middleton Place on the Ashley River in St. Andrew's Parish. He was the son of Henry Middleton and Mary Williams. At age twelve, he was sent to England to complete his education, eventually attending St. John's College (Cambridge) before entering the Middle Temple in London for legal training in 1757. He returned to South Carolina in December 1763. On August 19, 1764, he married the wealthy heiress Mary Izard, daughter of Walter Izard, Jr. The marriage produced nine children.<br /> <br /> Possessing financial independence, thanks to the wealth derived from his slaveholding and plantations, Middleton, like other members of the Lowcountry elite, pursued public office. In October 1765 he won a seat in the Commons House of Assembly, where he represented St. Helena's Parish until May 1768. In 1768, he and his wife left for Europe to spend the next three years traveling throughout the Continent, studying literature and arts. When Middleton returned to South Carolina in 1771, he avoided public service to focus on managing his rice plantations. However, as political turmoil with Great Britain reached a crisis point in 1775, his devotion to public service swayed him to reenter the public arena, serving on many revolutionary committees. <br /> <br /> Middleton emerged as a leader within the extreme faction of the local Whigs by organizing and leading raids on royal armories, raising money for the patriot cause, planning for the defense of Charleston, and proposing the confiscation of property belonging to those loyalists who had fled South Carolina. Middleton's work earned him a position on the committee drafting South Carolina's first constitution in February 1776 and election as a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. There Middleton, fearful of a British attack on South Carolina, reluctantly signed the Declaration of Independence. Over the next two years, Middleton helped frame the Articles of Confederation and tried to secure additional military support from Congress for the southern theater. His frustration with Congress led him to return home.<br /> <br /> In March 1778, the General Assembly elected Middleton governor under the state's new constitution. Middleton, however, refused the position, partly because he disagreed with the democratic spirit of the new constitution and partly because he still hoped for some form of reconciliation with Great Britain. Middleton provided assistance in the General Assembly until the siege of Charleston in 1780, when he joined the militia to help defend the capital. When Charleston fell to the British on May 12, Middleton was captured and eventually sent to St. Augustine as a prisoner of war, along with other patriot political leaders. In July 1781, he was exchanged and returned to Philadelphia as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he promoted South Carolina's commercial interests and insanely argued for the execution of British general Lord Cornwallis. <br /> <br /> After his return to South Carolina in 1783, Middleton devoted his energies to repairing his war-ravaged estate. He returned to the General Assembly in 1785 and also served as a trustee of the College of Charleston. Middleton died from an unknown fever on January 1, 1787 and was buried at his plantation, Middleton Place. ",

            "bodyText": "<p align=\"justify\">The fifth son and youngest child of an Irish immigrant and physician, Rutledge was born in 1749 in Charleston, South Carolina. Like Middleton, Lynch, and Heyward, the other South Carolina signers of the Declaration of Independence, as a young man he studied law in England. In 1773, during his first year of practice on his return to Charleston, he won Whig acclaim by obtaining the release of newspaper publisher Thomas Powell, who had been imprisoned by the Crown for printing an article critical of the upper house of the colonial legislature. The next year, Whigs named Rutledge as one of five delegates to the First Continental Congress. He married Henrietta Middleton, his colleague's sister. The Rutledges had three children.<br /> <br /> Rutledge spent his first congressional term in the shadow of the more experienced South Carolina delegates, among them his older brother, John, and his father-in-law, Henry Middleton. During 1775-76, however, both in Congress and in two South Carolina provincial assemblies, his increasing self-confidence and maturity brought him the esteem of his associates. In the latter year, two of the senior South Carolina delegates, Christopher Gadsden and Henry Middleton, retired from Congress and Thomas Lynch, Sr., suffered an incapacitating stroke. Rutledge, his brother absent on state business, found himself the delegation leader.<br /> <br /> On June 7, 1776, when Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed national independence, Rutledge led the moderates in securing a delay in the voting. He knew that independence was inevitable. In March his colony, preceded only by New Hampshire, had adopted a constitution. Moreover, that same month the provincial assembly had empowered its delegates to vote for independence if they so desired. Yet Rutledge firmly believed that the colonies should first confederate and nurture foreign alliances to strengthen themselves for the perilous step they were about to take. When the vote on independence came up on July 1, he refused to yield and South Carolina balloted negatively. But nine of the colonies voted affirmatively. Rutledge, realizing that the resolution would probably carry anyway, proposed that the vote be recast the following day. He persuaded the other South Carolina delegates to submit to the will of the majority for the sake of unanimity, and South Carolina reversed its position.<br /> <br /> Rutledge's last important assignment occurred in September, when he accompanied John Adams and Benjamin Franklin on a vain peace mission to Staten Island to negotiate with British Admiral Lord Richard Howe, who in union with his brother, Gen. William Howe, had been assigned as peace commissioners and vainly tried to resolve the differences between the colonies and the mother country. Two months later, Rutledge departed from Congress in order to resume his law practice in Charleston.<br /> <br /> In 1778, Rutledge accepted a seat in the state legislature and the next year won reelection to Congress, though military duties prevented his attendance. As a militia captain, in February 1779 he took part in Gen. William Moultrie's defeat of the British at Port Royal Island. In May 1780, after the British captured Charleston, Rutledge, as well as Heyward, Middleton, and other patriot politicians became prisoners of war and were imprisoned in St. Augustine, Florida until July 1781.<br /> <br /> From 1782 until 1798, Rutledge sat in the state legislature, which on three occasions designated him as a presidential elector. During this period, his mistrust of unbridled republicanism reinforced his conservatism and brought him into the Federalist Party. In private life he flourished, his wealth increasing through his law practice and investments in plantations. In 1792, his first wife died and he remarried. To crown his achievements, six years later he was elected governor. Early in 1800 at the age of fifty, nearly a year before the end of his term, Rutledge died in office.</p>",

            "bodyText": "“South Carolina is too small for a republic, but too large for an insane asylum.” - James Louis Petigru of Charleston, South Carolina expressed this unpopular opinion as his native state made the radical decision to secede from the Union in December 1860. Famously the last prominent Unionist in Charleston as the populace embraced secession, Petigru expressed remorse for the death of the Constitution and predicted defeat in the resulting civil war.<br /> <br /> Petigru was born near Abbeville on May 10, 1789, the eldest child of William Pettigrew and Louise Gibert. He attended Moses Waddel’s Willington Academy, graduated from South Carolina College in 1809, and taught at Beaufort College while he read law. Admitted to the bar in 182 shortly after changing the spelling of his name, he served as Beaufort District’s solicitor from 1816 to 1822. In 1816 he married Jane Amelia Postell, with whom he had four children.<br /> <br /> In 1819 Petigru moved to Charleston where he became James Hamilton’s law partner. Appointed South Carolina attorney general in 1822, he prosecuted all Charleston District civil and criminal cases and represented the state in appeals courts and federal courts. At times, despite his position as the guarantor of state legal authority, he strove to use federal law on race related issues such as enforcement of South Carolina’s Negro Seaman Act that required free black sailors aboard vessels in Charleston Harbor to be jailed.<br /> <br /> In 1830 Petigru, a leader of the Unionist faction, resigned as attorney general and was elected to the state House of Representatives. Despite defeat in 1832, he remained a major spokesman for his party until the repeal of nullification in 1833. In 1834, arguing for the plaintiff in <i>McCready v. Hunt</i>, he won a state appeals court decision that the nullifier-imposed test oath for all state officials violated South Carolina’s constitutional ban on such oaths. His dedication to the checks and balances in the Constitution derailed his political career in South Carolina.<br /> <br /> Petigru’s prominence after his political career ended derived from his legal career. As adviser to the British Consul Robert Bunch’s campaign to thwart the incarceration of black seamen and when he rescued the free children of George Broad from slavery, he acted both behind the scenes and in court.<br /> <br /> Torn between conflicting allegiances to the Constitution and his native South Carolina, Petigru had an unchanging commitment to justice. His loyalty to a constitutionally defined balance of power never wavered, whether it was defining minority rights from majority incursions or checking legislative excess by judicial action. When Charlestonians filled the streets, celebrating the secession of South Carolina with church bells pealing on December 20, 1860, Petigru asked a passerby wearing a blue secession cockade whether there was a fire.<br /> <br /> “Mr. Petigru, there is no fire; those are the joy bells ringing in honor of the passage of the Ordinance of Secession.”<br /> <br /> “I tell you there is a fire,” responded Petigru; “they have this day set a blazing torch to the temple of constitutional liberty and, please God, we shall have no more peace forever.”<br /> <br /> Petigru backed his Unionist sentiment in the courtroom, moving to block the Confederacy’s acquisition of absentee Carolinians’ property and its requirement that lawyers inform against such owners. Although he criticized the Confederate government, Petigru mourned Confederate battlefield losses, especially those in which young South Carolinians fell.<br /> <br /> “The universal applause that waits on secessionists and secession has not the slightest tendency to shake my conviction that we are on the road to ruin.”<br /> <br /> Petigru died on March 9, 1863 in Charleston, South Carolina. In an impressive tribute, city and state officials as well as Charleston’s Confederate officer corps followed his coffin to St. Michael’s cemetery.",

            "bodyText": "Robert Barnwell Rhett, born in Beaufort, South Carolina (born Robert Barnwell Smith) on December 21, 1800, was a politician, newspaper publisher, and rabid Fire-Eater. He owned the <i>Charleston Mercury</i>, a publication that spread his pro-slavery views and calls for secession.<br /> <br /> Rhett served in the South Carolina legislature from 1826 to 1832. He then became South Carolina’s attorney general through 1837. Most notably, he represented his district in the US House of Representatives from 1837 through 1849. His final public service for the United States of America came in 1850 when he was elected to fill the US Senate seat vacated by the death of John C. Calhoun. Following his public service, he focused his time on the <i>Charleston Mercury </i>and supporting early attempts at secession. <blockquote> <p>“There exists a great mistake...in supposing that the people of the United States are, or ever have been, one people. On the contrary, never did the sun shine on two peoples as thoroughly distinct as the people of the North and...South...Like all great nations of antiquity we are slaveholders and understand free governments. The North does not. They are a people wrapped up in selfishness. They have no idea of free government. Their idea of free government is this, that when three men get together, the two are to rule the one; when five men get together, the three are to rule the other two…” - November 10, 1860</p> </blockquote> Rhett was one of 169 South Carolinians who unanimously voted to secede from the Union on December 20, 1860. Rhett supported the idea of a convention to form a southern confederacy as states began to secede. Ironically, the men who assembled at this convention never supported Rhett’s inclusion in a high place in the new government. As a consolation, Rhett was made chairman of the committee drafting the permanent constitution.<br /> <br /> Differences between the Confederate Constitution and the US Constitution addressed southern grievances causing the Civil War. The right to own slaves in both states and territories was protected. Congress could not pass any law impairing the right to own slaves as property. Neither could it impose a protective tariff or appropriate funds for internal improvements. This constitution limited a president to one six-year term.<br /> <br /> Rhett served a one year term as a member of the Provisional Congress, the only political office he held for the Confederacy. He, like other Fire-Eaters, exemplified the irony of a states' rights inspired movement needing a centralized government. He sharply criticized President Jefferson Davis and his work to create a stronger executive. <br /> <br /> After the war, Rhett settled in Louisiana and died there in 1876. He is interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The eldest of five sons, Nelson was born in Yorktown, Virginia in 1738. At the age of fourteen, he sailed to England to begin his formal education. In 1761, after graduating from Hackney School and Cambridge University, he returned to Virginia to help his father manage his plantation and mercantile business. The next year, Nelson married Lucy Grymes; he and his wife had eleven children.<br /> <br /> In 1764, Nelson became a justice of the peace for York County and entered the House of Burgesses. He served in the house until May 1774, when Governor Lord Dunmore, angered at its protests over the Boston Port Act, dissolved it. Nelson attended three of the Virginia provincial assemblies, where he worked closely with Patrick Henry. The last assembly elected Nelson to the Continental Congress, at which time he resigned his colonelcy in the Virginia militia.<br /> <br /> In Congress, Nelson was outspoken in his desire to sever the bonds with Great Britain. He journeyed to Virginia in the spring of 1776. At a convention held in Williamsburg in May, he introduced and won approval for a resolution recommending national independence, drafted by Edmund Pendleton. Nelson carried it to Philadelphia and presented it to Richard Henry Lee, who redrafted and condensed it into his June 7 resolution. Not long afterward, Nelson's health began to decline. Subsequently, he divided his time between Philadelphia and Virginia, and in the spring of 1777 resigned from Congress.<br /> <br /> Back in Virginia, Nelson was awarded the rank of brigadier general in the militia and was elected to the lower house of the legislature. In the spring of 1778, Congress appealed for assistance in the creation of new troops of light cavalry. Nelson, partially at his own expense, raised, outfitted, and trained such a unit. In July, he marched it northward to Philadelphia. The next month, Congress decided it was not needed, and it returned home.<br /> <br /> Nelson served in Congress again for a short time in 1779, but poor health forced him to retire once more. Nevertheless, the next year he obtained munitions and supplies for the militia, commanded troops, attended the legislature, and raised money to help subsidize the war. He was particularly effective in soliciting funds from wealthy plantation owners, to whom he pledged to repay the loans personally if the state should fail to do so.<br /> <br /> When the British invaded Virginia in 1780-81, civilian control seriously hampered Nelson's effectiveness as a militia commander. Consequently, in the latter year the legislature elected him as Governor and granted him powers approaching those of a military dictator. Although still bothered by bad health, he kept the government intact and strengthened defenses. In September-October 1781, while taking part in the Siege of Yorktown, according to family tradition, he told General Washington to shell his own mansion when he learned it was a British headquarters. Soon after the victory at Yorktown, overwhelmed by the burdens of office and still in poor physical condition, he resigned the governorship.<br /> <br /> After his resignation, Nelson partially retired to Offley Hoo, a modest estate in Hanover County that his father had left him. In financial distress from his wartime sacrifices, Nelson lacked money to renovate his war-damaged Yorktown home, where he had lived since 1767. Except for occasional tours in the legislature and visits to Yorktown, he devoted the rest of his life to his business affairs. He died at Offley Hoo in 1789 at the age of fifty.</p>",

            "bodyText": "William Henry Drayton was born in September 1742 at Drayton Hall in St. Andrew's Parish, near Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of John Drayton, a wealthy planter and member of the Provincial Council, and Charlotta Bull, daughter of Lieutenant Governor William Bull. At the age of ten, he went to England to complete his education, returning home in 1763 at the urging of his father before he finished his degree at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1764, he married Dorothy Golightly, one of the wealthiest heiresses in the colony. Their union produced four children, of whom only Mary and John, a future governor of South Carolina, survived childhood.<br /> <br /> Financially secure and politically well connected, Drayton sought public office. He won a seat in the South Carolina Royal Assembly in 1765 but lost it in the following election. In July 1769, Drayton wrote a polemic in the <em>South Carolina Gazette </em>opposing the popular extralegal nonimportation association, established in defiance of the Townshend Duties, as \"a base, illegal decree\" designed to \"ruin and overthrow our happy constitution.\" The letter started a fiery debate in which nonimportation leaders won, resulting in Drayton's social, economic, and political ostracism. In January 1770, he sailed for England, where he hoped his views would find a receptive audience.<br /> <br /> In England, Drayton was introduced at court as a supporter of the crown's prerogative. To further display his loyalty, Drayton published in 1771 <em>The Letters of Freeman</em>, a compilation of his newspaper articles on the nonimportation debate. His allegiance earned him a position on the Provincial Council in Charleston. However, Drayton's aspiration for additional posts was frustrated when the Ministry appointed Englishmen to numerous offices that Drayton sought for himself. The 1774 passage of the Coercive Acts convinced Drayton that Great Britain threatened American liberty and property. In August, Drayton vented his frustrations with the crown and Parliament in <em>A Letter from Freeman</em>, a pamphlet addressed to the First Continental Congress in which he outlined American rights and proposed reforms of the British Empire that denied Parliament's jurisdiction over the colonies. His change in political allegiance prompted his uncle, William Bull, to suspend him from the Provincial Council in early 1775.<br /> <br /> Drayton's views made him one of the most popular Whigs in the colony. He won a seat in the Provincial Congress in January 1775 and soon after sat on all important revolutionary committees. Drayton used his powers to lead raids against the city's royal post office and armories, thereby obtaining important information regarding the intentions of the British and arms for the patriot forces. During the summer of 1775, Drayton led a five-man commission on a six-week tour of the backcountry to suppress the large number of loyalists in the region. In the face of great odds, Drayton managed to procure a treaty of neutrality from loyalist leaders at a conference in the town of Ninety Six. <br /> <br /> Whig leaders in Charleston rewarded Drayton for his achievement by electing him president of the Provincial Congress. In this role he encouraged the creation of a navy, raising and training troops, and erecting fortifications. Speaking to the Provincial Congress on February 6, 1776, Drayton became the first prominent South Carolinian to openly call for the establishment of a new government and separation from Great Britain. Drayton played a role in drafting the new constitution, which replaced the royal charter, and the new state constitution of 1778. He also vocally called for South Carolina's union with Georgia, which was extremely unpopular in Georgia. In January 1778, Drayton proposed numerous amendments to the Articles of Confederation, which included an alternative plan of confederation augmenting the power of the individual states and protecting southern interests. <br /> <br /> Elected to the Continental Congress in 1778, Drayton opposed all British efforts at reconciliation. He gave strong support to the Continental Army and advocated harsh treatment of Native Americans allied with the British. He served on nearly ninety ad hoc and five standing committees during his seventeen months in Congress. In his spare time, Drayton complied documents for a planned history of the Revolution, a project left unfinished when he died of typhus in Philadelphia on September 3, 1779. Originally interred at Christ Church Cemetery in Philadelphia, his body was returned to his family's ancestral home two hundred years after his death.  ",

Chase wanted the best value for his money. Local brickmakers initially refused Chase’s prices, so he ordered the first shipment of bricks from Mobile. This forced brickmakers in Pensacola to lower prices to compete for contracts.</p>   <p>Chase also ordered items like lime, copper sheeting, and even Venetian blinds, boosting the town’s maritime shipping trade. Tired of relying on faroff banks in New Orleans, he became a founding partner in the Bank of Pensacola. </p>   <p>To build the forts, Chase relied on enslaved tradesmen owned by Underhill & Strong of New Orleans. These men had experience in fort building. Chase added to the workforce by advertising for rented slave labor from the local area. A sudden swelling of enslaved people under Chase’s directive changed the system of slavery in Pensacola. More slaves meant more wealth. Wealth led to a healthy and growing economy.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1577127772250\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1577127772250\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1577127772250\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1577127772250\">In Love with Pensacola</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1577127772250\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1577127772250\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\"> <p>Chase spent 27 years constructing the Pensacola Bay forts. Though born in a northern state, he came to see himself as a southerner. In 1856, Chase resigned from the Army but kept busy growing Pensacola’s economy. Five short years later, the outbreak of the Civil War forced Chase to make a difficult decision. Should he return to his birthplace or align with the place and the people he loved in the Deep South?</p>   <p>Florida looked to Chase to lead the state’s militia in before the outbreak of the Civil War. State leaders tasked him with seizing the navy yard and negotiating the surrender of Union-held Fort Pickens. Chase had no hope of taking Fort Pickens by force because it was impenetrable—exactly as intended when he oversaw its construction 27 years earlier. </p>   <p>Though born in Massachusetts, Chase spent the majority of his life in the South. He planted roots in Pensacola, established his family and business practices in the city, and created a home on the Gulf Coast. The division of states during the Civil War affected Chase in unexpected ways. Chase’s enduring legacy, built in brick and mortar, are a testament to his impressive engineering skills and entrepreneurial spirit.</p> </div> </div> </div>",

            "bodyText": "Stephen D. Lee was born in Charleston, the son of Dr. Thomas Lee, a physician, and Caroline Allison. His family was distantly related to the Lees of Virginia. In 1850, Lee received an appointment to the US Military Academy at West Point where he graduated seventeenth of forty-six in the class of 1854. After seven years of service in artillery and staff positions, he resigned his US Army commission in February 1861 to enter Confederate service. As an aide to Confederate General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/pgt-beauregard.htm\">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, he delivered the ultimatum to evacuate Fort Sumter to Major <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-anderson.htm\">Robert Anderson</a> before the Confederates began their bombardment on April 12, 1861. He was also a member of the party that negotiated the evacuation of Fort Sumter on April 13, 1861. Lee was then elected captain of the artillery battery of the Hampton Legion, but the late delivery of its cannon prevented the battery from traveling with the legion to First Manassas. In autumn, the legion added additional artillery, and Lee was promoted to major. Throughout the spring and summer of 1862, he received additional promotions for his leadership and artillery skills during the Peninula Campaign, the Seven Days' campaign, Second Manassas, and Sharpsburg (Antietam). <br /> <br /> Promoted to brigadier general, Lee was sent west to command artillery as the Confederacy attempted to stop the Union from seizing control of the Mississippi River. He gained a decisive victory over General William T. Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, led an infantry brigade at Champion's Hill, and participated in the failed defense of Vicksburg, where he was captured on July 4, 1863. After being exchanged, he was promoted to major general and placed in command of all cavalry in Mississippi and Tennessee. In July 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general and given Hood's Corps in the Army of Tennessee, then defending Atlanta. His corps fought at Ezra Church, then lost heavily at Jonesboro as Atlanta began to fall. In the subsequent Nashville campaign, Lee suffered a leg wound in December 1864. During his recovery in Columbus, Mississippi, he married Regina Lilly Harrison of that city on February 8, 1865. The couple had only one child. After recovering from his wound, Lee returned to duty in the final battles in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> After the war, Lee returned to Mississippi, where he farmed. In 1878, he was elected to the Mississippi Senate, and two years later he became the first president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (later Mississippi State University). He entered the race for governor in 1890 but withdrew at the request of his board of trustees. In addition to his work at the university, Lee served for ten years as president of the Mississippi Historical Society. In 1889, he was involved in the founding of the United Confederate Veterans organization, and in 1895 he helped to organize the Vicksburg National Military Park Association, serving as its first president. Lee, a prominent Confederate general, took up the battle for memory of the Civil War in these years, helping solidify the Lost Cause and glorifying the short-lived Confederacy. Lee died in Vicksburg in 1908.",

As a hero in the United States’ disability rights movement, Roberts paved the way for people with physical disabilities to access higher education. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Roberts was born in San Mateo in 1939. When he was fourteen, he contracted polio and had to pause his high school studies. After surviving polio, Roberts was left paralyzed in most of his lower body except for several of his fingers. As he recovered, Roberts needed an iron lung or respirator. Because of this medical equipment, Roberts attended his classes by listening in on the telephone. He spent eighteen months receiving treatment until he returned home. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">After returning to his school in person, Roberts realized that many students with disabilities (like himself) faced discrimination. His school refused to allow him to graduate because he was unable to complete the driver’s education and physical education credits. Nonetheless, Roberts successfully petitioned his school to grant him his diploma. His uncertain graduation was only the first of such challenges that Roberts would encounter in school. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Upon graduating from high school, Roberts was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley.[1] Unfortunately, administrators tried to reverse Roberts’ acceptance when they realized that he was quadriplegic. Representatives of the school claimed that the dorms on campus did not have the appropriate equipment or space to accommodate Roberts’ 800-pound iron lung and his wheelchair. Roberts insisted on enrolling in classes, though, and he became the first student at his university to use a wheelchair. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">As an undergraduate student, Roberts created a group called the Rolling Quads. This group of students with disabilities moved into a dorm together. As a club, they pressured UC Berkeley to design more accessible classroom and dorm buildings for students with disabilities. This group grew into the Physically Disabled Students Program, which was the country’s first college organization for students with disabilities. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Physically Disabled Students Program would inspire Roberts to create a community in Berkeley where people with physical disabilities could live as independently as possible. Founded in 1972, this community was the first Center for Independent Living. It served as a model encouraging the movement toward independent living and accessibility in the disabled community. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In 1964, Roberts earned his BA, and he received his MA two years later. While he was accepted as a Ph.D. student, he never completed his degree; however, he taught political science courses at UC Berkeley for six years. Roberts later directed California’s Department of Rehabilitation. He also co-founded the World Institute on Disability, a program that continues to educate students about disability. Since his death, the state of California has memorialized Ed Roberts with a holiday in his honor. Every January 23rd is Ed Roberts Day.<br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">[1] Sather Tower, also known as The Campanile, is a clock and bell tower on the campus of UC Berkeley.

He had been coping with swelling in his lower body and legs, shortness of breath, and a dangerously low immune system. He described experiencing these symptoms since at least 1966. Rayford was reserved and quiet. We may never know the details that Robert hid from his doctors about how he may have come into contact with the virus, or why he felt unsafe sharing this information. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Rayford’s doctors first suspected that he had contracted an exotic illness, but the teenager had never traveled outside of the Midwest, much less outside of the country. Rayford died in 1969. While he had endured many tests, medical professionals remained baffled at his death. The autopsy revealed another confusing clue: small, cancerous tumors throughout his body. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Rayford’s death remained a mystery for years. In the early 1980s, medical professionals started to notice similar cancerous tumors in other patients. These patients, like Rayford, demonstrated low immune systems. These lesions, called Kaposi’s sarcoma, were unusual in young people. During the AIDS epidemic, doctors recognized that young HIV patients were at a greater risk of suffering from these tumors. Connecting the dots, doctors investigated Rayford’s medical records and blood samples. In 1987, researchers found traces of the HIV virus in preserved samples of the teenager’s blood. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">We can ask many questions about Robert Rayford’s death. How did Rayford contract the virus more than a decade before HIV/AIDS was identified and reached epidemic proportions in the 1980s? How many people had suffered and died from the mysterious disease before it was identified? Rayford’s story helps us better understand the complicated history of HIV/AIDS in the United States.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> </span></span></span><br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">[1] The City Hospital Historic District in St. Louis, MO was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 2, 2001.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Works Referenced: </span></span></span></span></span></span></strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">John Crewdson, “Case Shakes Theories of AIDS Origin,” <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> 25 October 1987 </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Al Hunter, “</span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><a href=\"http://weeklyview.net/2014/05/08/robert-rayford-americas-first-aids-victim/\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc\">Robert Rayford: America’s First AIDS Victim,</span></a><span style=\"color:black\">” <i>The Weekly View Community Newspaper, </i>8 May 2014</span></span></span></span>",

            "bodyText": "George Catlett Marshall Jr., American statesman and General of the Army, was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania on December 31, 1880. A graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, Marshall rose to the prestigious positions of Chief of Staff of the US Army during World War II and two cabinet offices under President Truman: Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. Before these incredible achievements, Marshall commanded Fort Moultrie as well as District I of the Civilian Conservation Corps for a brief time.<br /> <br /> Marshall entered the U.S. Army commissioned as a second lieutenant in February 1902. He first saw combat in the largely forgotten Philippine-American War, a failed Filipino independence insurrection. Marshall then spent considerable time stateside, including studies and later instruction at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.<br /> <br /> Marshall served on General John J. Pershing’s staff during World War I, gaining valuable experience in managing wartime relationships with allies. He also assisted planning military operations. Marshall’s WWI service proved an amazing apprenticeship for his role in organizing victory during World War II.<br /> <br /> Marshall spent his years between World War I and World War II rotating through various commands, principally in the United States but also in China. From July to October 1933, Marshall commanded Fort Moultrie where he received his promotion to colonel. His wife, Katherine Tupper Marshall, wrote of Fort Moultrie:<br /> <br /> “Our quarters at Fort Moultrie were not a home, but a hotel. The house had been built by the Coast Artillery in its palmy days, but now the place was in bad repair....Colonel Marshall had his regiment, he was back with the troops - all was well with the world.”<br /> <br /> Marshall particularly enjoyed continuing the work he had started at Fort Screven, his previous post, in the supervision of Civilian Conservation Corps camps. Proud of their work, Marshall seized opportunities to show them off to visitors. In September 1933, he invited officers and sailors from the visiting French cruiser <i>D’Entrecasteaux</i> to the dedication of a CCC camp near Georgetown, South Carolina, named Camp Lafayette in memory of the Frenchman who first landed in America near that spot in 1777.<br /> <br /> “When the cars drove in the camp the band struck up the Marseillaise. George had given a holiday to the surrounding CCC Camps and as far as you could see lines of young American boys and French sailors stood at attention. It was a thrilling sight.”<br /> <br /> Much to their disappointment, Colonel Marshall was quickly reassigned to the Illinois National Guard’s 33rd Division in November 1933. Colonel Marshall even wrote to Chief of Staff of the US Army General MacArthur to cancel the reassignment, describing his satisfaction with his command of Fort Moultrie.<br /> <br /> Marshall’s arguably greatest contribution in a long life of public service was his integral role in organizing victory for the Allies in World War II as Army Chief of Staff. Together with his counterparts in the Navy and Army Air Force, he collaborated with the British to plan and execute military campaigns in Northern Africa, Sicily, Italy, and finally the cross-Channel invasion of France.<br /> <br /> Marshall’s life of public service did not finish with victory over the Axis and the end of World War II. As Secretary of State, he led the American relief effort to rebuild and invest in European recovery. The European Recovery Program is better known as the Marshall Plan. Because of his leadership in this important work, Marshall became the only career US Army officer to ever receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which he was awarded in 1953. Poor health led to his resignation from the State Department, yet President Truman called upon him again as Secretary of Defense during the crisis of the Korean War.<br /> <br /> After resigning as Defense Secretary, Marshall retired to his home, Dodona Manor, in Leesburg, Virginia. He died in 1959 and is interred at Arlington National Cemetery.",

            "bodyText": "John A. Dahlgren was born in Philadelphia in 1809 and joined the Navy as a midshipman in 1826. After many years at sea with the coast survey, he was assigned in 1847 to the Navy’s Ordnance Bureau in Washington, D.C. He was best known for developing a series of heavy cast-iron smoothbore cannons that became known as Dahlgrens. He became head of the Washington Navy Yard in April 1861 and head of the Navy’s Ordnance Bureau in 1862.<br /> <br /> With his promotion to Rear Admiral, Dahlgren assumed command of the US Navy’s South Atlantic Blockading Squadron on July 6, 1863. He directed the naval bombardments of Confederate Batteries Wagner and Gregg in support of the Union Army’s assaults on Morris Island beginning on July 10, 1863 and resulting in the evacuation of Confederate forces from the island on the night of September 6-7, 1863. On the morning of September 7, Dahlgren demanded the surrender of Fort Sumter. When his demand was refused, he ordered an amphibious assault by sailors and marines to take place on the night of September 8-9. The Confederates were ready and waiting, easily defeating the attack and inflicting 127 Union casualties with no losses of their own.<br /> <br /> A similar attack had been planned the same night by Union Army Brigadier General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/quincy-a-gillmore.htm\">Quincy A. Gillmore</a> from Morris Island but was called off when the Army troops spotted the uncoordinated Navy attack failing. Much finger pointing followed the debacle on the Union side for several months. However, Admiral Dahlgren managed to keep his job. Cooperation between Dahlgren and the Union Army remained rocky throughout the ensuing siege period. In March 1864, Dahlgren learned of the death of his son, Colonel Ulric Dahlgren in a cavalry raid on Richmond, Virginia in which his son may have had orders to assassinate President Jefferson Davis and members of the Confederate cabinet. The episode, known as the Dahlgren Affair, is still shrouded in mystery. Dahlgren's eldest son, Charles Bunker Dahlgren, served in the US Navy during the Civil War, participating in the Siege of Vicksburg and also serving under his father in Charleston Harbor. <br /> <br /> In addition to helping seal off Charleston, he aided General William T. Sherman in the capture of Savannah in 1864. With the withdrawal of Confederate forces from Fort Sumter and the Charleston area on the night of February 17, 1865, Admiral Dahlgren was at last able to lead his fleet into Charleston Harbor.<br /> <br /> When he was relieved of the command of the South Pacific Squadron in 1869, a post he held for two years, he returned to the Washington Navy Yard where he served until his death in 1870.",

            "bodyText": "<p>During his time, Sir Francis Drake was known in England as an expert sailor, adventurer, privateer, navigator, and war hero. The Spanish, however, viewed him as an illegal trader of enslaved people and a ruthless pirate.</p> <p>Francis Drake came of age during a time of empire building for England, which trailed the earlier explorations and colonial expansion of its chief rival, Spain. His early years among the ships of the Thames Estuary were marked by the intensely emotional turmoil of the Protestant Reformation, which governed not only Europe's spiritual life, but also its political life.</p> <p>Drake's quest for new lands and riches took him on many voyages across the Atlantic. During his first three trans-Atlantic voyages, he sailed with John Hawkins, his second cousin and the man who is considered to have been the first English slave-trader. In 1568, during the third expedition, Hawkins' fleet was attacked by Spanish warships for engaging in illegal trade in the Caribbean Sea, including trading enslaved people. Hawkins lost four of six ships, and he and Drake narrowly escaped death. This event was a catalyst for Drake's hatred of Spain and preceded the many battles he waged against the Spanish.</p> <p>It was during his fourth trans-Atlantic voyage, in 1572, that Drake is said to have climbed a tree on the Isthmus of Panama and first glimpsed the Pacific. Captivated by this view, he swore to sail an English ship to those waters.</p> <p>Drake made good on this oath when he sailed from Plymouth in 1577 with a fleet of five ships and headed south and west amidst storms and mutiny. Passing through the Straights of Magellan, Drake reached the Pacific in September of 1578, and continued north, seeking the Northwest Passage. As he headed north, he continued striking at ships and ports along the western coast of South America, a significant source of Spain's colonial wealth. His ship, the <em>Golden Hind</em> (which had originally been named the <em>Pelican</em>), was soon filled with gold and silver, chests of rare porcelains from China, spices, and silks.</p> <p>He ultimately gave up his search for the Northwest Passage and is believed to have <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/people_europeanexplorers_francisdrake.htm\">spent six weeks at a \"convenient and fit harbourgh\"</a> in what is now <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/index.htm\">Point Reyes National Seashore</a> in California, repairing the <em>Golden Hind</em> and preparing for a long voyage west across the Pacific.</p> <p>Drake continued across the Pacific to Indonesia and then around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, completing the last leg of \"The Voyage of Circumnavigation\" as he returned to England. The <em>Golden Hind</em>, bulging with treasures from the East Indies, arrived in Plymouth in September of 1580. On April 4, 1581, Queen Elizabeth I knighted Drake onboard the <em>Golden Hind</em> in recognition of this journey.</p> <p>While \"The Voyage of Circumnavigation,\" is one of Drake's most famous maritime exploits, after serving as Mayor of Plymouth and a Member of Parliament in the early 1580s, he returned to sea in 1585 to raid Spanish settlements in the Caribbean. Drake commanded a fleet of about 25 ships and 2,300 men. His most important targets during this expedition were Santo Domingo (in present day Dominican Republic) and Cartagena (in present-day Colombia); from both of those towns he wrung fat ransoms.</p> <p>Having devastated Spanish colonies in the Caribbean through the spring of 1586, Drake set course for England, following the Gulf Stream Current along Florida's east coast. On May 28, his lookout sighted the coastal watchtower of the San Agustín (St. Augustine) settlement (in present-day northeast Florida). Only about 150 soldiers constituted the bulk of the town's population, so Drake's forces were easily able to raid and burn the town. This action should have made clear to the Spanish both the weakness of the struggling colony and the formidable character of the English opponent. Yet, despite both the English and pirates repeatedly harassing the Spanish colony over the next century, the Spanish government was slow in building fortifications to strengthen its control of the area. Construction of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/casa/index.htm\">Castillo de San Marcos</a> to guard the Saint Augustin Inlet didn't begin until 1672, and construction of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/foma/index.htm\">Fort Matanzas</a>, to control Matanzas Inlet, the \"backdoor\" to San Agustín, didn't begin until 1740. Both fortifications are now National Park Service sites.</p> <p>As he continued his voyage home, he also rescued the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/1585voyage.htm\">English military colony that was established on Roanoke Island in 1585</a> at what is now <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fora/index.htm\">Fort Raleigh National Historic Site</a>. Drake arrived at Roanoke in June of 1586 in time to rescue the 115-man military detachment from starvation and impending Algonquian attack, transporting them and their leader, Ralph Lane, back to England.</p> <p>He didn't get to stay home long before he was dispatched by Queen Elizabeth I to lead an attack on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz in 1587. The expedition was a military success, with over one hundred Spanish vessels destroyed or captured and delaying King Philip's plan to launch his armada to invade England by a year. When the Spanish Armada did launch in 1588, Drake, serving as vice admiral in command of the nimble English fleet of warships, was instrumental in the destruction of the mighty Spanish Armada off the coast of England, helping to pave the way for England to become a global superpower and helping Drake secure a reputation as one of the finest sailors in history.</p> <p>However, the defeat of the Spanish Armada was among the last of Drake's successful ventures. An expedition to attack Spain failed in 1589. Six years later, he returned to the Caribbean, where he would suffer two significant defeats.</p> <p>After crossing the Atlantic, Drake passed through a channel between what are now the British Virgin Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands, a channel which now bears his name. And while <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/viis/index.htm\">Virgin Islands National Park</a> on the island of St. John borders the Sir Francis Drake Channel, there is currently no evidence that he set foot on the island of St. John on his way to Puerto Rico, where the Battle of San Juan was fought.</p> <p>On November 22, 1595, Drake encountered the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/saju/learn/historyculture/el-morro.htm\">Castillo San Felipe del Morro</a> (El Morro)—which gained a reputation for being unconquerable and which is now part of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/saju/index.htm\">San Juan National Historic Site</a>—defending the harbor of San Juan. Good fortune was on the side of the Spanish; a miscalculation by Drake, together with the bravery of the defenders of El Morro, led to a totally unexpected defeat for the English.</p> <p>Drake sailed on with his injured fleet to attack the port of Panamá in early January 1596, but was, once again, defeated. A couple weeks later, Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship of dysentery on January 28, 1596, and was buried at sea near Portobelo on the Caribbean coast of Panamá.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Arabella Mason was born April 18, 1810 in Vermont. Her parents were Elijah Mason and his second wife, Lucretia Green (she is believed to be a relative to Nathaniel Greene). She had five siblings: brothers Carnot and John and sisters Parthena and Emeline.  In December 1816, when Arabella was six, her family moved to Hiram, Ohio. Arabella had two years in a district school in Vermont before attending school in Hiram.  Then she studied in Steubenville, Ohio. Arabella became a teacher and taught after she was married. <br /> <br /> In October of 1830, at the age of 20, she married Zeb Rudolph who was a 27- year old gentleman from the area. The couple's first home was a farm north of Garrettsville, Ohio. The couple would have four children together: Lucretia in 1832, John in 1835, Joseph in 1841, and Ellen in 1845. The Rudolph children had a home with stability and comfort, but their parents were not known to show any kind of affection. As an adult, Lucretia would recall the rarity of her mother’s kisses, and could not remember that her father had ever kissed her. Education and religion were very important and they passed that on to their children. <br /> <br /> In 1850, the northern Ohio Disciples of Christ established the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute in Hiram. While her husband played an integral part in founding, building, and funding the school, it was Arabella’s idea and insistence that the family move closer to the school in Hiram so that her children would have the opportunity to be well educated. After 20 years of living on their farm in Garrettsville, the family moved. Eclectic students knew the couple as “Uncle Zeb” and “Aunt Arabella”. They opened their home on Hiram Hill as a boarding house for students and teachers. Their home was often the center of campus life with students calling on friends who stayed there. One of the frequent visitors was James Garfield who renewed his acquaintance with Lucretia (Hiram was the second place their paths crossed).<br /> <br /> Arabella Rudolph died after a lengthy illness on July 13, 1879. James A. Garfield wrote in his diary: “Mother Rudolph knew me, but was evidently nearing the end. She asked [me] to put her in a chair and draw her into the parlor, which I did. We watched over her till near evening, when with great difficulty she made us understand that she wished us to take [her] out of doors. We placed her in a rocking chair and drew her out in the eastern shadow of the house, where she sat for half an hour. She looked with apparent satisfaction over the eastern landscape—doubtless thinking of her first home with her young husband 49 years ago, which lay within the prospect. She closed her eyes and rested with peaceful quiet some time, and then signalled us to take her in. At half-past six she said ‘I am dying’ and in a few moments quietly passed away. All her family were with her, and [she] left to each the perpetual memory of [a] dear, sweet, noble life, which had blessed and elevated all who knew her.” Arabella Mason Rudolph was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Hiram, Ohio. <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Legardeur de Sainte-Pierre started his career in the French colonial regular troops as a teenager and rose through the ranks to the level of captain.  He spoke many American Indian languages and advised the colony on Indian affairs. He was usually stationed at far flung forts and constantly praised for his outstanding actions and intelligence.  At some point he lost an eye. <br /> <br /> In 1753 the French colonial military built two forts to assert their claim over the Ohio River Valley, Fort Presque Isle (Erie, PA) and Fort LeBoeuf (Waterford, PA).  That fall Legardeur de Sainte-Pierre became the commander of Fort LeBoeuf.<br /> <br /> Just a week after he had arrived, a young Virginian came through the snow to the fort. It was George Washington.  When Washington met Legardeur de Sainte- Pierre he was impressed.  He wrote Legardeur de Sainte- Pierre was an “elderly Gentleman, & has much the Air of a Soldier.” He delivered a letter from the governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie, that stated the British claimed the Ohio River Valley and demanding the French leave the area.  <br /> <br /> Legardeur de Sainte-Pierre said he would send the letter to the governor of New France. He also wrote a reply for Washington to convey back to Dinwiddie. It included his polite, but firm reply, “As to the summons you send me to retire [leave], I do not think myself obliged to obey it.” The French were not leaving.  A few days later Washington left for his long journey back.<br /> <br /> As the French and Indian War escalated Legardeur de Sainte-Pierre was called to help fight the British. In the Battle of Lake George on September 8, 1755 he was leading some Canadian militia and hundreds of American Indians when he was killed.  This ended his long and distinguished career.<br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Resources:</strong><br /> For more Information on Legardeur de Sainte Pierre:<br /> http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/legardeur_de_saint_pierre_jacques_3E.html<br /> <br /> For George Washington’s account of his trip to Fort LeBoeuf:<br /> “Journey to the French Commandant: Narrative,” Founders Online, National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/01-01-02-0003-0002<br /> <br /> For more information on Fort LeBoeuf:<br /> http://fortleboeufhistory.com/campus/fort-le-boeuf-forts/<br /> <br />  ",

Like the other Rudolph children, Ellen was very educated for that time, and she attended Western Reserve Eclectic Institute like her siblings before her. It is believed that she could read Greek and Latin text like her sister and that she would continue her education throughout her adult life. While her brothers John and Joseph were off fighting in the Civil War, Ellen assisted her sister with household chores and in raising “Little Trot.” She later became a teacher.<br /> <br /> On November 22, 1866, she married Camden Oren Rockwell. They had three children: Arthur (“Archie”) Clennam in 1868, Bertha Lucretia in 1878, and Ethel Ellen in 1881.<br /> <br /> Like her brother-in-law James A. Garfield, Ellen kept a diary which can still be found in archives today.  During the Civil War, and when their children were young, Lucretia and Ellen relied on each other. They often shared domestic responsibilities—especially at the Rudolph home in Hiram when their mother was ill. <br /> <br /> By 1873, Nellie and her family lived in Akron, Ohio. They moved to St. Louis, Missouri in September 1874 and were living there when James A. Garfield was elected president in 1880.<br /> <br /> In 1925, Ellen’s husband Camden died. She lived her remaining years with her unmarried daughters, Bertha and Ethel. Ellen died on November 16, 1933, in Queens, New York and is buried at South Street Cemetery, Proctor, Vermont with her Rockwell family.</p>",

Not much is known of Joseph's young life - only that he, like his siblings, probably went to district schools, then attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute in Hiram, Ohio.<br /> <br /> Like many young men, including his brother John, Joseph enlisted to fight in the Civil War. On May 18,1861 he enlisted<b>,</b> and<b> </b>started his military career as a private in Company A of the 23rd OVI in early June. The 23rd was in battles such as Carnifax's Ferry in West Virginia while Joseph was a member. He transferred into Company A, 42nd OVI, his brother-in-law James Garfield's regiment, on March 1, 1862. Joseph was promoted to<b> </b>Full Sergeant on September 1,1862, and then Full Captain (Captain & Commissary) on May 28, 1864. He fought with the 42nd OVI at Vicksburg, Mississippi and saw duty in Texas and Louisiana, where he set up warehouses and supply depots for Union brigades.<br /> <br /> After the war, Joseph was an employee in the railway mail service. On December 2, 1873 in Paris, Ohio<b>,</b> 32 year old Joseph married Elizabeth \"Libbie\" Phillips. The couple had two sons<b>:</b> Max in 1876 and Edward \"Ned\" in 1877. Libbie Rudolph died in February of 1878, at the age of 31, and was buried in the Rudolph family plot in Hiram, Ohio's Fairview Cemetery. Joseph wed for a second time to Lide Mason, whom he married in 1879. Like his father Zeb, Joseph and his family moved to the Mentor farm with his sister Lucretia and her family.<br /> <br /> While President Garfield's family lived in the White House, \"Uncle Joe\" along with his father,were in charge of the farm. Joe's family would live on the third floor of the home. Lide Rudolph died in 1926. Uncle Joe was the last of the \"older\" generation to be living in the home<b>.</b> All of Lucretia and James' children had moved to their respective homes with their families. </p> <p>Joe died on January 29, 1934 at the age of 93, and was buried near his first wife Libbie in Hiram's Fairview Cemetery. It was after his death that the Garfield children decided that they needed to do something with the family home. The home and furnishings were donated to the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland and became a<b> </b>museum in 1936. </p>",

            "bodyText": "As a well-off young man Robert Stobo moved to Virginia and set himself up as a merchant.  When Virginia became involved in the conflict with the French over the Ohio River Valley, Stobo enrolled in the Virginia regiment as a major, and commander of one of the regiments.  Journeying to the wilderness to join George Washington at the Great Meadows he traveled in comfort.  He brought a wagon with personal supplies, food and 126 gallons of Madeira wine.  Along with him were ten servant-mechanics, including a hunter and a blacksmith.<br />  <br /> Stobo and fellow commander, Andrew Lewis, led their two regiments, of about 110 men, into the Great Meadows on June 9, 1754.  Three and a half weeks later the French attacked.  After fighting in the rain throughout the day the British decided to surrender.  As part of the surrender agreement the French wanted two hostages, which were to be exchanged for the French soldiers the British had taken hostage after the skirmish on May 28.  Stobo and Jacob Van Braam with either chosen or volunteered.<br /> <br /> The two hostages went with the French to Fort Duquesne.  They were treated very well and had the freedom to move around. Stobo started to learn French. He paid close attention to every detail and determined the fort was weak. A few weeks later, he wrote a letter to the British military telling them everything he knew about life at the fort and drew a map of the fort on the other side. He signed his name and asked an American Indian to smuggle the letter out. <br /> <br /> That fall, the two hostages were moved to Quebec. They still enjoyed much freedom. However, their freedom ended when General Braddock was defeated. In his papers, the French found Stobo’s letter! He had broken the trust of the French and given military secrets to their enemy.  The two hostages were put in jail. When put on trial Stobo admitted writing the letter. He said he thought he had done the right thing sending information to help his country. <br /> <br /> Stobo was found guilty and sentenced to death. News of the verdict was sent to the French king, who needed to verify it before Stobo was executed.  With the help of friends, he escaped twice. Both times, he was recaptured. However, the third time he tried, he got away safely. In disguise, he and eight other people set out in a canoe. <br /> <br /> It took them ten days to paddled two hundred miles down the St. Lawrence River. Then they captured a ship and sailed towards Fortress Louisburg, Nova Scotia. They were shipwrecked in a storm, but shortly afterwards captured two more ships and made it to the fortress where they were welcomed as heroes.   <br /> <br /> Stobo volunteered to return to Quebec and help British General Wolfe with his attack on the city.  He had very valuable information on the French military and on the terrain and was often in conversation with General Wolfe.  Although it can’t be proven many people speculate that it was Stobo who showed the British the small path that lead up onto the plateau just outside the city.  After a one-hour battle Quebec, the capitol of New France, surrendered.  <br /> <br /> However, Stobo wasn’t there to see the spectacular victory. Less than a week before he was sent to deliver an urgent message to the commander-in-chief in North America, Jeffery Amhurst.  <br /> <br /> Five years and eight months after leaving Williamsburg, Virginia he returned.  He was given a glorious welcome and monetary rewards.  Stobo became a Captain in the British Army and witnessed the end of the French and Indian War.  <br /> <br /> Years later disappointment, unrealized ambitions, low pay and ill health caught up with him.  He committed suicide after having been “disordered of the mind” for a while.  <br /> <br /> However during the French and Indian War, his country had benefitted for his valor, tenacity, and loyalty.  He had experienced the most “extraordinary adventures.”<br /> <br /> <strong>For more information:</strong><br /> Alberts, Robert C. “The Fantastic Adventures of Captain Stobo.” American Heritage, August, 1963. https://www.americanheritage.com/fantastic-adventures-captain-stobo#11<br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "(Another common spelling is Tanacharison)<br /> <br /> Tanaghrisson was a Seneca who was chosen by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) to lead the American Indians living in the Ohio River Valley taking up residence there about 1747.  As an influential leader he became involved in the start of the French and Indian War.  <br /> <br /> In the raising conflict between the French and the British he sided with the British. They gave him the title the Half King. As early as 1752, he told the Virginians that they should build a “strong house” at the Forks of the Ohio (Pittsburgh, PA). <br /> <br /> In 1753, when the French began building forts in the region, he sent three messages telling them to leave.  That fall George Washington came to Logstown (Ambridge, PA) where he lived to met with him.  Washington had a letter he was delivering to the French from the governor of Virginia insisting the French abandon their forts.  He was traveling to meet with the French and asked for some American Indians to guide and accompany him.  Tanaghrisson was one of four chiefs who joined Washington.  The party arrived at Fort LeBoeuf on December 11, 1753.  The French commander, Legardeur de Sainte-Pierre, said the French would not leave.<br /> <br /> The next year, on May 27, Tanaghrisson sent a message to Washington in the Great Meadows, where the Virginia regiment was camped.  The messenger told him a party of French soldiers were camped nearby.  The next morning, Washington and the Half King surrounded the French camp.  A fight broke out, but only 15 minutes later the French surrendered.  The Half King saw that the French commander, Ensign Jumonville, was wounded. He went up to him and said, “Thou art not yet dead, my father.” Then he raised his tomahawk and killed him.  This act was a symbol of the Half King’s feelings. He was using Ensign Jumonville as a symbol for all the French and he wanted the French to leave.<br /> <br /> Washington asked the Half King to fight with him at Fort Necessity, however he was skeptical of Washington chances. He decided to leave the area.  Later, he said that the \"French acted as great Cowards and the English as Fools...that he (the Half King) had carried off his Wife and Children, so did other Indians before the Battle begun, because Col. Washington would never listen to them, but was always driving them to fight by his Directions.\" Tanaghrisson moved to central Pennsylvania. <br /> <br /> He moved to central Pennsylvania.  The French wrote that Tanaghrisson had been captured as a child and was probably born Catawba.  The Seneca adopted and raised him.  Before he died in the fall of 1754, he explained his feeling towards the French.  When he was young, during his capture, the French soldiers had “killed, boiled and eaten his father” and he wanted revenge.  <br /> <br /> The French and Indian War was just starting when he died. However, he played a pivotal role in beginning the conflict.   <br /> <br /> For more information:<br /> Wallace, Paul A.

            "bodyText": "<p>Zeb Rudolph was born in Shenandoah, Virginia on February 23, 1803. His parents were John Rudolph and Susan Griffith Rudolph. His family moved from Virginia to a farm one mile north of Garrettsville, Ohio in 1806, and were among the first settlers in the area. Not much is known about his schooling, but it is believed he got his studious disposition from Susan, his mother.<br /> <br /> Like many of the young men of his time, Zeb became a farmer, but also learned the carpenter and joiners trade. What is a joiner? It is a form of carpentry that cuts and fits joints in wood without metal fasteners, screws or nails. Zeb was equally at home behind a plow and at a carpenter’s bench<b>.</b> Zeb’s parents were charter members of the Bethesda Baptist Church and Zeb became a member in 1823, at age 20. He could read both Testaments in the original languages: Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. The Disciples of Christ formally organized in Mantua in January 1827, and six of the nine original members were from the Rudolph family. <br /> <br /> In October of 1830, Zeb married Arabella Mason, daughter of a Hiram pioneer. The couple would have four children together: Lucretia in 1832, John in 1835, Joseph in 1841, and Ellen in 1845. <br /> <br /> On June 12, 1849, representatives of the Disciples of Christ voted to establish an academic institution, and Zeb Rudolph was one of the trustees. He was also in charge of the building committee, overseeing the carpentry, and was one of the workmen himself. They would choose the village of Hiram as the site for the school because the founders considered this area of the Western Reserve to be \"healthful and free of distractions<b>.</b>\" The school opened for the Fall term of 1850.  The Rudolph family moved from their Garrettsville farm to Hiram, closer to the college – at the insistence of Arabella, so that her children would have the opportunity to be well educated.  Many of the students came from the surrounding farms and villages of the Western Reserve. Hiram soon gained a national reputation and students began arriving from other states. It was at this school that Zeb's daughter, Lucretia, would cross paths a second time with her future husband, James A. Garfield. For many years<b>,</b> the Rudolphs would open their home as a sort of boarding house for the students. <br /> <br /> In 1879, Arabella died at the age 69. Zeb moved into the home of his daughter, Lucretia, at her farm in Mentor, Ohio where he would help the family run the farm. He lived in the home until his death on Oct. 20, 1897 at the age of 94. He and his wife Arabella are buried at the Fairview Cemetery in Hiram, Ohio. </p> <p><br />  </p>",

            "bodyText": "Ulysses S. Grant, Jr. was the second child of Ulysses and Julia Grant. He was a practicing lawyer and successful businessman who played an important role in the growth of San Diego, California, during the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Ulysses S. Grant, Jr. was born on July 22, 1852 in Bethel, Ohio. At the time of his birth, Julia Grant had been making her way from New York back to her childhood home in St. Louis (White Haven) after Ulysses S. Grant was ordered to move with the 4th U.S. Infantry to the west coast. While visiting her husband's family in Ohio, she gave birth to Ulysses Jr., who received the nickname \"Buck\" for his birth in the \"Buckeye State.\" Julia Grant described her second child as a very thoughtful and caring spirit: \"Ulysses had a protege [during his childhood], little Johnny S., who, he told me, had no mother, only a big sister, and she did not know how to take care of him. Ulysses took great pleasure in the permission given him to bring Johnny home on cold days and to give him his dinner in the kitchen. He often did such acts of kindness and protection to small boys, courteous and gallant--I could fill a volume with his pretty doings and sayings.\"<br /> <br /> Of his father, Ulysses Jr. recalled that \"his unfailing calmness, his ability to think out every act before making it, and his remarkable memory, are the traits that which stand out most clearly in my memory . . . He was a splendid family man. We all loved him but with that affection was a respect, almost an awe, that nobody else has even commanded from me.\" <br /> <br /> Grant received an elite education during his youth. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy after the American Civil War and then received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1874. He followed these accomplishments by obtaining a law degree from Columbia University two years later. While attending law school, Ulysses Jr. also served as a secretary to his father during the last eighteen months of his presidency. After the conclusion of his father's presidency, Ulysses Jr. established a successful Wall Street law practice in New York City. Anxious to expand his wealth and investments, he became friends with Ferdinand Ward, an investment banker. Ulysses Jr. approached his father and convinced him to join the two men in establishing a new investment banking firm, \"Grant and Ward.\" Ulysses Jr. and his father each invested $100,000 into the new venture, but Ward's financial management and outright fraud bankrupted both men in 1884. <br /> <br /> Grant continued working as a lawyer in New York, but his wife Fannie's ongoing health issues prompted a decision to move to San Diego, California, in 1893. While there he became a successful businessman, real estate speculator, and respected civic leader. In 1895, Ulysses Jr. and Fannie purchased a hotel called the Horton House. Ten years later, Ulysses Jr. torn down this hotel and began construction on a new hotel that was completed in 1910. The U.S. Grant Hotel remains a popular luxury hotel and historic landmark in San Diego today. Politically, Grant Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and remained a staunch member of the Republican Party. Although he largely stayed out of politics, Grant unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1904.<br /> <br /> Grant married Fannie Josephine Chaffee in 1880 and they had five children together. After Fannie's death in 1909, Ulysses Jr. remarried to America Rosa Workman in 1913. The marriage was opposed by much of the Grant family because Workman was 26 years younger than him. Nevertheless the two had a loving marriage until Ulysses S. Grant, Jr. died at the age of 77 after an illness. <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Frederick Dent Grant was the oldest child of Ulysses and Julia Grant. For most of his adult life he served in the U.S. Army and enjoyed a successful career in his own right, attaining the rank of Major General by the time of his death. <br /> <br /> Frederick Grant was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on May 30, 1850. He recalled his early life in several interviews during his later years: \"My first firm memories of my father were at my mother's farm, White Haven, near St. Louis. My father was an industrious and stirring man and he built himself a log cabin there, cutting the trees and hewing them. He had but little help, though I would accompany him sometimes. I watched him split the logs and it was hard, difficult labor. I never saw a man work so diligently.\" Since Frederick was the eldest child, he was treated \"always as if I were already a man.\" He also recalled that \"I, being the oldest, was permitted to accompany [my father] about the farm, and he began to teach me, at an early age, to ride and to swim. I can see myself now, a chubby little chap, sitting on the back of one of the farm horses and holding on for dear life, my father urging me to be brave . . . my father [also] gave me a series of home lessons, instructing me in the evening. He taught me arithmetic, reading and spelling and in the evenings would read aloud to the family. I distinctly remember that one of the periodicals he used to read was from the works of Charles Dickens. My father read stories aloud to us, and I have yet a vivid recollection of \"Little Dorrit\" and other tales. Besides the serial stories, he read Oliver Twist and many books by standard authors.\"<br /> <br /> Grant took an early interest in military affairs and, with the encouragement of his parents, occasionally joined his father on the battlefield during the American Civil War. Frederick was present with his father during the Vicksburg campaign, including the entire 45-day siege of the city. At one point during the campaign Frederick was shot in the leg by a Confederate bullet, although he made a full recovery. Ulysses S. Grant recalled that his son \"caused no anxiety either to me or his mother, who was at home. He looked out for himself and was in every battle of the campaign.\" In late 1863 Frederick became deathly ill with typhoid fever, but was able to make a full recovery. <br /> <br /> Like his father, Frederick Grant was appointed to the U.S. Military Academy. He began his studies in 1866 and finished in 1871 towards the bottom of his class, 37th out of 41 graduates. He was known as a troublemaker and received many demerits while at West Point. During a formal investigation of a hazing incident against underclassmen in 1871, he admitted to knowing about and supporting the prank. There were also rumors that he harassed and made racist comments to James Webster Smith, the first black cadet to attend West Point. Several investigations into the matter were conducted by West Point officials and eventually made their way to President Ulysses S. Grant's desk, but Frederick was never interview or implicated in the scandal. He did state at one point, however, that he believed that the time had not yet arrived for prospective black cadets to attend West Point. <br /> <br /> Grant spent most of his adult life in the U.S. Army and served at posts throughout the United States and abroad. After West Point he spent several years at frontier posts in the West. Away from the military, Grant spent seventeen years in both the private sector and government. From 1889 to 1893, he served as U.S. Minister to Austria-Hungary during Benjamin Harrison's presidency, and from 1895 to 1897 he served as a Commissioner of Police of New York City along with Theodore Roosevelt. With the outbreak of the Spanish American War in April 1898, Grant offered his services back to the U.S. Army and remained there for the rest of his life. Over the next few years he served in Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Texas, Kansas, and Illinois, among other places.<br /> <br /> Grant married Ida Marie Honore in 1874 and they had two children together. Like his father, Frederick Grant was a heavy smoker and died of throat cancer on April 11, 1912 at the age of 61.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Sir William Drummond Stewart was born in 1795, the second son of Scottish nobleman Sir George Stewart. As a young man, he joined the military, participated in combat in the Waterloo campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, and retired from service in 1820 as a captain.</p> <p>Seeking adventure and interested in the American West, Stewart came to America in 1832. In May 1833, Stewart departed from St. Louis, Missouri, with a party of mountain men on their way to the annual Horse Creek Rendezvous in Wyoming. On this journey, Stewart met famed western mountain men and explorers like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bica/learn/historyculture/jim-bridger.htm\">Jim Bridger</a> and Thomas Fitzpatrick. He also met Antoine Clément, a Métis fur trapper and hunter with whom he would share a decade long, on-again-off-again relationship.</p> <p>Stewart remained in the west for the next year. At the rendezvous of 1834, he met American businessman <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanielwyeth.htm\">Nathaniel Wyeth</a>, who was traveling with naturalists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnkirktownsend.htm\">John Kirk Townsend</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomasnuttall.htm\">Thomas Nuttall</a>. Townsend wrote of the encounter on July 2, 1834: \"We were joined at the rendezvous by a Captain Stewart, an English gentleman of noble family, who is travelling for amusement, and in search of adventure.\" Stewart also met the missionaries Daniel and Jason Lee, who had traveled to the Pacific Northwest with the intention of establishing a Christian mission to minister to the Flathead and Nez Perce people.</p> <p>That summer, Stewart traveled west with Wyeth, Townsend, Nuttall, and the Lees, hunting buffalo, sleeping under the stars, and surviving close encounters with grizzly bears. Wyeth, who was himself an experienced traveler in Western North America, was impressed by Stewart. Later that fall, he wrote a letter of introduction on behalf of Stewart that emphasized Stewart's knowledge of the rugged American West.</p> <p>Along the way, the group encountered Thomas McKay, an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company and the son of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/margueritemcloughlin.htm\">Marguerite McLoughlin</a> and her first husband. McKay traveled with them to American Fort Hall in present-day southern Idaho, and from there Stewart and the missionaries continued with McKay on his journey to the Pacific Northwest.</p> <p>On September 2, Stewart and the Lees reached the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Nez Perces, near modern Walla Walla, Washington. Here they were reunited with Wyeth, Townsend, and Nuttall. The two groups traveled separately down the Columbia River - Stewart, Wyeth, and the Lees hired a large barge to travel down the river to The Dalles, while Townsend and Nuttall journeyed by horse.</p> <p>On September 16, they reached Fort Vancouver, where they were welcomed by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/drjohnmcloughlin.htm\">Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin</a>. On their arrival, Jason Lee wrote a description of the fort: \"Arrived at Fort Vancouver at 3 o'clock, found the governor and other gentlemen connected with the fort on shore awaiting our arrival, and conducted us to the fort and gave us food, which was very acceptable, as we had eaten our last for breakfast. We received every attention from these gentlemen. Our baggage was brought and put into a spacious room without consulting us and the room assigned for our use, and we had the pleasure of sleeping again within the walls of a house after a long and fatiguing journey, replete with mercies, deprivations, toil and prosperity. I have been much delighted today in viewing the improvements of the farm, etc. The dinner was very good and served in as good style as in any gentleman's house in the east. Fine muskmelons and water melons and apples were set before us which were, indeed, a luxury after the dry living we have had for some time. After dinner took a turn in the garden and was astonished to find it in such a high state of cultivation. The orchard is young, but the quantity of fruit is so great that many of the branches [would] break if they were not prevented by props.\"</p> <p>On November 18, 1834, McLoughlin mentioned the travelers in his report to his superiors at the Hudson's Bay Company. He wrote: \"Captain Stewart is an Officer of the British army...he says he intends (according to the means of conveyance he may find) to go to Canada or St. Louis on the Mississippi next spring.\"</p> <p>William Drummond Stewart spent the winter of 1834-1835 at the fort. In early February, Stewart joined Hudson's Bay Company fur trader Francis Ermatinger, Fort Vancouver Clerk William Glen Rae, and Wyeth in three heavily-loaded canoes, heading up the Columbia River. The group visited the Hudson Bay Company's Fort Colvile, located in present-day northeastern Washington, and delivered goods at Fort Hall. Then, Stewart continued on to that summer's rendezvous in Wyoming.</p> <p>At the rendezvous of 1835, Stewart was reunited with Clément - who had not joined him on his travels in the Northwest - and the two resumed their relationship. He also met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whmi/learn/historyculture/marcus-biography.htm\">Dr. Marcus Whitman</a> and Reverand Samuel Parker. Stewart provided the missionaries with an update on Lee's settlement on the Willamette River, and offered ideas about where to set up their mission. After the rendezvous, Stewart and Clément traveled east with Whitman, who was on his way to Boston to gather supplies for his mission.</p> <p>Stewart was impressed by Whitman during this trip, and later wrote that he was \"a most excellent man, a curious divine...a most bold operator.\" In 1836, Stewart met Whitman again, this time with his new bride, Narcissa, and Samuel and Eliza Spalding, as the missionaries returned west. For part of their journey, they traveled with Stewart and his partner at the time, Adolph Sillem. In a letter dated June 3, 1836, Narcissa Whitman wrote of her efforts to recreate the kind of society she was accustomed to in the east, and Stewart and Sillem's participation in it: \"There are several gentlemen in the company who are going over the mountains for pleasure. Capt. Steward [<em>sic</em>]...is an Englishman and Mr. Celam [Sillem]. We had a few of them to tea with us last Monday evening, Capt. Fitzpatrick, Stewart, Major Harris, and [Sillem].\" The Whitmans went on to establish a mission near Walla Walla, a site that is now managed by the National Park Service as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whmi/index.htm\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>.</p> <p>Through the 1830s and 40s, Stewart traveled extensively throughout Western America, often with Clément. In the course of his time on the continent, the people he met or traveled with included a host of famous figures - in addition to those mentioned above, he crossed paths with Kit Carson, John James Audubon, Joe Meek, Daniel Boone, artist Alfred Jacob Miller, Benjamin Bonneville, William Clark, and Baptiste Charbonneau, son of Sacagawea.</p> <p>Upon the death of his father and older brother, Stewart inherited his family's estate, becoming the Laird of Grandtully and the Baronet of Murthly and Blair. He lived out his later life at Murthly Castle in Scotland among a vast collection of artifacts he had collected during his American travels, and died in 1871.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong><span class=\"subheading\">Bibliography</span></strong></p> <p>Benneman, William. <em>Men in Eden: William Drummond Stewart and Same-Sex Desire in the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade</em>.

            "bodyText": "Ellen Wrenshall Dent was the mother of Julia Dent Grant and the mother-in-law of Ulysses S. Grant. Little is known about her life except for what her daughter Julia Dent Grant recalled in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em>. <br /> <br /> Ellen Wrenshall was born in England in 1793, but at a young age her family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. According Julia Grant, Ellen was an avid horseback rider who would travel from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia to attend boarding school as a young girl. Ellen met and fell in love with Frederick Dent, a trader who had come from a prosperous Maryland family, while living in Pittsburgh. They married and began raising a family, but moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1819. <br /> <br /> Frederick and Ellen Dent initially lived in St. Louis city but purchased White Haven in 1820 as a summer home in the countryside, twelve miles from the downtown area. By 1827 the Dents had moved to White Haven full time, much to the chagrin of Ellen Dent. \"My mother hated the country and this place especially,\" Julia Grant recalled, \"feeling that all the sacrifices of society and friendship she had made on leaving her eastern home were lost.\" Ellen nevertheless adjusted to life at White Haven. \"Mamma, like my father, was a great reader, fond of poetry and music. She was beautiful, kind, and gentle. She spent much time in reading aloud to us her favorite authors, calling our attention to some passage that pleased or touched her. She loved to hear us sing her favorite old ballads to Emmie [Dent]'s guitar as we sat on the piazza in the summer moonlight,\" according to Julia.<br /> <br /> The Dent family owned upwards of thirty enslaved African Americans, several of whom worked under the close eye of Ellen Dent as they completed the domestic work of cooking at and cleaning White Haven. Ellen \"trusted her servants,\" Julia Grant argued. \"Frequently, Kitty, one of mamma's devoted maids, received her orders and carried them out perfectly.\" <br /> <br /> Ellen Dent's hospitality was well-received by a young Ulysses S. Grant, and the two developed a close relationship. When Grant was first stationed with the 4th U.S. Infantry at nearby Jefferson Barracks in 1843, he made a habit of coming out to White Haven on a weekly basis to visit the Dents for dinner. When Julia returned to White Haven from boarding school in early 1844, she fell in love with Ulysses and, as Grant later recalled, his visits to the home \"became more frequent.\" Ellen also welcomed Ulysses' with open arms when he resigned from the U.S. Army in 1854 to try his hand at farming at White Haven. <br /> <br /> The Grant family's years at White Haven (1854-1859) were marked by struggle and hardship. Ellen Dent nevertheless maintained a strong confidence in her son-in-law's abilities. As political debates about slavery filled the newspapers and the newly-formed Republican Party campaigned on the idea of banning slavery's westward expansion in the summer of 1856, the Grants and Dents sat outside one day to discuss politics. According to Julia Grant, Ellen made a bold prediction: \"My daughters, listen to me. I want to make a prophecy this Sunday afternoon. Remember what I say. That little man [Grant] will fill the highest place in this government. His light is now hid under a bushel, but circumstances will occur, and at no distant day, when his worth and wisdom will be shown and appreciated. He is a philosopher. He is a great statesman . . . I have been sitting on the piazza for the last half hour listening to those men talking without the least enlightenment on this important subject, until Captain Grant, in a few sentences, made the subject so clear and our duty so plain that I pronounce him a statesman and philosopher.\" <br /> <br /> Ellen Dent developed a severe upper respiratory illness in late 1856. Grant wrote to his father on December 28th that \"Mrs. Dent has been at the point of death for the last two weeks, but is now much better and will recover.\" Unfortunately Grant's prediction was incorrect. Ellen Wrenshall Dent passed away on January 14, 1857 at the age of 63 from what was most likely tuberculosis. Nevertheless her \"prophecy\" about her son-in-law's future success became true. <br /> <br />  ",

In 1913, Albright graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and moved to Washington DC to begin working as a clerk for the Secretary of the Interior. Although he worked on park issues right away, his focus became nearly exclusively their issues in 1915. That year he became the assistant of newly hired Stephen Mather. In fact, Mather would not join the department unless Albright agreed to be his assistant in order to “’keep me [Mather] out of jail.’” Together they worked to create a parks bureau that resulted in the creation of the National Park Service (NPS) on August 25, 1916.</p> <p>In 1917 Stephen Mather became seriously ill from what was likely bipolar depression. This made it so Mather was unable to do the duties as director of the newly formed NPS. During a span between 1917 and 1919, Albright served as acting director.</p> <p>After Mather could return, Albright took up the jobs of superintendent of Yellowstone and NPS field director. As superintendent, Albright wanted to make Yellowstone a flagship of the agency and demonstrate how a park would be managed under the new National Park Service. Many of the current agency and park-wide policies and functions have roots with Albright. Two of the functions he helped found were visitor services and park museums. He was also instrumental in achieving the enlarged Grand Teton National Park of today.</p> <p>After Mather suffered a stroke in 1929, Albright became the second director of the NPS. One of his most lasting contributions to the National Park Service was to get all the war department sites placed under NPS control. This solidified the agency’s place as the keeper of both the natural and cultural heritage of the United States of America.</p> <p>In 1933, Albright left the NPS to work for the United States Potash Company. He retired from the company in 1956. Although he went into the private sector, Albright was always interested and involved in the affairs of national parks. He was even awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980 for his involvement with the creation of the NPS. Albright died in 1987.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Abram Garfield was born in Washington D.C. on November 21, 1872. He was named for his grandfather, and usually called Abe. During their boyhood years, Abram shared most experiences with his older brother, Irvin. When they were six and four their mother wrote, “They are passing through that dreaded period of boyhood when the chief joy in living seems to be measured by the discomfort they can occasion to everybody else.”<br /> <br /> Like Irvin, Abe’s early education was a combination of home schooling, tutors, and local schools. He followed his older brothers to St. Paul’s, and graduated from Williams College the same year as Irvin. It was after college that the paths of the two younger Garfield sons diverged.<br /> <br /> Abram studied architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (which his mother called “Technology” in her letters) for three years. While he was there, Lucretia was having a carriage house and windmill built at her Lawnfield estate in Mentor, Ohio. In her letters to Abe, she asked for his advice and shared some of the difficulties she was having completing the project. Abram graduated from MIT in 1896, and then spent a year traveling in Europe.<br /> <br /> On October 14, 1897, Abram Garfield married Sarah “Ray” Granger Williams, daughter of one of the founders of the Sherwin-Williams Company. They lived on Cleveland’s east side, near the Lake Erie shore. The couple had two children—Edward Williams (Ted), born May 17, 1899, and Mary Louise (Polly), born July 5, 1903.<br /> <br /> Also in 1897, Abram formed a partnership with Frank Meade, and they earned a reputation as the premier residential architects and designers in the area. Over the years, the name of the firm changed as partners came and went, but it still exists today as DLR Group/Westlake Reed Leskosky. Abe was an active member of the firm for nearly sixty years.<br /> <br /> Abram Garfield founded the Cleveland School of Architecture and served as its first president from 1924 to 1929. The school became part of Western Reserve University in 1929, and Abe was the vice president until 1941, when he became a trustee.<br /> <br /> In addition to designing fine homes, Abe drew up the plans for the original Babies and Childrens and Maternity Hospital in the University Hospital group; the Bratenahl School; and the Woodhill and Seville homes for the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to the National Council of Fine Arts in 1909. President Coolidge made him a member of the National Commission of Fine Arts in 1925, and President Hoover appointed him to the Committee on Blighted Areas and Slums in 1932. An advocate of city planning, Abe was a member of the Cleveland Planning Commission from 1928 to 1942.<br /> <br /> Abram Garfield’s wife, Ray, died on February 3, 1945. Two years later he remarried; he was 75 years old. His new bride, Helen Matthews, was thirty years his junior. Abram Garfield died at age 85 on October 16, 1958. He is buried in the Williams family plot at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, beside his first wife Sarah “Ray” Williams, and near his father’s monument. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Irvin McDowell Garfield was born in Hiram, Ohio on August 3, 1870, the third son of James and Lucretia Garfield. He was named for Civil War Union General Irvin McDowell, “as a protest against the unjust treatment that that noble man has received from the public,” according to his father. He was usually called Irv. According to his parents, Irvin was the child that always “marched to the beat of his own drummer.\"<br /> <br /> Irvin and his younger brother Abram were home schooled until the fall of 1880. Their father was in the midst of his presidential campaign, older brothers Hal and Jim were in their last year at St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire, and sister Mollie was staying with friends in Cleveland to attend school there. Irvin and Abram had their first school experience at Mentor Village School, just a short walk from the Garfields’ home in Mentor, Ohio. They attended that school until the end of February 1881. The family moved into the White House on March 4, 1881, and all of the Garfield boys were tutored there by a gentleman named Dr. Hawkes. He thought that Irvin and Abram talked too much and spelled and wrote poorly!<br /> <br /> There are many stories of Irvin riding his high-wheeled bicycle indoors, careening down staircases and and through corridors in the Executive Mansion when the weather was bad—stories that as an adult Irvin always denied. He did tell his niece that there was a set of stone steps outside the White House that might have been the scene of some stunts.<br /> <br /> On the morning of July 2, 1881, Irvin and Abram Garfield were on a train carrying them home to Mentor, Ohio for the summer. When the conductors on the train heard that President Garfield had been shot in Washington D.C., they kept the boys from hearing the news. Train stations along the way were alerted and station masters warned travelers and newsboys to keep the news away from the children. When they reached Mentor, it was their Grandpa Zeb who told them about their father. They did not return to Washington, D.C., or see their father alive again.<br /> <br /> Irvin Garfield went to St. Paul’s School in the fall of 1885, and, following in the footsteps of their father and older brothers,graduated from Williams College in 1893. He then attended Harvard Law School, and worked in his brothers’ law firm, Garfield and Garfield, in Cleveland during the summer months of 1894. Irvin graduated and was admitted to the bar in 1896. He practiced law in Boston, specializing in probate, trust, real estate and railway law at the firm of Warren, Garfield, Whiteside and Lawson.<br /> <br /> Irvin achieved distinction in many fields. He was president of the Williams College Alumni Association; a football official at Harvard and other New England colleges; a trustee of Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now part of Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston); a trustee of the Warren Institution for Savings; and chairman of the Lawrence Gas and Electric Company.<br /> <br /> Irvin Garfield married Susan Emmons on October 16, 1906. They had three children—Eleanor, born June 27, 1908; Jane, born May 10, 1910; and Irvin McDowell, Jr., called Mike, who was born January 19, 1913.<br /> <br /> Irvin and Susan lived in Boston, and summered at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where Irv enjoyed golfing. Irvin McDowell Garfield died July 19, 1951, at age 80. He is buried in the Emmons family plot at Oak Grove Cemetery in Falmouth, Massachusetts. His wife Susan was buried beside him in 1953.</p> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Joseph Stanley Brown was born in the slums of Washington, D.C. on August 19, 1858. His grandfather, Nathaniel Stanley, was a fugitive from a British debtors’ prison who changed his name to James Brown when he arrived in Baltimore, Maryland - although his sons and grandsons kept Stanley as a middle name. Joe Brown’s education was in the public schools of Washington, but he taught himself shorthand and the new skill of typewriting, and at the age of 17 got a job as a stenographer for John Wesley Powell, the founder of the U.S. Geological Survey. Powell occasionally “loaned” his young, remarkably capable secretary to his good friend, Congressman James A. Garfield. Joe Brown made his first appearance at the congressman’s home in December 1878. Mollie Garfield was eleven years old.</p> <p> </p> <p>Joe Brown’s work for Congressman Garfield was only occasional until the 1880 presidential campaign, when he was asked to come to Mentor to help with the campaign correspondence. The volume of mail was staggering—the New York Times estimated that 100,000 letters were sent from Mentor between June 1880 and February 1881. During the campaign, Joe Brown became a member of the Garfield family. He shared a room with the older two Garfield sons, Hal and Jim, in the not-yet-finished third floor room Lucretia described as “the boys dormitory.” He celebrated with the family on election night, and returned to Washington with them in February to serve as the president’s private secretary in the White House. Brown was then 22 years old.</p> <p> </p> <p>The position of private secretary to the president then was apparently similar to the current post of chief of staff. Yes, Brown handled the president’s correspondence, but he understood that his main responsibility was “the protection of the president from the public—and I might add, his friends.” Brown was Garfield’s gatekeeper and press liaison. After the president was shot, Brown was apparently the only government officer willing to take responsibility for administrative decisions. His organization and calmness during the assassination crisis won him the respect of political Washington. He stayed at the White House for three months after President Garfield’s death, helping with the transition, but he refused a permanent post in the Chester Arthur administration.</p> <p> </p> <p>At the request of Mrs. Garfield, Joe spent the next two years sorting and arranging the late president’s papers. This was no small task. Altogether, Brown catalogued 29 huge storage crates of papers, which he kept in a secure, fire-proof vault at the Treasury Department. At the same time, Brown corresponded regularly with Lucretia Garfield about the progress he was making on the papers and the possibility of creating a secure storage place for them in Mentor, Ohio. Indeed, during the three years of planning and construction that resulted in the Memorial Library addition to Lawnfield, Brown’s suggestions became more and more detailed and included all areas of design and engineering. He encouraged the installation of gas light and heat, moving the kitchen and laundry, and getting rid of the old well and wood shed at the back of the house. He also included little “items” for Mollie: notes, drawings, and original poems. Hal, Jim, and Joe Brown spent the summer of 1885 working with the contractors on the construction of the addition, and the Memorial Library was completed in May 1886.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the fall of 1885, Joseph Brown went to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University, with the financial support of Lucretia Garfield. He studied geology, a field that had fascinated him since his time working for John Wesley Powell.</p> <p> </p> <p>It was just before Mollie Garfield’s June, 1888 wedding that Joe legally changed his name. The family story is that Lucretia Garfield suggested that Mr. Brown retrieve his grandfather’s long lost name. So the wedding invitation read: “Mrs. James A. Garfield requests the honor of your presence at the marriage of her daughter Mary to Joseph Stanley-Brown.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Joe prospered, as a geologist, railroad executive, and banker, becoming “conspicuously wealthy.” He and Mollie raised a son and two daughters, splitting time between South Pasadena, California and Long Island, New York. Joe died in Pasadena on November 2, 1941, at the age of 83. His remains were cremated and interred in the Garfield Monument at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.</p>",

He grew up in Worcester, New York and would become childhood friends with future wife Eliza Ballou.  Abram intended to marry Mehitabel Ballou, Eliza’s sister. However, when Abram heard she married someone else, he decided to leave New York for the Ohio territory in 1819.  Abram and Eliza crossed paths again in Muskingum County, Ohio where they formed a relationship. They were married in February of 1820 just 3 months later. The newlyweds moved to Newburgh which is Independence, Ohio today.  Abram took several contracts to build portions of the<b> </b>Ohio and Erie Canal in Newcomerstown and Independence, which his son James Abram would work on many years later.<br /> <br /> The Garfields' marriage would bring five children into the world. In 1821, their first child Mehitabel “Hitty” was born, Thomas followed in 1822. Mary and James Ballou would follow in 1824 and 1826 respectively.  Abram, Eliza and their children lived in a log cabin in Ohio’s Western Reserve near Newburgh, which is Independence today. Their youngest child James Ballou died in 1829, and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery in Solon, Ohio. <br /> <br /> After their youngest child's death the family turned to the Disciples of Christ which would become an important factor in James Abram Garfield’s adult life.  On November 19, 1831 the youngest Garfield child was born, James Abram, named after his deceased brother and his father. When James was just a little younger than two years old the family experienced a fire in the forest near their farm. Abram Garfield fought back flames in earnest; he succeeded in saving his farm, but caught a fever and died of what might have been pneumonia on May 8, 1833. In her diary Eliza remarked, “A few minutes before Abram succumbed, he gazed fondly at his brood and gasped out…, ‘Eliza, I have planted four saplings in these woods. I leave them in your care.’”  Eliza would take care of her four children and their farm by herself and was determined to her family together. She sold some of her farm parcel for a log schoolhouse where her children and their cousins, the Boyntons, and children surrounding farms would attend. Abram would die without seeing his children grow up and miss seeing his youngest son become the 20th president of the United States.  Abram Garfield has a gravestone at Roselawn Cemetery alongside his son James Ballou who was buried four years earlier.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0df7e581-ae8e-48fd-b385-a53f99962563}{50}\" paraid=\"890290018\"> </p>",

            "bodyText": "Eliza Ballou was born on September 21, 1801. Her parents were James Ballou and Mehitable Ingalls. Her father was a talented mathematician and clairvoyant, known as “James the Astrologer.” He ran a public house before his sudden death after a fall in his barn in April, 1808. Her mother Mehitable was described as a plucky, red-haired woman and a skillful weaver. Eliza was described as unusually attractive, petite, sprightly, industrious, intelligent, and a tireless spirit of activity.<br /> <br /> Eliza became acquainted with her future husband, Abram Garfield, when asking him for directions. She denied any interest in the “green boy,” but was soon smitten with the strong, handsome man Abram had become. He and her sister Hitty were promised to each other before the Ballou family moved west to Muskingum County, Ohio. After three years Abram would follow, only to find out that Hitty had already married a cousin. Within three months of reuniting, Eliza and Abram were married on February 3, 1820 in Perry Township, OH. They traveled north into Cuyahoga County where Abram farmed. When work began on the Ohio and Erie Canal, Abram obtained a contract to build a section of this great waterway. Eliza prepared meals for all the construction workers and sang songs in the evenings to keep their spirits high. She was known to have a lovely voice and knew many tunes.<br /> <br /> The Garfields had four children in quick succession: Meh<b>i</b>tabel in 1821, Thomas in 1822; Mary in 1824; and James Ballou in 1826. Their youngest, James Ballou, died at the age of two. Eliza was alone with her children one January night in 1829 when young Jimmy was taken with a fever and died in her arms.<br /> <br /> Eliza became quite despondent after losing her youngest child, but she found comfort in her new religion, the Disciples of Christ. When she realized that she was to have another child, she hoped and prayed for a son to take the place of the one she had lost. The new baby was given the name of the son that died, plus his father’s name. James Abram Garfield was born on November 19, 1831, and Eliza knew he was destined to be great and good. The family’s happiness in their new home in Orange Township would be brief. When a forest fire raged nearby, Abram fought bravely to keep the fire away from his home and family. Afterward, he was taken ill with a chill. Before dying, he is reported to have said, “Eliza, I have planted four saplings in these woods. I leave them in your care.” <br /> <br /> Eliza was determined to keep her family together. She sold a portion of her land to pay off debts. Eliza may have had help from her brother-in-law, Amos Boynton. It is uncertain whether Eliza was able to use her talents as a seamstress to earn money for the fatherless family (some sources say she did so). Devoted to her children, she guided them and shaped their lives with affection. Years later, her children would remember the songs she sang and the stories she told. Through her stories of Abram Garfield, she kept his memory alive. She recalled his great strength and his handsome, good looks. And, many of his traits were found in young James. She took pride in his achievements and encouraged him. When James proved to be a clever student, Eliza gave a corner of her property for a schoolhouse to be built in 1835. The Garfield children were joined by their six Boynton cousins and other neighbor children in the little log schoolhouse. <br /> <br /> In 1842, Eliza married a man named Alfred Belding. It has always been a mystery as to what happened to end the marriage. Belding’s petition for divorce stated that Eliza deserted him a year after their marriage and refused his appeals to live with him. Eliza and her son James never spoke of the man or the marriage<b> – </b>and the story never came to light during Garfield’s presidential campaign. But whatever reason Eliza had for leaving Belding, James still felt the anger years later. Shortly before Garfield was inaugurated, he read of Belding’s death and noted it in his diary.<br />  <br /> Eliza was not happy when James went seeking a job sailing the seas. He worked as a driver on the canal, traveling from Cleveland to Pittsburgh. The owner of the canal barge, the Evening Star, was his cousin Amos Letcher. Amos was the son of James’ Aunt Polly, the sister of Abram Garfield. Working the canal was the lowest form of being a sailor. And James didn’t know how to swim! His own account states that he fell into the canal 14 times during the four trips he made<b>!</b> He became ill, suffering from a fever and the ague, and was taken home by another cousin, Charles Garfield - Uncle Thomas’ son.  Eliza nursed James back to health and encouraged him to go to school<b>,</b> rather than return to canal life.<br /> <br /> In 1853, Eliza sold the farm to her brother-in-law, Amos Boynton. After Eliza gave up her home, she would sometimes stay with Hitty or Mary. But more often, she was with James and Lucretia. She wrote glowing letters to nieces and other family about how well taken care of she was, including the mention of a fine fire grate (fireplace) in her room and lovely mahogany furniture. During the campaign of 1880, Eliza told her stories of raising a family in a log cabin to the reporters. The whole country got to know <b>“</b>Grandma Eliza<b>”</b> through the news reports. Eliza was proud to be the first mother to see her son inaugurated in-person. James honored his mother in his first act as the 20<sup>th</sup> President by “leaning over and giving his dear aged Mother a kiss.” Eliza attended all the inaugural activities of the day. Living in the Executive Mansion (White House), too, was an honor. <br /> <br /> While living in the White House, word came at the end of June that Uncle Thomas Garfield and cousin Cordelia Boynton Arnold had been involved in a carriage accident. Their buggy had been struck on the passenger side by a train in Warrensville, Ohio; Uncle Thomas died immediately. Cordelia died of her head injuries a week later. Eliza returned to Ohio from Washington, D.C. for the funerals. She stayed with Hitty in Solon. That is where she learned that an assassin had shot James. He sent her one letter – the only letter he wrote during the days that he lingered. What a devastatingly sad day it was when her beloved son James died on September 19, 1881.<br /> <br /> Eliza continued to live with Lucretia and the children after her son’s death, becoming particularly close with the oldest, Hal. She became ill in the fall of 1887. Lucretia, Hal, and Mollie were in Europe at the time of her death on January 21, 1888 at “Lawnfield” in Mentor, Ohio. James R. sent word that the end was near, but that they should not shorten their trip to come home. Thomas came from Michigan to visit his mother during her illness, and Hitty spent time at “Lawnfield” caring for their mother. Eliza was 86 years old when she died. Her funeral took place in the parlor of the Garfield home<b>,</b> the portrait of her painted by Caroline Ransom at the foot of her casket.<br /> <br /> Eliza was temporarily interred in the Garfield Monument at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio when it was completed in May 1890. She now rests in Roselawn Cemetery, Solon, Ohio, beside her husband, Abram.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Thomas Garfield was the second child born to Abram Garfield and Eliza Ballou Garfield. He was born October 16, 1822 in Newburgh (now Independence), Ohio. By 1831, the Garfield family had grown to include Abram and Eliza and children Mehetable, Thomas, Mary, and James—the future president of the United States. The Garfield siblings did have another brother named James Ballou who was born in 1826 , but died in 1829. Thomas was only ten when his father Abram died on May 8, 1833, leaving him as the man of house.  He worked the family farm alongside his mother Eliza and sister Mehetable. Thomas wanted all of his siblings to attend school while he took care of the farm. At one point in his young life Thomas had a job chopping wood for .25 a cord.  “When I was fifteen years old mother owed $7 on a wool-carding and cloth bill, and I went to work chopping three-foot wood at twenty-five cents a cord to pay it. I worked all winter at those wages, and that is the way I kept the family. Those were hard times…”</p> <p>Thomas was a deeply religious Christian. Joining the Disciples of Christ at the age of 16, he never drank or smoked a day in his life and thought dancing was sin.“If I could have my way, there would not be another drop of liquor sold in this country, or brought into it. I never used tobacco, or tasted liquor in my life, I never bought a cigar, or a glass of liquor, and never went to a circus or a dance. I went to a menagerie once, when a boy, but I did not go into the next tent, where a circus was going on. I never owned a watch, nor had a piece of jewelry. I have always lived a quiet, peaceful life, and have never cared for such things.”</p> <p>He was a staunch Republican but never wanted to be involved in politics. “I am an elder in the congregation of Disciples of Christ at Jamestown, and that is the only office I ever held. I have never sought preferment of any kind, and the township offices that have been offered to me I have always refused.”<br /> <br /> On October 18, 1849 Thomas married Mary Jane Harper, a native of Maine. The couple lived in Solon, Ohio near family until they moved to Michigan. “We sold the farm in Ohio in 1854 and moved to Michigan. I lived three years in Byron Township, this county {Ottawa}, and then went back to Ohio, where I worked around on different farms for ten years. And then I came here to Jamestown Township, Michigan.” One reporter who visited Thomas at his Michigan home wrote, “…I climbed the hilly yard to the front door of a one-story house, built of wide pine boards, nailed upright and unpainted. Through the window of the principal room, which occupied half the house, a spinning wheel, decked with fillets of wool, looked out.”</p> <p>Thomas and Mary Jane moved to Jamestown, Michigan in 1867 and lived there for about ten years before a fire destroyed their house. Thomas wrote of getting financial help from his Congressman brother: “James helped me pay for it, and when our house burned in 1877, he helped me rebuild in return for what I had done for him.” The Michigan home had many pictures on the walls of James A. Garfield and their mother Eliza Ballou Garfield. The Garfields had a son on August 25, 1850 and named him James Abram after his uncle. It was said that the baby had the same high forehead and the same features and form as his well-known uncle.  A second child was born to the couple, born in 1853, a girl named Eliza, after her grandmother. Two years later, on April 26, 1855, their last child, Florence, was born.</p> <p>At the beginning of the Civil War Thomas wanted to enlist but was denied.  “I tried to enlist in the army with James, but they wouldn’t take me.” There is no documentation as to why he was not able to serve, but it is known that he suffered from seizures (epilepsy). Some reports said that James did not visit Michigan but Thomas refuted this by saying “James visited me several times. He was here in 1878, when he spoke in the city on the resumption of a specie payment. He was always so loving, and affectionate when he came to see me.” It wasn’t until after President Garfield was shot that reporters realized that he had a brother and they wanted the chance to interview him. A reporter for the Chicago Inter-Ocean asked Thomas why he had not gone to see his brother after being shot. Thomas’s response was because of the cost of travel, and also because he had been told that nobody would be admitted to see the President. “My sister Mary and I went to Elberon Cottage before he died, but the doctors wouldn’t let us in.” Thomas said this of the experience, “Mary was a good nurse, and James called for her in his sickness, and she was very anxious to go in to nurse him, but the doctors wouldn’t let her. We have always believed he was doctored into death, and if Mary could have taken care of him, he would have lived.” Thomas was 59 years old when President Garfield was shot on July 2, 1881 in Washington, D.C.  <br /> <br /> After the death of the President the whole Garfield family (siblings, mother, wife and children and any other members) traveled to Cleveland for the funeral. The funeral took place on September 26, 1881.   The same reporter who had asked Thomas if he visited the President asked if he had attended the funeral. Thomas Garfield replied saying “Yes, sir, I was gone from the home for three days, and when I reached Cleveland was directed to go to the house of Mrs. Colonel Shelden, where my mother and sister were.” </p> <p>Thomas Garfield’s name was mentioned during the presidential campaigns of 1892 and 1896. People opposing the Republican Party made it known to others that Thomas Garfield was going to be voting against the party he had always supported. This claim was false and angered Thomas, who spoke out in papers against this claim, but because the remarks were so close to the 1892 election results they were not seen by many. In 1897, he made it known before the election that this was again a false claim given from the other side.</p> <p>“If my martyred brother were alive his voice would be heard from ocean to ocean in favor of the Republican party, and its principles, and I shall not prove self a traitor to his memory, and to the people of my country, who placed him in the presidential chair, a position the highest in the gift of the people, I believe the principles he advocated are as true.\"</p> <p>Just as the Garfield family in Ohio suffered loss so too did the Garfields in Michigan. Thomas and Mary Garfield lost their daughter Florence Garfield O’Dell in 1887 at the age of 32. Mary, Thomas’s wife, died January 4, 1900 at the age of 71 from uterine cancer. Thomas Garfield died at the age of 87 on April 12, 1910. He and Mary are interred in the Hanley Cemetery in Jenison, Michigan. His daughter Eliza died in 1910 as well. Son James A. Garfield, named for his presidential uncle, died on May 6, 1926 at the age of 75. <br /> <br /> Thomas helped shape the life of his mother and siblings—including his younger brother James, the future President of the United States—for the better. Thomas and James shared an unbreakable bond all their lives and even President Garfield’s assassination could not break it. Thomas Garfield was known to some as the “forgotten Garfield,” but today he is revered as one of the most important people in the life of the 20th president of the United States.</p>",

She grew up in both Puerto Rico and New York. In the United States, Rodríguez Trías faced discrimination at school because she was Latina. School administrators placed her in less advanced classes despite her good grades and English fluency. Only when a teacher noticed her intelligence was she moved to higher-level classes. <br /> <br /> Her education set her on a path to medicine. She recalled that being a doctor “combined the things I loved the most, science and people.” Rodríguez Trías studied at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan. She became involved with the Puerto Rican independence movement.[1] <img alt=\"Female doctor treating an infant patient.\" data-render=\"1|0|0|0|0|0|0|15|15\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6473315|0|\" src=\"/articles/images/Helen-rodriguez-trias-taking-care-of-a-newborn.jpg\" style=\"float:left;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px;\" title=\"Dr. Rodríguez Trías taking care of a newborn, c. 1963.\" />After graduating in 1960, she completed her residency in pediatrics at University Hospital in San Juan and then began teaching at the medical school there. She also established Puerto Rico’s first infant health clinic. The results of her work were immediate: within three years, infant mortality at the hospital had declined by fifty percent. <br /> <br /> In 1970, Dr. Rodríguez Trías returned to New York and took a job heading the pediatrics department at Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx. The 1970s were a turbulent time for the hospital. It served mostly Black and Latino patients. Community leaders and activists frequently criticized the hospital for public health violations, crumbling facilities, and negligent care. In 1970, a radical Puerto Rican civil rights organization called the Young Lords staged occupations of hospital buildings. They demanded better care for their community. During her tenure, Dr. Rodríguez Trías worked to train her staff on the needs of Puerto Rican community members. She aimed to find points of agreement among the Young Lords and the other groups who had a stake in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Dr. Rodríguez Trías’s work and personal experiences made her pay attention to the ways poverty, inequality, and racism led to poor health. During the 1970s, she brought that understanding to the growing women’s health movement. The women’s health movement had grown from the larger feminist movement of the 1960s. It fought for women’s reproductive rights and to end sexism in healthcare.  <br /> <br /> Dr. Rodríguez Trías first joined the movement in October of 1970, when she attended a conference about abortion rights at Barnard College.[2] With other women of color, she worked to move the mostly white women’s movement toward a broader conversation around social and economic justice. The “important issues,” she remembered, were “about equity…about getting economic power, about ending violence against women.”  <br /> <br /> Dr. Rodríguez Trías pursued a broad vision of women’s health justice. She wanted women to be able to choose when and whether to have children, and to get the best possible care either way. She recognized that this looked different depending on a woman’s race and class.<img alt=\"Dr. Rodríguez Trías speaking at an abortion rights rally, 1970s.\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|225|320|0|15|15\" height=\"320\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6473277|0|\" src=\"/articles/images/273_12.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px;\" title=\"Dr. Rodríguez Trías speaking at an abortion rights rally, 1970s.\" width=\"225\" /> Middle-class white women often had to fight to get the birth control they needed. But many poor Latina and Black women had become victims of sterilization abuse. In Puerto Rico, government programs promoted sterilization as a simple and effective method of birth control. These programs were partly driven by concerns about “population control.” While many women chose the procedure, health authorities pressured many others—especially working-class and poor women—to agree to it or falsely told them that it was reversible. Similar programs targeted poorer Black women and girls in the American South. “While young white middle class women were denied their requests for sterilization, low income women of certain ethnicity were misled or coerced into them,” Dr. Rodríguez Trías explained. She argued that the women’s health movement needed to respond to all of this. To work on these problems, Dr. Rodríguez Trías founded the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse and the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, Dr. Rodríguez Trías worked as medical director of New York State’s AIDS Institute, advocating for women and children with HIV. She co-founded the Women’s Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus of the American Public Health Association (APHA). She later became the first Latina director of the APHA. <br /> <br /> President Bill Clinton awarded Dr. Rodríguez Trías the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001. She died later that year in Santa Cruz, California of complications from cancer. In 2019, New York City announced that it will honor her with a statue installed in St. Mary’s Park in the Bronx, near the site of the old Lincoln Hospital. <br />  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{c8e755e9-36da-48f4-bca2-4c71b9688fac}{248}\" paraid=\"94996106\">Notes </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9e084a21-ee73-4e64-a805-cdbca7ca8eee}{4}\" paraid=\"729121423\">[1] The Tower and Quadrangle at the University of Puerto Rico were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 17, 1984. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9e084a21-ee73-4e64-a805-cdbca7ca8eee}{16}\" paraid=\"1590217414\">[2] Barnard Hall, formerly Students’ Hall, at Barnard College was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 2003. <br />  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{9e084a21-ee73-4e64-a805-cdbca7ca8eee}{30}\" paraid=\"732363203\">Bibliography </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9e084a21-ee73-4e64-a805-cdbca7ca8eee}{34}\" paraid=\"81051517\">“Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias.” Changing the Face of Medicine. U.S. National Library of Medicine.

            "bodyText": "By Patty Pollitzer, NPS Volunteer <br /> <br /> Countless women (and some men) devoted themselves to obtaining the vote for women. Some worked at the national level alongside and inspired by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a>. Maybe they marched in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woman-suffrage-procession1913.htm\">1913 procession down Pennsylvania Avenue </a>in Washington DC. Maybe they <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">held up a banner</a> outside the White House gates in 1917. Many more engaged at the state or local level. We are likely to hear about national organizations like the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/learn/womens-suffrage.htm\">National Woman’s Party</a> (NWP) or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">National American Women’s Suffrage Association</a> (NAWSA), but the country had a patchwork of sometimes loosely affiliated groups in cities, counties, and states campaigning for “equal suffrage.” Members of these groups might set up a booth on the main street of their town and hand out lemonade and suffrage literature.<br /> <br /> That’s how my great aunt, Anita Pollitzer, started her suffrage work in South Carolina for the Equal Suffrage League of Charleston when she was home from college in the summer of 1915. (Her older sisters, Carrie and Mabel, had been supporters of the League since its founding in 1913.) When Anita returned to Teachers College at Columbia University in New York City in the fall of 1915, she marched in the suffrage parade down 5th Avenue. At this point, suffrage was a relatively minor interest for Anita; her focus was really on art. But when Anita was back in Charleston in March 1917, Elsie Hill of the NWP came to town to talk suffrage. Anita and her sisters helped arrange the logistics for Hill’s evening talk. The next morning Elsie Hill told Anita she should work for suffrage at the national level.<sup>[1]</sup> After graduating college and spending a few summers teaching art at the University of Virginia, that’s exactly what Anita did.<br /> <br /> One day in the fall of 1918, Anita took the train from Charlottesville to Washington, D.C. and presented herself to Alice Paul at NWP headquarters. In what appears to be Alice Paul’s usual style, she put Anita to work immediately. In a newspaper article from 1923, Anita recalled that first meeting with Alice Paul. She recounted that Paul asked Anita if she’d had lunch. A somewhat puzzled Anita replied yes. Paul said that was a good thing because she wanted Anita to go immediately to the Capitol and start talking to certain Congressmen.<sup>[2]</sup> Anita apparently did well with that task. A month later she was in Wyoming lobbying on behalf of the NWP, sending letters to Paul recounting “snow miles high” and the “influenza epidemic so bad that it was considered immoral for six women to meet in a parlor.” So she “tramped the automobile roads and papered the trees” with posters.<sup>[3]</sup> <br /> <br /> In January 1919, Anita was in Florida to talk state legislators into passing a resolution urging their U.S. Senators to press for passage of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-nineteenth-amendment.htm\">Susan B. Anthony Amendment</a> in the Senate. This was an NWP tactic — get state legislators to bring pressure for federal action. They’d reverse this approach (from federal politicians toward state legislatures) in the subsequent fight for ratification. It wasn’t just legislators the NWP appealed to as part of their strategy. Anita attended the semi-annual meeting of the South Florida Press Association to get their support for a resolution favoring suffrage. As one newspaper article recounted: “Miss Anita Pollitzer, a pretty captivating girl from Charleston South Carolina mingled freely, but modestly, amongst the editors and charmed all of the with her smiles and vivacity.” The Association passed the resolution for women’s suffrage unanimously.<sup>[4]</sup><br /> <br /> Anita had boundless energy, persistence, and absolute faith in the rectitude of her cause. These qualities made her a formidable force. Toward the end of January 1920, when suffragists wanted the governor of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/washington-state-women-s-history.htm\">Washington state</a> to call a special session of the legislature to vote on ratification the governor tried to duck any meetings with suffragists. But Anita persisted and “finally got an interview with the governor by suddenly corralling him in the lobby of the Willard hotel.”<sup>[5]</sup> It didn’t hurt that her energy, intellect, and conviction were contained in a petite brunette with a ready smile, lilting Southern accent, and gracious charm.<br /> <br /> In March 1920, Anita became Secretary of the legislative committee of the NWP. She was only 25 years old, the youngest of the NWP officers.<sup>[6]</sup> She took part in the NWP’s federal and state strategies. In the Summer of 1920 she was one of the NWP contingent that picketed the Republican convention in Chicago.<sup>[7]</sup> That summer she also met with Democratic presidential nominee Cox and Republican nominee Harding in Ohio.<sup>[8] </sup><br /> <br /> Anita participated in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/womens-suffrage-timeline.htm\">ratification battles</a> in numerous states and employed various tactics. Sometimes she worked from Washington, D.C. The governor of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/south-dakota-women-s-history.htm\">South Dakota</a> was reluctant to call a special session of the legislature to vote on ratification. Anita talked to South Dakota’s U.S. Senator and the Secretary of the Republican Congressional Committee to pressure state legislators to show the governor their support for ratification. South Dakota ratified December 4, 1920. Anita used similar behind the scenes maneuvering to achieve ratification in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wyoming-women-s-history.htm\">Wyoming</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/new-jersey-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">New Jersey</a>.<sup>[9]</sup><br /> <br /> Sometimes, Anita joined NWP members on the ground in the state itself. After Washington became the 35th state to ratify the Amendment on March 22, 1920, the push was on for one remaining state. Attention first turned to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/delaware-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">Delaware</a>. Anita was there with numerous other NWP members.<sup>[10]</sup> Unfortunately, Delaware did not ratify, and eyes turned to Tennessee.<br /> <br /> Sue White led the NWP contingent in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/tennessee-women-s-history.htm\">Tennessee</a>, her home state. Anita was responsible for the eastern part of the state and for Republicans. Concerned about lack of support from Republican legislators she went to see the influential Republican former governor Ben Hooper. Anita spent the day with him and got him to telephone Republican legislators. When he got home at the end of the day Hooper’s wife asked what he’d done that day. He said: “Suffrage that’s all. A little suffragist came into my office this morning and made me do everything except jump through a hoop and if she had asked me I’d have done that too.”<sup>[11]</sup><br /> <br /> The Tennessee Senate approved ratification on August 13 by a wide margin, but there was much doubt about the House. NWP lobbyists worked nearly around the clock, constantly checking in with legislators and comparing notes with each other every few hours. Among the legislators in the eastern part of the state for which Anita was responsible was 24 year-old Harry Burn. Anita had gone to his Republican county chairman and asked if Harry would support ratification. The county chairman had telephoned Harry Burn while Anita was standing there and assured Anita that Burn would support suffrage. When in Nashville, Burn was approached by suffragists and anti-suffragists. He told both of them that he was uncertain. A few days before the vote he told suffragists “I cannot pledge myself but I will do nothing to hurt you.” (Irwin p. 460). On the day of the vote, although wearing a red rose (the flower of the antisuffragists), he again assured them “my vote will never hurt you.”<sup>[12]</sup><br /> <br /> As is well known, Burn voted in favor of tabling ratification, but when the time came to vote on ratification itself, he voted “aye.” Although accounts of the famous vote often cite a letter from Burn’s mother Febb as the reason he voted to ratify the suffrage amendment, I like to think that Anita had something to do with it too.<br /> <br /> After ratification of the 19th Amendment, Anita turned her sights on other aspects of women's social, political, and ecomonic equality. In 1923, the National Woman's Party proposed another amendment to the U.S. Constitution which became known as the Equal Rights Amendment. Anita Pollitzer, like many in the NWP, fought for the ERA for the rest of her life. <br /> <br /> References: <ol> <li> <p>Georgia O'Keefe and Anita Pollitzer, <em>Lovingly, Georgia: The Complete Correspondence of Georgia O'Keefe and Anita Pollitzer</em> ed.

They spent about three years in Germantown, Michigan. The first of their six children, Ellen was born there on February 23, 1846. The Larabees moved back to Ohio in 1848, and lived near the rest of the Garfield family in Solon. One summer, James boarded with Mary and Marenus. His comment about his brother-in-law was that he was a sharp man with a dollar. James said his sister Mary was the best cook in the family.

Because of her support, the NWP was able to launch ambitious campaigns to pass the 19th Amendment, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">protests at the White House </a>which led to arrests and imprisonment for hundreds of women.<br /> <br /> <br /> Belmont initially supported suffrage organizations focused on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/flexing-feminine-muscles-strategies-and-conflicts.htm\">state voting rights</a> like the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She witnessed a rally in London organized by he <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm\">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU), the militant suffrage organization founded by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Inspired by the suffragettes' actions and intensity, Belmont began to favor more confrontational tactics used to secure a federal amendment enfranchising women. She joined the executive committee of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU), formed after <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-burns.htm\">Lucy Burns</a> and Alice Paul <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/dyk-alice-paul-carrie-catt.htm\">broke away</a> from NAWSA in 1914 over personal and philosophical differences. The name of the organization changed to the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916.<br /> <br /> With Belmont's attention came her bountiful resources. She played a significant role in the work of the CU and NWP, She provided money to finance their ambitious campaigns. Her social prominence also won both publicity and respectibility for their efforts, which many considered radical and militant. She often hosted suffrage gatherings at her opulant summer mansion in Newport, Rhode Island known as \"Marble House.\" The house is now on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> After the ratification of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-nineteenth-amendment.htm\">19th Amendment</a> in August 1920, Alva Belmont continued to support the work of the National Woman's Party in the ongoing struggle for women's social, political, and economic equality. Because of her generous patronage, the NWP was able to purchase a permanent headquarters on Capitol Hill. Initially, the NWP bought the Old Brick Capitol, a historic building on First Street, NE. The federal government seized that building through eminent domain and demolished it to build the Supreme Court. With Alva's continued support, the NWP then purchased the grand house at 144 B Street, NE (now Constitution Avenue) which they named the Alva Belmont House in her honor. In 2016, the headquarters was declared a National Monument and became a National Park Service site as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/index.htm\">Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument</a>.",

            "bodyText": "George Davis was born December 26, 1839, in Dunstable, Massachusetts. In 1861 Davis was working as a clerk in a store in Burlington, Vermont when he enlisted in the 1st Vermont Infantry for three months. At the end of its three months the 1st Vermont was mustered out. Now a civilian, Davis returned to his clerk position in Vermont. Davis later enlisted in the 10th Vermont Infantry Regiment and was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant.  <br /> <br /> At the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864, Davis commanded a small Union detachment at Monocacy Junction. His job was to defend the covered bridges across the river, which carried the Georgetown Pike, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Bridge. Davis and his men held their position throughout the day against repeated Confederate assaults.<br />  <br /> Davis recounted his experiences in the battle in a post-war letter:  <blockquote> <p> <em>I was sent to General Wallace’s headquarters for orders, which were to hold the two bridges across the river at all hazards, and prevent the enemy from crossing…I knew nothing of the situation, or plan of battle except as apparent to the eye. The natural advantages of cover and position were in our favor.<br /> <br />  In the early part of the noon attack, the wooden bridge over the Monocacy River was burned without notice to me…I received no orders from any source after the first gun was fired in the morning. Being only a First Lieutenant, it was a new experience to be thus suddenly thrown into such a responsible position, where authority must be used and great risk taken.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Our noble band of Vermonters stood by me till I gave the order to retreat, when we kept together and crossed the railroad bridge, stepping upon the ties, there being no floor. The enemy were at our heels, and before we could get away from the bridge had laid violent hands upon five of my own company close around me and taken them prisoners.</em></p> </blockquote> Davis served with the 10th Vermont through the fall campaign in the Shenandoah Valley and was promoted to captain. While at winter quarters in Petersburg, Virginia, Davis was injured when the log cabin he was in collapsed, and he was discharged from the army and returned home to Vermont. <br /> <br /> On May 27, 1892, George E. Davis received the Medal of Honor for his valiant defense of the bridges at the Battle of Monocacy.  Davis later visited the Monocacy Battlefield with fellow Vermont soldier and Medal of Honor recipient Alexander Scott. Davis died on June 28, 1926, in Bennington, Vermont. ",

            "bodyText": "<h4>A Legacy of Stewardship</h4> <p>One of four children, Nelson was born in Clear Lake, Wisconsin on June 4, 1919 to Mary (Bradt), a nurse and Anton Nelson, a country doctor. Growing up in the north woods of Wisconsin allowed him to foster a deep love of the outdoors. At an early age, he was exposed to the politics of the day by his father, which helped Nelson develop an appreciation for progressive ideals and learn about the role of government in society. He went on to become a lawyer and serve in the Pacific during WWII. Post-war, Nelson was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1948 and held that office for a decade before becoming the Governor of the state. After two terms as Governor, he was elected to the US Senate in 1962 where he served until 1981.</p> <p>In 1969, then US Senator from Wisconsin, Nelson formulated one of the most powerful ideas of the century. While returning from California where he witnessed the devastating effects of an oil spill in Santa Barbara, Nelson was inspired by an article about teach-ins as part of anti-war efforts. He was moved to wonder aloud, “Why not have a nationwide teach-in on the environment?” On April 22, 1970 the first Earth Day was a resounding success, celebrated by 20 million people across the US who came together in their communities to support the environment. The American Heritage Magazine called this first Earth Day “one of the most remarkable happenings in the history of democracy.” <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/npscelebrates/earth-day.htm\">Earth Day</a>, now an annual international event, continues to inspire environmental movements and legislation around the globe. This single day, that became a worldwide phenomenon, is only a fraction of Nelson’s legacy.   </p> <blockquote style=\"background: #f9f7f1;\"> <p>Our goal is not just an environment of clean air and water and scenic beauty. The objective is an environment of decency, quality and mutual respect for all other human beings and all other living creatures.</p> <footer>Gaylord Nelson</footer> </blockquote> <p> Long before the idea of the first Earth Day, this tireless champion of the people and the environment, cultivated a dream to preserve the magical landscape of the Apostle Islands. He sought to safeguard the undeveloped shorelines, red sandstone cliffs, unique landforms, flora, and fauna of this special place. His dedication to the betterment of society through preservation remained throughout his career. </p> <p>This love of the natural environment and concern for the wellness of all through conservation was well received in Washington. Both Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, and President John F. Kennedy recognized the value in developing a national recreation area in the Chequamegon Bay region and traveled to Ashland in 1963, flying over the Apostle Islands as part of a national conservation tour. Years of negotiation, compromise and collaboration came to fruition on September 26, 1970 when President Richard Nixon signed legislation creating the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/index.htm\">Apostle Islands National Lakeshore</a>. The bill included 20 islands and a 12 mile strip of mainland containing the sea caves.</p> <blockquote style=\"background: #f9f7f1;\"> <p>This is a unique collection of islands…..there is not another collection of islands of this significance within the continental boundaries of the United States. I think it is tremendously important that this collection of islands be preserved.</p> <footer>Gaylord Nelson</footer> </blockquote> <p>Through continued diligence and grace, Nelson and others were able to convince the government and public that the islands greatest value lay in their preservation as a wilderness. On December 8, 2004, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/management/wilderness.htm\">Gaylord Nelson Wilderness</a> was created as President George W. Bush signed legislation designating 80% of the land area of the Apostle Island National Lakeshore as <a href=\"https://carhart.wilderness.net/\">Wilderness</a>.</p> <p>The winner of many prestigious awards, his accomplishments and his legacy are perhaps best expressed in The Presidential Medal of Freedom proclamation from President Clinton, which states, ”As the father of Earth Day, he is the grandfather of all that grew out of that event: the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act….” After leaving the Senate in 1981, he continued to work for 14 years on behalf of the people and the environment as counselor for the Wilderness Society. When asked why he continued to work he said only, “Our work’s not done.”</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Moses Cone rose from immigrant roots to become a leading industrialist during America's Gilded Age.<br /> <br /> The story of the Cone family begins with Moses’ father, Herman Kahn, who immigrated to America from Bavaria, Germany in 1846, when he was 17 years old. Herman first settled in Richmond, Virginia, and Americanized his name from Kahn to Cone. After a few years he relocated to Jonesboro, Tennessee, where he opened a retail grocery store. He married Helen Guggenheimer, who, like he, was of German Jewish heritage. The eldest of their thirteen children, Moses, was born in Jonesboro, Tennessee on June 29, 1857. <br /> <br /> In 1870, Herman Cone moved his family to Baltimore, Maryland seeking better economic opportunities following the Civil War. In Baltimore, he opened a wholesale grocery. Moses began his career in his father’s business. Moses and his brother Caesar, worked as travelling salesman for their father, and eventually became partners in the business, H. Cone and Sons.<br /> <br /> Travelling throughout the South for the family business, Moses and Caesar developed strong ties with company stores in the region’s numerous textile mills. In 1891, the brothers started their own business, Cone Export & Commission Company, which sold textile products from smaller, independent southern mills to a wider market. They charged a 5 percent commission on these sales transactions. <br /> <br /> Expanding their textile business further, Moses and Caesar opened Proximity Manufacturing Company in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1895. This cotton mill, which produced denim fabric, was named for its closeness—or proximity—to the raw materials needed for manufacturing cotton textiles, and to the railway lines required for transportation. <br /> <br /> As their business continued to grow, the brothers opened and purchased additional mills, eventually becoming the leading makers of high-quality denim, corduroy, and flannel. During Moses’ lifetime, the brothers’ mills produced one third of the world’s supply of denim fabric, earning Moses the nickname, the “Denim King.”<br /> <br /> Moses Cone married Bertha Lindau on February 15, 1888. Their economic success enabled the couple to develop Flat Top Manor, a country estate located in the cool and healthful air of the mountains in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. It was to become a testament to the wealth and influence attained by Moses Cone and his family.<br /> <br /> Moses’ vision for the estate was influenced by his great regard for the natural landscape. He purchased the first piece of land in Blowing Rock in 1892 and eventually acquired nearly 3,600 acres for his estate. Following the example of other Gilded Age industrialists, Moses sought to build a country refuge where he and Bertha could relax from the stress of their business and reconnect with nature.<br /> <br /> Construction of the family home began in 1899 and was completed in early 1901. While other wealthy men were busy building French-style chateaus and homes reminiscent of European estates, Moses and Bertha modeled their home on the American past, building a relatively modest home in the Beaux-Arts style. It may have been a conscious expression of the couple’s desire to distance themselves from their German Jewish immigrant roots and be seen as “American.”<br /> <br /> Flat Top Manor was a designed as summer home where Moses and Bertha could enjoy the mountains and entertain guests. The couple spent winters in Baltimore, Maryland. The manor house was large compared to most American homes, containing about 14,000 square feet of living space on three floors. Its 23 rooms included 11 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, a billiard room, music room, and library. Shady porches, leaded glass windows, and 11 fireplaces graced the house.<br /> <br /> The house had all the modern amenities available in a rural location in America. This included telephones, a servants’ call system, indoor plumbing with cold and hot running water, a central wood-fired heating system, and a state-of-the-art carbide gas lighting system. Electricity was run to the house in 1927, about 25 years after it was built.<br /> <br /> A staff of African American servants worked for the family inside the house. They included cooks, laundry maids, chambermaids, parlor maids, a butler and in later years a chauffeur. These staff members lived in two cottages located behind the manor house.<br /> <br /> Recreational facilities outside the house included a bowling alley, tennis court, and formal croquet lawn. But the crown jewel of the estate was an extensive system of carriage roads that Moses and Bertha designed. Totaling 25 miles, these roads were used for both the pleasure of the family and for maintaining the large estate. The Cones also built three lakes on their property, which were stocked with bass or trout. The largest was Bass Lake—which is the centerpiece of the beautiful view from the manor house.<br /> <br /> Moses Cone considered himself to be a gentleman farmer. He established agricultural enterprises on the estate in hopes that Flat Top Manor would eventually become financially self sufficient. He directed the planting of commercial apple orchards and maintained herds of sheep and beef cows on the estate. Bertha later established a small dairy operation on the farm. Thirty-two local families who worked in the orchards and farm operations lived in simple cottages scattered around the estate. <br /> <br /> While many land barons kept their estates private, Moses Cone chose to open the grounds of Flat Top Manor to the local community—opening the gates at 8:00 AM each morning and closing them at 6:00 PM each evening. People were welcome to walk or ride horses on the carriage trails and explore his estate, though restrictions were placed on picking flowers or hunting on the property.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Moses and Bertha took a year-long trip around the world. The trip began in Europe and ended in Asia. While on this trip, Moses developed health problems, including chest pains and indigestion. After returning to the United States in 1907, Moses was evaluated at John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and was diagnosed with heart problems.<br /> <br /> Moses died unexpectedly on December 8, 1908 as a result of heart disease. He was just 51 years old. Moses was buried on his estate in the family cemetery, at a site which he had selected during his lifetime.<br /> <br /> Bertha Cone outlived her husband by 39 years. She took over management of Flat Top Manor after his death and proved herself to be a very competent manager of the estate, continuing to fulfill the dreams that Moses had for his beloved Flat Top Manor. During this time, she also received an annual income based on her husband’s co-ownership of the Cone business.<br /> <br /> Flat Top Manor remained Bertha’s summer home for the remainder of her life. She was often joined by her two sisters, Clementine and Sophie, and other family members during her summers at the estate.<br /> <br /> Bertha died at Flat Top Manor on June 8, 1947 at the age of 89. The couple had no children, so in accordance with an indenture made by the family in 1911, funds from the estate were used to build the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital in Greensboro, North Carolina, home to the family's textile mills. Construction of the hospital began in 1949 and the facility opened to the public in 1953.<br /> <br /> Ownership of Flat Top Manor was also transferred to the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, which was charged with operating the estate as a “public pleasuring ground”--essentially a free public park. Shortly thereafter, the hospital donated Flat Top Manor to the National Park Service to become a part of the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> Today Flat Top Manor is preserved as the Moses H. Cone Memorial Park. You can visit Flat Top Manor, located near Blowing Rock, NC, at Milepost 294 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. </p>",

It was his work that guided the initial exploration and design of the parkway.<br /> <br /> He trekked the ridgelines of the Blue Ridge to find the optimum route. It is Browning who made the recommendations to Stanley Abbott and to the engineers regarding the geography and the view-sheds. He was called to Washington, where he presented a persuasive argument to Harold Ickes for what became the route of the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> Browning's maps were given to the Secretary of the Interior in 1934 in preparation for Parkway planning . These maps were the catalyst for the acceptance of the Blue Ridge Parkway plan.<br /> <br /> Later, in one of the many trips to western North Carolina made by Ickes and by Arno Cammerer, his assistant, it was Browning who was called on to escort the dignitaries on planned trips to the Blue Ridge Parkway construction sites and to the surrounding mountains. Browning knew his western North Carolina geography, as he had spent countless hours walking the route that would later become the parkway. <br /> <br /> A native of Maryland, Getty started his career as a surveyor. He worked in West Virginia as a bridge surveyor and for the railroad. He them moved back to Maryland to work for the Maryland Roads Commission, which was based in Baltimore. He moved to North Carolina in 1920 to work for the newly formed Highway Commission for the state, and stayed for the remainder of his career. He became the chief location and claim engineer for the North Carolina Commission and was responsible for many highways within the state, including the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> A resident of Durham, North Carolina, Browning moved to Raleigh in 1925 when he was promoted to the position of director of the Location and Right of Way department for the Highway Commission. He was a significant contributor to the war effort and was charged to assist the Navy in development of a large munitions plant. He also played a key role in the production of tankers used in the war effort.<br /> <br /> As you travel the Blue Ridge Parkway, stop at Milepost 451.2, to view a plaque that honors Browning and his work on the Blue Ridge. Near the city of Waynesville, North Carolina, a high peak of some 6,000 feet, called is Browning Knob, is named for the indefatigable mountain lover, R. Getty Browning.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Frederick Fayette Dent was the father of Julia Dent Grant, father-in-law of Ulysses S. Grant, and the owner of the White Haven estate in St. Louis, Missouri for more than forty years. Born on October 6, 1787 in Cumberland, Maryland, Dent grew up in a wealthy family that owned several slave plantations throughout Maryland. When his father died in 1802, Dent moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he became a trader and businessman. He specialized in the fur trade with various Indian tribes between St. Louis and Pittsburgh, including the Sauk and Meskwaki (Fox) tribes. Dent also served as a non-commissioned officer in the War of 1812 and fought in the Battle of Bladensburg. <br /> <br /> After meeting his wife Ellen and starting a family, the Dents moved to St. Louis by 1819. Frederick Dent became a successful merchant and land speculator. The Dents originally rented a city home but soon accumulated enough money to purchase a second home twelve miles away in the St. Louis countryside the following year. Frederick Dent called this country home \"White Haven,\" after one of his family's plantations in Maryland. As his wealth grew, Dent added land and purchased enslaved laborers to work the property. By 1830 White Haven was 850 acres and worked by eighteen enslaved African Americans (this number would increase to thirty by 1850). Signifiying his desired status as a Southern gentleman, Dent refered to himself as \"Colonel,\" although he never held this rank during the War of 1812.  <br /> <br /> Frederick and Ellen Dent had seven children who lived to adulthood and grew up at White Haven. A son, Frederick T. Dent, Jr., received an appointment to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. During Fred's last year at West Point, he became roommates with fellow cadet Ulysses S. Grant. The two became close friends, and upon graduation in 1843 Grant was stationed at Jefferson Barracks, a military post five miles south of White Haven. Ulysses was invited to visit White Haven and soon became a regular visitor to the home. In February 1844 Grant met Fred's sister, Julia Dent, and the two quickly fell in love. Colonel Dent was initiatlly skeptical of the arrangement. He loved Julia's company and believed she was not prepared to be a soldier's wife. According to Julia, there was even one point when her father suggested that Ulysses be married to another daughter, Nellie Dent, rather than herself. Ulysses and Julia initially kept their engagement a secret, but Colonel Dent finally gave approval for the marriage a year later in 1845. Following the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, Dent helped arrange Ulysses and Julia's wedding at his home in downtown St. Louis. <br /> <br /> Frederick Dent's status as a wealthy slaveholder influenced his political views. He was a strong supporter of President Andrew Jackson and friends with William Clark and Thomas Hart Benton, two of Missouri's most popular proslavery politicians. He also served on the finance committee of the St. Louis Anti-Abolitionist Society. This organization formed in 1846 to convince the Missouri State Legislature to pass stronger laws protecting the rights of slaveholders in the state. Dent was known within the family circle for avidly reading newspapers and discussing politics in the White Haven dining room. When Ulysses S. Grant lived at White Haven from 1854 to 1859, the two regularly discussed slavery and the possiblity of civil war in the United States.<br /> <br /> About a month after the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, Grant came to visit Colonel Dent at White Haven while mustering troops in nearby Belleville, Illinois. Ulysses reported to Julia that her father supported the Union, but was also opposed to any efforts by the federal government to prevent a southern state from joining the Confederacy. \"Your father . . . is really what I would call a secessionist,\" according to Grant. As the Civil War continued, Colonel Dent refused to take a loyalty oath and argued to Julia that secession was constitutional. <br /> <br /> Frederick Dent was financially ruined by the end of the Civil War. The remaining enslaved laborers ran away from White Haven in 1864 and past debts caught up to him. A stroke shortly after the war also affected his health. By 1866 Colonel Dent moved to Washington, D.C. When his now-famous son-in-law took the oath of office to become 18th President of the United States in 1869, Dent moved into the White House with the Grants to live out his remaining years. He died at the White House on December 15, 1873 at the age of 86. ",

            "bodyText": "William Jones was an enslaved man owned by Ulysses S. Grant for a period of time in the late 1850s. On March 29, 1859, Grant went to the St. Louis Courthouse and wrote a manumission paper legally freeing Jones from slavery. Jones is the last enslaved person to have been owned by a U.S. President. <br /> <br /> A lack of documentation makes it difficult to trace most of Jones's life experiences. According to his manumission paper, Jones was born around 1824, five foot seven in height, and of mulatto complexion (a nineteenth century term for someone who is of mixed black and white ancestry). For a number of years he lived and worked on the White Haven plantation in St. Louis, Missouri, which was owned by Grant's father-in-law, Frederick F. Dent. Grant purchased Jones from his father-in-law while working as a farmer at White Haven (1854-1859). The exact date of this purchase is unknown. Jones may have assisted in the construction of Grant's log cabin on the property, \"Hardscrabble,\" and most likely worked on eighty acres of White Haven land that was managed by Grant and cultivated for fruit and vegtable crops. <br /> <br /> After continued setbacks and financial struggles at White Haven, Grant gave up farming and moved to downtown St. Louis in early 1859 to work in real estate. Had Grant chosen to do so, he could have sold Jones for a profit of $1,000 to $1,500 (more than $43,000 in 2020 dollars) to a prospective slaveholder in St. Louis. Instead, he chose to give Jones his freedom. <br /> <br /> Park staff at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site are currently working to learn more about Jones's whereabouts after he received his freedom. Two possible theories exist at this time. The first is that he may have remained in St. Louis. A St. Louis City Directory for 1860 includes a listing for a \"William Jones (Col'd)\" who was living with five other free people of color in an outbuilding along the city riverfront. The listing also states that this person was working as a horse driver. The second theory is that he may have moved to California. George W. Dent, a brother-in-law of Ulysses S. Grant, moved to that state in the early 1850s and brought along Henrietta, an enslaved woman at White Haven (even though slavery was banned in California). Grant's wife Julia recalled later in life that while traveling through San Francisco in 1879, she was called upon by a Henrietta Jones who remembered Julia from their days together at White Haven. The \"Jones\" surname has led to speculation that Henrietta may have been married to William. Alternatively, the similar surname could have represented a sibling or other familial relation between the two, or Henrietta's marriage to a different person with the last name of Jones. Regardless, these theories remain purely speculative at this time. <br /> <br />  ",

Earle Bowden.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Known as the Father of Gulf Islands National Seashore, J. Earle Bowden used his position as editor of the local newspaper to build public support for the preservation of sites of natural and historic value through the creation of a national seashore. Bowden, a native of Northwest Florida, grew up with a fondness for the natural beauty of the area. This evolved into a passion for preservation and conservation.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Inspired by Norman Rockwell, Bowden followed his passion for art to Florida State University. He graduated with a degree in journalism in 1951. Bowden joined the staff of the <i>Pensacola News Journal </i>in 1953 after a stint in the Air Force in Idaho. He began as a sports writer covering the Pensacola minor league baseball team. His cartoons with images of players and coaches helped develop a stronger fanbase. This fanbase continues to support the Pensacola Blue Wahoos today.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 1965, Bowden became the editor of the editorial page. His stories and editorials included his own political cartoons. Bowden is the only editor to draw his own political cartoons for his editorials. He used his platform to shed light on local preservation and environmental concerns. He once stated, “I always thought that was what an editor was supposed to do. Get out and lead the town.”</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">One of his first editorials in 1965 focused on protecting Pensacola’s beaches and historic sites. The editorials influenced the powerful Congressman Bob Sikes, who submitted a bill to protect portions of the seashore from further development. Once the bill was introduced, Bowden used his editorials and political cartoons to defend the bill against strong resistance. He convinced the community of the benefits of a national seashore. In six short years, Bowden and the community succeeded in establishing Gulf Islands National Seashore.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">J. Earle Bowden used his voice to save not only the natural and historic resources on Santa Rosa Island but also areas and islands from Destin, Florida to Cat Island, Mississippi. He also used it to preserve the history of the city of Pensacola. His passion and influence also helped to establish the Pensacola Historic District in 1969. He also served as a founding member of the Pensacola Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission. For all his efforts, in 1984, he earned the title of Florida Preservationist of the Year from the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">J. Earle Bowden’s legacy endures throughout Pensacola and Santa Rosa Island. The portion of Highway 399 which runs through Gulf Islands National Seashore, bears his name. The city of Pensacola erected a statue of him in the J. Earle Bowden Plaza, the former site of the <i>Pensacola News Journal</i> building. Yet, his greatest legacy remains Gulf Islands National Seashore.</span></span>",

By all accounts, as an adult, Frederick avoided publicity and society more so than his siblings.</p> <p>Memories of friends and employees portray a man who extremely shy, indicated by a story often told of him regarding his endeavors to avoid meeting people on the estate. His neighbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt recalled that Vanderbilt avoided meeting people as much as possible and was even embarrassed when he met the servants about the place, darting into the pines only to meet them in the thicket.</p> <p>Frederick graduated from Yale University Sheffield Scientific School in 1876, the only one of his siblings to attend college.</p> <p>In 1878, Frederick married Louise Holmes Anthony Torrance (1854–1926), the daughter of Charles Lee Anthony and Catherine Anthony. Louise's father was a successful dry-goods merchant in New York City. She had been previously married, in 1868, to Frederick's cousin Alfred Torrance, before their divorce in 1877. It was reported that Frederick and Louise’s marriage generated some initial family disapproval and was the subject of public gossip.</p> <p>In 1878 he entered the family’s New York Central Railroad, beginning his career as his father had done, as a clerk working his way through the various departments. He worked in minor jobs, submitted to the usual rules and regulations of the various offices, and won the commendation of department heads for his industry and application.</p> <p>Frederick never retired. By the time of his death, he was a director of twenty-two railroads, the Western Union Telegraph Company, Hudson River Bridge Company, Detroit River Tunnel Company, Niagara River Bridge Company and the New York State Realty and Terminal Company. He followed the family tradition in keeping his business interests closely tied up with the transportation industry. His chief holdings were in the New York Central Railroad, and directorships in other railroads stemmed from that system, with which the name of Vanderbilt has been linked since its beginning.</p> <p>Frederick and Louise owned houses in Newport, Bar Harbor, Hyde Park, Manhattan, and a great camp in the Adirondacks.</p> <p>Among his hobbies, Vanderbilt was known to play the banjo, he derived his chief pleasure in angling and outdoor sports, and was passionately devoted to yachting. He owned a series of elegant steam yachts, and together Frederick and Louise travelled on those yachts to Florida, Europe, South America, up the northeast coast, and to Hyde Park. After the death of his wife in 1926, he spent much of his year on his yacht.</p> <p>Vanderbilt was a member of numerous clubs—the Metropolitan, University, Knickerbocker, Tuxedo, Yale, South Side, and Midday Clubs. He was also a member of the Larchmont, New York, and Sewanhaka-Corinthian Yacht Clubs.</p> <p>Frederick gave generously to institutions, particularly to his alma mater, the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. His other contributions included $3.5 million to Vanderbilt University, $1.5 million (with his brothers and nephew) to establish the Vanderbilt Clinic (an outpatient clinic at Columbia University), $100,000 to the Red Cross War Fund in World War I, $100,000 to the Y.M.C.A., $50,000 for New York City unemployment relief during the Depression, $100,00 to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and building the Sloan Hospital for Women, and the Anthony Home for Working Girls.</p> <p>Frederick was the only one of the third-generation Vanderbilts to increase his inheritance to a sizable fortune. In 1924, shortly after the income tax was introduced, he was one of the ten wealthiest taxpayers in America, paying $793,000 in taxes (the equivalent of over 10 million dollars in 2012). When Frederick died in June of 1938, most of his estate went to Daisy Van Alen, with $20.5 million divided into a 100-share trust fund, and other bequests to charities, family, and long-time employees, including his valet, his assistant butler, and a house maid.</p>",

He worked for a number of hospitals in the New York area in the late 1930s, joining the staff of the Neurological Institute at Columbia-Presbyterian where he specialized in the treatment and care of poliomyelitis victims. He also maintained a private medical practice of his own. Numbered among his personal patients was Trude Lash, the wife of Eleanor Roosevelt’s close friend Joseph Lash. While visiting the Lashes in New York City in 1944, Eleanor Roosevelt became acquainted with Dr. Gurewitsch, and when she moved from Washington to New York after FDR's death, she asked him to be her personal physician.</p> <p>Gurewitsch and Roosevelt were cordial and friendly, but their friendship did not begin in earnest until late in 1947 when Gurewitsch was diagnosed with tuberculosis and needed to return to Switzerland for treatment. Unable to find adequate passage on his own, Roosevelt arranged for him to travel with her on the same plane that was taking her to Geneva for a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. When the plane was grounded because of heavy fog in Ireland, Roosevelt looked after Gurewitsch and over the course of their two-day delay, a bond was struck that would last until ER's death in 1962.</p> <p>Gurewitsch was an open and sympathetic man. Roosevelt felt comfortable confiding in him many of her anxieties and preoccupations. They corresponded with each other regularly and, over the next fifteen years. Gurewitsch would accompany Roosevelt to no fewer than thirteen different countries on her international trips. In 1958, Gurewitsch married Edna Perkel at a ceremony in Roosevelt’s New York City apartment. Soon after, Roosevelt and the Gurewitsches jointly purchased a townhouse located on Manhattan's Upper East Side, revealing just how close Roosevelt had become with the Gurewitsches, especially David. As Roosevelt battled severe anemia and tuberculosis of the bone marrow, she increasingly relied on Gurewitsch for medical and emotional support. He remained her primary physician until her death on November 7, 1962.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Arguably the most famous prisoner to be held at Andersonville was Dorence Atwater, of the 2nd New York Cavalry. Atwater enlisted early in the war and was captured in the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg. He was sent to Richmond, where he was held on Belle Isle. At Belle Isle he became ill with diarrhea, surviving three trips to the hospital. Finally in January, as a means to save his own life, he accepted a parole to work for the Confederate Army. Although still a prisoner, he worked as a clerk in the office charged with distributing supplies sent from the north to prisoners in the city. From this position he observed extreme cases mismanagement of the Confederate prison bureaucracy. He noted that clothing and blankets sent by the US Sanitary Commission often found their way into the hands of Confederate guards. \"Enough clothing was received to have furnished every prisoner with a complete suit and change of under-clothing, blankets, and over-coat, but no prisoner received these articles; if he were furnished with a blouse he must go without a shirt; if with pants he had to go without drawers…\" he testified in 1869. He saw one Confederate officer with more than $50,000 that he had taken out of packages sent to prisoners by the families.<br />  <br /> Atwater was transferred from Richmond to Andersonville in late February 1864, where he arrived on March 1. In May he became ill again with chronic diarrhea and was admitted to the hospital, which at the time of his admission was still located inside the prison stockade. Remembering the lessons learned in Richmond, he approached Dr. Isaiah White about accepting a parole to work in the hospital as a clerk. He was paroled June 15 and was one of several prisoners charged with maintaining the death register. In late August he took action, and began to secretly copy the death list, largely out of a belief that the Confederate army at Camp Sumter would not turn over the main copy at the end of the war.<br /> <br /> Atwater was transferred from Andersonville in February 1865, smuggling his copy of the burial list out with him. He was paroled at the end of the month and was home in Connecticut by mid March 1865. He notified Federal officials of the burial record in his possession, and an expedition was planned was to Andersonville to mark the graves at the prison. While this expedition was being planned, Atwater contacted Clara Barton, offering to assist her with her work notifying the families of missing soldiers. In late July and early August 1865 both Atwater and Barton accompanied the army's expedition to mark and establish Andersonville National Cemetery, and the two spent much of their time going through burial records and writing letters to families of the dead.<br />  <br /> Atwater, eager to publish the list, took his copy back from the army at the end of the expedition. He was charged with larceny in a court martial and sentenced to prison. After a few months he was released and went to work with Barton in her Missing Soldiers Office. In 1866, with Barton's assistance, the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/listofunionsoldi01atwa\">New York Tribune published Atwater's Andersonville Death Register</a>, bringing Atwater a great deal of public notoriety. He toured the country with Barton lecturing on Andersonville to raise money for the Missing Soldiers Office before joining the State Department as a consul in the 1870s. First stationed in the Seychelle Islands, Atwater eventually settled in Tahiti, where he became a respected businessman and married a member of the royal family. A monument was erected in Atwater's honor in his hometown of Terryville, Connecticut in 1907, and he died in San Francisco in 1910.

His efforts were unsuccessful, obliging him to take work with a New York City furniture maker. He also taught woodworking in a settlement house vocational program located in New York City’s Greenwich Village.</p> <p>Following Eleanor Roosevelt’s inquiries, Landolfa agreed to an interview with Nancy Cook (with the aid of an interpreter) and arrived at Val-Kill in December of 1926. Val-Kill Cottage was nearing completion and the furniture factory was still under construction. Cook purchased machinery and workbenches selected by Landolfa and he began constructing furniture for Val-Kill Cottage during the first months of 1927. Landolfa possessed what Mrs. Roosevelt described as an “artist’s love of fine workmanship.”</p> <p>Landolfa had understandable misgivings moving to rural Hyde Park. He knew no one and spoke little English. He considered returning to Italy, but Mrs. Roosevelt encouraged him to stay, enrolled him in a night class to learn to speak English, provided room and board, driving lessons, and helped him purchase his first car.</p> <p>The Val-Kill Shop was soon bustling with several important orders placed that winter. Landolfa crafted furniture for the shop’s first customer—FDR, who was then finishing his cottage at Warm Springs, Georgia. To meet the demanding schedule and additional orders, Landolfa hired more craftsmen. Business remained steady until it began slowing in 1930. The hardest years were 1934 and 1935, when hours were cut due to lack of orders. Landolfa finally left for more reliable income when Mrs. Roosevelt arranged a job for him restoring furniture for a local judge. In time, Landolfa opened his own shop in nearby Poughkeepsie, New York and continued making furniture for another 40 years until his retirement.</p>",

After working a short time as a woodcrafter in an automobile body factory and then a few years as a house carpenter, Berge took a job repairing furniture at the East 13th Street Antique Shop in New York City. Berge developed his craft by instinct, familiarizing himself with eighteenth-century craftsmanship and perfecting his technical skill. He studied the furniture collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Throughout his life, he remained committed to traditional values of craftsmanship and historic integrity.</p> <p>Berge joined the Val-Kill Shop in the summer of 1927. The shop was busy and well equipped when he arrived, but he was critical. Berge thought the furniture designs were attractive, but lacking correctness, pointing out their unfamiliarity with authentic American style and techniques. Berge’s criticism was directed, in part, toward adaptations designed to make the furniture “suitable for modern needs,” an advertised feature of Val-Kill furniture.</p> <p>By the end of 1930, orders for the Furniture Shop dropped so low that most of the workers were let go, leaving only Berge and two others. During the remaining years, orders were scarce and infrequent, preventing steady full-time work.</p> <p>By 1935, Mrs. Roosevelt and her partners began liquidation of the Furniture Shop. Mrs. Roosevelt was making plans to convert the factory building into her own residence. Berge stayed through 1936 to complete the final orders, most of them placed by Mrs. Roosevelt for her new cottage. Berge had been setting up a shop at his home, presumably to start his own business as soon as he was able. He accepted Mrs. Roosevelt’s offer take what machinery from the shop he still needed and the Val-Kill Shop trademark. Berge continued making furniture under the Val-Kill name until his retirement in the 1970s.</p>",

Handsome and athletic, he gave her riding lessons (and later bought her a chestnut mare named Dot), coached her in tennis and swimming, taught her to shoot a pistol, and generally built her confidence. Eleanor came to rely on Miller, perhaps even held romantic feelings for him. Her son James described the relationship as possibly \"the one real romance in mother's life outside of marriage.\" She always kept a room for him wherever she lived.

            "bodyText": "<p>Louis Howe was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on January 14, 1871, to Edward Porter Howe, a Civil War veteran who worked as an insurance executive and small-time newspaper publisher, and Eliza Blake Ray. After watching their son battle a series of illnesses and accidents, the Howes thought Louis could not handle the roughness of public school and enrolled him instead in the Temple Grove Seminary for young women in Saratoga Springs, New York. Howe began his journalism career at seventeen when he joined the staff of his father's Democratic-leaning weekly, <em>The Sun</em>, and began freelancing for other regional papers, often scooping his rivals. When <em>The Sun</em> folded in 1900, he turned to freelancing full time and in 1906 the <em>New York Herald</em> hired him to assist in their coverage of the Albany legislature.</p> <p>Eventually his interests moved from covering politics to politics itself. In 1906, Howe began handling political matters for Auburn, New York, Mayor Thomas Mott Osborne. Their collaboration was not smooth and Osborne fired Howe three years later. In 1911, Howe became enthralled with FDR's anti-Tammany insurgency within the state senate. When typhoid sidelined FDR in the midst of his 1912 re-election effort, Eleanor Roosevelt asked Howe to manage FDR's campaign. Howe and FDR quickly became devoted to one another and Howe adopted FDR's ambitions as his own. When FDR became <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">assistant secretary of the navy</a> in 1913, Howe accompanied FDR to Washington and served as his chief of staff, deftly using the patronage positions FDR had at his disposal to weaken Tammany and shore up the FDR factions within the party. When the Democrats tapped FDR as their vice-presidential nominee, FDR then asked Howe to manage his 1920 campaign. Howe then tutored Eleanor Roosevelt, as they rode the campaign train, becoming her confidant, mentor, and friend.</p> <p>Howe's dedication to both Roosevelts was fierce. When polio paralyzed FDR in 1921, Howe strove to boost FDR's spirits, preserve his political reputation, and support Eleanor in her efforts to bolster FDR's independence and continue her own public commitments. In the process, he helped Eleanor master public speaking and navigate the turf wars of New York politics. He helped keep FDR before the public by orchestrating FDR's statements on public issues, writing magazine articles published under FDR's byline, and coordinating FDR's appearance at the 1924 Democratic convention. Howe convinced Eleanor to join the League of Women Voters and to edit papers such as the <em>Women's Democratic News</em> to keep FDR's name and ideas before the public while he was recovering. Howe's efforts, coupled with Eleanor’s political network and FDR's incessant correspondence with Democrats across the nation, convinced New York Governor Alfred E. Smith (who was then the Democratic candidate for president) that FDR must be his successor in the New York statehouse. At first, Howe was reluctant for FDR to return to active politics (together they had planned to wait four more years). But quickly Howe was able to convince voters that FDR's illness was not a reason to bar him from office.</p> <p>FDR's election to the governorship in 1928 changed their relationship as Howe, while still FDR's closest advisor, now had to share the governor with other key members of his staff. During FDR's four years in Albany, Howe worked closely with both Roosevelts, promoting Eleanor’s literary work and assisting her political efforts while working unceasingly to secure the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination for FDR. The more successful Howe became in promoting FDR, the more advice FDR sought for other quarters, much of which challenged Howe's more traditional political views. Rivalries within FDR's inner circle developed and the asthmatic Howe's always frail health declined rapidly. Once FDR won the nomination, to Howe's great dismay, much of FDR's post-convention campaign would be managed by a team lead by Jim Farley.</p> <p>Having mentored, pushed, and championed FDR for twenty years, FDR's victory meant almost as much to Howe as it did to FDR. FDR appointed Howe his personal secretary, a title that allowed Howe great latitude and few official duties, and Howe moved into the White House. Although his health quickly deteriorated, Howe continued to speak bluntly and frankly to FDR, refusing to let the aura of the presidency isolate him from the man whom he had supported for two decades. His advice to Eleanor was just as honest and bold. He encouraged her to hold women-only press conferences, helped choreograph her media campaigns, and supported her efforts to find a way to address issues and shape policy. Howe especially championed the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Subsistence Homestead programs, and the New Deal's anti-crime initiative.</p> <p>Howe entered the Bethesda Naval Hospital on August 21, 1935 and remained there until his death April 18, 1936. Eleanor arranged a state funeral in the East Room of the White House for her friend, whom she would later describe as \"one of the seven most important people\" in her life.<br /> <br /> <em>Biography courtesy of The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project for the National Park Service.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Henry Morgenthau, Jr. was born May 11, 1891 in New York City, the grandson of German Jewish immigrants and the child of Henry Morgenthau, a realtor and diplomat, and Josephine Sykes Morgenthau. Educated in private schools, young Morgenthau studied architecture and agriculture for two years at Cornell University. In 1913, he bought an apple and dairy farm in East Fishkill, New York, a town in Dutchess County. It was there that Morgenthau met and befriended Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, who lived in nearby Hyde Park. As a World War I colleague of Herbert Hoover, Morgenthau helped the U.S. Farm Administration develop a plan to send tractors to war-ravaged France. In 1922, Morgenthau bought the <em>American Agriculturist</em>, which he continued to publish until 1933. He served as chair of the New York State Agricultural Advisory Committee from 1928-1930, after which he served on the state Conservation Commission until 1932.<br /> <br /> In 1933, President Roosevelt appointed Morgenthau governor of the Federal Farm Board, and in November of the same year, when acting treasury secretary William Woodin's ill health forced his resignation, Roosevelt named Morgenthau undersecretary of the treasury and promoted him to secretary of the treasury the following year. Morgenthau held that post until 1945. During his tenure in this office, he became famous for resisting Keynesian economics and raising over $200 billion through the sale of bonds.<br /> <br /> Morgenthau's legacy is more than wartime fiscal policy. Although treasury was not initially involved in establishing military or refugee policy, Morgenthau and his department eventually played a key role in American refugee policy when they helped convince FDR to establish an independent refugee agency outside the state department. The War Refugee Board, not the recalcitrant State Department, would assume responsibility for rescuing European Jews and would take the lead in saving as many as 200,000 European Jews. In 1944, he proposed a plan for postwar Germany that called for Germany to be stripped of its industry and forced to return to an agrarian economy; although the plan was considered, it was ultimately rejected. Later that year, Morgenthau was a major player at the Bretton Woods Conference, the birthplace of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (precursor to the World Bank). The week after FDR's death, Morgenthau urged ER to continue her political career and to speak out forcefully on the issues, arguing that her voice was needed more than ever in the postwar world.<br /> <br /> After leaving the cabinet on July 22, 1945, Morgenthau became a philanthropist and a leading financial advisor to the new nation of Israel. He died in Poughkeepsie, New York, on February 6, 1967.<br /> <br /> <em>Source: The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project for the National Park Service.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1861, and a graduate of Cincinnati College of Music, she married William Howard Taft in 1886. Nellie Taft distinguished herself as founder and president of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra Association. After the Spanish-American War, President William McKinley appointed William Taft Governor of the Philippine Islands, where he served from 1900 to 1903. There, Mrs.Taft distinguished herself as a public servant. The Tafts worked as a team, reversing discrimination against locals and establishing a policy of equality. She was a fan of Manila's Luneta Park, a swampland transformed in 1820 into the Paseo de Luneta, a plaza in the form of a Roman circus or parade for riding and walking. Later, the Paseo de Luneta served as a fortification, around the old Walled City, or Intramuros, a historic Spanish colonial district that Nellie Taft fought to preserve. The Paseo de Luneta was a community recreation center where concerts were open to all.<br /> <br /> When President Theodore Roosevelt appointed William Taft Secretary of War in 1904, the Tafts returned to the United States via Japan, where they were celebrated as political celebrities. Stateside, Mrs.Taft read the McMillan Commission's \"city beautiful\" plan for the capital, and discovered another niche. Commissioner Daniel Burnham traveled to Manila to see Luneta, and in 1906 a Luneta type plan materialized as West Potomac Park's \"Four Fountains\" in a recently-established evergreen and rose nursery. By the 1920s, the \"Four Fountains\" sported Asian magnolias and forsythias, and by the 1930s, Japanese flowering cherry trees. Almost all was destroyed in the 1940s to make way for the new Potomac bridges. Fountain four, now in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama/planyourvisit/george-mason-memorial.htm\">George Mason Memorial</a>, and the Cuban Friendship Urn remain, still surrounded by Asian plantings.<br />  </p> <hr /><sup>Originally written by Michael Litterst</sup>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Dr. Frederica “Freddy” de Laguna was an influential archeologist and anthropologist who worked extensively throughout Alaska. Her trailblazing career spanned more than three decades. Dr. de Laguna’s research not only helped lay the groundwork for modern archeology in Alaska, it helped to open the male dominated field of archeology to women in the early 20th century.  </p> <h4><br /> <strong>Getting to Alaska  </strong></h4> <p>Frederica de Laguna earned her PhD in anthropology at Columbia University in 1933, with field work focused on Europe and Greenland. Her experience in Greenland studying arctic cultures led to a position as a research assistant on an expedition in Prince William Sound. Before the expedition could start, the leader fell ill, throwing the trip into question.  As a female research assistant in the 1930s Dr. de Laguna wasn’t able to use the funds secured by her male expedition leader to carry on with the project. However she secured her own funding for the expedition through the University of Pennsylvania Museum which hired her to catalog items in their collection in return for funding two excavations in Cook Inlet. <br /> <br /> Over the course of two and a half decades, Dr. de Laguna would go on to lead five expeditions to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. <br /> <br /> During Dr. de Laguna’s first expedition to Cook Inlet in 1930, she chartered a boat called the Dime. Initially, she employed two boat captains, Jack Fields and his partner Harry Lewis. According to Dr. de Laguna “I thought I was getting two men for my money, but the partner took one look at me while I was sitting in the taxi office and faded out of the picture. He was either apparently very shy, or distrustful of women and refused to meet me.” Eventually, Dr. de Laguna set sail with Mr. Fields for the south end of Cook Inlet and conducted surveys in Kachemak Bay.  <br /> <br /> Later studies in 1933 brought her to the remote west side of Cook Inlet where, even today landing a boat is difficult because of the drastic differences between high and low tide. Dr. de Laguna was able to survey three places on the west coast: Chinitna Bay, Tuxedni Bay, and the village of Tyonek. While expedition funding from the Museum covered part of the costs, Dr. de Laguna self-financed some of her work with royalties from a series of mystery novels she authored.  </p> <h4><br /> <strong>Cook Inlet Findings  </strong></h4> <p>Dr. de Laguna’s survey’s of Tuxedni and Chinitna Bays, in what is now Lake Clark National Park, during the 1930s and 1940s were some of the first archeological studies of the Cook Inlet. In Tuxedni Bay in 1933 Dr. de Laguna discovered one of the only two pictograph sites in Lake Clark. It wasn’t until 1975 that she was able to interpret the iconography of the pictograph and made suggestions toward the date it was created. Her findings from the pictograph site and others along Cook Inlet suggested a chronological timeline of cultures that lived on the coast. <br /> <br /> Often, findings from early archeological studies are disputed by subsequent research using more modern techniques. However, Dr. de Laguna’s hypotheses remain foundational to archeologists today and have only been reinforced by further study. In 2006, using modern technology, another interpretation of the pictographs in Tuxedni Bay was conducted and confirmed de Laguna’s original interpretation.  </p> <h4><br /> <strong>A Contemporary View of Early Archeological Methods </strong></h4> <p>While Dr. de Laguna is a celebrated groundbreaking archeologist, her methods were a product of her time. Dr. de Laguna conducted research prior to the passing of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nagpra/index.htm\">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act </a>in 1990 (NAGPRA). Before NAGPRA was passed, many scientists, including Dr. de Laguna, collected remains from Native American graves. Since the passing of NAGPRA, artifacts collected from Dr. de Laguna’s study sites have been returned to the cultures to which the artifacts belong.   <br />  <br /> Today, professional and academic archeologists, including those from the National Park Service, adhere to strict professional standards of conduct. In addition, the National Park Service conducts extensive consultation and cooperates with local tribes and Native Corporations when researching or excavating on Federal Lands.  </p> <h4><br /> <strong>A Storied Career </strong></h4> <p>Frederica de Laguna was born in a time when women were not typically scientists, and those who were worked especially hard to be recognized. Against that backdrop Dr. de Laguna’s career was particularly remarkable.  <br /> <br /> In 1938 Dr. de Laguna taught the first archeology course at Bryn Mawr College where she earned her undergraduate degree. In 1942 de Laguna took a leave of absence from Bryn Mawr to serve in the naval reserve as a lieutenant commander of Women Accepted for Voluntary Service. She taught naval history and codes and ciphers to women midshipmen until the end of WWII in 1945. After the war, she returned to her archeological work and served as the Vice President of the Society of American Archeology from 1949-1950. Frederica de Laguna’s extensive work as a pioneering archeologist, scholar, educator, and writer led her to be one of the first women elected to the National Academy of the Sciences in 1986. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<em>By Fort Vancouver National Historic Site Volunteer-in-Parks Dr. Robert Staab</em> <h3>Early Life and Career</h3> <br /> Dionysus Daniel \"Danny\" Grecco was born in San Jose, California, on November 10, 1896. Just one year earlier, his parents and older brother had immigrated to the United States from Italy. In 1904, the family moved again, this time to Portland, Oregon. In 1905, a 9 year old Grecco stood in awe and watched Lincoln Beachey fly his dirigible at the Lewis and Clark Exposition. From that moment, Grecco looked to the sky for his future.<br /> <br /> In 1910, at the Rose City Speedway, Grecco saw his first airplane, flown by Eugene Ely. Ely was part of the Glen Curtiss aviation demonstration team, flying in exhibitions and showing off Curtiss products around the country. Curtiss airplanes featured a simple construction style, which could easily be disassembled, trucked to another city, and reassembled. <br /> <br /> On June 11, 1912, Grecco was one of the \"mechanics\" who helped assemble Silas Christofferson's pusher-type airplane on the top of Portland's Multnomah Hotel. Grecco worked on the wings and landing gear. The aircraft had to be disassembled and hoisted in pieces to a wooden runway constructed on top of the hotel's roof, where it was reassembled. It weighed only 860 pounds and was pushed by a Curtiss OX-5 engine. The airplane was constructed from spruce, muslin, wires, and bamboo. Christofferson lifted off from the top of the Multnomah Hotel, made his historic flight - the first to cross the Columbia River - and landed at the Aviation Camp at Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington. The flight took a total of 12 minutes.<br />   <h3>Wing Walking</h3> <br /> After briefly working in China as an airplane mechanic, Grecco returned to the United States to work for Tex Rankin, a well-known Portland-based pilot and operator of a flight school. Grecco first began flying in 1919, in a Great Lakes biplane powered by an OX-5 engine, an agile little plane, popular with acrobatic pilots. The abilities of this biplane came in handy during Grecco's death-defying career with the Tex Rankin Air Circus.<br /> <br /> In addition to running a flight school, Tex Rankin had employed a number of \"extra ordinary, brave, or plain crazy\" men who were part of his \"Tex Rankin Air Circus.\" As he worked to pay for flying lessons and training, Grecco became a \"wing walker.\" Walking on the wings of in-flight aircraft was a popular performance in the years following World War I, and Grecco was one of the best. He would walk from one plane to another, one plane to a boat, or one plane to an automobile. He accomplished all this without a harness or a parachute, flying 400-500 feet off the ground. Grecco performed in cities along the West Coast, especially in Oregon, at state fairs and other functions. In 1928, he \"hung on to a Curtiss Jenny's wing as it flew over the Columbia River.\"<br /> <br /> By 1936, federal regulations were passed banning wing walking at under 1,500 feet elevation; if above 2,000 feet, wing walkers were required to wear a parachute. With these new safety rules, the thrill of watching wing walking performances lessened, and the stunt lost its appeal.<br />   <h3>Mechanics Career</h3> <br /> During World War I, Grecco served as a mechanic in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.<br /> <br /> In 1927, at the new Portland Municipal Airport on Swan Island, Grecco serviced Charles Lindbergh's plane when the famed aviator arrived to help dedicate the new airfield. Also in that year, he earned his aviation mechanic's license.<br /> <br /> Like many early pilots, Grecco experienced some devastating crashes. On April 25, 1927, at Pearson Field, Grecco took two Portland telephone operators for a joy ride, but at 100 feet elevation, the airplane faltered and crashed into the high grading of the SP&S railroad berm. The two women, Zola V. Schan and Harriette Franklin, were killed. Grecco survived the crash, but his injuries required a lengthy hospital stay. Records show that Grecco had been married to Franklin in 1922. Grecco remarried in 1929, to Genevieve Coffey. The Greccos had a son, Warren, in 1931.<br /> <br /> In 1937, Grecco became a test pilot for a new plane built by Marvin Joy. The plane was given many names, among them \"the flying fuselage.\" This newly designed plane did not last long, and was very unstable. Grecco remarked that \"it had no lateral stability.\"<br /> <br /> As good as he was at flying and stunts, Grecco became most well known as a talented airplane mechanic. He was part of a team that assembled the first plane to fly from the airfield at Portland's Westmoreland Park. Grecco was affiliated with both the Ace Aircraft Company in Portland, and the Oregon, Washington, Idaho Air Plane Company.<br /> <br /> In 1937, he was one of the mechanics who disassembled the famed ANT-25 Soviet aircraft that made the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/aredboltfromtheblue.htm\">world's first transpolar flight</a>, from Moscow, Russia, to Pearson Field. After it was disassembled, it was shipped back to the Soviet Union via the Panama Canal. One of Grecco's most treasured memories was receiving \"tools and a survival kit\" from the Soviet crew.<br />   <h3>After World War II</h3> <br /> In 1946, Grecco earned the first helicopter mechanic rating from Bell helicopters. Later, he was involved as a mechanic in the test flights of Chuck Yeager's X-1 in 1947. In his later years, Grecco worked at Pearson Field, maintaining old aircraft and doing mechanical work up until the months before his death in October 1983.<br /> <br /> Grecco is a member of the Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1963, the Federal Aeronautic Administration designated Danny Grecco as \"the best mechanic in the west.\"<br />   <h3>Bibliography</h3> <br /> Alley, Bill. <em>Pearson Field: Pioneering Aviation in Vancouver and Portland</em>.

            "bodyText": "<p>Naukane, also known as John Cox (or Coxe), was one of many Hawaiians who came to the Pacific Northwest to work in the fur trade. With his royal background and his extensive travels between the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific Northwest, eastern Canada, and England, Cox's story is exceptional in many ways. But his final journey to Fort Vancouver was echoed by many of his countrymen, who also found a life that suited them in the fur trade. For nearly three decades, John Cox was a fixture at the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Vancouver, where his story is still told today.<br /> <br /> Naukane was likely born on the island of Hawai'i, and was a high-ranking member of Hawai'i's royal family. As a child of about twelve years old, he witnessed the death of famed British explorer Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay in 1779.<br /> <br /> In February 1811, the Pacific Fur Company's ship <em>Tonquin</em> also arrived in Kealakekua Bay. The Pacific Fur Company (PFC) was an American fur trade enterprise owned by businessman John Jacob Astor. When it arrived to resupply in Hawai'i, the <em>Tonquin</em> was en route from New York City to the mouth of the Columbia River, where the PFC intended to establish a fur trading post.<br /> <br /> From Kealakekua Bay, the <em>Tonquin</em> proceeded to Waikiki, where the ship's officers met with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/puhe/learn/historyculture/kamehameha.htm\">Kamehameha I, King of the Hawaiian Islands</a>. In the course of their visit, the king contracted a group of twelve Hawaiian laborers to go to the Northwest with the PFC on board <em>Tonquin</em>. Naukane was appointed a \"royal observer,\" in charge of overseeing these laborers. On the journey to the Northwest, Naukane was given the name \"John Cox,\" because he resembled another PFC crew member of the same name.<br /> <br /> In the spring of 1811, the <em>Tonquin</em> arrived on the Northwest coast, and its crew set to constructing Fort Astoria, which was intended to be the PFC's primary trading post. The Hawaiian members of the expedition were charged with tending to the fort's three pigs and maintaining a garden. Fur trader Alexander Ross described Cox during this time as \"a bold and trustworthy fellow.\" In July, Fort Astoria received a visitor: a small party led by British-Canadian mapmaker and surveyor David Thompson, employed by the Canada-based North West Company. Thompson rested at Fort Astoria for a week, and came to regard Cox as \"a prodigy of wit and humour.\" When Thompson departed, Cox went with him, severing his contract with the PFC and embarking on a cross-continent journey.<br /> <br /> With David Thompson's party, Cox traveled by canoe and portage to Fort William, the North West Company's supply depot near Lake Superior, arriving in July 1812. There, they received news that the United States and Great Britain had declared war against each other, and the War of 1812 had begun. To aid in the war against the Americans, the North West Company decided to forcibly seize Fort Astoria; a party, which included Cox, due to his experience crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar, was sent to England with the mission to outfit a ship and return to Astoria.<br /> <br /> After a brief sojourn in England, during which he was nearly shanghaied in Portsmouth, Cox returned to Astoria in 1813, aboard the HMS <em>Racoon</em>. However, by that time the peaceful surrender and transfer of Fort Astoria from the Pacific Fur Company to the North West Company had been negotiated, and the fort, now under British control, was renamed \"Fort George.\" Cox remained at Fort George until 1814, when he returned to Hawai'i.<br /> <br /> Back in Hawai'i, Naukane joined the court of Prince 'Iolani Liholiho, who succeeded Kamehameha I in 1819 and became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/puhe/learn/historyculture/kamehameha2.htm\">King Kamehameha II</a>. In 1823, Kamehameha II and other high ranking members of the court, including Naukane, traveled to England, arriving there in May, 1824. For nearly a month, the court was received in London, and toured the city. But by late June, many members, including the king, had contracted measles. On July 8, the Queen consort, Kamamalu, died. Days later, on July 14, Kamehameha II died. The bodies were returned to Hawai'i for burial, but Naukane and others in the traveling party who did not contract measles were regarded with suspicion. Concerns about misspent funds from the late king's treasury also increased tensions, and it is speculated that Naukane returned to his life in the North American fur trade - and his identity as John Cox - to escape this scrutiny.<br /> <br /> In 1821, Cox's former employer, the North West Company, merged with the Hudson's Bay Company. Thus, when Cox resumed his career in the fur trade, it was as an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). From 1824 until 1842, Cox worked as a middleman at Fort George and Fort Vancouver. The term \"middleman\" was a boating term that was also used in a broader sense to describe general laborers at fur trade posts. During this time, Cox may have served in boats traveling the Columbia River and other regional waterways, but he likely also performed other types of manual labor.<br /> <br /> In October 1825, Cox was implicated in a possible theft of beaver skins and blankets aboard the ship <em>William and Ann</em> at Fort George, said to have been perpetrated by some of the fort's Hawaiian employees. Cox was accused of giving blankets to his wife (probably an Indigenous woman he had married since his return to the Northwest). Some of the accused admitted they had taken blankets for the Native women they were living with or married to, but Cox maintained his innocence.<br /> <br /> A unique aspect of Cox's service in the fur trade is his work as Fort Vancouver's swineherd. He is recorded in this position in the years 1826-1835 and 1842-1843, concurrently with being recorded as a middleman. Fort Vancouver's Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin had received orders from his superiors to establish a farm that could provide provisions to the HBC's network of forts in the region, as well as enough beef and pork for ships leaving the fort to return to England. McLoughlin was dedicated to the creation of a highly productive and efficient farm surrounding the post.<br /> <br /> Early on, establishing a herd of pigs at the fort was difficult; many were killed as a result of eating \"poisonous weeds.\" In 1836, McLoughlin wrote to the Company's directors in London, \"There is a weed on our plains, which poisons a great number of our Pigs but it will get extirpated.\" By 1844, the farm was a success; the herd that Cox was responsible for included 727 pigs. Cox was not the only Hawaiian who was in charge of this important task at Fort Vancouver - he was joined by fellow Hawaiians Orohuay (recorded as a pigherd 1832-1837) and Towai (recorded as a pigherd 1833-1845). Cox, Orohuay, and Towai grazed the fort's pigs on the plain between the fort and the Columbia River, an area that became known as \"Coxe's Plain.\"<br /> <br /> In his later years, Cox was remembered by Fort Vancouver's residents and visitors as a great storyteller, who was especially fond of recounting his memories of Captain Cook's death. In 1845, he was joined at Fort Vancouver by his younger relative (perhaps a son or nephew) William Naukana, who went on to have a long career at the HBC's posts in Canada and San Juan Island. In 1847, traveling artist Paul Kane visited Fort Vancouver and painted Cox. This portrait is now in the collection of the <a href=\"https://collections.rom.on.ca/\">Royal Ontario Museum</a>.<br /> <br /> On February 2, 1850, Naukane, or John Cox, died at Fort Vancouver at the approximate age of 83. Thomas Lowe, a clerk at the fort, wrote in his journal the next day: \"Old Cox, a Sandwich Islander [Hawaiian] who has been a long time in this Country in the Company's employ, died here yesterday afternoon. He was in England and Canada, and was about 12 years old when Captain Cook was killed at Owhyhee [Hawai'i].\"<br /> <br /> Today, John Cox's story is told through exhibits and public programs at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. Local Hawaiian artist Amy Kapuanani Antonio-Claussen has also used Cox's story as inspiration for her artwork, which has been featured at the site in a temporary exhibit from 2017 to 2018, and in prints and postcards available for sale in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/bookstore.htm\">Friends of Fort Vancouver bookstore</a>.

            "bodyText": "<p>Originally named Brown Weasel Woman, Pi'tamaka was born into the Piikáni (Piegan Blackfeet) tribe in the 19th century. As a young girl, she began to show less interest in traditional female roles and more interest in hunting and the games her brothers played. Her father, a well-respected warrior of the tribe, indulged her interest and taught her to hunt and fight.</p> <p>As she got older, she accompanied the men on buffalo hunts, even saving her father's life during a hunt when an enemy war party attacked them. When her father was killed in battle and her mother became ill, Brown Weasel Woman became the primary caretaker of the family. However, by taking a widow into her family to help with those responsibilities, she was again free to hunt the buffalo.</p> <p>Soon the lessons she learned in fighting were put to use. When members of the Crow tribe stole horses from her people, a Piikáni war party set out to get them back and Brown Weasel Woman joined them. One version of the story states that the leader of the war party told her to go back, but she refused. When he said that the war party would not continue unless she returned home, she told him to go ahead, and that she would retrieve the horses on her own. With that, the war party - including Brown Weasel Woman - continued on to get their tribe's horses back.</p> <p>After finding the horses and leading them towards home, they stopped to camp for the night. Brown Weasel Woman stayed awake as a lookout while the others slept. She spotted two Crow warriors attempting to steal back the horses. Stories conflict as to whether she killed one or both of the warriors, but the result was the same: she saved the herd. During another raid, she was part of a group that captured several hundred horses. She eventually gained a reputation as a successful hunter and warrior.</p> <p>During the summer, when the tribes gathered and the warriors told of their many adventures, the Piikáni chief told Brown Weasel Woman to share hers. This was a highly unusual thing for a woman to be asked, but after doing so, the chief bestowed upon her the name Pi'tamaka (Running Eagle) as a sign of respect and honor.</p> <p>She continued to hunt and raid as her father had taught her before she died as a warrior at the hands of the Flathead tribe some time after the late 1870s.</p> <p>Books have been written about Pi'tamaka and Pitamakan Lake in Glacier National Park is named for her.</p>",

There is some controversy as to who was the first person to discover the gold.  Carmack was traveling in a party including his wife Shaaw Tláa (Kate Carmack), her brother, Keish (Skookum Jim), and Káa Goox (Dawson Charlie). Numerous versions of the discovery story are told, however, in the end the first claim to be filed for Bonanza Creek was under Carmack's name, likely because he was the only EuroAmerican in the group.<br /> <br /> George Carmack was born September 24, 1860 in Port Costa, California. After his 21st birthday in February 1882, George enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and sailed to Sitka on board the USS <em>Wachusett</em>. By 1885 George was stricken with gold fever and headed north to Juneau to outfit for a summer of prospecting and eventually taking the Chilkoot Pass into the Yukon. George, by 1887, could speak both Chilkat Tlingit and Tagish dialects, and married a Tagish chief's daughter, named Shaaw Tláa (Kate). The couple later had a daughter named Graphie Gracie. In August of 1896, George had staked a claim on the richest creek in the Yukon.<br /> <br /> In July of 1899, George and Kate departed for California By 1900 would George severed his commitment to Kate and married another woman. George worked several more gold claims and dealt in real estate in his later years. He died at age 62 in 1922.</p>",

His family was tightly linked to the trade between coastal Tlingit people and the inland Tagish. His father was a Tlingit man from the Crow clan and his mother was Tagish from the Wolf clan. These strong family ties seemed to influence Keish because as a young man he worked in Dyea as a packer on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/chilkoot-history.htm\">Chilkoot Trail</a>.<br /> <br /> Keish got the nickname Skookum (strong) Jim, for being able to haul huge loads of more than 100 pounds on the Chilkoot Trail. He also met George Carmack on the Chilkoot Trail, who would become a friend and partner. Carmack would eventually start a family with Keish's sister, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/kate-carmack.htm\">Shaaw Tláa (Kate Carmack)</a>. These two men, along with Keish's cousin, began prospecting together in 1888. In 1887, Keish assisted Captain William Moore with a survey over another low lying pass to the east of the Chilkoot Trail. Moore would go on to develop this route to later competed with the Chilkoot Trail as a major route to the Klondike, known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/whitepasstrail.htm\">White Pass Route</a>.<br /> <br /> In the early 1890s, Keish left the area and his friends to head north to Forty Mile, along the Yukon River and began prospecting on his own. He returned some years later and reconnected with his sister and friend George. Soon after his return in August of 1896, the family group of four discovered gold on Rabbit (Bonanza) Creek. This discovery was the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/goldrush.htm\">Klondike Gold Rush</a>. Together Keish, George Carmack, Kate Carmack, and Dawson (Tagish) Charlie worked what would become known as Discovery Claim and collectively earned nearly one million dollars. <br /> <br /> After the strike of good fortune, Keish built a home for his wife and daughter in Carcross, Yukon Territory where he spent the winters trapping and hunting. In the summer, he would return to the Klondike Fields and continue searching for gold. In later years, Keish built a home for his sister in Carcross, and developed a Trust that went to his people. For this reason the Tagish people and people of the Yukon consider Keish to be a generous man of historic significance.</p>",

His principal successes during the war were the defense of Quebec against American attack and organizing the evacuation of British-held New York at the end of the conflict. He resumed his role as governor of Quebec and governor in chief of the remaining provinces of British North America from 1786 to 1796.<br /> <br /> Born into the Anglo-Irish gentry, Carleton began his military career in 1742. He later served briefly in the War of Austrian Succession and in the British defense of Hanover during the Seven Years’ War. During this period, he became friends with James Wolfe who advanced Carleton’s career by appointing him quartermaster general during the campaign against New France and the capture of Quebec in 1759. Carleton was present at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in which he was lightly wounded. He then saw considerable action in the Caribbean and ended the Seven Years’ War as a colonel.<br /> <br /> In 1766, Carleton was appointed acting lieutenant governor of Quebec, and then governor in 1768. Angering English-speaking American colonists ,who poured into Quebec after the conquest, Carleton advocated preserving many aspects of French Canadian governance, including the Catholic Church.<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> </span>Carleton pushed through the Quebec Act of 1774, which expanded the borders of the province, restored French civil law and tithes to the Catholic Church, and perhaps most troublesome for American colonists, did not include an elected assembly or the right of <em>habeas corpus</em>. American patriots considered the Quebec Act despotic, and included it among the hated “Intolerable Acts.” It is considered a cause of the American Revolution.<br />  </p> <h4>American Revolution</h4> <p>In May 1775, news of the Battle of Lexington and Concord reached Quebec, and Carleton sent more than half of his garrison to assist General Thomas Gage in Boston. Left with few regular troops, Carleton’s efforts to form effective fighting units from the French Canadian population met with limited success, and he was reluctant to employ American Indian warriors who offered their services.<br /> <br /> Carleton’s defense against Montgomery and Arnold’s Quebec Campaign of 1775-1776, while successful in the end, showcased the fact that Carleton's talents lay more in administration and diplomacy than in war. He overestimated the loyalty of the French Canadian population and their willingness to fight for the British against the invading Continentals. Likewise, Carleton underestimated the revolutionary fervor of the American colonists and its influence in Quebec. Continental forces captured the strong points of Ticonderoga, St. Johns, and Montreal, laying siege to Quebec in November 1775. Carleton repulsed an attack on Quebec by American forces on December 31, in which the American commander, Major General Richard Montgomery, was killed. Despite their defeat, the Americans maintained the siege until it was lifted with the arrival of British reinforcements under John Burgoyne in May 1776. Carleton then led the pursuit of Continental forces which culminated in the British victory at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in October. Although victorious, the American force successfully prevented Carleton from invading New York before the onset of winter. Carleton was incensed the following year when Burgoyne was granted command of the ill-fated Saratoga Campaign. Carleton demanded to be recalled to Great Britain and was replaced as governor by Frederick Haldimand.<br /> <br /> Knighted for his efforts in Canada, Carleton returned to North America as commander in chief of British forces in 1782. He became a champion of the loyalists, opposed to their treatment in the Treaty of Paris. He was even more incensed that it fell to him as the British commander in New York to implement the treaty’s provisions. Though not an abolitionist, Carleton was a staunch defender of British promises of freedom for escaped slaves who had found refuge behind British lines. He ordered careful records kept (known as “The Book of Negroes”) of all former enslaved people granted their freedom by British authorities, who were then evacuated from New York in 1783.<br /> <br /> The evacuation of former slaves was a point of controversy between Carleton and George Washington when they finally met in May 1783. Washington argued that the removal of former slaves, including enslaved people who fled Mount Vernon, was a breach of the peace treaty, to which Carleton replied that honor demanded Britain’s promises of freedom made before the treaty be kept. Washington dropped the issue, but the dispute over compensation for slaveholders continued.<br />  </p> <h4>Postwar Career</h4> <p>In 1786, Carleton was ennobled as the First Baron of Dorchester for his services to the Crown, and he returned to North America as both Governor of Quebec and Governor-in-Chief of all the remaining British provinces. His principal task was to find a constitutional way to satisfy the thousands of loyalist newcomers who resented the presence of French civil law and land tenure in Quebec, while still maintaining the loyalty of the French Canadian majority. Though Carleton was unable to find a suitable compromise, Parliament debated and passed the Constitutional Act of 1791 which split Quebec into English-speaking Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) under English common law with its own assembly, and the French majority Lower Canada (Quebec).<br /> <br /> Carleton presided over the constitutional changes, and returned to England in 1796, passing away in 1808 at the age of 84.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<div><em>By Jack Nisbet</em><br /> <br /> At the beginning of September 1825, naturalist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/daviddouglas.htm\">David Douglas</a> was busily pressing plants and drying seeds in his cedar bark hut on the grounds of Fort Vancouver when he learned that an upper Chinook headman named Chumtalia was visiting the post. Chumtalia's home village lay upstream of the Columbia at the rapids called the Cascades of the Columbia - the site of today's Bonneville Dam. The previous spring Douglas had observed many interesting plants at the Cascades and was anxious to return and collect their ripe seeds. After hiring Chumtalia as a guide and a Canadian <em>voyageur</em> to paddle, he journeyed upriver two days, then pitched camp near Chumtalia's lodge. \"I found my Indian friend during my stay very attentive and I received no harm or insult. He accompanied me on some of my journeys,\" Douglas noted in his journal.<br /> <br /> When Douglas expressed a desire to climb Table Mountain on the north side of the river the next morning, Chumtalia excused himself on account of feeling ill (which Douglas believed to be feigned) an appointed his younger brother as a substitute. After an exhausting three-day trek, Douglas recuperated back at the village, fishing and shooting at seals while resting his sore feet. Chumtalia then willingly ferried Douglas to the south shore and led him to a rugged drainage below snowcapped Mount Hood. Along the way they gathered seeds of several penstemons and passed beautiful stands of beargrass. At the climax of the day's ascent, they reached a stand of magnificent firs, which were still known as pines at that time. Certain that the species, which he named <em>Pinus nobilis</em>, was new to science, Douglas wanted cones to send to England, but found them impossible to obtain - the trees were too huge to climb, and the cones to high in the tree tops to shoot down. He made a note in his journal to acquire the cones \"by some means or another.\" He did eventually succeed in obtaining seeds of the tree we now know as <em>Abies procera</em>, or noble fir.<br /> <br /> When Douglas revisited the Cascades of the Columbia in August of 1826, Chumtalia welcomed him with a meal of fresh salmon and huckleberries laid out on a tule mat. The headman then insisted that the naturalist exchange his battered craft for a larger one from the village, and the next day Douglas arrived at Fort Vancouver in style. <br /> <br /> In July of 1830, Douglas again traveled to the Cascades in the hopes that Chumtalia would guide him back to the grove of noble firs to gather cones. The journey was postponed because the headman was hosting a feast in honor of his daughter's coming of age, but less than a month later, Chumtalia arrived at Fort Vancouver in his large canoe to pick up the naturalist and his gear. This time, Douglas was able to obtain his much-desired fir cones, as well as a tribal name for the noble fir. \"Brought to Fort Vancouver by the Indians, under the name of Tuch-tuck, from the Great Falls of the Columbia.\"<br /> <br /> Soon afterwards, however, some distressing news reached the post:</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Poor Chumtalia is since dead.

He learned Chinook jargon (Chinuk Wawa), a <em>lingua franca</em> that allowed him to communicate with different bands throughout the lower Columbia. He sometimes reimbursed his \"Indian acquaintances\" in trade goods if they delivered certain desirable specimens to his lodge at Fort Vancouver.<br /> <br /> While exploring the shores of Willapa Bay in the late summer of 1825, Douglas stopped at the village of a Chinook headman called Cockqua, whose people were harvesting the roots of the beach peavine (<em>Lathyrus littoralis</em>) and <i>so-much-tan</i>, seashore lupine (<em>Lupinus littoralis). </em>Always curious about the tribal uses of plants for food and textiles, Douglas studied baskets, hats, and pouches woven from cedar roots, sedges, cattail, and beargrass. After placing an order for four custom hats \"like the Chiefs' hats from England,\" Douglas asked his host to keep an eye on evergreen huckleberries (<i>Vaccinium ovatum</i>) growing nearby and harvest their seeds when they ripened. <br /> <br /> A few weeks later, back at Fort Vancouver, Douglas noted in his journal: \"Last night my Indian friend Cockqua arrived here from his tribe on the coast, and brought me three of the hats made on the English fashion, which I ordered when there in July... Faithful to his proposition he brought me a large paper of seeds of <em>Vaccinium ovatum</em> in a perfect state.\"<br /> <br /> Douglas revisited Cockqua's village in early spring 1827 in search of <em>sewellel</em> or mountain beaver (<i>Aplodontia rufa</i>). The naturalist had noticed robes that the lower Chinooks sewed from the skins of this small rodent, but he had never seen the actual animal, and was hoping his friend could help capture one. Cockqua was occupied with a cousin's funeral, but promised to send some specimens to Fort Vancouver as soon as possible. A month later, still keen to obtain a <em>sewellel</em>, Douglas dispatched a reminder of that promise \"to be read by my Chenook friend Cockqua.\"<br /> <br /> Douglas did eventually obtain a complete mountain beaver specimen, as well as a cloak: \"an Indian blanket or robe, formed by sewing the skins of the sewellel together. The robe contains twenty-seven skins, which have been selected when the fur was in prime order.\"<br /> <br /> During Douglas's second visit to the Columbia in 1830, he made no mention of Cockqua. The headman may have been carried away by the relapsing fever epidemic that made its first appearance that year, decimating many settlements along the river and Pacific Coast.<br /> <br /> <strong><u>References</u></strong><br /> <br /> Douglas, David. <em>Journal Kept by David Douglas During His Travels in North America. </em>London: William Wesley and Sons, 1914.<br /> <br /> Nisbet, Jack. <em>David Douglas: A Naturalist at Work</em>.

Shipmate <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/daviddouglas.htm\">David Douglas</a>, an acquaintance from Glasgow botanical circles, described Scouler as \"a man skilled in several, and devotedly attached to all, branches of Natural History.\" During the nine-month voyage, in addition to treating injured sailors, Scouler enthusiastically examined insects, arthropods, mollusks, jellyfish, flying fish, marine mammals, rocks, and birds.<br /> <br /> Upon disembarking at the mouth of the Columbia, Scouler explored the river mouth for several days, taking particular interest in the fossil shells along the beaches. Scouler joined Douglas at Fort Vancouver between May 2 and May 11, 1825, and the pair made excursions to Menzies Island, where they found a new forget-me-not. On the plain between the post and the river, they spotted coralroot and calypso orchids, and watched American Indian women harvest edible plants. \"The margins of this prairie abounded in the beautiful <em>Phalangium exulentum</em> [camas],\" Scouler wrote, \"whose roots are so much used by the Indians as a substitute for bread, while the tubers of a species of <em>Sagittaria</em> [wapato], which grows on the marshy banks of the river, affords an agreeable substitute for potatoes. In the neighboring woods we found some of the choicest plants the N.W. [Northwest] coast can boast of.\"<br /> <br /> After a fruitful summer coasting off British Columbia, cataloguing everything from intertidal seaweeds to local salmon varieties, Scouler returned to Fort Vancouver for a few days in early September and helped Douglas arrange plant specimens to send back to England. On his way downstream to board his ship home, Scouler stopped at Mount Coffin, a well-known tribal cemetery at the mouth of the Cowlitz River. There he stole bones and artifacts from burial canoes. Like many scientists of his time, Scouler viewed such remains as items of scientific interest, and later published a paper on two skulls he had collected.<br /> <br /> Although Scouler's time in the Pacific Northwest was brief, British taxonomists attached his name to an impressive variety of species, including a moss, red algae, fern, willow, a Pacific salmon, and many flowering plants, including the beautiful campanula still known as Scouler's harebell.<br /> <br /> <strong><u>References</u></strong><br /> <br /> Douglas, David. \"Sketch of a Journey to the North-western Parts of the Continent of North America, During the Years 1824, 5, 6, and 7.\" <em>Companion to the Botanical Magazine 2 </em>(1836): 82-177.<br /> <br /> Nelson, E.

Although she did not win, she did receive 10 percent of the vote.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">In 1965, Amelia asked Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to come to Selma to help in the fight for Civil Rights. They accepted, and set up headquarters in Amelia's home. It was there at home that they planned the Selma to Montgomery March, despite pressure from local law enforcement.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">On March 7, 1965, Amelia and almost 600 people (including John Lewis and Rosa Parks) gathered. Starting at the Brown Chapel AME Church, the non-violent marchers began their walk from Selma to Montgomery. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state and local police attacked them with tear gas and billy clubs. Police beat Amelia unconscious for refusing to retreat. Television and newspaper cameras recorded the violence. Over seventy marchers were beaten and seventeen hospitalized. The event became known as Bloody Sunday.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Amelia was present for the second Selma to Montgomery march that turned back at the bridge. She was also part of the third, successful march that left Brown Chapel on March 21 under heavy guard provided by President Lyndon Johnson. When the march arrived at the Alabama State Capitol on March 25, it was over 25,000 strong.[3] The Selma to Montgomery marches were key events that resulted in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">In later life, Amelia married a former classmate, James Robinson. They settled in Tuskegee. In 1990, Amelia received the Martin Luther King, Jr. Freedom Medal. The Oscar-nominated film, Selma, depicts her role in Bloody Sunday.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Amelia Boynton Robinson died in 2015. Just months before her death, Amelia crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge again, this time with President Obama and Congressman John Lewis. They, and hundreds of others, were there to mark the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><strong>Notes:</strong> </span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">[1] Hill Hall at Savannah State College, built in 1901, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1981.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">[2] Tuskegee University was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966 and designated a National Historic Landmark on June 23, 1965.

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Christopher Gadsden was born in Charleston on February 16, 1724, the son of Elizabeth and Thomas Gadsden, a customs collector. Gadsden received a classical education in England before completing a four-year apprenticeship in Philadelphia. Between 1745 and 1747, he served as purser aboard the British man-of-war <em>Aldborough</em>. With money from his time at sea and a large inheritance from his parents, who had both died by 1741, Gadsden started one of the most profitable mercantile careers in the Carolinas. By 1774, he owned four stores, several merchant vessels, two rice plantations, a residential district in Charleston called Gadsdenboro, and a large wharf on the Cooper River. A portion of Gadsden’s Wharf is now the site of the Liberty Square Visitor Education Center, a ferry departure location for Fort Sumter.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Possessing financial independence and a desire to serve, Gadsden pursued public office. In 1757 he began his nearly three decades of service in the Commons House of Assembly. He first revealed himself as a vocal defender of American rights during the Cherokee War by attacking British colonel James Grant for taking command of local troops above provincial colonel Thomas Middleton. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Gadsden continued to champion American home rule and to oppose Parliamentary supremacy at the Stamp Act Congress in New York in 1765. During the next decade, Gadsden joined with Charleston mechanics (Sons of Liberty) to lead the local Patriots against every perceived threat to American rights. Gadsden’s influence and dedication earned him election to the First Continental Congress where his extremism manifested itself in proposals to reject all Parliamentary legislation since 1763, to attack the Royal Navy in American waters, and to instruct each colony to prepare for war.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Gadsden returned to South Carolina in February 1776 to serve as colonel of the First Regiment and as a member of the Provincial Congress, during which time he coauthored the South Carolina constitution of 1776. In the summer of 1776, Gadsden commanded Fort Johnson during the British attack on Sullivan’s Island. He offered congratulations to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-moultrie.htm\">Col. William Moultrie</a> after the decisive victory over the Royal Navy.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1778, Gadsden helped secure the disestablishment of the Anglican Church and popular election of senators in the new state constitution. Gadsden served as vice president, later as lieutenant governor once South Carolina joined the other colonies under the Articles of Confederation. Similar to the Patriot firebrand of Massachusetts, Samuel Adams, Gadsden’s role diminished following the Declaration of Independence. Gadsden’s zealous personality also proved counterproductive in working relationships with other officers and politicians. In 1777, Gadsden resigned his commission as brigadier general after conflict with General Robert Howe.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">During the siege of Charleston in 1780, Gadsden insisted the Continental Army remain in Charleston, contributing to the largest surrender in American military history until the Civil War. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-lincoln.htm\">Maj. Gen. Benjamin Lincoln</a> allowed the attendance of the Privy Council in his councils of war. Historians agree that Lincoln should not have allowed Gadsden to dominate the military conferences. Gadsden, representing South Carolina after the departure of Governor Rutledge, declared that \"the Militia were willing to Live upon Rice alone rather than give up the Town upon any Terms.\"After the surrender of Charleston, Gadsden was paroled to his home. <br /> <br /> British General Earl Cornwallis, fearing the influence leading Patriots had over the populace, arrested about twenty paroled civil officers. </p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">\"His Lordship in order to secure the quiet of the province, finds himself under the necessity to direct the Commandant to order several Persons to change their Place of Residence on Parole from Charles Town to St. Augustine; His Lordship has further directed that a proper Vessell be provided to carry their Baggage with them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">When they arrived, Governor Tonyn of British East Florida offered them freedom of the town if they would give their parole. Gadsden was the only one to refuse, even with the threat of a dungeon, stating \"Prepare it then. I will give no parole, so help me God!\" Gadsden suffered during his time as a prisoner in the dungeon of Castillo de San Marcos. He endured 42 weeks of confinement in the dungeon, suffering from a poor diet and psychological warfare as the British lied to him about the progress of the war and then threatened him with hanging should the Patriots hang Major John Andre for his role in Arnold's treason. Fortunately for the South Carolinians, they were included in a general exchange of prisoners and arrived in Philadelphia in July 1781. <br /> <br /> Gadsden returned to public service, joining the state's House of Representatives in Jacksonboro. At this session, Governor Rutledge surrendered his office. Gadsden was elected as governor, but declined citing his poor health. He returned to public service briefly in 1788 to vote for ratification of the US Constitution and again in 1790 to serve in the state's constitutional convention. Gadsden died on August 28, 1805 from head injuries suffered in a fall near his home. </p>",

            "bodyText": "James Brown was born in Culpeper County, Virginia around 1845. As far as we can tell, he did not serve during the Civil War, but he was old enough that he could have. By the middle of his tenure in the Army, in the 1880s, Brown was stationed in Bonita Canyon, Arizona, during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">Geronimo Campaign</a>. While in Bonita Canyon, Brown may have added his initials to a stone in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">Garfield Monument</a>, which men in the 10th Cavalry created to honor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/james-garfield-the-great-what-if-president.htm\">President James Garfield</a>.<br /> <br /> Troop I, of which Brown was a First Sergeant, replaced Troops E and H at Camp Bonita, and added one stone with many men's initials on it to the monument. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?id=878CEEE0-B077-4155-8293-10E417E694A3\">stone</a> has Troop I, 10, various initials (including possibly Brown's), and three linked ovals engraved into it. The linked ovals are a symbol of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, a black fraternal order. Brown held the ranks of Sergeant and First Sergeant during his long military career, which was cut short when he froze to death between Havre and <a href=\"https://fortassinniboine.org/about/\">Fort Assinniboine</a>, Montana.<br /> <br /> Brown's gravestone has the Freemason symbol on it, indicating that he, like many other black soldiers, was a member of a Prince Hall Masonic Lodge. One of the first black military masonic lodges was established near Fort Davis, Texas, in 1883 and was called the Baldwin Lodge, likely after Troop I's commander, Captain Theodore Baldwin. Since it was a military lodge, its location moved with the soldiers, and in 1887 Baldwin Lodge #16 was at Fort Verde, AZ, and in 1889 it moved to Fort Apache, AZ. <br /> <br /> Based on his military records, Brown was stationed in: <br /> <br /> Washington, D.C., 1867 (10th Cavalry, Troop J)<br /> Ft. Sill, OK 1872 (10th Cavalry, Troop I)<br /> Ft. Richardson, TX 1877<br /> Camp near Presidio, TX 1882<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fobo/index.htm\">Ft.

Leavenworth</a>, KS 1892<br /> <br /> Almost nothing is known about Brown’s personal life, and until we find out more, this biography and others like it will be incomplete and imbalanced. From his military records, it appears his widow (name unknown) filed for his pension after his death.

Key was a private in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battle-units-detail.htm?battleUnitCode=UUS0111RI00C\">111th US Colored Troops</a> during the Civil War, and deserted his troop on December 28, 1864, in Nashville, TN. A few days later, on January 2, 1865, he was apprehended and confined in military prison for three or four months. His pay was stopped for 90 days, and he rejoined his troop in May, 1865. Without any personal records, we do not know the story behind Key’s desertion, and have to rely on military documents.<br /> <br /> Just a year after he mustered out of the 111th USCT, Key joined the newly formed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/history-10th-cav.htm\">10th Cavalry,</a> Troop E. He spent the rest of his military career in Troop E, including time in Arizona, during the military's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">Geronimo Campaign</a>. While in southern Arizona, Key carved his name into a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">stone monument</a> honoring President James Garfield. By the end of his time in the Army, Key was an Orderly Sergeant, and his character was regularly listed as “excellent.”<br /> <br /> Based on his enlistment records, we know Key was stationed throughout the United States:  <ul> <li>Athens, AL 1864</li> <li>Nashville, TN 1865 (military prison for deserting)</li> <li>Nashville, TN 1866 (muster out of 111th USCT)</li> <li>Memphis, TN 1867 (10th Cavalry, Troop E)</li> <li><a href=\"http://sill-www.army.mil/History/\">Ft.

Cole’s military career began when he was 21, when he enlisted in Company K of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battle-units-detail.htm?battleUnitCode=UUS0012RAH0C\">12th US Colored Heavy Artillery</a>.  After the Civil War was over, and Congress passed the Army Organization Act, allowing black soldiers to serve in segregated Army units, Cole enlisted in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/history-10th-cav.htm\">10th Cavalry,</a> Troop H, where he spent the rest of his career. Cole held the rank of Sergeant for many years.<br /> <br /> Cole was stationed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/foda/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Ft. Davis, Texas</a>, where he married Estephana Gonzales in 1882. They had one son, Joseph Cole, born December 26, 1894 in El Paso, Texas. While Cole was stationed in Arizona in 1886, he and five other men (including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-casey.htm\">John Casey</a>) in Troop H <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">helped capture Chief Mangus</a>, the last major Chiricahua Apache chief to surrender to the US government. Cole also contributed a hand-carved stone to a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">monument to President James A. Garfield</a>, in Bonita Canyon, Arizona, a temporary camp where he was stationed for about six months.<br /> <br /> Cole was stationed in various places across the country:  <ul> <li> <ul> <li>Bowling Green, KY 1865</li> <li>Louisville, KY 1866</li> <li>Ft.

Buford, ND 1892</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <br /> Cole retired from the Army in North Dakota, and it appears that he returned to his home state of Kentucky, where he died in 1900. Much of what is known about Pollard Cole and other Buffalo Soldiers stationed at Bonita Canyon is gleaned from enlistments, court documents, and other official records.

Almost nothing is known about his early life. In an 1860 list of \"free inhabitants\" in Maryland, Harris (13 years old) was included. When he was 19, Harris enlisted with the 30<sup>th</sup> Colored Infantry, Company H, based out of Maryland. His USCT (United States Colored Troops) enlistment remarked that he was a \"slave,\" he was 5’5” and had a relatively fair complexion. He was recorded as “griff,” which was a racial term for someone who was lighter skinned.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">After enlisting with his regiment on March 11, 1864, he served in major campaigns such as the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/african-americans-at-the-siege.htm\">Sieges of Petersburg</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> and Richmond, and the battles for Weldon Railroad, Poplar Grove Church, and Boydton Plank Road. Harris’ company also participated in the first and second expeditions against Fort Fisher, as well as its eventual capture on January 15, 1865. When Wilmington, North Carolina was captured, Harris’ company was there as well. When Confederate General Joseph E. Johnson surrendered to Union Major-General William T. Sherman at Bennett Farm April 26, 1865, Harris was there for the largest surrender of Confederate troops in the Civil War.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Harris mustered out of the USCT on December 10, 1865, and in early April 1875, Harris enlisted with Troop A of the 10<sup>th</sup> Cavalry in Baltimore, MD.

Harris served in the 10<sup>th</sup> Cavalry and 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry during his military career.

George was from the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. An Ojibway pipemaker, he was long associated with the park. George was a seasonal laborer in the early 1950’s, then in 1970 he was hired as a seasonal cultural demonstrator, a job he continued to do until 1983. One of his projects at the park was the construction of a buffalo hide tipi, which was completed in 1960. In the late 1970’s he made another buffalo hide tipi along with an eagle headdress and staff, all which were on display for over 40 years at Pipestone National Monument.<br /> <br /> Winona was a daughter of Moses and Estelle Crow. The family moved to Pipestone in 1927 from Granite Falls, Minnesota. Winona was married to George Bryan (“Standing Eagle”). They followed the family tradition of quarrying and carving, as they were taught by Winona’s father Moses. Winona carved many items from the pipestone but the turtle, which represents long life and fertility, was her favorite. The largest turtle made by Winona remains on display at the Monument.<br /> <br /> George could often be found on the trail, carving pipes and interpreting his work and the history of the site to visitors. He was known for his skill in carving bison and disk pipes. Winona and George were members of the original Pipestone Indian Shrine Association and Winona was also a member of the Pipestone County Historical Society. In her younger years, she was well known as a champion dancer in many tribal pow-wows.<br />  <br /> The Bryans first started quarrying in the early 1930’s. Their quarry is known as the Spotted Quarry, and remains in the Bryan family today. <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\"\"><span style=\"color:black\"> </span></span></span><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Benjamin Lincoln, major general in the Continental Army, was one of the few individuals present at the three major surrenders of the American Revolution: Saratoga, Charleston, and Yorktown. He followed his military career with public service at the state and federal level. <br /> <br /> Lincoln was born on January 24, 1733 in Hingham, Massachusetts. He attended local schools and then established his own farm. Elected town clerk in 1757, he gradually became prominent in the colony's militia and politics. By 1772, he had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and had been elected to the colonial legislature. He rose to prominence in the Seven Years' War where he gained experience in military planning and organization. He later served as the secretary of the provincial assembly that replaced the colonial legislature in defiance of the Boston Port Bill. In February 1776, the Massachusetts legislature appointed him a major general of militia. His service in the New York campaign, especially his command of militia soldiers who bought General Washington's army time to retreat to White Plains, New York, earned him praise and recognition. Acting on Washington's recommendation, the Continental Congress appointed him a major general in the Continental Army on February 14, 1777. <br /> <br /> Lincoln's first combat experience as a major general in the Continental Army came in the Battle of Bound Brook on April 13, 1777, an engagement in which the British and Hessians attempted to surprise a portion of the Continental Army at the end of the winter encampment. Defeated by British General Cornwallis, Lincoln successfuly led his men away from capture. Lincoln received orders from Washington in July 1777 to travel to upstate New York and aid in the defense of the state from British General Burgoyne's march down the Hudson River. <br /> <br /> Lincoln's task was to raise the New England militia and harass British supply lines in the vicinity of Fort Ticonderoga. His command had some success but was weakened by the lack of cooperation from leading New England militia generals like John Stark. Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates, commander of the Northern Department, ordered Lincoln to join his forces. Lincoln arrived after the Battle of Freeman's Farm. Lincoln's militia played no role in the Battle of Bemis Heights as they were on the other side of the river from the decisive Patriot victory in which then-Patriot General Benedict Arnold won fame for his bravery.  In a skirmish following the battle, Lincoln's ankle was shattered by a British musket ball while his men defended a ford over the Hudson River. He spent several months recovering at his home in Hingham. The injury left his affected leg two inches shorter than the other, and the danger of infection loomed. <br /> <br /> The Continental Congress, impressed with Lincoln's service, chose him to replace Maj. Gen. Robert Howe as commander of the Southern Department in September 1778. Lincoln arrived in Charleston to take command in December, nearly coinciding with the British capture of Savannah, Georgia. Lincoln wanted to drive the British out of Georgia, but his actions in Georgia exposed South Carolina to attack. His spring 1779 campaign against the British in Georgia, marching on Augusta, prompted British General Augustine Prevost to attack Charleston. The British devastated Patriot properties in the Lowcountry near Charleston, threatening the city, and forced Lincoln's army to return to South Carolina. Lincoln complained to General William Moultrie, \"it appears...that I have lost the confidence of the people.\" Contemplating resignation, Moultrie and Governor Rutledge convinced Lincoln to remain. Lincoln then led American forces in the disastrous Franco-American Siege of Savannah in October 1779, in which the Patriots and French suffered almost 1,000 casualties. This largely forgotten battle was one of the war's bloodiest and also significant for the over 500 free black Haitian soldiers in the French command.<br /> <br /> Following this defeat, Lincoln then presided over the largest defeat of American forces during the American Revolution, the surrender of Charleston and 5,000 soldiers. He decided to hold Charleston against a combined British army and navy expedition, commanded by General Sir Henry Clinton and Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot. After a siege of six weeks on the peninsula of Charleston, without effective support from the Continental Navy, Lincoln capitulated on May 12, 1780. <br /> <br /> Exchanged in November 1780, Lincoln served as second in command to Washington during the Yorktown campaign. Feigning illness, British General Cornwallis declined to attend the surrender ceremony. His second in command, Brig. Gen. Charles O'Hara, attempted to surrender his sword to Washington. Washington declined and motioned toward Lincoln, who accepted the sword. <br /> <br /> During the last years of the American Revolution, Lincoln served as the first Secretary at War, under the Congress of the Confederation, from 1781 - 83. In 1787, he was a member of the Massachusetts state convention that ratified the US Constitution. He later held various positions in the Massachusetts government and, also as a reward for his Federalist politics, served as the Collector of the Port of Boston, a lucrative federal appointment he held for about twenty years until his retirement in 1809. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>As commander of the XIV Army Corps at Chickamauga and commander of the Army of the Cumberland at Chattanooga, Major General George H. Thomas played a prominent role in the Chattanooga Campaign. Born into a large slave owning family in Southampton County, Virginia, Thomas displayed talent that earned him a cadetship at West Point, where he graduated in the Class of 1840, ranking twelfth in a class of forty two cadets. His pre-Civil War experience included garrison duty at Forts Moultrie and McHenry and combat experience during the Mexican-American War, where he served as a lieutenant in Captain Braxton Bragg's Battery E, 3rd US Artillery, becoming close friends with his future foe. With peace, Thomas saw service in Florida before being appointed to teach cavalry and artillery tactics at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1851, largely due to a recommendation from Bragg. Thomas had a number of his future subordinates and foes as students there and became close with the Academy's superintendent, Robert E. Lee. While at West Point, he also met Frances Lucretia Kellogg, from Troy, New York, whom he married in 1852.</p> <p>Thomas returned to the field in 1854, being transferred to California where he was appointed a major in the newly created 2nd United States Cavalry, once again due to a recommendation from his old friend, Braxton Bragg. Thomas renewed his friendship with fellow Virginian and second-in-command of his new regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Lee. Thomas saw action against the Comanche, and during this conflict, he received his only wound, being struck by an arrow in his chin and chest in a skirmish along the Brazos River in August of 1860. Upon his recovery, Thomas asked for a leave of absence. It was during this time that he faced one of the most difficult decisions of his life, whether to stay true to the United States Army or join many other Southern officers in resigning and offering their services to their home states as they left the Union. Thomas's decision ultimately resulted in members of his family disowning him.</p> <p>Thomas stayed true to the Union and was appointed brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers, organizing and training Kentucky and Tennessee volunteers at Camp Dick Robinson, Kentucky. He won the first major victory for the Union in the Western Theater at Mill Springs, Kentucky, on January 19, 1862. Promoted major general of volunteers in April, Thomas participated in subsequent battles and campaigns in 1862 that included Corinth, Mississippi, Perryville, Kentucky, and Stones River (Murfreesboro), Tennessee.</p> <p>As the Chattanooga campaign unfolded in the summer of 1863, Thomas' corps marched over the Cumberland Mountains and crossed the Tennessee River at Bridgeport and Stevenson, Alabama, in late August, early September. At Chickamauga, Major General William S. Rosecrans, commander of the Union Army of the Cumberland, gave Thomas the responsibility for defending the left of the Union line and the LaFayette Road, the crucial road leading north to Chattanooga. As one-third of the Union Army, including Rosecrans, retreated north toward Chattanooga on the second day of the battle, Thomas took command of the remaining Union troops on the field, organized them, and successfully defended Snodgrass Hill and Horseshoe Ridge. His defense permitted the safe withdrawal of the Army of the Cumberland to Chattanooga and earned him the nickname \"Rock of Chickamauga.\"</p> <p>When Rosecrans was relieved of command in October, Thomas was appointed the new commander of the Army of the Cumberland. It was Thomas's army that broke the two month siege of Chattanooga by scaling the heights of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863, and routing the Confederate left and center. In 1864, he participated in the Atlanta campaign and oversaw the defense of Nashville, where he defeated the army of his former pupil, John Bell Hood, in December of 1864. This victory earned him the thanks of Congress.</p> <p>With the end of the Civil War, Thomas continued in military service, commanding the Department of the Cumberland through 1869 and leading the fight against the campaign of terror and intimidation of the newly formed Ku Klux Klan. In 1869, Thomas was transferred to San Francisco to command the Division of the Pacific. He died there from a stroke on March 28, 1870, and was buried in his wife's hometown of Troy, New York with full military honors.</p> <p align=\"center\"><em><u>Bibliography</u></em></p> <p>Cleaves, Freeman. <em>Rock of Chickamauga: The Life of General George H.

He also taught as an instructor at the US Military Academy at West Point until the outbreak of the American Civil War. After being assigned to brigade command in the Pennsylvania Reserves, Reynolds briefly served as military governor of Fredericksburg, Virginia during the spring of 1862 before leading his brigade in the Seven Days Battles around Richmond. Reynolds was captured by the Confederates after the Battle of Gaines' Mill and placed in Libby Prison, but was exchanged on August 13, 1862, just before the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).<br /> <br /> When he returned to the army, Reynolds was elevated to command of the Pennsylvania Reserves Division since its commander, Brig. Gen. George A. McCall, had himself been captured only two days after Reynolds.<br /> <br /> Since the V Corps (in which Reynolds served) had been detailed to support John Pope's Army of Virginia, Reynolds was present at the Second Battle of Manassas. On the second full day of the battle, even as most of the Union forces were retreating, Reynolds led his men in a final determined counterattack on Henry Hill. This action proved crucial in giving the Union Army time to retreat and avoid destruction.<br /> <br /> Following the Second Battle of Manassas, Pennsylvania Governor Andrew G. Curtin requested that Reynolds be pulled away from the Army of the Potomac to command the Pennsylvania Militia. Consequently, during the Maryland Campaign, Reynolds was stationed in Pennsylvania drilling the home guard and missed the Battle of Antietam.<br /> <br /> Reynolds returned to the Army of the Potomac in time to lead his division in the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. On July 1, 1863, as he led his First Corps into line on McPherson Ridge to stop the Confederate advance toward Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Reynolds was shot in the head by a Confederate sharpshooter, killing him instantly. Command passed to his senior division commander, Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday. Reynolds was the highest ranking officer on either side killed at Gettysburg.  <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>Former Governor, Actor, Businessman, Bodybuilder, (1947–)<br /> Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, in Thal, a small village near Graz, Austria. At a young age, he enjoyed watching movies, in particular Reg Parker, a body builder and star in B-level Hercules movies. The films also helped start Schwarzenegger's own obsession with America, and the future he felt awaited him there. Schwarzenegger found his answer in bodybuilding, entering in contests such as Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia.</em></p> <p>In all, Schwarzenegger won five Mr. Universe titles and six Mr. Olympia crowns during his bodybuilding career. After Schwarzenegger immigrated to the United States in 1968, at the age of 21, he helped propel bodybuilding into the mainstream, culminating in the 1977 documentary, Pumping Iron, which tells the tale of Schwarzenegger's defense of his Mr. Olympia crown.  From 1990 to 1993, Arnold promoted fitness as Chairman of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Wilson\">Pete Wilson</a>. He has been an activist for the Special Olympics. He founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide.</p> <p>After acting in a few small parts, such as Hercules in New York and The Long Goodbye, Schwarzenegger landed a bigger role in the film Stay Hungry and was awarded a Golden Globe. With his intense physical strength and size, Schwarzenegger was a natural for action films. He became a big hit in several popular 1980s action movies, including Conan the Barbarian. Schwarzenegger also starred as a deadly machine from the future in The Terminator and as a mercenary in The Expendables.</p> <p>Off-screen he continued his remarkable story, joining the Kennedy family by marrying Maria Owings Shriver, daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her husband R. Sargent Shriver.</p> <p>In 2003, Schwarzenegger won the California governor's seat in a special recall election. In a state that was mired in severe budget woes, the newly elected Republican governor promised to bring economic stability to his adopted state. As governor, Schwarzenegger worked to improve the state's financial situation, promote new businesses, and protect the environment. In 2006, he was re-elected for a second term. In his second term as governor, Schwarzenegger struggled to help California through difficult financial times. Throughout his political career, Schwarzenegger credited former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as an inspiration. Schwarzenegger said, \"I became a citizen of the United States when [Reagan] was president, and he is the first president I voted for as an American citizen. He inspired me and made me even prouder to be a new American.\"</p> <p>After leaving office in January 2011, he sought to revive his career in the entertainment industry.  Schwarzenegger starred alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone in the film The Expendables. In August 2012, he reunited with the film's cast for a follow-up film, The Expendables 2. Schwarzenegger rejoined Sylvester Stallone for The Expendables 3 in 2014. He returned to the film franchise that made him a star the following year. Schwarzenegger starred in Terminator Genisys with Jason Clarke and Emilia Clarke.</p> <p>For a good part of his professional life, Arnold has been an entrepreneur and successful businessman. By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of successful business ventures and investments. His current net worth is estimated in the hundreds of millions.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger has also a solid track record as an environmental activist for reducing greenhouse gases.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian/United States citizen. He holds Austrian citizenship by birth and has held U.S. citizenship since 1983. Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities to keep his Austrian citizenship, since Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he kept his Austrian citizenship.<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\"\"> </span></span></span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Susie King Taylor, teacher and nurse, achieved many firsts in a lifetime of overcoming adversity and helping elevate others out of slavery. As the author of <i>Reminiscences of My Life in Camp with the 33d United States Colored Troops, Late 1st S.C. Volunteers</i>, she was the only African American woman to publish a memoir of her wartime experiences. <br /> <br /> Susie Baker was born into slavery near Savannah, Georgia in 1848. Despite Georgia's harsh laws against the formal education of African Americans, she attended two secret schools taught by black women. Her literacy proved invaluable not only to her but to other African Americans she educated during the war. She became free at the age of 14 when her uncle led her out to a federal gunboat plying the waters near Confederate-held Fort Pulaski.<br /> <br /> Baker and thousands of other African American refugees found themselves seeking safety behind Union lines on the South Carolina Sea Islands. She soon attached herself to the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first black regiment in the US Army. First organized by Major General David Hunter, the military governor Rufus Saxton would become the driving force behind the unit’s creation.<br /> <br /> Taylor originally worked as the regimental laundress and throughout the war would perform the essential duties of cooking and washing. However, her literacy proved most useful and enabled her to serve as the reading instructor for the regiment of former slaves. The unit’s white abolitionist colonel, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, later wrote of his men, “Their love of the spelling-book is perfectly inexhaustible.” <br /> <br /> Taylor married Sergeant Edward King of the First South Carolina in 1862. Together they remained with the unit until it was mustered out of service in 1866. Postwar, the Kings moved to Savannah, Georgia. She hoped to continue her teaching career and opened a private school for the children of freedmen. Unfortunately, her husband died the same year, and a public school opening caused her private school to fail. By 1868, Taylor was forced to find work as a domestic servant. <br /> <br /> She moved to Boston in 1872 where she married Russell Taylor in 1879. She devoted much of the rest of her life to work with the Woman’s Relief Corps, a national organization for female Civil War veterans. She died in 1912, ten years after publishing her memoir.</p>",

She was raised there until the late 1930s. <br />  </p> <h4>Growing up at Tanalian Point</h4> <p>As a child, Katie had no formal education except for occasional visits to Nondalton and lessons from neighbors, Doc Dutton and Joe Kackley. Doc and Joe, as they were known in the Lake Clark region, were friends of the Trefon family and taught the younger Trefon children, including Katie, to read and write. In a 1975 interview, Katie recalled: </p> <p>“...these two white people, one was Doc Dutton and one was Joe Kackley. They had little correspondence books for us. They taught us five days a week for a couple of hours a day. Sometimes in the evenings just let us read and write and stuff like that. And once in a great while we went to Nondalton to visit the school kids…” <br /> <br /> In the late 1930s, Katie married her first husband William “Billy” Hill in Iliamna. Hill was a Finnish-born boat builder, motor vessel captain, prospector, trapper and Bristol Bay fisherman. After their marriage they resided in Iliamna where Hill built a home. They had five children before Hill died in 1944. Several years later, Katie married Chester Wilson.<br />  </p> <h4>A Subsistence Way of Life</h4> <p>In a 1975 interview, Katie remembered her mother trapping lynx, wolverine, fox, beaver, otter and muskrats in the Chulitna area, remembering:</p> <p>“My mom did...Sometimes we used to go across the lake ….that’s where the beaver and otters and muskrats and everything in that river [were] so we used to go and trap over there.” </p> <p>Katie’s mother, Mary Ann Trefon, born between Tyonek and the Yukon area in 1878 and married to Trefon Balluta. As American traders and prospectors began to enter the Bristol Bay uplands and the Cook Inlet region, her mother was raised in an era of considerable change. When Mary Ann was young, there was little food to eat --  as a result she kept busy throughout the year obtaining various subsistence foods for her family. Katie stated:</p> <p>“I don’t remember being without meat. Wintertime we fished through the ice-got some grayling and white fish and what we called candlefish and then we had set hooks for ling cod and lake trout so we had fresh fish all the time whenever we wanted and had salt fish in barrels.”<br /> <br /> Learn more about the Dena’ina subsistence way of life and gain a deeper insight into a <a href=\"https://nps.gov/articles/a-grateful-heart.htm\">historic photo </a> of Katie Trefon Wilson and her mother, Mary Ann Trefon, circa 1927. </p>",

Planners for the March used the NUL headquarters office in New York for their meetings and Young served as a featured speaker. Following the March, Young advocated for federal assistance to cities combating poverty. He developed a 10-point domestic program, the \"Domestic Marshall Plan\" as a strategy for combating poverty and closing the wealth gap between Black and White Americans. Young's plan was influential to President Johnson's War on Poverty and was partially incorporated into the legislation. In 1968, the Johnson administration awarded Young the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.</div>",

After years of shipping parts and hauling them to his store, Dempster decided to start manufacturing his own windmills in 1885.<br /> <br /> In 1886, he incorporated the business renaming it the Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company. With the infusion of outside money, he built a large factory. A larger manufacturing facility was constructed in 1898 a few blocks away where Dempsters LLC still operates today.<br /> <br /> Mr. Dempster navigated the company through difficult times including economic depressions and the First World War. Over his years of management, the company created innovative designs based on the needs of farmers. This included expanding into agricultural equipment in 1897. C. B.

Dempster operated the Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company until his death 1933. He served as president for forty-six years, from incorporation in 1886 until his death.

            "bodyText": "<h3>Early Life</h3> James Knox Polk was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina but moved with his family to Tennessee in 1806. Polk attended the University of North Carolina graduating with honors. James Polk studied law and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1820. Polk had larger designs for himself.<br /> <br /> He sought and won election to the Tennessee legislature in 1823. While serving in the legislature, Polk became a firm supporter of Andrew Jackson. A year later, Polk would marry Sarah Childress. The couple would never have children. Polk’s political ambitions would take him to the Tennessee Governor’s Office in 1839.  <h3>Presidential Election of 1844</h3> In 1844 James Polk found himself the favorite for the Democratic Vice-Presidential nomination. But instead he turned his eyes towards the Presidency. Basing his platform on U.S. expansionism, Polk defeated Henry Clay, the Whig Presidential nominee, and become the first “dark horse” President.<br /> <br /> During his campaign, Polk stated Texas should be re-annexed and Oregon re-occupied. Polk was able to settle the Oregon issue with Great Britain diplomatically. The result of which was an agreement on a boundary at the 49th parallel. Texas would prove to be a different matter.<br /> <br /> In 1845, the United States annexed Texas making it the 28th state. Mexico viewed this as an act of aggression because it had never recognized Texas independence. In addition, Mexico maintained the southern boundary of Texas was the Nueces River. Texas countered that claimed by maintaining the Rio Grande to be its southern boundary.<br /> <br /> Further complicating relations between the U.S. and Mexico was Polk's desire to acquire the California and the New Mexico territories from Mexico. To this end Polk sent John Slidell to Mexico, offering $20 million in exchange for this vast territory. Slidell did not receive a warm welcome when he arrived. No one with the authority to enter such negotiations would comprise their political career by doing so. <h3>War with Mexico</h3> With expansion progress stalling, Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to the disputed area between Texas and Mexico. Taylor and his Army of Occupation arrived on the banks of the Rio Grande in March 1846. The Mexican government mobilized a force to dislodge General Taylor and his troops. The two armies clashed on May 8th at Palo Alto and May 9th at Resaca de la Palma starting the U.S.-Mexican War. The Mexican Army was unsuccessful and Taylor continued his campaign into northern Mexico earning victories at Monterrey and Buena Vista.<br /> <br /> Still unable to get Mexico to negotiate, President Polk sent General Winfield Scott on a campaign to capture the Mexican capital. General Scott's army landed at Veracruz capturing the port city and then on into the Valley of Mexico. The general took Mexico City in September 1847 after a spirited defense of the capital by General Santa Ana's Army. The war was over. <h3>Sea to Shining Sea</h3> The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in February 1848, settled the border question between Texas and Mexico and outlined the exchange of California and New Mexico for $15 million. President Polk had finally achieved what he had set out to do, extend the boundaries of the U.S. from sea to shining sea. The U.S. had acquitted about 1 million square miles as a result of the war. The addition of territory came with a price. The addition of this new land stirred debate between the North and the South over the expansion of slavery—a debate that erupted 13 years later in the Civil War. <h3>Post-Presidency</h3> President James K. Polk maintained his pledge to serve only one term. His time in the Oval Office took its toll on his health. He and Sarah Polk embarked on a tour of the South in early March 1849. The plan was to end the tour in Nashville where Polk had purchased a home, later known as Polk Place. James Polk became ill along the way and feared he had contracted cholera.<br /> <br /> The couple eventually made it to Nashville in early April. All was well until June when Polk fell ill again, more than likely with cholera. He held on for some days, eventually dying on June 15, 1849. Sarah Polk would live at Polk Place for another 42 years. ",

An outspoken suffragist and feminist, she tirelessly led the charge for women's suffrage and equal rights in the United States. Born to a New Jersey Quaker family in 1885, young Alice grew up attending suffragist meetings with her mother.[1] She pursued an unusually high level of education for a woman of her time, graduating Swarthmore College in 1905. She also received her master's in sociology in 1907, a PhD in economics in 1912 from the University of Pennsylvania, and a law degree (LLB) from the Washington College of Law at American University in 1922.<br /> <br /> While continuing her studies in England, she made the acquaintance of militant British suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. Pankhurst’s group used disruptive and radical tactics including smashing windows and prison hunger strikes. Police arrested and imprisoned Paul many times for her involvement with the group. Forever changed by her experiences, Paul returned to the United States in 1910 and turned her attention to the American suffrage movement.

Paul believed that the movement needed to focus on the passage of a federal suffrage amendment to the US Constitution.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">When she first returned to the United States, Alice Paul attempted to work with the main US suffrage organization, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). They appointed her chair of the NAWSA Congressional Committee in 1912.

The carefully planned parade turned into a near riot when spectators began assaulting the women and the police refused to intervene. The cavalry from Fort Myer eventually restored order and the parade continued. Disagreements over the parade and fundraising lead to growing tension between Alice Paul and the NAWSA leadership.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">In 1916, Paul founded the National Woman’s Party (NWP). Paul adopted the Pankhursts’ imperative to “hold the party in power responsible.” The NWP withheld its support from existing political parties until women had gained the right to vote and “punished” those parties in power who did not support suffrage. Through dramatic protests, marches, and demonstrations, the suffrage movement gained popular support.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">In 1917, Alice Paul and the NWP began </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">picketing the White House</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"> -- the first time ever anyone had protested there. When World War I started, people felt that the nonviolent protests by these “Silent Sentinels” was disloyal. The women were harassed and beaten, and were repeatedly arrested and jailed on charges of “obstructing traffic.” The women were sent to the Occoquan Workhouse (prison) in Virginia and the District Jail in DC.[2] Prison conditions were awful. In October 1917, Alice Paul and others went on a hunger strike in protest. In response, the prison guards restrained and force-fed her through a tube. In November 1917, the superintendent of Occoquan ordered over forty guards to attack the Silent Sentinels. Battered, choked, and beaten, some to unconsciousness, the women described it as the “Night of Terror.”<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Paul and the NWP continue to organize protests outside the White House until 1919, when Congress voted to send the Susan B. Anthony Amendment to the states for ratification. In 1920, the required 36 states ratified the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, making it the </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">19th Amendment to the US Constitution</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">. The 19th Amendment paved the way for most women to vote by removing sex as legitimate legal reason to deny a woman the right to vote. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Paul believed the vote was just the first step in the quest for full gender equality. In 1922, she reorganized the NWP with the goal of eliminating all discrimination against women. On July 20, 1923, 75 years after the first women's rights convention in 1848, Paul introduced the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), also known as the Lucretia Mott Amendment, in Seneca Falls, NY.[3] It launched what would be a lifelong campaign to win full equality for women. In 1929, the National Woman’s Party moved into a permanent headquarters in the Sewell House on Capitol Hill. The NWP renamed the house the Alva Belmont House in honor of their primary benefactor.[4]</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Concerned not only with the rights of American women, but also with those of women around the world, Paul founded the World Woman’s Party, which served as the NWP’s international organization until 1954. In 1945, she was instrumental in incorporating language regarding women’s equality in the United Nations Charter, and in establishing a permanent UN Commission on the Status of Women. In the 1960s, she also played a role in getting sex included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Alice died in 1977 at a Quaker facility in Moorestown, New Jersey.

Evers and his wife Myrlie established the NAACP office in Jackson, Mississippi in the mid-1950s. He tirelessly led marches, prayer vigils, voter registration drives and boycotts. As early as 1955, Evers' name appeared on a death list. Yet he persistently appealed to blacks and whites to work together for a peaceful solution to social problems. The eyes of the nation turned to Jackson in the early 1960s as Evers orchestrated a boycott of white merchants. Backed by federal troops, he also led efforts to help James Meredith integrate the University of Mississippi in 1962. When disgruntled racists hurled a firebomb into the Evers home in 1963, Myrlie Evers bravely put out the flames with a garden hose. Evers continued his work, but an assassin's bullet ended his life a few weeks later outside his home. Evers' brother Charles took up his work as the NAACP field secretary in Mississippi. In 1994 - 31 years and three trials later - Evers' killer, Byron De La Beckwith, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p> <p>As the child of a Mississippi farmer, Medgar Evers experienced racism everyday. White children on school buses taunted him as he walked 12 miles each way to the ill-equipped school for black children. Friends became lynching victims. Evers joined the Army and served honorably in Germany and France during World War II. When he returned, he joined the NAACP after a mob of armed whites wouldn't let him enter the polls to vote. He enrolled in Alcorn College (1948-1952) and married fellow college student Myrlie Beasley in 1951. Over the next two years, Evers worked as an insurance salesman in Mound Bayou and organized NAACP chapters throughout the Mississippi Delta.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Mr. Lockwood attended Washington State University and participated in the Air Force Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. Following graduation, he served as an officer in the United States Air Force from September 1979 until June 1996. His initial assignments were as an Administrative Officer in Germany at Bitburg Air Force Base and then at Headquarters United States European Command. In 1988, while serving as a missile officer in the 66th Strategic Missile Squadron, he painted a mural in the entry to the underground control center. The shirt he used as inspiration for the mural in the Delta-01 tunnel junction was donated to the park's museum collection in 2017. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lockwood was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/upload/Recognizing_Science.pdf\">interviewed for the park's oral history collection in May 2018</a>. Below are several excerpts from his interview.</p> <hr /> <h4>What were the best and the worst things about the job?</h4> <p>For me - and I think this was because I was older - was the intrinsic reward of it. It's really boring, unfulfilling to a lot of second lieutenants that, you know, have visions of what a grand Air Force career is going to be like and they end up basically sitting downstairs watching TV doing document changes and very kind of boring things on a 24-hour basis. So, there's not a lot of luster if you hadn't gone into the military to serve and get intrinsic value of doing a duty that you don't want to do in real life - you don't really want to launch these things. You know?<br /> When you're a ground troop, you really don't want to go to war and start exchanging bullets with people. So, you have to have that sense of, \"What I'm doing is valuable because I'm training to do it, but I'm not wanting to actually do it.\" So, for me, being operational, having spent seven years just on the admin side of it - though, very interesting - being on the operational tip of the spear type thing, the last line of defense was rewarding for me.</p> <h4>During the Cold War missile combat crew officers carried .38 caliber revolvers while on crew; can you explain why?</h4> <p>Most people think we did to defend the capsule. It was really to protect the codes down there - and we didn't need it you know - so, all the<br /> material classified and all that, it was all protecting the classified material and what our piece of the launch codes were. The authentication documentation. We weren't really expected to fight-off the Soviet spetsnaz with our .38s. It was all the coded stuff down there. So, and there were some equipment racks that had codes and things in it too.<br /> <br /> We had - now, one guy shot a computer down there with a gun. So, weird things happen on crews. I was not in there at the time. But we had the .38s down there and I'm - I think it was Ellsworth. I don't think it was Warren. But I know one of them was you know, like playing quick draw and accidentally discharged the weapon and it went into one of the computer racks.</p> <h4>You lived off base in Rapid City; did your neighbors know what you did for a living?</h4> <p>My neighbor - now that, there's actually a funny story and it's actually true. My next-door neighbor was a very nice guy. Watched our kids and all that. He was a minister. Very peace-loving individual. They were actually part of one the protest groups in the area that would protest the weapons. So, their view was “We love Air Force people, but we don't like these weapons being in existence.” They were fine to us, they were just - they were members that wanted a nuclear-free world and all of that. One of the times I was out on alert, they actually protested my site. So, I actually had my next-door neighbor arrested. So, that was kind of amusing. Then we had a beer the next day and all that.</p> <h4>Where was this wall art that you did?</h4> <p>The wall art was when I was the Delta Flight Commander. I was the Delta Flight Commander for a year before I moved out and took over Echo. I had been in Strategic Air Command for a while and there were always things you do to try to - it was called self-help programs - that you always tried to do to make an impression and to give yourself an edge when it comes to the inspection team. That was when they went someplace they would see something that showed initiative they'd go, \"Oh, extra bonus points.\" Also at the time, Strategic Air Command was going big on their nose art on aircrafts. Kind of bringing back the art you would see in the World War II bombers. They were doing some of those with the aircraft. So, they also suggested, \"Well, missiles should do this too. They should do some nose art.\"<br /> <br /> Well, we were out there anyway for maintenance. That's when it (Delta) went through its last rehabilitation. That's when the carpets got put down and the headliner got put up and all that kind of stuff. So, as the flight crew, we were kind of out there supporting that, we decided we were going go ahead and do the artwork anyway and put it on the wall next to the elevator. <br /> <br /> So, that was the inspiration of actually doing it to begin with. The artwork itself was a result of - it's not my art. I just actually physically painted it up there. There were t-shirts that went around the bomb wing at the time of a B1 flying through the Soviet flag. The artist did the shirts as a fundraiser for them. So, the artist decided to also do one for us after that, with the missile coming up through the flag as a fundraiser. The artwork that was on the shirt, I put it on an overhead projector and projected it against the wall.</p> <h4> </h4>",

At the age of four, her family left England and immigrated to the United States. In their new country, the Shaws made several moves. After settling in the bustling port city of New Bedford, Massachusetts, they uprooted again, this time to the industrial city of Lawrence, Massachusetts.[1] A few years later, the family at last settled on a farm in rural Michigan. Deciding she did not want to continue working on the farm, Shaw pursued teaching and then worked as a seamstress. None of these vocations really suited Shaw, but they would shape her for life. These experiences served as the foundation for Shaw’s insistence on tackling the problems of working and indigent women along with the cause of suffrage. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">In her mid-twenties, Shaw enrolled in Albion College in Albion, Michigan. She then returned to Massachusetts and enrolled in the School of Theology at Boston University. After becoming a Methodist minister, Shaw worked at the Dennis Union Church in Dennis, MA. But she was not content to stay out of the city of Boston. She started commuting back in from the Cape Cod area and pursued a medical degree at Boston University while continuing her ministry.[2] She was only the second woman to graduate from BU’s School of Theology and the first to be ordained as a Methodist minister. She received her medical degree in 1886. Still, Shaw did not spend much time working in either field. Called to do more overtly political work, Shaw decided not to minister or heal one-on-one and left to speak to a larger base. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">By the mid-1880s, Shaw was establishing herself as an advocate for temperance, a cause she took in part because of her time doing medical work in Boston.

Moving up the ranks, Shaw was subsequently hired to work with the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, or WCTU, a national organization working against the consumption of alcohol. For Shaw, temperance and women’s suffrage were <i>not </i>mutually exclusive causes. As Chair of the Franchise Department of the WCTU, Shaw traveled extensively to promote women’s voting rights. The WCTU believed that, with access to the ballot, women would vote for candidates who supported temperance. As she rose to prominence on the lecture circuit, Shaw was elected president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1904. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Shaw was known as a fierce advocate for working class women. Yet her Progressive politics with regards to suffrage and labor must be understood within a larger context. As Shaw traveled the country, she also espoused nativist, or anti-immigrant ideas. Under her leadership, NAWSA was known to be a hostile organization to African American women and other minorities. Shaw’s exclusionary politics were not unique. Unfortunately, they were too often mirrored in the practices and policies of NAWSA and other pro-suffrage groups for women.[2] This, too, is part of the legacy of Shaw’s ministry and speaking career. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">In her final years, Shaw focused on another form of national service, becoming part of the Woman's Committee of the Council of National Defence during World War I. This would earn her widespread acclaim and praise from President Woodrow Wilson. Still, contemporaries more likely knew her for her speeches on suffrage and temperance: Shaw is estimated to have delivered over 10,000 in her career. In July 1919, less than a month after the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification, Shaw died. She did not live to see it become law. In 1897, Shaw had said, “The millennium may not come when women vote, but it will never come, until they do.”[4] At her bedside when she died was Lucy Elmina Anthony, Shaw’s partner of 30 years and niece of Susan B. Anthony. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Though she served as a leader during critical years of the fight for suffrage, Shaw is not as well-known as some of her peers, such as </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/anthonyhouse.htm\"><span style=\"color:null;\">Susan B.

As part of their efforts to communicate with Helen, her parents Arthur and Catherine Keller turned to the Perkins School for the Blind, based in Watertown, Massachusetts. A Perkins graduate named Anne Sullivan was sent to the Keller home to train Helen in her seventh year. Sullivan famously taught Keller to read braille and in time, Keller was able to communicate through both sign language and aural speech.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Following the completion of her studies at the Cambridge School for Young Ladies, Keller enrolled at Radcliffe College. While completing her collegiate studies, Keller wrote her autobiography, <i>The Story of My Life</i>, first published in 1904.[2] All of her work as student and author was done in conjunction with Sullivan, who became a lifelong friend. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">A self-described “militant suffragette,” Keller used the considerable notoriety she gained in her adolescence to advocate for others for the rest of her life. In 1913, Keller participated in the large parade known as the “Woman Suffrage Procession” in Washington, DC. Her interest in women’s rights was rooted in her connections to contemporary labor movements. Keller was particularly interested in working people’s issues, including industrial safety standards, which led to membership in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Keller’s radical politics also included supporting the movement to increase access to birth control for women. When a biographical film called <i>Deliverance</i>, which featured Keller, premiered in New York City, she joined with striking actors instead of attending. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Keller regularly gave lectures in support of the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) to earn a living. Though she was interested in persons with disabilities, it is important to note the breadth of Keller’s interests. Later in life, Keller was particularly passionate and dedicated to global causes, including anti-imperialism. An anti-war philosopher and agitator, Keller protested World War I and later, World War II.<br /> <br /> Over the course of her lifetime, Keller would become one of the world’s best-known people with a disability. A complex woman with a range of political affiliations, Keller is often remembered for her early triumphs. This early focus misses Keller’s evolution and the contributions she made to a variety of causes. Keller was born into affluence and comfort; she died nearly ninety years later a devoted revolutionary who had worked tirelessly to make the oppression of others better understood. Her ashes, as well of those of her companion, Anne Sullivan, are interred at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC.[3]</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">[1] Helen Keller was born at home.

Anthony is perhaps the most widely known suffragist of her generation and has become an icon of the woman’s suffrage movement. Anthony traveled the country to give speeches, circulate petitions, and organize local women’s rights organizations.<br /> <br /> Anthony was born in Adams, Massachusetts.[1] After the Anthony family moved to Rochester, New York in 1845, they became active in the antislavery movement. Antislavery Quakers met at their farm almost every Sunday, where they were sometimes joined by Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison. Two of Anthony's brothers, Daniel and Merritt, were later anti-slavery activists in the Kansas territory.<br /> <br /> In 1848 Susan B. Anthony was working as a teacher in Canajoharie, New York and became involved with the teacher’s union when she discovered that male teachers had a monthly salary of $10.00, while the female teachers earned $2.50 a month. Her parents and sister Marry attended the 1848 Rochester Woman’s Rights Convention held August 2.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Anthony’s experience with the teacher’s union, temperance, and antislavery reforms, and her Quaker upbringing, laid fertile ground for a career in women’s rights reform to grow.

Anthony circulated petitions for married women's property rights and woman suffrage. She addressed the National Women’s Rights Convention in 1854 and urged more petition campaigns. In 1854 she wrote to Matilda Joslyn Gage that “I know slavery is the all-absorbing question of the day, still we must push forward this great central question, which underlies all others.”</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">By 1856 Anthony had become an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, arranging meetings, making speeches, putting up posters, and distributing leaflets. She encountered hostile mobs, armed threats, and things thrown at her. She was hung in effigy, and in Syracuse, New York her image was dragged through the streets.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">At the 1856 National Women’s Rights Convention, Anthony served on the business committee and spoke on the necessity of the dissemination of printed matter on women’s rights.

The masthead of the newspaper proudly displayed their motto, “Men, their rights, and nothing more; women, their rights, and nothing less.” Also that year, the Fourteenth Amendment passed, recognizing that those born into slavery were entitled to the same citizenship status and protections as free people. The amendment did not, however, grant universal access to the vote. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/comrades-in-conflict.htm\">A rift appeared</a><span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"> among those, like Stanton and Anthony and </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a><span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">, who had been allies in the fight for universal suffrage. Anthony and Stanton were hurt that Douglass supported the Fifteenth Amendment, which granted the vote to Black men only. They felt he had abandoned woman suffrage. Douglass, in turn, was hurt by the insulting arguments of Anthony and Stanton against African Americans. They all thought that it would be impossible to get the vote for both women and African Americans at the same time, and disagreed with the others’ priorities. The rift turned ugly at a public meeting of the AERA held in New York City in 1869.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Following the meeting, Stanton, Anthony and others formed the National Woman Suffrage Association and focused solely on a federal woman’s suffrage amendment.

When Anthony refused to pay a $100 fine and court costs, the judge did not sentence her to prison time, which ended her chance of an appeal.

Her parents were Quakers, and gave her an education of the same quality that boys got at that time. Early on, Maria taught in her father’s school. At home, he taught her astronomy. At only twelve years old, Maria helped her father calculate exactly when a solar eclipse would occur.<br /> <br /> In 1835, she opened her own school, allowing non-white students to attend -- a controversial decision in a community where the public school was segregated. In 1836, she took a job as the first librarian of the <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-97ae1a3a-7fff-2b33-7cf7-928d1573d48f\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nantucket-atheneum.htm\">Nantucket Atheneum</a></b>, a position she held for 20 years.<br /> <br /> She continued her astronomical work at night, even after working all day at the Atheneum. On October 1, 1847 she discovered what became known as Miss Mitchell’s Comet (Comet 1847 VI; now known as C/1847 T1). She received an award from King Frederick VI of Denmark as the first person to discover the comet, which brought her worldwide fame as the America’s first professional astronomer who was a woman. She was only the third woman worldwide to discover a comet (the others were Caroline Herschel and Maria Margarethe Kirch, both German astronomers).<br /> <br /> In 1848, she was the first woman elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; in 1850, she became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was also elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1869, one of the first women to do so. Following her work at the Atheneum, she worked at the U.S. Nautical Almanac Office as an astronomer, calculating the positions of Venus in the heavens.<br /> <br /> In 1865, Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York hired Maria Mitchell as faculty and as Director of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/vassar-college-observatory.htm\">Vassar College Observatory</a> (the oldest building on Vassar’s campus). She discovered during her teaching career that, despite her qualifications, she was making less money than many younger, male professors. She insisted on an increase, and received it. She taught at Vassar College until she retired in 1888.<br /> <br /> Following her retirement, one of her assistants, Mary W. Whitney, took over as Director of the Vassar College Observatory, a post she held until 1895. The next two directors were also women who could trace their academic lineage back to Maria Mitchell: Caroline Furness (Director from 1895-1936) and Maud Worcester Makemson (Director from 1936 to 1957). There have only been two subsequent directors since then, both men.<br /> <br /> Maria Mitchell died on June 28, 1889. Her telescope is in the collections of<b> </b>the Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington, DC.<br /> <br /> Maria Mitchell was an early trail-blazer for women in the sciences, in higher education, and in pay equality.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Sister of Paul, Elizabeth (Liza) Florence Dunbar was born at her maternal grandmother’s house on Howard Street in Dayton, Ohio, to Matilda and Joshua Dunbar. Elizabeth contracted various illnesses during her short life, and Felton O. Best suggested in a 1992 doctoral dissertation that Elizabeth’s illnesses and need for medicines exacerbated the family’s limited finances and led to confrontations between Joshua and Matilda that damaged their unstable marriage. With Matilda responsible for earning most of the family’s income and with Joshua rarely assuming paternal duties, Matilda assigned Paul (at the time between 2 and 4 years old) responsibilities for rocking and otherwise quieting Elizabeth. She died of marasmus (malnutrition) and is buried in Dayton’s Woodland Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Plasterer and father of Paul Laurence Dunbar, Joshua was born enslaved in Kentucky, perhaps in Garrard County. Historians know little about his early life. Joshua trained as a plasterer while enslaved. His master allowed him to work away from his home plantation and keep some of his earnings. With the assistance of Quakers, he eventually fled Kentucky, venturing to Upper Canada through the Underground Railroad network. He returned to the United States after the creation of the United States Colored Troops in 1863. Joshua enlisted in the 55<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Regiment (Colored) under Colonel Norwood P. Hallowell on June 5, 1863. Medical officials discharged him from the 55<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts on October 28, 1863 for varicose veins, but Joshua soon reenlisted in the 5<sup>th</sup>Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment (Colored). He served in this unit until the end of the war, rising to the rank of sergeant. He was discharged in Clarksville, Texas, on October 3, 1865. For the remainder of his life, Joshua drew a monthly pension of $25.00 for his service.<br /> <br /> With the end of the war, Joshua moved to Dayton, Ohio, where he met Matilda Burton Murphy sometime after 1866. They married on December 24, 1871. Matilda gave birth to Paul, their first son, that next June. Joshua and Matilda had one other child, Elizabeth (1874-1876). Joshua attempted to work as a plasterer but racism left him unemployed for extended periods of time. He and Matilda endured a tense, abusive relationship before she left him around 1873; this relationship set a poor example for Paul’s relationship with Alice Moore. Matilda petitioned for a divorce from Joshua and received one on January 9, 1876. Paul memorialized him and other African American soldiers in “The Colored Soldiers” (1895). Joshua died of pneumonia at the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Dayton on August 16, 1885 and is buried in Dayton National Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The mother of Paul Laurence Dunbar was born enslaved near Shelbyville, Kentucky, to Isaac Burton and Eliza Porter Burton. Her master, Shelbyville landowner David Glass, hired her out as a domestic servant until emancipation in 1865. He gave Matilda the opportunity to gain her freedom by immigrating to Liberia (West Africa), but slavery in the United States ended before her scheduled departure. Around the age of 16, amid the Civil War, she married R. Weeks (or Wilson or Willis) Murphy, who was also enslaved. Together they had two children, Robert and William Murphy. Matilda and R.W. Murphy separated after the war, with Matilda moving to Dayton, Ohio, to live with her mother in the spring of 1866.<br /> <br /> In Dayton, Matilda worked as a launderer. There she met Joshua Dunbar, a plasterer. They married on December 24, 1871. Their marriage produced two children, Paul and Elizabeth Dunbar; Elizabeth died before her third birthday. As an enslaved child, Matilda had few educational opportunities. She wanted better for her children and attempted to show them the importance of education by enrolling in night classes at the tenth district school on Zieger Street while spending her days washing clothes, cooking, and sewing for Dayton residents. Matilda’s literacy was such that she taught Paul the basics of reading before he entered elementary school (though she did not teach her other sons).<br /> <br /> Matilda’s life was connected closely with that of Paul. She and Paul rarely left each other’s presence; Matilda even moved to Washington, D.C., to live with him after his marriage to Alice Moore. After his separation from Alice in 1902, Matilda and Paul briefly moved to Chicago. In 1903, they returned to Dayton and, in 1904, purchased a house on North Summit Street on the city’s west side in a neighborhood that was overwhelmingly white. Paul wrote from this house until his death from tuberculosis in 1906. Matilda – commonly known as “Mother Dunbar” – lived in the Summit Street house, financially supported by relatives and neighbors, until her death on February 24, 1934. She is buried at Dayton’s Woodland Cemetery. Matilda gained a reputation as a gracious, well-spoken hostess who welcomed those interested in the writings of her son to her home. She maintained Paul’s library and study in their 1906 conditions and showed his work spaces to visitors. The Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society (today the Ohio Historical Society) acquired the house after her death and formally opened it as a museum in 1938; the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial became part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park in 1992.  </p>",

The third of six children, Dan married Catherine Reeder in Centerville, Ohio, on February 12, 1818, after moving to Montgomery County with his parents and siblings. While he taught school for a term in Vermont before moving west, Dan spent most of his life as a farmer. In 1821, Dan, Catherine, and their two young sons moved to an 80-acre farm in Rush County, Indiana. After wintering in a crowded cabin with the family of the land’s seller, Dan built his own cabin, complete with a wood floor. The Wrights grew corn on this farm; lacking livestock, they plowed their furrows by hand.<br /> <br /> In 1823, Dan sold this farm and moved his family to a farm 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southwest of their first home. This second farm grew over the years to cover a full 160-acre quarter section. Catherine gave birth to Milton Wright, the fifth of five surviving Wright children, at this farm in 1828. Later in life, Milton Wright described his father as “grave in his countenance, collected in his manners, hesitating in his speech, but very accurate.” After converting to Christianity in 1830, Dan – who worked in a distillery for a time while living in Centerville – became a teetotaler who avoided alcohol and refused to sell his corn crop to distillers to convert into whiskey. Dan also strongly supported the abolition of slavery, voting for Liberty Party candidate James G. Birney in the presidential election of 1844 (an election won by Democrat James K. Polk). Dan also opposed the activities of secret fraternal societies such as the Masons. Milton inherited strong views towards religion, slavery, and fraternal societies from his father. In 1840, Dan sold the second Rush County farm and moved to another in Orange Township, Fayette County. He died at this farm in 1861 – the site of Lorin Wright’s birth in 1862.</p>",

His work supported the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in developing Cape Hatteras National Seashore as part of President Franklin D.

            "bodyText": "<p>Susan Koerner Wright's father was born in Förthen, Saxony (Germany), to Johann Thomas Koerner and Eva Elisabeth Polion. In 1807, he was apprenticed to Johann Samuel Zeimer as a wagon-maker. He was declared a master wagon-maker after a two-year apprenticeship. In 1817 or 1818, he emigrated to the United States to avoid military conscription.<br /> <br /> Upon reaching the United States, John Koerner worked for awhile as a carriage-maker in Baltimore, Maryland. On April 10, 1820, he married Catherine Fry (or Freyer) and moved with her to her parents’ seventy-acre farm near Hillsboro, Virginia, in Loudon County. Over the years of their marriage, John and Catherine had five children. John worked in the farm’s carriage shop and at a forge in Hillsboro.<br /> <br /> John and Catherine sold their land to William Brown in 1832 and moved west to Union County, Indiana, a place to which several relatives preceded them. There they acquired a 170-acre farm, where they grew crops and John practiced his carriage trade. Later Wright family accounts told of a farm with tens of buildings that seemed like a small village. John converted from Presbyterianism to the United Brethren in Christ soon after his arrival in Indiana; he was active in this church until his death in 1876. He is buried in the Franklin Church Cemetery near Liberty, Indiana.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The only surviving daughter of Milton and Susan Koerner Wright, Katharine was born in Dayton, Ohio, at the Wright residence on Hawthorne Street. The youngest of the Wright siblings (more than thirteen years younger than eldest brother Reuchlin), Katharine developed close relationships with the younger of the four brothers, Wilbur and Orville. With the death of Susan Wright in 1889, Katharine assumed much of the responsibility for managing the Wright household, especially during Milton's frequent absences. While Milton was rather demanding of Katharine in domestic matters, instructing her in household tasks in letters sent from across the United States, he did not want her to neglect her intellectual development. Katharine attended Dayton's Central High School and entered Oberlin College in 1893. She graduated from Oberlin with a bachelor's degree in 1898 and eventually obtained a job as a teacher of Latin and English at Dayton's Steele High School. Katharine taught there until 1908.<br /> <br /> Katharine left teaching in September of 1908, after the crash of a Wright airplane piloted by Orville during a demonstration flight for the U.S. Army at Fort Myer, Virginia; a crash that killed Lt. Thomas Selfridge. She stayed with Orville during his convalescence, and after his recovery traveled with him to meet Wilbur in France for a promotional tour. Katharine actively assisted her brothers' careers, serving as a confidant and sounding board.</p> <p>Katharine's relationship with Orville, who never married, became especially close after the deaths of Wilbur in 1912 and Milton in 1917. She served as a director of the Young Woman's League of Dayton, supported efforts to gain women the right to vote, and remained active in Oberlin College affairs, leading its alumni group and gaining election to its board of trustees. She also married a college friend, Kansas City newspaper owner and editor Henry J. Haskell, at Oberlin on November 20, 1926. While Lorin Wright heartily approved of the marriage, it ruptured Katharine's relationship with Orville, who believed that through it Katharine rejected him as a brother. He refused to interact with the couple, who lived in Kansas City, shunning Katharine until days before her death from pneumonia on March 3, 1929. Orville asked Henry to allow Katharine to be buried in Dayton, and she was interred with her parents and brother in Woodland Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Lorin, the second son of Milton and Susan Wright, was born in Fairmont, Indiana, in the home of his grandparents. Named by his parents for a community chosen randomly from a map, Lorin moved with his parents and siblings to Dayton, Ohio, in 1870. As a child, Lorin developed a close relationship with his elder brother Reuchlin. He and Reuchlin enrolled at Hartsville University in Indiana, the alma mater of their parents, between 1881 and 1883, but did not earn degrees. Instead, Lorin ventured west to Kansas City in 1886 in search of work. Lorin spent little time in Kansas City, where Reuchlin settled, returning to Dayton in the fall of 1886. However, Lorin returned west in 1887, settling in the frontier town of Coldwater, Kansas, where he worked as a bookkeeper and deputy county treasurer. In 1889, he returned to Dayton, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Lorin married Ivonette Stokes on January 12, 1892 and took a position with the John Rouzer Company as a bookkeeper. Lorin and Netta had four children, nieces and nephews with whom Wilbur and Orville developed close relationships.<br /> <br /> While not a frequent participant in the research of his brothers Wilbur and Orville that produced the first successful airplane, Lorin assisted them when needed. He helped manage his brothers’ financial affairs in Dayton while they were away from home, and he delivered news of their first powered flight in December of 1903 to the <i>Dayton Journal</i>. Unfortunately, the Associated Press representative at the <i>Journal</i> ignored Lorin’s important news. In 1915, amidst the Wright-Curtiss patent battles, Lorin secretly visited Lake Keuka in New York, where Glenn Curtiss attempted to fly a modified 1903 model of Samuel Langley’s Aerodrome. Curtiss’s employees discovered Lorin and confiscated his film, but they failed to demonstrate that Langley’s craft was capable of flight before Orville and Wilbur’s flights of December 1903. Lorin turned his energies to the Dayton area in the 1920s and 1930s, becoming an owner and president of Miami Wood Specialties, which made wooden toys (including toy airplanes) and serving as a Dayton City Commissioner from 1920 to 1927. He died in Dayton in 1939 and is buried at Woodland Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Milton, a bishop in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, was born in Rush County, Indiana, to farmers Dan Wright, Jr., and Catharine Reeder. He was their fifth child (of an eventual seven) and fourth son. Dan Wright was a teetotaler who accepted lower payments when he sold his corn, so it would not be made into whiskey, and an uncompromising abolitionist. Milton also supported these causes, transmitting these values to his children. At the age of 12, Milton moved with his family to a farm in Fayette County, Indiana. It was while working in the fields of his parents’ farm at the age of 15 that he experienced a religious conversion. In 1848, the Reverend Joseph Ball baptized Milton into the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. In 1850, the United Brethren licensed Milton to preach. He was admitted to the church’s local governing body in 1853 and was ordained as a minister in 1856. While a student at Hartsville University in 1853, Milton met Susan C. Koerner. After courting for several years, and after Milton served as a missionary for the United Brethren in the western United States, they married in Indiana on November 24, 1859. Milton and Susan had seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Susan died in 1889 of tuberculosis; Milton never remarried.<br /> <br /> Milton and his family first moved to Dayton in 1869 when he became editor of the United Brethren periodical, The Religious Telescope. His prominence within his denomination grew, and in 1877 Milton’s colleagues elected him bishop. The next year his duties expanded to include the administration of the church’s Western conferences. He and Susan moved their family to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to allow Milton to live closer to the churches he served. Milton cared greatly about the intellectual development of his children and maintained a large and varied library in which they read. His gift of a toy helicopter to Wilbur and Orville in 1878 helped develop their interest in aviation.<br /> <br /> The Wright family returned to Dayton, home of the United Brethren’s publishing house, for a final time in 1884 when Milton desired to live closer to the United Brethren headquarters and publishing house during the culmination of years of theological conflict between Radical and Liberal elements of the church. Milton, a leader of United Brethren members known as Radicals who were loyal to the denomination’s old constitution, was instrumental in an 1889 denominational schism. Milton was a respected elder statesman of the United Brethren in Christ – Old Constitution until his retirement from the active ministry in 1905.<br /> <br /> Milton continued to live with sons Wilbur and Orville and daughter Katharine after his wife’s death in 1889. He flew once, with Orville at Huffman Prairie in 1910, and moved with Orville and Katharine to Hawthorn Hill in Oakwood in 1914. He conducted extensive genealogical research into the ancestry of his family and maintained a diary that chronicled nearly sixty years of his life. Milton died at Hawthorn Hill on April 3, 1917. He is buried in Dayton’s Woodland Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Orville Wright, working with his brother <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/wilburwright.htm\">Wilbur</a>, made the first heavier-than-air, powered, controlled flight by man, leading the world into the aviation age.</p> <h3>Family Life</h3> <p>Orville was born to Milton and Susan Wright in Dayton, Ohio on August 19, 1871. Orville was the sixth child of seven, but two of his older siblings did not survive infancy. Those siblings that did survive were his 3 older brothers, Reuchlin, Lorin, and Wilbur, and he would have one younger sister, Katherine, born exactly three years after him in the very same room, in the family house in Dayton on 7 Hawthorne Street. He would become very close with Wilbur, as their scientific collaborations can attest, and he would also have a close relationship with Katharine. Their father Milton was a Bishop in the United Brethren Church, causing the family to relocate frequently, in addition to Milton often traveling for work. Despite this, it was a very loving, close-knit family. Their parents raised the children to be self-confident and to pursue whatever aroused their curiosity.</p> <h3>Education</h3> <p>Orville received his formal schooling in Iowa, Indiana, and Dayton, Ohio, where the family was finally able to settle for good in 1884. Orville, like his older brother Wilbur, was a good student favoring math and science classes, with mechanical inclinations and ambitions. Milton recalled young Orville as enthusiastic and a leader. Among other fun exploits, Orville promoted circuses for the area, and became famous in the community for his high quality kites he flew and sold, designing and building the kites himself. Orville found high school to be less than challenging, causing him to drop out in the 11th grade. However he and Wilbur would later be bestowed with honorary PhD degrees from Harvard, Yale, and other prominent schools for their invention of the airplane.</p> <h3>Occupation</h3> <p>For two summers while in high school, having worked for Dayton printers, he decided to start his own printing business with his friend Ed Sines. After eventually buying Ed Sines out as co-owner, he asked Wilbur to join him in the printing business. Soon the brothers began building their own printing presses. Orville was famous for making a press out of the folding tops of carriages, tombstones, and other spare parts. The Wright’s printing business stayed in operation until 1899, but after 1892 Ed Sines mostly ran the business. Wilbur and Orville formed the Wright Cycle Company in 1892 selling, repairing, and manufacturing bicycles. The bicycle business was a great success, allowing them the funding and time they would need for their pursuit of aviation.</p> <h3>Interest in Flight</h3> <p>Both Orville and Wilbur fondly recalled when, in 1878, their father brought home a toy helicopter powered by a rubber band. Designed by French aeronautical experimenter Alphonse Pénaud, this toy did not simply fall to the ground as expected. Rather it \"flew across the room till it struck the ceiling, where it fluttered awhile, and finally sank to the floor.\" The delicate toy didn’t last long before it broke, but it truly caught the brothers’ attention; they tried to replicate the toy themselves. Orville later credited this childhood toy as being the object that sparked their original interest in flight.<br /> <br /> The Wright’s fascination with flying increased due to two events in 1896; the death of Otto Lilienthal, the celebrated glider experimenter, in a flying accident, and the semi-successful unmanned launching of powered models by Samuel Langley. They continued their bicycle business for the next two years, but mastery of flight weighed heavy on their minds.</p> <h3>Pursuit of Flight</h3> <p>In 1899, Orville and Wilbur began reading all they could about flight, in addition to constantly observing birds and continuing their kite experiments. Designing and manufacturing bicycles themselves honed Orville and Wilbur’s natural mechanical abilities. Many of the tools they used to manufacture bicycles they would also use when building their gliders and flyers. In their bicycle shop in Dayton, they did much of their inventing and research. However, it was the Outer Banks of North Carolina that met their criteria for testing their inventions, with its privacy, steady winds, and wide-open non-vegetated spaces. It was here, in sparsely populated Kitty Hawk, they set up camp, giving them the freedom to experiment with and perfect their machines until they achieved success. At age 32, Orville piloted the first successful powered, controlled flight on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers had changed the world.<br /> <br /> After 1903, their attention was devoted solely to aviation. By 1908, they formed airplane companies in Europe and America and, by 1910, they had taught the world how to fly. They came back to Kitty Hawk for glide and flight practice, and on October 24, 1911, Orville established a new world soaring record at Kitty Hawk of nine minutes and forty-five seconds, a record that stood for ten years.</p> <h3>Legacy</h3> <p>In 1932, the Wright Memorial at Kitty Hawk at Kill Devil Hills was dedicated, the largest memorial to the brothers’ achievements. Orville was in attendance. He did not make a speech on this auspicious occasion, however, because unlike his brother Wilbur (who died of typhoid fever in 1912), Orville was not a comfortable public speaker. Orville, who had become a millionaire due to the brothers’ invention of the airplane, lived to age 76, having witnessed aircraft used in two world wars, the development of the jet engine, and man breaking the speed of sound. He died of a heart attack in Dayton on January 30, 1948, only 21 years before man first set foot on the moon.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Poet and writer, Paul was born in Dayton, Ohio, to Joshua Dunbar and Matilda Murphy. He was the eldest of two children born to Joshua and Matilda, who were former slaves, and had two half-brothers through his mother. Paul attended Dayton’s public schools. He was the only African American in the Central High School class of 1890; so few African Americans attended high school at the time that segregated public secondary schools were financially unfeasible in Dayton. At Central High, Paul edited the school newspaper and was a member of the literary and debate societies. Future aviator, Orville Wright, was a member of Paul’s high school class but did not graduate. However, Wright printed a newspaper that Paul published and edited for the African American community of west Dayton, the <i>Dayton Tattler</i>; this paper ceased publication after three issues in December of 1890.</p> <p>Paul hoped to attend college or secure a job in journalism upon graduating from high school, but he did not have enough money for additional education and job prospects for a young African American man were limited in Dayton. He eventually secured a position as an elevator operator for the Callahan Building in downtown Dayton. Paul wrote poetry and short stories in his spare time and received a fortuitous break in 1892, when a former teacher invited him to speak at the convention of the Western Association of Writers in Dayton. Poet James Newton Matthews applauded Paul’s reading at that meeting in an article published throughout the Midwest. Attention generated through Matthews’ article encouraged Paul to publish his first poetry collection, <i>Oak and Ivy</i>, in 1893. Paul continued to write at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago, where he received the praise of civil rights leader Frederick Douglass. A review of Paul’s dialect poems for <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> by prominent literary critic William Dean Howells in 1896 brought Paul national acclaim and sales, and he began touring the United States and Great Britain to deliver public readings.</p> <p>In 1897, Paul accepted a job as a research assistant at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. However, his health deteriorated as his literary success grew, and he soon left this job. After a stormy engagement, Paul eloped with fellow poet Alice Ruth Moore, whom he courted for several years chiefly by letter. They married in New York on March 6, 1898. The couple had no children. Physicians diagnosed Paul as having tuberculosis in 1899. This diagnosis – in an age without antibiotic medications – disrupted his relationship with Alice. Paul medicated himself by drinking heavily and developed into an alcoholic; his alcoholism and continued abuse of Alice led her to leave him in 1902. While Alice refused to have contact with Paul for the remainder of his life, the couple did not divorce; she retained his name and promoted his writing until her death in 1935. Paul, who wrote novels, play, and song lyrics in addition to poetry, lived the last three years of his life with his mother in a house on Summit Street (today Paul Laurence Dunbar Street) in Dayton, where he died on February 9, 1906. His poetry influenced Harlem Renaissance writers James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, and Claude McKay during the 1920s and continues to influence contemporary American literature. Paul is buried in Dayton’s Woodland Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Read more about the incredible <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/daav/learn/historyculture/paullaurencedunbarslegacy.htm\">legacy</a> of Paul Laurence Dunbar.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Reuchlin was born near Fairmont, Indiana, the eldest child of Milton and Susan Koerner Wright. Named for German theologian Johannes Reuchlin (1455-1522), Reuchlin moved often as a child as his father’s ministerial career with the Church of the United Brethren in Christ developed, arriving in Dayton in 1870. As a child, Reuchlin developed a close relationship with his brother Lorin, the second-eldest of the children of Milton and Susan Wright. After graduating from Coe’s Collegiate Academy in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1878, Reuchlin enrolled in nearby Western College, a United Brethren school, perhaps with the intention of studying for the Brethren ministry. However, he left Western College and in the fall of 1880 taught one term in an elementary school near Cedar Rapids. He returned to college, as a sophomore, with brother Lorin in 1881 when they enrolled at Hartsville University in Indiana. Both left Hartsville in 1883 without earning degrees. Reuchlin returned to Dayton that autumn and obtained a job as a clerk for a local lumberyard. He and Lorin lived in a Dayton boardinghouse until their parents and younger siblings returned to Dayton in the summer of 1884.<br /> <br /> Reuchlin married Lulu Billheimer on April 27, 1886 in Westerville, Ohio. They welcomed their first child, a daughter, thirteen months later. Finding his young family’s financial situation to be difficult, Reuchlin left Dayton in February of 1889. He found work as a bookkeeper with the South Missouri Lumber Company in Kansas City, where Lulu and their daughter joined him. Reuchlin and Lulu had four children, three of whom survived to adulthood. During his family’s thirteen-year stay in Kansas City, Reuchlin also worked for the Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham Railroad. In 1901, he and his family moved to an 80-acre farm near Tonganoxie, Kansas, where they raised cattle and seed corn. As an adult, Reuchlin grew distant from his father, brothers, and sister in Dayton, who did not get along with Lulu. It is possible that Reuchlin felt inferior to his more famous brothers; he believed that he did not deserve all of the $50,000 he inherited from Wilbur in 1912 and attempted to return $1,000 to his father. Milton, Orville, and Katharine refused to accept the money. Reuchlin died of a stroke in Kansas City in 1920 and is buried there.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Wilbur Wright, along with his brother <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/orvillewright.htm\">Orville</a>, achieved international fame by designing, building, and flying the first airplane. Their contributions to aviation remain unparalleled.</p> <h3>Family Life</h3> <p>Wilbur was born to Milton and Susan Wright on April 16, 1867 in Millville, Indiana. The third child of seven, two of his younger siblings would not survive infancy. He had two older brothers, Reuchlin and Lorin, and later two younger siblings, Orville and Katharine. Their father Milton, a bishop in the United Brethren Church, moved the family to Dayton, Ohio.<br /> <br /> Wilbur was always close with his younger brother, Orville. Wilbur, Orville, and their other siblings knew they were fortunate to grow up in a loving home with parents that encouraged curiosity and intellectual development through reading, problem solving, and experimentation.</p> <h3>Education</h3> <p>Wilbur was a good student in school; math and science were his favorite subjects. Wilbur, along with Orville, excelled in math and was very mechanically inclined. Before Wilbur could graduate high school, the family moved from Indiana to Dayton. After they moved, his plan was to graduate high school and attend divinity school at Yale University. However, in the winter of 1885-86, while playing “shinny,” a type of ice hockey, he was attacked by neighborhood bully Oliver Crook Haugh, who knocked his teeth out with a hockey stick (Haugh would be executed in 1906 for the murders of his own parents and brother). After this injury, Wilbur gave up his formal education, staying home for three years to take care of the household and his sick mother, who died of tuberculosis in 1889. During these years, he continued reading everything available in his father’s well-stocked library. Although his formal education did not continue, he and Orville, would eventually receive honorary degrees for inventing the airplane and leading the world into the Age of Flight.</p> <h3>Occupation</h3> <p>As they grew, Wilbur and Orville became closer. Wilbur had become a self-assured and determined young man, excellent at writing and public speaking. The next phase in Wilbur’s life began when Orville convinced him to join his printing business. Throughout their early lives, the brothers were involved in a variety of commercial ventures. In 1892 they formed the Wright Cycle Company and designed, manufactured, and sold bicycles. This proved a successful venture, which allowed them spare time for other projects.</p> <h3>Idea of Flight</h3> <p>Wilbur and Orville had been exploring the idea of flight since childhood. In 1878, Milton Wright gave the boys a rubber-band-powered toy, much like a helicopter. Designed by French aeronautical experimenter Alphonse Pénaud, this toy did not simply fall to the ground as expected. Rather it \"flew across the room till it struck the ceiling, where it fluttered awhile, and finally sank to the floor.\" Though the fragile toy soon broke, the brothers were amazed. Soon they were attempting to build their own toy helicopters.<br /> <br /> Two events in 1896 solidified the brothers’ desire to achieve human flight: the death of Otto Lilienthal, the celebrated glider experimenter, in a flying accident, and the semi-successful unmanned launching of powered models by Samuel Langley. Fortunately, their bicycle business provided the funds for this new pursuit.</p> <h3>Pursuit of First Flight</h3> <p>The designing and manufacturing of bicycles sharpened the brothers' mechanical skills. In their construction of flying machines, Wilbur and Orville often used the same equipment and tools used in repairing bicycles. They conducted many of their scientific experiments in the backroom of their shop; most of the parts used in the first successful airplane were built there.<br /> <br /> The Wrights' most focused work in aviation began in 1899, when Wilbur wrote the Smithsonian Institution and requested any literature they had on flying experiments. Dismayed that so many great minds had made so little progress, the brothers realized that they had as much chance as anyone of succeeding. Wilbur took the lead in the early stages of their work to solve the mystery of flight, but Orville was soon drawn in as an equal collaborator. They quickly developed their own theories and began experimenting with human flight.<br /> <br /> The Outer Banks of North Carolina, with its steady winds, vast open spaces, high sand dunes, and relative isolation, provided the ideal location for the brothers to begin their large-scale experiments.<br /> <br /> After four years of scientific experimentation, they achieved the first successful powered, controlled, heavier-than-air flights in the world on December 17, 1903. Even though Wilbur, age 36, didn’t pilot the first flight (Orville was at the helm), he did fly the longest flight of the day at 852 feet in 59 seconds.<br /> <br /> The Wright brothers would continue to perfect the art of flying for almost a decade, giving demonstrations both in the United States and abroad, securing patents and manufacturing contracts, all while constantly trying to improve their airplanes.<br /> <br /> Wilbur Wright died of typhoid fever on May 30, 1912 at age 45.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Mary Martin was Superintendent at Lassen Volcanic National Park from 2005 until her retirement in 2007.<br /> <br /> When asked to be transferred to Lassen she was extremely excited, it was the “nature” of her youth. Mary grew up in San Francisco. Her father worked for PG&E, their employee association had family camps/cabins in northern California, around the Lassen area. Mary's favorite was DeSabla, near Magalia. They also spent several summers at the camps around Lake Almanor. When Mary and her husband, Dick worked in the desert, their summer camping trip was always two weeks in the Lassen area. The smell of the forest, the trees, the solitude, the lakes and streams, and more are her “happy place.”<br /> <br /> Mary was Superintendent at Mojave National Preserve for 11 years. As one of the first five people hired after the designation of the park unit by the California Desert Protection Act, the hectic pace of a new park, dealing with constant and controversial issues (building the park staff, grazing, private inholdings, hunting/guzzlers, developing the GMP, mining, special park uses, filming, poaching, hazmat dumping, meth labs, illegal trespass, building a fire center and visitor center, etc) the idea of a completely different park experience was enticing. Every day at Mojave Mary loved going to work, the challenges, the rewards, the outstanding and passionate staff, the “wins”, witnessing the park blossom into a “jewel in the crown”, were all wonderful, however, after 11 years it was time for something new.<br /> <br /> Mary was honored to be the Park Superintendent at one of the oldest national parks in the system and it was fun for her to know that she would be working with many managers she knew from her early days (and theirs) in Yosemite National Park. Mary did have to pay attention to not calling the Maintenance Chief “Danny” (as he was known in Yosemite when we were all relatively new to the National Park Service).<br /> <br /> One of Mary's charges assuming the position was a “last chance” at developing a visitor center within the allotted budget. She loved challenges like that and working with a team to plan and develop visitor centers. Her team at Mojave had successfully planned a new visitor center and she relished another opportunity at Lassen. The previous plan, a large multi-story concrete and glass, curved building came in significantly over budget. The management staff worked to ensure they could meet the budget challenge and have a visitor center that met the needs of the park and connect with the public on the importance of resource protection. Once started, they realized that they might achieve “certified” LEED status, then silver and, when the competitive juices flowed, gold was quickly surpassed by a platinum goal. And it was achieved.<br /> <br /> In coming from a new national park that needed to build the budget from one dollar, yes that happened, Mary assumed that Lassen had achieved an adequate budget over the years. She was wrong. The park was woefully underfunded and had not had an increase in well over a decade. The budget constraints hampered her ability to protect the natural and cultural resources of Lassen. Working with the management team on the team's PMIS requests they succeeded in achieving ONPS budget increases.<br /> <br /> During her tenure, an Environmental Assessment for concessions and visitor services was approved, developing the Manzanita Cabins and kayak rentals (which have proven successful) and addressing many other visitor services in the park.<br /> <br /> This winter brings to mind the challenges of road opening while Mary was at Lassen. Because of another high snow year they were unable to open the road until July 13th. The safety issues with road opening are considerable and the staff dedicated and exemplary.<br /> <br /> Mary made a real effort at engaging local communities and park neighbors. She thoroughly enjoyed public meetings, remarkably different from being called a “jack booted thug” in the desert. At Lassen the local communities loved the park and enjoyed recreating in their park. The most controversial issue she dealt with at these meetings was being asked about the closure of the ski area…and, being a skier, she thought it was a fun question to answer.<br /> <br /> At Mojave private land acquisition was a major management initiative. Mary really enjoyed that aspect of the job and had succeeded in gaining $20 million in private funding for the project. At Lassen, Mary heard there was a private parcel at Spencer Meadows contiguous to the park the owner was interested in selling. Obtaining private funding, Mary and her team were able to add 80 acres to the park, the first park expansion in decades.<br /> <br /> The management team and staff at Lassen were dedicated to the park and the NPS mission. Mary was very rewarded to be there while accomplishing a myriad of natural and cultural resource protection/visitor goals (Manzanita campground thinning project, several successful fire management tasks and plans, developing an employee safety program, developing the current park movie and so much more).<br /> <br /> Today, Mary and her husband visit Lassen Volcanic, especially with their grandchildren. \"It never fails to take my breath away and leave me in awe. I’m not sure being the Park Superintendent at Lassen Volcanic National Park was something a girl growing up in San Francisco could even dream about, but I know that having the honor of holding that position will never leave my dreams.\"",

During her 20-year service with the park, she demonstrated native lifeways wearing her Astugewi tribal dress as her park uniform.<br /> <br /> LaMarr began demonstrations of Atsugewi traditional cultural activities for park visitors outside the Loomis Museum in June of 1952. In her 30-minute program, LeMarr primarily demonstrated basket weaving and acorn pounding. The program proved to be popular, drawing crowds of several dozen visitors each session. Two years later, LaMarr was joined by another cultural demonstrator, Dessie Snooks, also known as Karr-ah-taht-menoo, or “Grasshopper Woman.” <br /> <br /> At nearly 80 years old, LeMarr was described by the chief park naturalist as “still bright and charming as she has always been.” LaMarr's given name was Boonookoo-eemenorra and so she was affectionately called “Boonie” by park staff. She continued to give demonstrations each summer until 1972, when she fell ill in the spring and passed away that September. After awhile, her nieces Laverna Jenkins and Lillian Snooks continued the demonstrations. <br /> <br /> In 1988, Snooks told a Los Angeles Times reporter, \"The old Indian ways of the Atsugewis are dying fast.

            "bodyText": "George William Norris came to Beaver City, Nebraska in 1885 to practice law. In his three terms as the prosecuting attorney of Furnas County, and in his seven years as judge in Nebraska’s Fourteenth judicial district, Norris's influence was felt in south central Nebraska. However, in his 40 years in the U.S. Congress his outstanding contributions influenced the entire nation.<br /> <br /> Norris was born in 1861 in Ohio and after one year at Baldwin University in Ohio, he enrolled in Indiana State Normal School at Valparaiso. During the years he was a school teacher, he also studied law. He then entered law school at Valparaiso and was admitted to the bar in 1883.<br /> <br /> In order to have funds to set up a law practice, Norris returned to teaching for a short time, and then in 1884 began a partnership with H.H. Harrington in a law office in Beatrice, Nebraska. Within a year, however, Norris moved to Beaver City in Furnas County, Nebraska, and established a law practice there.<br /> <br /> In 1899 Norris moved to McCook, Nebraska. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1902 and served five terms. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1912, where he also served five terms. He served under seven presidents, from Theodore Roosevelt through Franklin Roosevelt.<br /> <br /> Norris's accomplishments during these years that he represented Nebraska in Washington, D.C. included writing the Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which is also known as the \"Lame Duck\" amendment. He introduced it in the Senate and helped secure its passage in 1933. This amendment provided that Congress convene in January following the election in November, instead of months later. It also advanced the presidential inauguration from March to January.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, there was a huge gap between people in town and people on the farms. Only about 10 percent of U.S. farm families had central station electricity in the mid-30s. Nebraska’s average in 1929 was even lower – only 5.9 percent of farmers had electricity. Almost all urban people had power.<br /> <br /> George Norris was Nebraska’s independent Senator from McCook. He knew first hand from growing up on a farm what it was like to live without power. Throughout the 20s, Norris had tried to push through the Tennessee Valley Authority that would build a series of dams on the Tennessee River to provide, among other things, cheap electricity to the rural people of that region. He finally succeeded in 1933. Then he turned his attention to rural residents across the nation.<br /> <br /> President Roosevelt was also sympathetic to the need for power on the farm. In 1936, FDR created the Rural Electrification Administration by executive order. To pay for the program, he took $100 million of work relief funds and set them aside for the REA.<br /> <br /> Norris is credited with planning the Tennessee Valley Authority, which provided flood control and created electricity in the region drained by the Tennessee River. The TVA, as it is known, was a forerunner of the Rural Electrification Act (REA), which eventually brought electricity to farms and ranches across the nation. Norris is also known for his support of the rights of laborers in collective bargaining.<br /> <br /> Norris wrote and promoted the Nebraska constitutional amendment that created the Unicameral Legislature in Nebraska, which is unique among the 50 states.<br /> <br /> While Norris was a Republican, except for his last term in office, his attitude and actions were those of a progressive. He had planned to retire in 1936 but was encouraged to run again for the Senate as an independent. He was elected by a large majority. Throughout his years in public office, Norris had received much support from Democrats in Nebraska. In turn, he had campaigned for Alfred Smith (1928) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932, 1936, and 1940). Norris's defeat in the Senate race in 1942 was thought to have resulted from his support for these Democratic candidates.<br /> <br /> Norris returned to McCook in 1943 and died there on September 2, 1944. He was the first person named to the newly created Nebraska Hall of Fame in 1961.<br /> <br /> The Norris Home in McCook, a National Historic Landmark, contains original family furnishings and memorabilia from Norris's years in Washington and is open to the public as a branch museum of the Nebraska State Historical Society.",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>By Jack Nisbet</em><br /> <br /> The Hudson's Bay Company's original Fort Vancouver was still under construction when Scottish naturalist David Douglas arrived in the spring of 1825. He carried a letter of introduction to Chief Factor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnmcloughlin.htm\">Dr. John McLoughlin</a> explaining his mission to collect seeds and specimens of Northwest plants for the London Horticultural Society.<br /> <br /> Help came from all sides. McLoughlin provided the newcomer with his personal support as well as the Hudson's Bay Company's available resources. Many of the agents were young Scottish men who shared not only Douglas's background, but also his love of fishing and shooting game. Whenever he went into the field, Douglas traveled with French Canadian hunters and <em>voyageurs </em>who were intimately acquainted with the landscape. The American Indian wives and mixed families of these company employees held deep cultural knowledge of plants as food, medicine, and textiles.<br /> <br /> During the spring of 1825, Douglas explored the prairies and woodlands around the new fort, marveling at the blend of big-leaf and prairie lupines: \"they thrive in the highest perfection and make two of the most beautiful plants I ever beheld.\" He collected a broomrape and deervetch that emerged after Indigenous controlled burns on the open terraces above the Columbia River. By summer's end he had amassed 499 species of plants from the vicinity, many of them new to science.<br /> <br /> Using Fort Vancouver as a home base, Douglas roamed the Columbia Department during visits in 1825-27, 1830, and 1832-33. Even though his main focus was on seeds for British gardens, his observations covered the entire range of natural science. He watched pocket gophers munch their way through camas fields and the first Fort Vancouver potato patch. He puzzled over the species of local deer, and the common tree squirrel of the area still carries his name. During the winter months, he studied the behavior or local birds and mammals and compiled \"An Account of the Zoology of the Columbia.\"<br /> <br /> Adept at generating local excitement, Douglas inspired local hunters to bring in items of special interest such as sugar pine nuts and bighorn sheep. When one of the Hudson's Bay Company hunters brought a freshly shot California condor into Fort Vancouver, the workers \"had a hearty laugh at the eagerness with which the Botanist pounced upon it. In a very short time he had it almost in his embrace fathoming its stretch of wings...This satisfied him, and the bird was carefully transferred to his studio for the purpose of being stuffed.\"<br /> <br /> After Douglas's collections outgrew a hide tent on the post grounds, workers fashioned a cedar bark hut for him. There he examined pitch from native conifers and artifacts woven from native fibers. He asked the post blacksmith to forge a rock hammer so he could crack out mineral samples. When he brought an extensive kit of surveying equipment from London in 1830, a clerk trained in surveying helped Douglas determine latitudes, longitudes, and peak elevations around the vicinity of the fort. \"In all that pertained to nature and science,\" wrote clerk George Barnston, \"he was the perfect enthusiast.\"<br /> <br /> <strong><u>References</u></strong><br /> <br /> Barnston, George. \"Abridged Sketch of the Life of Mr. David Douglas, Botanist, with a Few Details of His Travels and Discoveries.\" <em>Canadian Naturalist and Geologist</em><em> 5</em> (1860).<br /> <br /> Douglas, David. <em>Journal Kept by David Douglas during his Travels in North America</em>.

With a sensible Quaker background and a self-deprecating sense of humor, Townsend set about documenting the fauna of the region. After spending the winter of 1834-35 in Hawaii, Townsend returned to Fort Vancouver in time for songbird migration, and eventually described five wood warblers from the Pacific Northwest. </span></span></span></span></span></p> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Specializing in bird and rodent specimens, Townsend kept careful behavioral notes about his prizes. He characterized the Audubon’s warbler as “always silent while engaged in seeking its food,” and observed that the shy member of the family we now call MacGillivray’s “warbles a very sprightly and pleasant little song, raising its head until the bill is almost vertical, and swelling its throat in the manner of many of its relatives.” John James Audubon later used several of Townsend’s specimens as models for his large paintings.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Well aware that the California condor had been studied by both Lewis and Clark and David Douglas, Townsend determined to make his own study skin of a bird he encountered feeding on dead salmon at Willamette Falls. After taking what he thought was a kill shot and stripping naked to swim over to a sand bar and retrieve it, the collector was surprised to discover that “the huge creature had been only wing-broken and as I approached him, seemed determined not to yield himself a willing captive.” As people and dogs from the local village gathered around, Townsend began to pelt the condor with stones. Laughter from the women rang in his ears as he tried to kick sand in the bird’s eyes. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Occasionally harassed by local dogs while hunting for specimens, Townsend threatened to shoot the unruly animals if they were not tied up. From then on, “whenever I approached the lodges, there was a universal stir among the people, and the words ‘<i>iskam kahmooks, kalaklalah tie chahko</i> (take up your dogs, the <i>bird chief</i> is coming)’ echoed through the little village.”</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Townsend the \"bird chief\" was equally keen on small rodents, and one of the many species named after him is Townsend’s big-eared bat, about which he noticed a symbiotic relationship with the workers at the fort: “This species is protected by the gentlemen of the Hudson’s Bay Company, for their services in destroying the dermestes beetles which abound in their fur establishments.”</span></span></span></span></span> <p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">During his time at Fort Vancouver, Townsend became part of the fur trade community, serving on one of the first formal juries there and assuming the role of post surgeon after </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/meredithgairdner.htm\">Meredith Gairdner</a><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\"> left.

After a week, Tolmie departed for Fort Nisqually, leaving Gairdner with a dead skunk to dissect and a seasonal outbreak of intermittent fever (probably malaria) to treat. His patients included Chief Factor </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnmcloughlin.htm\">Dr. John McLoughlin</a><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\"> and family, workers at the fort, and Indigenous people from the lower Columbia. When not treating the ill, Gairdner took a turn in the trading room, for his contract with the Hudson's Bay Company included part-time service as a clerk. These duties did not leave as much leisure time for exploration as he had hoped. </span><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#131612\">“Opportunities of visiting even the environs of the Fort are </span></span><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">few and far between,” he wrote a few months after his arrival. “My collections of plants in N.W. America are as yet but small having made but one small journey into the country of the Walamet river, ground already traversed by Douglas.”</span></span></span></span></span></p> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">That August, David Douglas himself arrived at Fort Vancouver,</span> <span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">and for two months Gairdner had the pleasure of a fellow naturalist's company. Douglas shared his notes on some new species of pines he had collected, and they were planning an assault on Mount St. Helens when an eruption ensued. After listening to tales of the botanist's adventures, Gairdner concluded: “The true method of examining this country is to follow the plan of Douglas, whether with the view of investigating the geognostic, botanical or zoological riches of the country.”</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Between 1833 and 1835, Gairdner spent his small amount of free time examining the country near Fort Vancouver. He studied the salmon species that frequented the Columbia. He sent a number of bird skins to the Edinburgh Museum, including “a little Columbian owl” and four different woodpeckers. He developed an interest in ethnography, compiling a “List of nations on the lower part of the Columbia” that grouped people by language families and dialects—a testimony to the diversity of local tribes. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">In the fall of 1834, Gairdner mailed “a small case of novelties” to his mentor William Jackson Hooker in Scotland. In addition to plants from the environs of the fort, it contained cordage woven from the local iris, fishing nets, edible roots, and seeds of a sedge “used by the Chinooks for the manufacture of baskets.” </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">The following spring, Gairdner contracted tuberculosis, and that fall sailed for Hawai'i to recuperate. He passed away there before he could fulfill his ambition of returning to the Columbia to make scientific explorations in the spirit of Douglas. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <strong><u>References</u></strong><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span lang=\"en-US\" style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Gairdner, Meredith. “Observations During a Voyage From England to Fort Vancouver, on the North-West coast of America.” <i>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal.</i> 16 (1834): 290-302</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">_________. <i>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</i>, 19, no. 37 (July 1835) p. 1</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">_________. “ Notes on the Geography of the Columbia River.\" <i>Journal of the Royal Geographic Society</i> 11 (1841): 250-257.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">_________.

In his late twenties he became fascinated with the prospect of importing salmon and furs from the Pacific Northwest. After chartering a vessel to ferry trade goods around the Horn to the Columbia River, he journeyed overland with a small party in spring 1832 to establish a trading post. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">Upon arriving on the Columbia that October, Wyeth learned that his ship had wrecked en route. The trader found himself “afloat on the great sea of life without stay or support but in good hands, i.e. myself and providence and a few of the H.B.Co. who are perfect gentleman.” Determined to return to Massachusetts and outfit another ship, the American spent the winter months scouting the area for a suitable post site.

Among his first collections was the Pacific dogwood (<i>Cornus nuttalli</i>), which he identified as a new species. He forwarded viable seeds to England, where they sprouted and became a featured attraction at Kew Gardens. He also found time to collect 23 new species of freshwater mollusks from the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, including the winged floater,<i> Anodonta nutalliana</i>. As his vessel paused in the tidewaters before embarking on its Pacific voyage, the tireless collector snagged a salt-water clam named <i>Clinocardium nuttallii</i>, Nuttall’s cockle.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman\",sans-serif\">When Nuttall returned to Fort Vancouver the following spring, he and John Kirk Townsend identified several new plants plus a host of Northwest birds.

Electing to set aside his religious convictions and the leanings of his middle name, he volunteered his services to defend the nation. His initial service proved short, however, when following the Battle of Fort Macon, Rodman contracted typhoid fever and returned home to recover.<br /> <br /> When he received a letter from General Burnside informing him of a need for officers for the upcoming movement to counter Lee's invasion of Maryland, Rodman quickly responded. Still ailing and against the advice of his physician, he returned to the Army after only a few weeks, in time to lead the Third Division of the IX Corps in their effort to take Turner's Gap in the Battle of South Mountain.<br /> <br /> Three days later, in the Battle of Antietam, on September 17, 1862, Burnside and the IX Corps were ordered to strike the right flank of the Confederate line. When the advance was held up attempting to cross the bridge over Antietam Creek that would bear Burnside's name, Burnside sent Rodman's Third Division further downstream to find a place where they could ford and flank the enemy defending the bridge.<br /> <br /> Rodman found too late that no one had properly reconnoitered the proposed ford, two-thirds of a mile south of the bridge, which was unusable due to its steep banks.<br /> <br /> It was not until around noon that Rodman's men successfully found and secured the crossing at Snavely's Ford two miles farther downstream. By 1 p.m., Rodman and his men had reached the west bank and had begun to form into line to attack Lee's right, but the delay in organizing the remainder of the corps meant that the benefit of securing the crossing at Snavely's Ford was largely negated.<br /> <br /> Rodman led his men in the final assault, only to be turned back by the timely arrival of A.P. Hill's division after a rapid forced march from Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Catching sight of the approaching Confederates, Rodman knew his division, on the far left flank, would bear the brunt of their assault and turned to warn his brigade commanders. As he galloped across the field toward them, he was shot through the left lung and fell mortally wounded.<br /> <br /> Isaac Peace Rodman died thirteen days later in a field hospital near Sharpsburg, MD.<br /> <br /> In a funeral oration, Senator Henry B. Anthony said of Rodman:<br /> <br /> \"Here lies the true type of the patriot soldier. Born and educated to peaceful pursuits, with no thirst for military distinction, with little taste or predilection for military life, he answered the earliest call of his country, and drew his sword in her defense.\"<br /> <br /> Rodman was one of six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Stephen Arnold Douglas, best known for his career in national politics and his antebellum political rivalry with Abraham Lincoln, began life inauspiciously enough in rural Vermont. The son of a country doctor, Douglas was educated in common schools and later completed his preparatory education at the Canandaigua Academy in Canandaigua, N.Y.<br /> <br /> Moving west to Illinois, Douglas completed his studies to become an attorney and soon began his meteoric rise in state politics when he was elected State's Attorney for the Morgan circuit in 1835. From there, Douglas quickly rose through the Illinois state political and legal systems and by 1843 had secured a seat in Congress, elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat.<br /> <br /> During his time as a congressman and later as a senator, Douglas was best known for his work promoting the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. The Kansas-Nebraska Act created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and sought to settle the issue of whether these territories would be admitted as free or slave states into the Union through popular sovereignty, meaning residents would vote on the issue. This politicization resulted in pro-slavery settlers and abolitionists flooding the territories, resulting in Bleeding Kansas. The Kansas-Nebraska Act spurred Abraham Lincoln to oppose Douglas and challenge his seat in the Senate.<br /> <br /> When Lincoln ran for the US Senate seat held by Douglas in 1858, the two men faced off in a series of seven impassioned debates, famously known as the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. While Lincoln may have been considered the victor of the debates in the view of history, Douglas won the election. Two years later, he ran against Lincoln as the Northern Democratic candidate in the four-way race for president. Though finishing second to Lincoln in popular votes, he mustered only 12 electoral votes, the fewest by far of the four candidates.<br /> <br /> After the inauguration, Douglas threw his support behind Lincoln and undertook a tour to bolster support for the Union, making visits to Virginia, Ohio and Illinois. However, less than three months after Lincoln's inauguration, Douglas contracted typhoid fever and died in Chicago on June 3, 1861.</p>",

            "bodyText": "William Henry Seward was appointed Secretary of State by Abraham Lincoln on March 5, 1861, and served until March 4, 1869. Seward carefully managed international affairs during the Civil War and also negotiated the 1867 purchase of Alaska.<br /> <br /> Seward was born in Florida, New York on May 16, 1801. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York in 1820.<br /> <br /> William H. Seward became a well-established Republican politician, formerly identifying with the Whig Party, and was known for his stance against the spread of slavery. Many viewed him as the top Republican presidential candidate in 1860. Seward had a long political career including service in the New York State Senate, US Senate, and as governor of New York. Seward was so confident in the strength of his political experience that he believed it was nearly a foregone conclusion that he would secure the Republican nomination for President for the 1860 election. He was so confident in fact that he feared political overexposure was the only thing that could cost him the nomination.<br /> <br /> In order to minimize this risk, in 1859, he embarked on an eight month tour of Europe. During this time the relatively unknown Abraham Lincoln campaigned aggressively and rapidly built up support amongst Republicans even as Seward's opinions became more moderate on the issue of slavery, costing him additional support. As a result, Lincoln was able to secure his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate at the 1860 Republican Convention.<br /> <br /> Once it was clear that Seward would not be the nominee, he dutifully put his support behind Lincoln, campaigning on his behalf. Because of his vast experience Seward was appointed Secretary of State in 1861. As the most powerful member of Lincoln's cabinet, Seward was part of many influential decisions, including the timing of the Emancipation Proclamation.<br /> <br /> The timing of the proclamation was highly political. Lincoln penned his first copy in July 1862, when Union armies were losing one battle after another. Seward persuaded Lincoln that emancipation then would look like the \"last measure of an exhausted government . . . stretching forth its hands to . . . Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.\" (In the mid-19th century, black Americans were sometimes called Ethiopians.) So Lincoln decided to wait for a victory on the battlefield. The Battle of Antietam gave him his opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the night of April 14, 1865 when John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln his actions were part of a coordinated plot to assassinate several high ranking members of the Lincoln administration. George Atzerodt was meant to murder Vice President Andrew Johnson, though he backed out at the last minute, while Lewis Powell and his lookout David Herold were sent to assassinate Secretary Seward. Seward was at home and bedridden following a recent carriage accident. Powell was able to gain entry to the home by saying that he had medicine for the Secretary. Once inside the home Powell attacked two of Seward's sons, soldier and nurse Sergeant George Robinson, and knocked Seward's daughter Fanny to the floor before brutally stabbing William H. Seward in the face and throat.<br /> <br /> The attack left Seward with permanent facial scars, but he survived and continued to serve as Secretary of State in the Johnson administration. Perhaps his greatest achievement during this time, though it was commonly derided as \"Seward's Folly\", was helping to negotiate the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<h3>Early Life</h3> Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston in 1809. Both of his parents were actors. His mother, the much admired Elizabeth Arnold Poe was a talented actress. His father, David Poe was considered less talented. The Poes performed at theaters throughout the Eastern seaboard, from Boston to Virginia. In 1811, Elizabeth Poe died of tuberculosis in Richmond, Virginia, leaving orphaned Edgar, his infant sister Rosalie, and his older brother Henry. David Poe, apparently had abandoned his wife and children earlier and was not present when she died.<br /> <br /> The three children were separated and raised by different families. Edgar was taken in by the successful Richmond merchant John Allan, and his frail wife Frances. The Allans had no children of their own. They raised Edgar as part of the family and gave him their middle name, but never legally adopted him.<br /> <br /> In 1815, Edgar traveled with the Allans to England and Scotland, where John Allan planned to expand his tobacco business. Edgar attended boarding schools throughout the five years the family lived overseas. After John Allan’s business venture failed, he moved the family back to Richmond, Virginia in 1820. <h3>From University of Virginia to West Point</h3> Edgar continued his studies in Richmond. He entered the University of Virginia in 1826 at the age of 17. During the year he attended the university, Edgar excelled in his studies of Latin and French. He was unable to complete his studies at the university because Allan refused to pay debts Edgar had incurred during the school year. Allan and Edgar quarreled over the debts, of which a large portion was incurred from gambling.<br /> <br /> Shortly after his quarrel with his foster father, Edgar Allan Poe left Richmond for Boston where he hoped to pursue a literary career. His first book of poetry, <em>Tamerlane and Other Poems</em> was published there. Unable to support himself, and receiving little assistance from his foster father, Poe enlisted as a private in the US Army on May 26, 1827 for a five year term. He entered under an assumed name and lied about his age, claiming to be 22 years old when he was only 18. Poe was assigned to Battery H of the First Artillery at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor. On October 31, 1827 Battery H was ordered to Fort Moultrie to protect Charleston Harbor. He sailed on the Brigantine <em>Waltham</em>, arriving for duty in Charleston on November 18. <br /> <br /> At Fort Moultrie, Poe was promoted to artificer, the rank of a noncommissioned officer or enlisted man who had a mechanical specialty. On December 11, 1828, Poe’s battery sailed for duty at Fortress Monroe, Virginia where he attained the rank of Sergeant-Major, the highest possible rank for a non-commissioned officer. His quick progress up the ranks can be attributed to his education, high social standing, and competence. Despite his accomplishments, Poe left military service in April 1829 and hired a substitute to complete his obligation. <br /> <br /> A brief reconciliation between Poe and Allan occurred upon the death of Frances Allan in 1829. Allan assisted Poe in obtaining a discharge from the regular Army and an appointment as a cadet at the US Military Academy in West Point. Entering West Point in July 1830, Poe was again plagued by restlessness. One of his roommates described him as having “the appearance of being much older. He had a worn, weary, discontented look, not easily forgotten by those who were intimate with him.” The financial hardship along with the realization that literature was his true vocation, led to Poe’s decision to resign from the Academy. Allan, as Poe's guardian, refused to give him permission to resign. Unable to obtain permission to resign, Poe chose to neglect his duties and was court-martialed for “gross neglect of duty” and “disobedience of orders.” <h3>Editor and Author</h3> After leaving West Point, Poe eventually moved to Baltimore where he lived with his impoverished Aunt Maria Poe Clemm and her young daughter, Virginia. Poe continued to write poetry and prose. In 1833, he won a $50 prize and attention for his short story “Ms. Found in a Bottle.” The attention he gained led to a job offer as an editor for the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond. Poe accepted the position and moved to Richmond in 1835. His aunt and cousin joined him the following year. Poe married his thirteen year old cousin, Virginia, shortly afterwards.<br /> <br /> The Poes and Mrs. Clemm moved to New York City in 1837 with the hope of Edgar finding work in the literary field. The city, as well as the rest of the country was in the midst of a depression caused by the financial “Panic of ’37.” Unable to find work, Poe moved to Philadelphia in 1838. The six years he spent in Philadelphia proved to be his most productive, and perhaps the happiest years of his life. He worked as an editor and critic for one of the nation's largest magazines, Graham’s Magazine. Some of his most famous stories were written in Philadelphia, including the “Fall of the House of Usher,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Mask of the Red Death,” and “Ligeia.” Poe referred to South Carolina settings in several short stories, including “The Balloon-Hoax\" and “The Oblong Box.\" By far his most popular story inspired by Sullivan’s Island was “The Gold Bug,” originally published in 1843. In 1842, his beloved wife became ill with tuberculosis. Her illness and the constant strain of financial problems, caused Poe to sink into deep bouts of depression. <h3>Professional and Personal Loss</h3> The Poes and Mrs. Clemm moved to New York City in 1844. Poe continued to work as an editor and critic. He gained his greatest fame as a poet after his poem “The Raven” was published in 1845. In the same year, he achieved his lifelong dream of owning a literary journal. Unfortunately, the journal failed within a few months. The Poes and Mrs. Clemm moved outside of New York City to a small cottage in 1846. Virginia died of tuberculosis the following year. <h3>Death</h3> For the next two years Poe continued to write poetry, short stories, criticism and plan for his own literary journal. After a successful lecture tour in the South and an extended visit in Richmond, Poe seemed to be finally recovering from the loss of Virginia, and making plans for the future. On his way back to New York City, Poe stopped in Baltimore where he died of “acute congestion of the brain.” The day was October 7, 1849; Edgar Allan Poe was 40 years old.<br />  ",

After dropping out of Yale University, Benjamin moved to New Orleans in 1828 where he clerked at a law firm until he was admitted to the bar in 1833. In 1852 he was elected to the U.S. Senate, making him only the second Jewish-American senator in the history of the country. President Millard Fillmore offered to nominate Benjamin to the U.S. Supreme Court, which could have made him the first Jewish-American justice, but Benjamin declined.<br /> <br /> When Louisiana seceded from the Union, Benjamin resigned his Senate seat and was appointed as the first Attorney General of the Confederacy by his close personal friend, Jefferson Davis. In September 1861 he was appointed Secretary of War. In this position he had strong disagreements with President Davis over the conduct the war, and quarreled with generals P.G.T. Beauregard and \"Stonewall\" Jackson. In March 1862 Davis appointed Benjamin to the position of Secretary of State, a post that he would hold for the remainder of the conflict.<br /> <br /> Following the surrender of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, Benjamin fled the country, making his way to the Bahamas and then to England, where he resumed his successful legal career. He lived in exile for the remainder of his life, never returning to the United States. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard was born to a French Creole family on a sugar plantation outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. While studying engineering at the US Military Academy at West Point, he also studied artillery under Robert Anderson, whom he would encounter again under dissimilar circumstances in Charleston in 1861. Beauregard served in the Mexican-American War as an engineer and later held a position as the superintending engineer of the U.S. Custom House in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> After his native Louisiana seceded, Beauregard became the first Confederate general officer on March 1, 1861 with the rank of brigadier general. Quickly thereafter, he took command of Confederate forces in Charleston, South Carolina. He found harbor defenses in a poor state despite the energy with which the southerners had erected batteries. He applied his knowledge of engineering and artillery to strengthen Confederate positions. <br /> <br /> After President Lincoln’s communication to Governor Francis Pickens of South Carolina that a relief fleet was being sent to resupply Fort Sumter, President Jefferson Davis of the Confederate States of America ordered Brigadier General Beauregard to deliver a final ultimatum to Major Anderson to evacuate Fort Sumter. Beauregard witnessed the bombardment from Charleston, from the Edmonston-Alston House on the Cooper River waterfront, and sent his three aides to seek terms to conclude the battle. <br /> <br /> The victor of Fort Sumter, Beauregard followed that success with another victory at the First Battle of Manassas (or Bull Run). Beauregard, later transferred to the Western Theatre because of his disagreements with President Jefferson Davis and other leading Confederates, commanded at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee and the Siege of Corinth in northern Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Beauregard’s defeat at Corinth resulted in his loss of command of the Western Theatre. The people of Charleston had fond memories of Beauregard from 1861 and clamored for him to take command of their defenses. Beauregard returned to Charleston in 1863 in time to prepare for and defend against repeated Union attacks, beginning in April with a failed Union naval attack. Union General Quincy A. Gillmore directed the failed assaults on Battery Wagner on Morris Island in July. Frustrated, he demanded Beauregard evacuate Morris Island and Fort Sumter or Charleston would be fired upon.<br /> <br /> Beauregard never received the letter and vigorously protested Gillmore’s bombardment of Charleston, writing him: “I am surprised, sir, at the limits you have set to your demand. If, in order to attain the bombardment of Morris Island and Fort Sumter, you feel authorized to fire on this city, why did you not also include the works on Sullivan’s and James Islands, nay, even the city of Charleston, in the same demand?” Despite outcry in the Confederacy, Gillmore continued to direct fire upon Charleston.<br /> <br /> Beauregard’s valuable experience in commanding a successful defense against besieging Union forces was duplicated in June 1864 when he directed the defense of Petersburg, Virginia, thereby safeguarding Richmond. <br /> <br /> Following his military career, Beauregard was one of the few wealthy former Confederate generals because of his role in promoting the Louisiana Lottery. He died in 1893 and is buried in New Orleans in the tomb of the Army of the Tennessee.",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Edmund Ruffin, the father of soil science, achieved notoriety for his outspoken views on slavery, states’ rights, and secession. Born to a wealthy Virginian planter family in 1794, Ruffin began in his twenties experimenting with ways to rejuvenate the depleted soil of his native state, which suffered from the monoculture of tobacco. He advocated crop rotation and the use of marl, or lime, to improve the soil by reducing acidity. In addition to his work in agriculture, Ruffin served as a private in the Virginia militia during the War of 1812 and later held political office as a state senator.<br /> <br /> By the 1850s, Ruffin’s attention became increasingly drawn to politics. He advocated for secession years before it became reality. Events, however, soon outpaced even Ruffin’s prediction of secession. John Brown’s raid on the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859 alerted southerners to the extent of pro-abolitionist sentiment in the North. Ruffin traveled to witness Brown’s execution and later purchased several of the pikes Brown and his men had carried to send to southern governors as a reminder of the intent of abolitionists.<br /> <br /> The presidential election of 1860 saw the Democratic Party split along geographic lines. Ruffin and other Fire-Eaters, known for their support of slavery and secessionist rhetoric, traveled throughout the South, urging states to secede and form a new government. Ruffin was present in Charleston on December 20, 1860 when South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Union.<br /> <br /> In his 1860 book, <em>Anticipations of the Future, to Serve as Lessons for the Present Time</em>, Ruffin predicted civil war would come in 1868 with the re-election of the hated William H. Seward, that the first shots of that war would be fired at Fort Sumter, and that the South would be victorious.<br /> <br /> On April 12, 1861 Ruffin, now a private in the Palmetto Guard and stationed on Morris Island, fired a shot from a 64-pounder columbiad at Fort Sumter, one of the first shots fired of the American Civil War. Days after the Confederacy’s first victory at Fort Sumter, Ruffin was overjoyed to hear his native Virginia had seceded. A hero for his role at Fort Sumter, Ruffin spent the early stages of the war traveling to battlefields to rally the troops.<br /> <br /> As the fortunes of the war turned against the Confederacy and Union forces made greater incursions into Virginia, Ruffin stopped traveling and abandoned some of his properties, spending the end of the war at his farm in Amelia County, Virginia. After hearing the news of the surrender of Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House and being in poor health, Ruffin decided to end his life rather than live under the Stars and Stripes again. He committed suicide on June 17, 1865 at the age of seventy-one and was later interred at his Virginia plantation, Marlbourne.</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">“And now with my latest writing and utterance, and with what will [be] near to my latest breath, I here repeat, & would willingly proclaim, my unmitigated hatred to Yankee rule—to all political, social and business connections with Yankees, & to the perfidious, malignant, & vile Yankee race.”<br />  </p> </blockquote>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Francis Wilkinson Pickens, grandson of Revolutionary War general Andrew Pickens, was a lawyer, state and federal legislator, US ambassador to Russia, and governor of South Carolina. During his term as governor, he witnessed and supported the secession of South Carolina from the Union and the opening shots of the Civil War from Confederate batteries at Union-held Fort Sumter. <br /> <br /> A political ally of Senator John C. Calhoun, Pickens ardently supported nullification in the 1830s, questioning the legality of a protective tariff. At the 1850 Southern Rights Convention in Nashville, Pickens emerged as a strong advocate for secession. The failure of southern cooperation pushed him briefly toward the radical position of separate state action, but he returned to the fold of the national Democratic party and actively campaigned for the 1856 candidacy of President James Buchanan. In return for his support, Buchanan offered Pickens the position of minister to Russia, which he eventually accepted. He served there from 1858 to 1860, befriending Czar Alexander II.<br /> <br /> In 1860, Pickens was elected governor of South Carolina and was installed just days before the state voted to secede from the Union. Under intense pressure to remove the Federal presence from Charleston Harbor, Pickens protested the move of Major Anderson's Union garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter. Apart from the shots fired at the <em>Star of the West</em> in January 1861, a vessel sent to reinforce and reprovision Fort Sumter, Pickens avoided hostilities. The eventual bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter, which opened the Civil War, came after the Confederate government took control of events in the harbor. <br /> <br /> Pickens' administration was beset was war-related problems, including raising troops and supplies to defend the coastline and assist the army in Virginia. Confidence in Pickens' leadership eroded over the course of his term, and his power diminished with the creation of a five-member executive council. <br /> <br /> He retired from politics in 1862, retiring to his plantation in Edgefield, but returned at war's end to represent his district in the state's constitutional convention. Pickens, as a convention delegate, recommended South Carolina adopt a policy of cooperation with the Johnson administration and personally introduced the bill to repeal South Carolina's Ordinance of Secession. It passed by a margin of 105 to 3. He died at his home on January 25, 1869, and was buried at Willowbrook Cemetery in Edgefield County.</p>",

He offered his services to Mississippi and was pleased to receive commission as a Major General in the Army of Mississippi. However, less than a month later he was elected president of the Confederacy. Despite his desire to serve as a general in the Confederate army, Davis accepted his election and was inaugurated on February 18, 1861 in Montgomery, Alabama.<br /> <br /> During his presidency, Davis was unable to find a strategy to defeat the better organized and more industrially developed North. Perhaps his most successful military move came in June 1862, with the appointment of Robert E. Lee to lead the Army of Northern Virginia. While many have criticized Davis' leadership during the war, most believe he guided the South as well as could be expected, given the limitations of the Confederacy.<br /> <br /> Recognizing these limitations, Davis' general strategy was defensive. However, during the Maryland Campaign Davis decided to attempt to hurt Union confidence and strengthen the Confederate position by launching an offensive campaign. Unfortunately for Davis, this invasion would ultimately meet with defeat and Lee's Army of Northern Virginia would retreat back across the Potomac and into the Confederacy following the Battle of Antietam. At the end of the war, Davis was imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe and charged with treason, though the case was never brought to trial. Despite his stalwart belief, even until his death in 1889, that the Confederate secession had been constitutional, throughout his later years Davis encouraged Southern loyalty to the Union. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Louis Trezevant Wigfall, a Texas politician and briefly an officer in the Confederate States Army, advocated for slavery and secession. His rhetoric earned him a place with other leading Fire-Eaters: William Lowndes Yancey, William Porcher Miles, and Roger Atkinson Pryor. He witnessed the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter from Morris Island while serving as an aide to General P.G.T. Beauregard. Wigfall also played a role in securing the Union’s evacuation of Fort Sumter. <br /> <br /> Wigfall was born on a plantation near Edgefield, South Carolina. Wigfall bounced between different universities for his degree and at one time abandoned academics entirely to fight in the Third Seminole War in Florida. After his graduation from the South Carolina College (now University of South Carolina), Wigfall pursued a career in law. His interest in politics later overshadowed his law career.<br /> <br /> In 1848, Wigfall left South Carolina for Texas, leaving behind political battles that had escalated into fighting in duels. In Texas, Wigfall became a staunch opponent of Governor Sam Houston for his Unionist views and became an important Democratic leader in the state. Wigfall was elected to the US Senate by the Texas legislature in 1859 and served until March 1861. <br /> <br /> Wigfall, addressing the Senate in December 1860, outlined his views on the relationship of the states with the Union and criticized the Northern freedom of press. <br /> <br /> “You shall not publish newspapers and pamphlets to excite the non-slaveholders against the slaveholders, or the slaveholders against the non-slaveholders. We will have peace; and if you do not offer it to us, we will quietly, and as we have the right under the constitutional compact to do, withdraw from the Union and establish a government for ourselves; and if you then persist in your aggressions, we will leave it to the ultimo ratio regum (a resort to arms), and the sovereign States will settle that question. And when you laugh at these impotent threats, as you regard them, I tell you that cotton is king.”<br /> <br /> Wigfall traveled to Charleston, South Carolina as the Confederacy verged upon open warfare with Major Anderson’s Union garrison at Fort Sumter. He secured a position as an aide to General Beauregard. On the second day of the battle, the flag above Fort Sumter fell, and Confederates wondered if Anderson wished to surrender. Wigfall, on his own initiative and without orders, commandeered a rowboat on Morris Island and had Private Gourdin Young of the Palmetto Guard and two slaves take him out to Fort Sumter. Upon arrival, he sought an audience with Major Anderson and climbed into the fort through an open embrasure. <br /> <br /> “Your flag is down, you are on fire,” Wigfall told the Federals, “and you are not firing your guns. General Beauregard wants to stop this.”<br /> <br /> Wigfall succeeded in ending hostilities and granted generous evacuation terms, but the arrival of aides directly from General Beauregard with different information enraged Anderson who felt he had been misled and lied to by Wigfall. Eventually negotiations succeeded in calming the situation and securing an end to the first battle of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Wigfall followed this bizarre role in the opening acts of the war as an ineffective and often drunk brigadier general until February 1862 when he resigned his commission to take a seat in the Confederate Senate. Similar to his time in the US Senate, he advocated for states’ rights and loudly disagreed with President Jefferson Davis’ strong national government approach. <br /> <br /> At the end of the war, Wigfall returned to Texas and then sailed to Great Britain in exile where he attempted to create conflict between Great Britain and the United States. He returned to his native country in 1870 and finally died in Galveston, Texas in 1874.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Mary Chesnut, wife of former US Senator James Chesnut, started to write a diary as South Carolina made the momentous decision to be the first state to secede from the Union. Her diary provides a unique perspective on the political and societal realities of life in the Confederacy as well as first-hand accounts of important events like the bombardment of Fort Sumter and the start of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> Mary Boykin Miller was born on March 31, 1823, the daughter of Stephen Decatur Miller, an eminent South Carolina politician, who served as governor and in Congress. In April 1840, she married Chesnut, eight years her senior and another member of South Carolina’s leading class. They went to live with James’ parents at Mulberry, the Chesnut plantation three miles south of Camden. Amid the strong personalities of the Chesnut clan, Mary struggled to adjust and found life more stimulating once they moved to Washington DC when her husband took his seat at the Senate. Chesnut later became the first southerner to resign his seat in the US Senate, following Lincoln's victory in the presidential election. <br /> <br /> Chesnut was present at the birth of the Confederacy in Montgomery, Alabama in February 1861, witnessing the inauguration of President Jefferson Davis. She also famously witnessed the outbreak of the Civil War in Charleston and feared for her husband’s safety as he served as General Beauregard’s aide.<br />  </p> <p>Writing of the bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, she wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>\"Do you know, after all that noise and our tears and prayers, nobody has been hurt. Sound and fury, signifying nothing. A delusion and a snare.... Carolina Institute, where secession was signed, burned down. From East Bay - along Broad St. down to the river - Mr. Petigru's house. So being antisecession does not save. The fire, as the rain, falls on the just and the unjust. Fire appeared simultaneously in several places.\"</em></p> <p><br /> She captured the tense anxiety of the battle and the jubilation that occurred once news of Major Anderson’s surrender of Fort Sumter arrived.<br /> <br /> “Carolina Institute, where secession was signed, burned down. From East Bay - along Broad St. down to the river - Mr. Petigru’s house. So being antisecession does not save. The fire, as the rain, falls on the just and the unjust. Fire appeared simultaneously in several places.”<br /> <br /> Chesnut’s description of the fire of December 1861, which destroyed an estimated one-quarter of Charleston, foreshadows the later destruction Charleston would face by Union bombardment. Chesnut models the uncertainty and varying fortunes of the war in her personal life as the Confederacy, so often victorious at the outset of the war, ended in defeat and economic ruin.</p> <blockquote><em>“Lee’s tears - outsiders’ sneers - Yankees’ jeers. Did we lose by imbecility or because one man cannot fight ten for more than four years? We waited and hoped. They organized and worked like moles, with the riches of all the world at their backs. They have made their private fortunes by their country’s war. We talked of negro recruits. The Yankees used them - 18 million against six. The odds too great.”</em> - Chesnut in 1865 on the course of the war</blockquote> <p>Like many of the planter elite, the Chesnuts experienced financial troubles after the Civil War, losing their slaves and struggling to keep their plantations with mounting debts. She died in 1886 and was buried next to her husband in Knights Hill Cemetery in Camden, South Carolina.<br /> <br /> The diary provides an inside look at the political and social life of the South during the Civil War South and has been called the most important work by a Confederate author by some literary scholars. As Mary had no children, before her death in 1866 she gave her diary to her closest friend, Isabella D. Martin, urging her to have it published. The diary was first published in 1905 as a heavily edited version called A Diary from Dixie. A second, annotated version was published in 1981 as Mary Chesnut's Civil War, which won the Pulitzer Prize for history.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Arthur Kelly was born on October 27, 1900 in Hubbard, Texas. He graduated from the University of Texas in 1921, where he studied physical anthropology. He received his Masters in 1925 and his PhD in 1929 from Harvard University. He became a Fellow at the National Research Council and began studying physical traits of Cherokee individuals, but resigned to take an assistant professorship at the University of Illinois. There, he taught classes and directed archeological fieldwork at sites including Starved Rock State Park and Powell Mound at the famed Cahokia Mounds. <br /> <br /> In 1933, Kelly moved to Macon, Georgia to run the archeological excavations at Ocmulgee Creek (today Ocmulgee Creek National Monument). These excavations were one of five Smithsonian-sponsored projects that provided a suffering workforce with income during the Great Depression. It would become the largest archeological dig ever conducted within the United States. <br /> <br /> As Director, Kelly supervised a workforce of 700-800 individuals employed by the Works Progress Administration, specifically the Civil Works Administration, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps. Engineers produced scaled maps and soil profiles while illustrators drew in-situ (in place) finds. Some individuals worked as weekend tour guides, when up to 3000 people visited the site. Crews were stationed at different sites all around Ocmulgee, including one at Swift Creek composed entirely of African-American women. Daily, Kelly walked between these sites and dictated his interpretations to secretary Charlie Tidwell. By the time the excavations were finished, over 2.5 million artifacts were recovered. <br /> <br /> The Ocmulgee Project ran until 1937. In that year, Kelly was made the Chief Archeologist for the National Park Service and moved to the Washington, D.C. headquarters. While in a more administrative role, he continued to participate in excavations. In 1938, he helped run a field school in Chaco Canyon alongside Florence Hawley Ellis, Donovan Senter, and Robert Lister. The next summer, he was at Dunlap Farm with Gordon Willey, where together they produced a dendrochronological (tree-ring) dating sequence for Georgia dating back to 1700.  <br /> <br /> In 1941, the National Park Service eliminated the Chief Archeologist position. Kelly was reassigned to the Custom’s House in Salem, Massachusetts as its Superintendent. Two years afterwards, he requested to be transferred back to Ocmulgee as a “way to get back to some digging” (Willey, 45). He remained in the position of Superintendent and worked alongside archeologist Charles Fairbanks.  <br /> <br /> In 1946, after ten years, Kelly left the National Park Service and became a professor at the University of Georgia. In the following years, he became an archeological consultant to the state of Georgia and a founding member of the Georgia Historical Commission and the Society for Preservation of Early Georgia History. He worked at sites all across the state including Estatoe Mound, Bell Field, Etowah, Sixtoe, and Mandeville. In 1949, he ran a summer field school near Kolomoki State Park, the oldest and largest Woodland site in the southeastern United States. Kelly officially retired in 1967 but continued his excavations at Bell Field. He died on November 4, 1979. <br /> <br /> <br /> <u>Sources: </u><br /> 1. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ocmu/learn/historyculture/stories.htm\">Stories: The Largest Archeological Dig in America History</a>.

He was born in 1782 probably at Floyd’s Station, just east of Louisville, Kentucky, a log fort established in 1780 by his uncle, John Floyd. Charles’s father, Robert Clark Floyd, had come from Virginia where he had served in the Revolutionary War with George Rogers Clark. Young Charles would have grown up in this frontier setting, familiar with a gun and the surrounding wilderness. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\">The family moved across the Ohio River into present day Indiana in 1799 and two years later Charles was named the first constable of Clarksville Township. The fact that the young man, about 19 or 20, was named keeper of the peace in a new and untamed township says much about his abilities, strengths and personality. William Clark would have been familiar with Charles, since the Clark and Floyd families were well acquainted – which possibly explains why the young man was appointed as one of the sergeants of the Corps.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\">There is some debate on the name of Charles’s father. While most believe it was Robert, others feel he was the son of another Charles Floyd. The confusion is understandable, since the elder Charles Floyd also had a son named Charles – who actually was the first cousin of Sergeant Floyd. But it’s clear that Robert Clark Floyd was the sergeant’s father because of the heirs who actually came into possession of Sergeant Floyd’s land warrant. It originally would have been given to Robert, and was later passed down to Mary Lee Walton, the youngest daughter of Robert and sister of Charles, who sold the land in 1839. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\">Charles Floyd died, of course, on August 20, 1804 and was buried on a bluff a half mile below a small stream that the Expedition named the Floyd River. The actual burial site doesn’t exist today, since the changing river course and eroding bluff have changed the area on the south side of today’s Sioux City, Iowa. The Sergeant’s remains are buried under the 100-foot obelisk which stands in a location near the original site, a lasting tribute to this outstanding young soldier and member of the Corps. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\">Today, the site of Floyd’s Station is within the city of St. Matthews, Kentucky where this memorial sign stands.<br /> <br /> Learn more:</span></span></span></span><br /> <a href=\"http://www.lewis-clark.org/channel/362\">Discovering Lewis and Clark </a><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Jean Carl Harrington, often called “J.C.” or Pinky, and Virginia Sutton Harrington were two pioneering National Park Service archeologists. The couple met while graduate students at the University of Chicago studying anthropology and archeology, and married in 1938 while working at Jamestown. Together, Virginia and J.C. excavated and interpreted many important historic archeological sites throughout the United States, and helped to form the discipline of historical archeology.</p> <p>J.C. Harrington was born in 1901 in Michigan. He completed a degree in architectural engineering at the University of Michigan in 1924, then pursued a career in architecture until the onset of the Great Depression. After a summer spent in New Mexico during his undergraduate studies, Harrington first became interested in archeology. J.C. decided to pursue a graduate degree in archeology at the University of Chicago. He finished his Master’s degree in 1935 and passed his comprehensive exams the year after.</p> <p>In 1936 the National Park Service offered Harrington a job by to excavate the historic Jamestown site. As someone with both archeological and architectural experience, he was perfectly suited to work at the site and mediate conflict between the Jamestown architects and archeologists. Although he was at first hesitant, Harrington accepted the job, and began his 30-year long career with the National Park Service. After work at Jamestown ended as a result of World War II, Harrington was made Superintendent of Colonial National Historical Park. He held this position until 1954 when he was made the Eastern Regional Archeologist for the Southeast Region of the National Park Service, a position he held until his retirement in 1965.</p> <p>Although he began his career working at Native American sites before European contact, J.C. is best remembered as one of the pioneers of historical archeology, the study of archeological sites for which there is recorded history. J.C. arrived at Jamestown in 1936 with no experience in historical archeology, a field then still in its infancy. Harrington became one of the biggest advocates for historical archeology. One important contribution is a system of dating using the stem width of clay tobacco pipes, which is still used today (“Dating Stem Fragments of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Clay Tobacco Pipes”). In honor of his accomplishments, the Society of Historical Archaeology created the J.C. Harrington Award. He was also awarded a Citation for Distinguished Service from the United States Secretary of the Interior in 1952, a high honor.</p> <p>Virginia Sutton was born and raised in Washington D.C., and attended Swarthmore College, where she received a Bachelor’s degree in history in 1934. That same year she joined the National Park Service as a seasonal Ranger Archeologist at Mesa Verde. Like J.C., Virginia undertook graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where she completed a Master’s degree in anthropology. In 1937 she took a job at Jamestown as the site’s Ranger Historian- the very first woman to hold the position of Ranger Historian in the National Park Service. While at Jamestown, she worked with J.C. to excavate the site, but also provided interpretation for visitors. Her efforts to engage the public included exhibits at the Jamestown Education Museum and a program called “This Week at the Excavations,” which gave weekly exhibits and tours about the work completed that week and lab for public viewing (“A New Archaeology in the New Deal: The Rise of Historical Archaeology in the 1930’s”, 39). While at Jamestown, she passed the junior archeologist examination and was made a permanent archeologist at Colonial National Historical Park.</p> <p>Alone, J.C. and Virginia Harrington were important archeologists. Together, they worked as a team to excavate important archeological sites, establish professional associations, travel across the world, and even continue to excavate after retirement. In addition to their work at Jamestown, J.C. and Virginia collaborated at many of the projects J.C. directed for the NPS including Fort Raleigh and Fort Necessity. The couple also helped to establish the Eastern National Park and Monument Association, which supported the work of NPS archeologists and historians and made their research available to the public. Virginia served as the first treasurer of the group. After J.C. retired from the National Park Service in 1965 the couple conducted excavations in Nauvoo, Illinois and on Constitution Island for West Point Military Academy. It is without a doubt that both the archeology of the National Parks and the field of American archeology are greatly indebted to the work of J.C. and Virginia Harrington.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Jesse Logan Nusbaum was the first archeologist hired by the National Park Service. He was born in Greeley, Colorado, September 3, 1887, to Edward Moore and Agnes Strickland (Moodie) Nusbaum. Nusbaum attended local public schools in Greeley as well as the Colorado Teachers College there, receiving his B. Pedagogy in 1907. After graduation, Nusbaum went to New Mexico State Normal in Las Vegas to teach science and manual arts.</p> <p>In the summer of 1907, Nusbaum began his connection with Mesa Verde as a photographer and archeological assistant to A. V. Kidder. In June of 1909, Nusbaum became the first employee of the School of American Archeology and Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe under Dr. Edgar L. Hewett. While there he conducted archeological surveys, investigations, excavations, and ruins stabilization in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Colorado, and New Mexico including the Pajarito Plateau. Nusbaum's work at the museum again brought him to Mesa Verde for the excavation, repair, and stabilization of Balcony House, an important major project that extended into the winter of 1910. He spent nine months in Washington, D. C., September 1911 to June 1912, working on exhibits for the Panama-California Exposition to be held in San Diego, California. While in Washington, Nusbaum took advanced courses at night and continued his advanced studies in Colorado during the summer of 1913. His innovations at Mesa Verde and manual arts background stood him in good stead during this supervision of the restoration of the New Mexico Palace of Governors in Santa Fe which was completed in Fall of 1913. In 1913, Nusbaum worked three months in the Maya ruins of Yucatan with Dr. S. G. Morley. During his many expeditions with the museum, Nusbaum also helped restore the mission church at Pecos. He used some of its design in the work of the state art museum, built in 1916-19 under his supervision.</p> <p>Nusbaum attempted to become an aviator during World War I but instead became an engineer and served in France. He enlisted in May 1918 and was discharged April 1919. From May 1919 to June 1921, he was employed at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in New York City. While Nusbaum was working in New York he took part in several southwest expeditions including those at Hawikuh Pueblo and Basketmaker Cave.</p> <p>In 1921, while still in New York, Nusbaum was selected by Stephen Mather and Arno Cammerer to become superintendent at Mesa Verde National Park. Director Mather had become disgusted with the conditions that had developed there under a political superintendent. Nusbaum was a very effective superintendent, advancing the development of the park and preserving the archeological resources. He discontinued grazing, built a museum and developed good interpretive programs, especially ones designed to explain the Antiquities Act. His involvement with the Act led to his designation in 1927 as the lead archeologist and prime enforcer of the Act for the Southwest (while remaining Mesa Verde superintendent).</p> <p>Nusbaum continued this dual capacity until 1930, when he took a leave of absence to organize and direct the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe, New Mexico. He continued as director of the laboratory until 1935, having earlier returned to the Park Service and resumed his dual duties as Mesa Verde superintendent and Department of the Interior archeologist enforcing the Antiquities Act. Nusbaum continued this dual position for many years. In 1946 he left to work at the NPS office in Santa Fe, where he took up increased duties as the senior archeologist of the NPS. In this capacity, Nusbaum began one of the first salvage archeology projects when he persuaded El Paso Natural Gas Company to allow archeological excavation along their pipelines. For this, and many other accomplishments, Jesse L. Nusbaum received the Distinguished Service Award from the Department of the Interior in 1954.</p> <p>After a year's extension Nusbaum was forced to retire from the National Park Service at the age of 71 in 1957. However, he continued to do consulting work for many years. He died in Santa Fe in December 1975, at the age of 88.</p>",

Caywood in his practice and publications of historical sites archaeology, including the Hudson Bay forts in the Northwest, the mission sites in the Southwest, the historic Meductic site in Canada, and his work at Greenspring and Jamestown, Caywood became one of the early practitioners of historical archeology.</p> <p>Caywood received a BS degree in business administration in 1932 from the University of Arizona and a MA in anthropology in 1933. Caywood started working as an archeologist in 1933 at Tuzigoot, the 13th-century A.D. pueblo in the Verde Valley near Clarkdale, with Edward H. Spicer, another University of Arizona graduate student. By July 1935 the fieldwork and ruin stabilization had been completed with Civil Works Administration labor, and a 119-page illustrated report published by Caywood and Spicer through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and NPS, the latter now Caywood's full-time employer. This stands as a speed record for excavation and publication by any unit of Federal Relief archaeology in the 1930s and 1940s. Tuzigoot became a National Monument in 1940.</p> <p>Caywood began his 34-year career working for the NPS in 1934 as a temporary summer ranger at Mesa Verde. Soon after, he became the site superintendent at Canyon de Chelly. He went on to supervise excavations at Fort Vancouver, Fort Spokane, and Fort Okanagan, Washington. In 1954-1955 he excavated the 17th-century English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia (part of Colonial National Historical Park) and nearby at Governor Berkley’s Greenspring plantation.</p> <p>Other assignments took Caywood to Alaska to make survey reports on Sitka and on the Kenai Peninsula, and to Hawaii to make archaeological surveys of the islands of Oahu, Molakai, Maui, and Hawaii. On loan to the Branch of Historic Sites of Canada, he excavated the site of Meductic in the province of New Brunswick.</p> <p>Projects within the NPS included Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, on Virginius Island, and excavation and stabilization work at Montezuma Castle, Tumacacori, Tonto National Monument in Arizona, and Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico. After a stint as superintendent of Ocmulgee National Monument, Georgia, from 1956 to 1961, he ended his career in 1969 at the NPS Southwest Archeological Center.

Whir, whir, ......Bang, bang,...Crash, smash! The rebel batteries opened upon us together. The windows rattled, the house shook to its foundations. Heaven and earth seemed collapsing.\"<br /> \"We all went into the cellar....I entrenched myself in an empty piano box...\"<br /> <br /> In 1866, Ames' began writing a column for the New York Independent entitled, \"Woman's Letter from Washington.\" This column was how she became a well-known writer.

He would also lose his village lands that were promised under the Prairie du Chien treaty of 1829, to the American population he strove to protect.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A 19th-century poet, essayist and journalist, Walt Whitman stands as one of the most influential poets in American literature, and one of the first to gain international recognition. Whitman spent most of his early years in Brooklyn, where he worked as a printer and newspaper journalist through the 1850s.<br /> <br /> The first edition of his landmark collection of poetry, <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, was privately printed in 1855 and consisted of 12 untitled poems, one of which was to later become famous as \"Song of Myself.\" His literary style was experimental, a free-verse avalanche in celebration of nature and self that has since been described as the first expression of a distinctly American voice. Attracted to other men, Whitman's writings include allusions to affection between men. Although <em>Leaves of Grass</em> did not sell well at first, it became popular in literary circles in Europe and, later, the United States, and Whitman published a total of eight editions during his lifetime.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, Whitman moved to Washington, D.C., where he served as a volunteer nurse, and clerk in the Army Paymaster's Office and later, the Department of the Interior. There he published the poetry collections Drum Taps, which was based upon his war-time experiences. Sequel to Drum Taps, also published in 1865, contained his famous elegies for Abraham Lincoln, \"Where Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" and \"O Captain! My Captain!\" In 1873, he was paralyzed after a stroke and moved to Camden, New Jersey. Whitman's prose descriptions of the Civil War, Specimen Days & Collect, were published in 1882. By the time of his death he was an international literary celebrity.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<h3>Early Life</h3> <p>The first woman of the Klondike was Shaaw Tláa, also known as Kate Carmack. Shaaw Tláa spent her childhood in south-central Yukon. Native Tagish, Shaaw Tláa was one of eight children born into an arranged marriage between the coastal Tlingit people and the Tagish to formalize trading partnerships. Shaaw Tláa’s first husband, a Tlingit man, and their infant daughter died during an influenza epidemic plagued by the Alaska Native population of Alaska and the Yukon. Her mother encouraged her to marry her deceased sister’s husband, a white man named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/klondikekings.htm#georgecarmack\">George Carmack</a>. In January 1893, seven years after their marriage, Kate gave birth to their daughter, Graphie. </p> <h3>The Gold Rush Begins</h3> <p>In 1896 Shaaw Tláa was traveling in remote Canada with her husband George, her brother <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/klondikekings.htm#keish\">Keish (Skookum Jim)</a>, and Ka'a Goox (Dawson Charlie).  On August 17, 1896, the group discovered a significant amount of gold as they stopped to fish along Rabbit Creek, a small tributary of the Klondike River. While debate remains about who first made the discovery of the first claim, it was staked by George Carmack, the only white member of the group. <br /> <br /> News of this gold quickly spread and ignited the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-98. Like other early Klondike women, Shaaw Tláa did very well in the beginning. For the first year after the big discovery of gold, little changed in Shaaw Tláa’s life. She and George worked their rich mining claim for two seasons. In their cabin, Shaaw Tláa kept house, cared for their daughter and took in laundry. She sewed moccasins and warm winter clothing to sell to other miners and helped provide meals for her family by picking berries and trapping rabbits and ptarmigan.</p> <h3>Post Gold Rush</h3> <p>In the fall of 1898, the family decided to go to Seattle to celebrate their riches. They planned to buy a yacht to sail to Paris with their millions. Adapting to life in the big city was not easy for Shaaw Tláa and within a year, George and Shaaw Tláa's marriage fell apart. After 13 years of marriage, he left her for another woman and claimed that they had never been officially married. Shaaw Tláa attempted to file for divorce, but there was no official record of their marriage. George remarried another woman by late 1900.  <br /> <br /> Upon her return to the Yukon Territory, Keish built Shaaw Tláa a cabin in Carcross, where most of their family had settled. Shaaw Tláa earned a small income from selling needlework to tourists. Once her daughter Graphie was 16, George lured her to Seattle.  It was a devastating loss, as Shaaw Tláa held firmly to the Tagish belief that children belong with the mother’s clan. Graphie married and never saw her mother again. <br /> <br /> Shaaw Tláa remained with her Tagish clan and lived out the rest of her life in Carcross, Yukon Territory. She never received her share of any mining riches and was supported by a government pension until her death. She died during an influenza epidemic on March 29, 1920 and was buried in the Carcross cemetery at the age of 63. </p> <p> </p>",

He was a Morroccan guide and interpreter who arrived in Florida in 1527 from Spain with the Panfilo de Narvaez expedition. He was one of the first native Africans to explore the American Southwest and one of the first to encounter the Zunis. <br /> <br /> Estevancio was enslaved after the Portuguese captured his hometown of Azemmour, Morocco in 1513 and was later sold as a personal servant to Andres de Dorantes of Bejar del Castanar of old Castille; though he was enslaved by del Castanar, they became good friends. Following the collapse of the de Narvaez expedition to Florida, Estevancio was one of only four survivors of the original 600 explorers to reach the Spanish territory in modern day Mexico after surviving for more than a decade as slaves to native tribes. Upon reaching Mexico, the other three survivors returned to Europe, while Estevancio was sold to Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain. Putting Estevancio’s rare knowledge of the area beyond New Spain to use, Mendoza ordered him to lead Franciscan Fray Marcos de Niza to explore the area to the north. <br /> <br /> In 1539 he led a small reconnaissance party, under the command of Franciscan priest Fray Marcos de Niza, on foot to Culiacan, Mexico. Estevancio went ahead of Fray Marcos sending runners back daily with wooden crosses to indicate the promise of the country ahead. As the days went by the crosses kept getting bigger. On one of these days he came upon Hawikuh, and sent a huge cross back to Fray Marcos. The Zunis didn't trust him because his medicine gourd was trimmed with owl feathers--that symbolized death. He was kept outside the village while the elders debates and the next morning Zuni warriors killed him.<br /> <br /> <strong>What Makes Estevancio an American Hero? </strong><br /> Despite being an enslaved Native African, Estevancio's knowledge helped transform our knowledge of the American Southwest and offers concrete evidence that Islam and Muslims were not recent arrivals in the United States.",

 We read in this holy book, “If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us….Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth.  Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.  Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.  Psalm CXXIV</em></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>For the Mendi People,</em></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cinque<br /> Kinna<br /> Kale</em></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Boston, Nov. 6th. 1841</em></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">John Quincy Adams remained a vocal opponent to slavery until his death in 1848 when he suffered a stroke at the U.S. Capitol.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">This is just one of many stories associated with the Amistad event.  To learn more about others involved, please access <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelamistad/people.htm\">the main People page of this itinerary</a>.<br />  </p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-98cff606-36d7-b33d-d922-891b6dca8094\">Source:</b></em></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>“John Quincy Adams and the Amistad Event” pamphlet produced by Adams National Historical Park.</em></p>",

Van Buren sent this request to the courts while Secretary of State John Forsyth readied a ship to return the captives to Cuba.

Pieh and 52 men, women, and children were purchased by  two Spanish plantation owners and boarded onto the schooner La Amistad.<br /> <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-17a27388-50a9-f1b6-7b08-2367d894cf6f\">Three days into the voyage to Porto Principe, Cuba, Pieh freed himself and others from their shackles.  They killed the captain, cook, and two other crew members disappeared.  Having taken over the ship, Pieh ordered the schooner sail towards Africa. Rather than comply, the second-mate - who was steering the ship - secretly changed course at night, sailing west or north.  After two months at sea the </span>Amistad was seized by the U.S. brig Washington off the coast of Long Island, NY.

They ruled that Pieh and the others had been illegally captured, and thus illegally sold into slavery.</span><br /> <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-17a27388-50a9-f1b6-7b08-2367d894cf6f\">In November 1841 Sengbe Pieh returned to Mendeland in present-day Sierra Leone with the other African captives.

They organized the legal defense and raised money for the Mende Africans during their imprisonment.</span><br />  <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">Lewis Tappan was a fervent abolitionist and leader of the Amistad Committee. He was living in New York when he was contacted by a Connecticut abolitionist aware of the Amistad captives.  Tappan was eager to intervene on behalf of the Mende, and he saw them and their story as a means to advance the abolitionist cause.</span><br />  <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">Tappan traveled to New Haven on September 6 to meet the Mende and investigate the legality under which they were held in Cuba. Roger Baldwin, Seth Staple, and Theodore Sedgwick were secured as legal counsel by the Committee.  The legal team had determined that a successful defense hinged on a first-hand account of the Africans’ experience, and so they went about finding a Mende interpreter.  After a few semi-successful attempts, they located James Covey. </span><br />  <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">Covey was Mende who had been kidnapped and sold into slavery as a child.  He was later found and captured by British soldiers and freed.  He had learned to speak English, joined the British Navy, and he was in New York at the time of the Amistad.</span><br />  <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">The </span><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/articles/amistad-legal-battle.htm\">trial progressed</a> through the District Court, then Circuit Court, and then finally to the Supreme Court.  The Committee recognized the Supreme Court trial would require more experienced counsel, and they approached <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/people/john-quincy-adams-and-the-amistad-event.htm\">John Quincy Adams</a>, who agreed to argue the case.  Adams used the defense developed by Baldwin early in the case. On March 9, 1841 Justice Story delivered the court decision that the Mende were free men who had been illegally kidnapped from Africa.  They were to return to Africa as soon as possible.<br />  <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">After the trial the Mende lived, learned, and worshiped with local members of the Committee while they raised money for the return voyage to Africa.  By November 1841 the Committee had raised enough money for the voyage.  On November 27 the Mende and a few members of the Committee boarded the </span>Gentleman. They arrived in Sierra Leone in January, and the Committee members founded the Mende Mission to expand Christianity in Africa.<br />  <br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">This is just one of many stories associated with the Amistad event.  To learn more about others involved, please access </span><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelamistad/people.htm\">the main People page of this itinerary</a>.<br /> <br />  <br /> <em><strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\">Sources:</span></strong></em><br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\"><a href=\"http://www.sierra-leone.org/Books/Amistad.pdf\">The Amistad Revolt: A Historical Legacy of Sierra Leone and the United States</a></span>.<br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\"><a href=\"http://www.famous-trials.com/amistad/1229-ami-btap\">http://www.famous-trials.com/amistad/1229-ami-btap</a></span><br /> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73f72c6d-507d-b41e-9fec-0be1988bb080\"><a href=\"http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/trialheroes/Tappanessay.html\">http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/trialheroes/Tappanessay.html</a></span>",

Confederates under the command of Stonewall Jackson surrounded the garrison on September 13. After much fighting on Maryland Heights on that day and a barrage of artillery fire on the 14th, Davis realized the cavalry would be caught by the Confederates if they did not escape. On the evening of the September 14, 1862, Davis and other cavalry leaders met with garrison commander Colonel Dixon S. Miles and planned for the 1,400 cavalrymen to escape from Harpers Ferry. The plan was successful – Davis led the men and horses across the Potomac River pontoon bridge, around the base of Maryland Heights, and north along the Harpers Ferry-Sharpsburg Road. Not only did the cavalry escape, they also captured a Confederate ammunition train near Williamsport, Maryland consisting of 75 to 80 wagons and 300 horses and mules. They took the train to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and then the cavalrymen turned around and rejoined the Union forces at the Battle of Antietam.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In the spring of 1863, Davis was killed in combat at Beverly Ford, near Brandy Station, Virginia.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska. Born in the home of his paternal grandparents, his mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr. Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the Oak Park, Illinois before moving to the home of her parents in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1916, Dorothy married Gerald Rudolff Ford, a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They then called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr. The future president was never formally adopted, and did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.</p> <p>Growing up in Grand Rapids, Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. A star college football player at the University of Michigan, he also worked as a seasonal park ranger at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell\">Yellowstone National Park</a> in 1936. Ford later recalled of his time as a ranger as, “One of the greatest summers of my life.”</p> <p>Ford served in the Navy during WWII. He returned to civilian life in 1946, having earned the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. He resumed his law practice and civic activities in Grand Rapids.</p> <p>In August 1947, Ford met his future wife, Elizabeth (Betty) Bloomer Warren, through mutual friends. Less than a year later, Ford decided to run for Congress to represent his Michigan district (District 5). He and Betty were married in October 1948, a few weeks before his victory, which would sweep the newlyweds away to Washington, D.C. for the next 30 years.</p> <p>Elected to the House of Representatives in 1948, Ford represented Michigan's 5th District for nearly 25 years before finding himself at the crossroads of history. He was elevated to vice president, and then became the 38th U.S. president in 1974 due to Richard Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal and subsequent resignation.</p> <p>Ford's early presidency marked a state of tumult for the nation, with downfalls including an ailing economy, the ending of the Vietnam War, and an energy crisis. <span>One of President Ford’s first actions was granting Nixon a full presidential pardon. He was hoping to begin healing the deeply divided nation, but the short-term effect of this extremely controversial action was further polarization. </span>Following in Nixon's footsteps with China, Ford was the first U.S. president to visit Japan. Challenged by fellow Republican Ronald Reagan during his campaign for re-election in 1976, Ford eked out the nomination, but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the presidential election. <span>Carter began his inaugural address by saying, “For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1977, the Fords moved to a new house they built in Rancho Mirage, California. Ford continued to participate actively in the political process and to speak out on important issues. He published his memoirs in 1979.</span></p> <p>Gerald Ford died on December 26, 2006, at home in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 93—the oldest any president has lived to date. Named in his honor are a presidential library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a museum in Grand Rapids. The home that belonged to Ford’s grandparents in Nebraska was razed after a 1971 fire caused substantial damage. Today, the <a href=\"http://www.nebraskahistory.org/conserve/brthsite.htm\">Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens</a> marks the location of the house at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Lyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in central Texas, not far from Johnson City, which his family had helped settle. Growing up, he felt the sting of rural poverty, working his way through Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now known as Texas State University), and learning compassion for the poverty and discrimination of others when he taught students of Mexican descent in Cotulla, Texas.</p> <p>In 1937 he campaigned successfully for the House of Representatives on a New Deal platform, effectively aided by his wife, the former Claudia \"Lady Bird\" Taylor, whom he had married after a whirlwind courtship in 1934.</p> <p>During World War II, Lyndon Johnson served briefly in the Navy as a lieutenant commander, receiving a Silver Star in the South Pacific. After six terms in the House, he was elected to the Senate in 1948. In 1953, he became the youngest Minority Leader in Senate history, and the following year, when the Democrats won control, Majority Leader. With rare legislative skill he obtained passage of a number of measures during the Eisenhower Administration. He became, by many accounts, the most powerful Majority Leader of the twentieth century.</p> <p>In the 1960 campaign, Johnson, as John F. Kennedy's running mate, was elected Vice President. On November 22, 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Lyndon Baines Johnson became the 36<span>th</span> President. </p> <p>Shortly after assuming the Presidency, Johnson used his legislative prowess to pass two bills that Kennedy had endorsed but was unable to get through Congress at the time of his death: a tax cut and a civil rights act. The latter, which would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, became the first effective civil rights law since Reconstruction, outlawing segregation and discrimination throughout American society. Next he enacted his own agenda, urging the Nation \"to build a great society, a place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor.\" In 1964, with Hubert Humphrey as his running mate, Johnson won the Presidency against Republican challenger, Barry Goldwater, garnering 61 percent of the vote and had the widest popular margin in American history—more than 15,000,000 votes.</p> <p>President Johnson used his 1964 mandate to bring his vision for a Great Society to fruition in 1965, pushing forward a sweeping legislative agenda that would become one of the most ambitious and far-reaching in the nation's history. Congress, at times augmenting or amending Johnson's legislation, rapidly enacted his recommendations. As a result, his administration passed more than sixty education bills, initiated a wide-scale fight against poverty, saw federal support of the arts and humanities, championed urban renewal, environmental beautification and conservation, enabled development of depressed regions and pushed for control and prevention of crime and delinquency. Millions of elderly people were also given the means for proper medical care through the 1965 Medicare Amendment to the Social Security Act.</p> <p>Johnson's Great Society also included the continued advancement of civil rights. He realized the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which removed poll taxes and tests that represented an obstacle to the ballot among many Americans of color, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, preventing discrimination in housing sales and rentals. Additionally, he appointed the first African American cabinet member and U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall.</p> <p>Nevertheless, two overriding crises had been gaining momentum since 1965. Despite the beginning of new antipoverty and anti-discrimination programs, unrest and rioting in black ghettos troubled the Nation. President Johnson steadily exerted his influence against segregation and on behalf of law and order, but there was no early solution.</p> <p>The other crisis arose from the U.S. war in Vietnam, which the U.S. had committed to under Eisenhower and Kennedy. Despite Johnson's efforts to end Communist aggression by increasing US troop involvement to leverage a peaceful settlement, fighting continued. Controversy and protests over the war—and Johnson—had become acute by the end of March 1968, when Johnson limited the bombing of North Vietnam in order to initiate peace negotiations. At the same time, he startled the world by withdrawing as a candidate for re-election so that he might devote his full efforts, unimpeded by politics, to the quest to strike an honorable peace.</p> <p>When Johnson left office, peace talks were underway. He died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973. The day before his death, he had learned that peace was at hand in Vietnam.</p>",

McLoughlin hastily signed a five-year contract with the North West Company (NWC), a fur trading enterprise, and was sent to Fort Kaministiquia (later Fort William) on the northern side of Lake Superior.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1811 at Fort William, he met Marguerite Wadin McKay, the daughter of a Swiss fur trader and a Cree mother, and the two became lifelong companions, eventually having four children together.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The North West Company's chief rival was the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). McLoughlin joined a splinter group within the NWC who wished to work with the HBC to create a more profitable environment for all. Representing the interests of this group, McLoughlin traveled to London in 1820 to meet with the HBC along with other NWC representatives. Negotiations between the two companies continued until 1821, when they were merged under the name of the Hudson's Bay Company. McLoughlin returned to North America as the new Chief Factor of the HBC's Rainy Lake District, where he stayed for the next two years.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1824, McLoughlin received a new assignment that would change his life forever. George Simpson, Governor of the HBC's North American operations, assigned McLoughlin with establishing a headquarters for the company's Columbia District - a huge swath of land that encompassed much of the Pacific Northwest. This headquarters was established at Fort Vancouver, located on the north bank of the Columbia River.</span></p> <p>Under McLoughlin's leadership, Fort Vancouver flourished, becoming a center for the fur trade, agriculture, commerce, and society in the region. Fort Vancouver was also a destination for Oregon Trail emigrants. Though McLoughlin had been ordered by the HBC to discourage and turn away American settlers, he instead offered them credit at the fort's shops. His persistence in assisting American settlers and missionaries would later become the cause of increasing strife in his relationship with the HBC.</p> <p>In the late 1830s and early 1840s, McLoughlin's relationship with Simpson and the HBC's leadership sharply deteriorated. The HBC disapproved of his courtesy towards encroaching American settlers, his management of an unsuccessful new post in San Francisco, and his ownership of a controversial piece of property in the predominantly American town of Oregon City.</p> <p>Additionally, McLoughlin's son, John, Jr., had been assigned as Clerk in Charge at Alaska's Fort Stikine, but was murdered by his men in 1842. A cursory investigation by George Simpson determined that John, Jr., had been abusive towards his men, and that the homicide was justifiable. The conclusion, and the lack of justice for his son, left McLoughlin outraged and heartbroken.</p> <p>In 1845, McLoughlin built a home on his property near Oregon City's Willamette Falls and retired there in 1846. McLoughlin became an American citizen in 1851, and was active in Oregon City as a businessman, merchant, and mill owner.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1957, 100 years after his death, McLoughlin was officially named the \"Father of Oregon\" because of the aid he provided to American settlers.</span></p> <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paul Eliot Green is one of the South’s best known literary artists. A prolific writer, his works include dramas, screenplays, essays, poetry, short stories, and novels. In 1927, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his Broadway play <em>In Abraham's Bosom</em>. Shortly after, he developed an experimental dramatic form, the symphonic drama. It includes music and dance, and is popularly known today as the musical.  </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Often based on a historical event, Green’s symphonic dramas were typically performed onsite. <em>The Lost Colony</em>, which includes original music, dance, pantomime, and poetic dialogue, is Green’s most celebrated outdoor symphonic drama. It has been performed annually at Fort Raleigh Historic Site since 1937.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Just as his writing questioned traditional literary form, Green’s endeavor to expose the deplorable conditions of the African American in the South is a trademark of his work. </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Acknowledged as the Dramatist Laureate of North Carolina, Paul Green amassed awards and honors that distinguished him as one of the most successful artists in the history of North Carolina. </span><span class=\"s1\">Not only was he awarded the Pulitzer Prize (1927), he received two Guggenheim Fellowships (1928-1929), was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1940), received the North Carolina Award for Literature (1960), the State of North Carolina Distinguished Citizen Award (1976), and was inducted into Broadway's Theatre Hall of Fame (1993) and the North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame (1996). Green was posthumously named North Carolina’s \"Pioneer of the Century\" (2000).</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Green’s commercial success belies his humble beginnings. He was born in 1894, in rural Harnett County, North Carolina. Raised on a cotton farm, hard work and simple living encouraged his strong work ethic and love of Southern tradition. He readily mastered his studies at nearby Campbell University in Buies Creek. After serving in the armed forces during World War I, he attended the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and later studied at Cornell University.  </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green’s literary works span many genres. With 41 plays and symphonic dramas, 12 screenplays, and more than 50 bound editions of poetry, short stories, essays, North Carolina folklore, and novels, Green is considered one of the most prolific Southern writers of his time. Most of his dramas have been staged on and off Broadway, and his screenplays have been produced with Will Rogers, Bette Davis, and Janet Gaynor in featured roles.  </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After his initial literary success, Green began to experiment with Expressionism and the dramatic form. By coupling music and dance within a dramatic script, he developed the contemporary American musical, calling it a symphonic drama. Green asserted that the development of this uniquely American form was a progression of American society: ''The narrow confines of the usual Broadway play and stage are not fitted to the dramatic needs of the American people. They cannot contain the richness of our tradition, folkways, singing, dancing and poetry.” When he added the feature of actual historical events, he intentionally made the the work philosophical, educational, and entertaining. His best known drama, <em>The Lost Colony</em> (1937), chronicles the journey of the ill-fated colony of settlers at Roanoke Island in 1587. Performed onsite at the Waterside Theater at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, this popular drama continues to attract audiences to this day. In 2013, <em>The Lost Colony</em> was awarded the Tony Honor for Excellence in the Theater.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green’s interests included not only his literary studies, but also contemporary human rights issues, which he incorporated in almost everything he wrote. He became known as an artist who represented the South with depictions of realistic, everyday life and to this effect, incorporated Southern dialect in his dialogues. As one of the first Southern writers to attain national acclaim, he was a prominent contributor to early efforts of social change and civil rights and, more specifically, racial discrimination. As such, he is considered an early activist in the Civil Rights movement, and was one of the first white playwrights to write works for black actors. Themes in his later works included the cruelty of capital punishment and the inequality of poverty. </span><span class=\"s1\">He considered himself a humanist and was an outspoken opponent of American militarism during the Vietnam War. </span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Paul Green died at his home in Chapel Hill NC on May 2, 1981. He was a professor at UNC Chapel Hill for many years, and encouraged a generation of young scholars to go beyond social and artistic norms of the day. As a literary master, he not only produced a body of work that explores the beauty of Southern traditions but also introduced the concept of using music and dance in the dramatic form to develop depth of theme and content. Just as producing his historical symphonic drama on location was unique, his portrayal of the social issues of racism and civil rights was controversial. While describing his work, he said, “I try to write about men and women struggling not only to be themselves, but to be on the side of something that counts for others.\"</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Elizabeth Arnold Poe was a beautiful and talented actress who charmed theatergoers of her day. Born in England, she traveled with her mother, who was also an actress, to the United States in 1796. From the age of 9 until her death at 24, Elizabeth made her living as an actress in theaters from Boston to Charleston. She never failed to delight audiences with her singing, dancing, and comic and dramatic performances. Little is known of her personal life.<br /> <br /> Elizabeth Poe's husband, David Poe, was not present at the time of he death. He had apparently abandoned his family. Edgar, his older brother Henry and infant sister Rosalie were orphaned and left to the charity of the Richmond community. Henry was sent to Baltimore to his grandfather's [David Poe, Sr.] home. Rosalie was adopted by the William Mackenzie family, and Edgar was cared for by the John Allan family. Both the Mackenzie and Allan families resided in Richmond.</p> <h3>Good Sense and Natural Ability</h3> <p><em>Review in the Boston Gazette, March 21, 1808</em><br /> \"If industry can claim from the public either favor or support, the talents of Mrs. Poe will not pass unrewarded. She has supported and maintained a course of characters, more numerous and arduous than can be paralleled on our boards, during any one season. Often she has been obliged to perform three characters on the same evening, and she has always been perfect in the text, and has well comprehended the intention of her author. In addition to her industry, however, Mrs. Poe has claims for other favors, from the respectability of her talents. Her Romps and Sentimental characters have an individuality which has marked them peculiarly her own. But she has succeeded often in the tender personations of tragedy; her conceptions are always marked with good sense and natural ability….”</p> <h3>Mrs. Poe Has Hit the Happy Medium</h3> <p><em>Review of Elizabeth’s performances in the plays Pizarro and John Bull at Fontainbleau in Ramblers’ Magazine and New-York Theatrical Register, November, 1810. </em><br /> “In the afterpiece, mrs. Poe was excellent. It is in this line of characters she particular [sic] delights and to which she should bend her chief attention. It is difficult to be sprightly without being fantastic, and to act the hoyden, without being gross and mawkish. Mrs. Poe has hit the happy medium; and let her cultivate it with assiduity. It is one of the most difficult and most important departments of female comedy.”</p> <h3>By the Death of this Lady</h3> <p><em>News of Eliza Poe's death in the Richmond Enquirer, December 10, 1811, Richmond, Virginia.</em><br /> \"Died, on last Sunday morning [December 8] Mrs. Poe, one of the Actresses of the Company at present playing on the Richmond Boards. By the death of this lady the Stage has been deprived of one of its chief ornaments. And to say the least of her, she was an interesting Actress, and never failed to catch the applause and command the admiration of the beholder.\"</p>",

Their main waterway was the Calooshahatchee River, which means River of the Calusa.  They had a reputation from being a fierce, war-like people, especially among European explorers and smaller tribes.<br /> <br /> Known as the \"Shell Indians\", the Calusa are considered to be the first shell collectors. Unlike other tribes, the Calusa did not  make any items from pottery. Shells were used to make items like jewelry, utensils, and tools. They discared shells into huge piles, called mounds, which can still be found in many parts of Florida today. Many groups protect the remaining shell mounds, while archaeologists have studied them to learn about this tribe.<br /> <br /> With a population estimated to be around 50,000, they controlled most of Florida. Because they lived along the coast, they were excellent sailers. They defended their lands against other small tribes and European explorers. The Calusa travelled by dugout canoes, which were made from hollowed-out cypress logs. These logs were about 15 feet long. They Calusa used the canoes to travel as far as Cuba, and to sail up and down the coast salvaging goods from shipwrecks.<br /> <br /> By the late 1700s, the Calusa had died out. Diseases such as smallpox and measles were brought into their territory from European explorers, which wiped out entire villages. Many Calusa were captured and sold as slaves. Some believe that the remaining members of the Calusa tribe left for Cuba once the Spanish gave Florida to the British in 1763. Once the Calusa disappeared, enemy tribes began raiding their territory. ",

            "bodyText": "Juan Garrido a.k.a \"Handsome John\" was an free African conquistador who worked alongside Ponce de Leon for thirteen years.<br /> <br /> African conquistadors like Garrido were not uncommon. Many found their way into Spanish life, rather than becoming slaves. They joined Spanish conquests as soldiers, some in exchange for freedom others for financial gain. They enjoyed the spoils of their conquests, which included land, official jobs, and pensions.<br /> <br /> Garrido was born on the west coast of African ca. 1487 and later moved to Lisbon, Portugal.<br /> It is unknown how, when, or why Garrido was free man among the enslaved. One historian, Ricardo Alegria, suspects he was the son of a king. This hypothetical king would have traded with the Portugese and set Garrido up as a commerical liasion. Other historians argue that Garrido might have been a slave who was granted his freedom. This theory comes from the coincidence that his name matched that of a Spainard's on his first voyage to the New World. Fifteen year old Juan left Lisbon and travelled to Seville, Spain and joined the convoy to Hispaniola in 1503. Pedro Garrido, who was aboard a ship in the convoy, might have been Juan's master and Christian namesake.<br /> <br /> Garrido spent six years in Hispaniola. The Spanish government allowed conquistadors to take land, people, and treasure. This was the Crown's attempt to convert the world to Catholicism. In 1508, he joined Juan Ponce de Leon on his mission to search for gold in Puerto Rico. Once there Ponce de Leon settled  and became govenor on the island. Garrido stayed with him and fought alongside the Spanish against the natives who revolted in 1511. After Ponce de Leon lost his position to Diego Columbus in 1513, he took Garrido and others to look for another treasure island. Instead, they found Florida. Though the claimed and named the land, they were ill-equipped to fight the Florida native. They left Florida with plans to return to conquer it.<br /> <br /> By 1519, Garrido was a veteran conquistador. He was a member of the Hernan Cortes' expedition that invaded Meco and lay seize on the Aztec capital at  Tenochtitlan. After watching and surviving the slaughter of Cortes' troops in 1520, Garrido helped collect the remains of Spanish soliders. He also helped erect a commemorative chapel near the site of the slaughter. For his service, Garrido was given property on a dried out lake ped outside the former Aztec capital in 1522. He became a farmers and was one of the first cultivators to harvest wheat in the America. His wheat production, along with grapes, was in direct response to Spanish secular and religious settlers in Mexico. Garrido married and settled in Mexico City. Together, Garrido and his wife had three children.<br /> <br /> Garrido returned to Florida with Ponce de Leon in 1521. They arrived with settlers, livestock, supplies, and weapons to control the natives. Before they were able to get settled, Native American's once again ran the Spanish off. Ponce de Leon took an arrow and was rushed to Cuba for medical attention. He died a month later in Havana.<br /> <br /> <br /> By the end of his life, Garrido had served with Spanish forced for over 30 years. He went on a final expedition with Cortes in 1533. According to legal documents, Garrido died in Mexico City sometime between 1547 and 1550.<br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "John Allan was born in Scotland. In 1794, at the age of 14, John moved to Richmond, Virginia, to live with his uncle who was very a successful merchant. John worked several years as a clerk for his uncle before he started his own business as a tobacco merchant. He married the “much admired” Frances Keeling Valentine. John and Frances never had children of their own. Edgar Poe was two years old when he was brought into the Allan household. He was well cared for, provided a good education, and at most times treated as a member of the family. Although Edgar’s middle name comes from the Allan family, he was not legally adopted by John Allan. <h3>Edgar is a Fine Boy</h3> <em>Excerpt from schoolmaster William Ewing's letter to John Allan (in England), November 27, 1817</em><br /> I trust Edgar continues to be well and to like his School as much as he used to do when he was in Richmond. He is a charming boy and it will give me great pleasure to hear how he is, and where you have sent him to school, and also what he is reading…Let me now only beg of you to remember me respectfully to your lady Mrs. Allan and her sister, who I hope are well, and also do not forget to mention me to their august attendant Edgar.<br /> <br /> <em>Excerpt from John Allan's letter to schoolmaster William Ewing, England, March 21, 1818</em><br /> Accept my thanks for the solicitude you have so kindly expressed about Edgar and the family.  Edgar is a fine Boy and I have no reason to complain of his progress.<br /> <br /> <em>Excerpt from John Allan's letter to his uncle William Galt, England, September 28, 1818</em><br /> Edgar is growing wonderfully and enjoys a good reputation as both able and willing to receive instruction. <h3>Sulky and Ill Tempered</h3> <em>John Allan to Henry Poe (Edgar's brother) who was living in Baltimore, November 1, 1824</em><br /> Dear Henry,<br /> I have just seen your letter of the 25th ult. to Edgar and am afflicted, that he has not written you. He has had little else to do for me he does nothing & seems quite miserable, sulky<br /> & ill-tempered to all the Family. How we have acted to produce this is beyond my conception—why I have put up so long with his conduct is little less wonderful. The boy possesses not a Spark of affection for us not a particle of gratitude for all my care and kindness towards him. I have given him a much superior Education than ever I received myself. If Rosalie has to relie on any affection from him God in his mercy preserve her—I fear his associates have led him to adopt a line of thinking & acting very contrary to what he possessed when in England. I feel proudly the difference between your principles & his & have my desire to Stand as I ought to do in your Estimation. Had I done my duty as faithfully to my God as I have to Edgar, then had Death come when he will had no terrors for me, but I must end this with a devout wish that God may yet bless him & you & that Success may crown all your endeavors & between you your poor Sister Rosalie may not suffer.<br /> At least She is half your Sister & God forbid my dear Henry that We should visit upon the living the Errors & frailties of the dead. Believe me Dear Henry we take an affectionate interest in your destinies and our United Prayers will be that the God of Heaven will bless & protect you. Rely on him my Brave & excellent Boy who is willing & ready to save to the uttermost. May he keep you in Danger preserve you always is the prayer of your Friend & Servant.<br /> John Allan <h3>I Am Nearly Without</h3> <em>Edgar Allan Poe to John Allan, Baltimore, August 10, 1829</em><br /> Dear Pa,<br /> I received yours this morning which relieved me from more trouble than you can well imagine—I was afraid that you were offended & although I knew that I had done nothing to<br /> deserve your anger, I was in a most uncomfortable situation—without one cent of money—in a strange place & so quickly engaged in difficulties after the serious misfortunes which I have just escaped—My grandmother is extremely poor & ill (paralytic). My aunt Maria if possible is still worse & Henry entirely given up to drink & unable to help himself, much less me—<br /> <br /> I am unwilling to appear obstinate as regards the substitute so will say nothing more<br /> concerning it—only remarking that they will no longer enlist men for the residue of anothers’<br /> enlistment as formerly, consequently my substitute was enlisted for 5 years not 3—<br /> I stated in my last letter (to which I refer you) that Mr. Eaton gave me strong hopes for<br /> September at any rate that the appointment could be obtained for June next—I can obtain decent board lodging & washing with other expenses of mending &c for 5 & perhaps even 4 ½ $ per week—<br /> <br /> If I obtain the appointment by the last of September the amount of expense would be at<br /> most $30—If I should be unfortunate & not obtain it until June I will not desire you to allow as much as that per week because by engaging for a longer period at a cheap boarding house I can do with much less—say even 10 even 8 $ per month—any thing with which you think it possible to exist—I am not so anxious of obtaining money from your good nature as of preserving your good will—<br /> <br /> I am extremely anxious that you should believe that I have not attempted to impose upon<br /> you—I will in the meantime (if you wish it) write you often, but pledge myself to apply for no<br /> other assistance than what you shall think proper to allow—<br /> <br /> I left behind me in Richmond a small trunk containing books & some letters—will you<br /> forward it on to Baltimore to the care of H-W. Bool, Jr. & if you think I may ask so much perhaps you will put in it for me some few clothes as I am nearly without—<br /> <br /> Give my love to Miss Valentine—<br /> <br /> I remain Dear Pa<br /> Yours affectionately<br /> Edgar A. Poe<br />   <h3>Wholly and Entirely Your Own Mistaken Parsimony</h3> <em>Excerpt of a letter from Edgar Allan Poe to John Allan, West Point Military Academy, January 3, 1831</em><br /> Sir,<br /> I suppose (altho’ you desire no further communication with yourself on my part,) that your<br /> restriction does not extend to my answering your final letter.<br /> <br /> Did I, when an infant, sollicit your charity and protection, or was it of your own free will,<br /> that you volunteered your services in my behalf? It is well known to respectable individuals in Baltimore, and elsewhere, that my Grandfather (my natural protector at the time you interposed) was wealthy, and that I was his favorite grandchild—But the promises of adoption, and liberal education which you held forth to him in a letter which is now in possession of my family, induced him to resign all care of me into your hands. Under such circumstances, can it be said that I have no right to expect any thing at your hands? You may probably urge that you have given me a liberal education. I will leave the decision of that question to those who know how far liberal educations can be obtained in 8 months at the University of Va. Here you will say that it was my own fault that I did not return—You would not let me return because bills were presented you for payment which I never wished nor desired you to pay. Had you let me return, my reformation had been sure—as my conduct the last 3 months gave every reason to believe—and you would never have heard more of my extravagances. But I am not about to proclaim myself guilty of all that has been alledged against me, and which I have hitherto endured, simply because I was too proud to reply. I will boldly say that it was wholly and entirely your own mistaken parsimony that caused all the difficulties in which I was involved while at Charlottesville. <h3><br /> You Will Surely Pity Me</h3> <em>Edgar Allan Poe to John Allan, Baltimore, April 12, 1833</em><br /> It has now been more than two years since you have assisted me, and more than three since you have spoken to me. I feel little hope that you will pay any regard to this letter, but still I cannot refrain from making one more attempt to interest you in my behalf. If you will only consider in what a situation I am placed you will surely pity me—without friends, without any means, consequently of obtaining employment, I am perishing—absolutely perishing for want of aid. And yet I am not idle—nor addicted to any vice—nor have I committed any offence against society which would render me deserving of so hard a fate. For God’s sake pity me, and save me from destruction.<br /> E A Poe<br /> <br />  ",

She would be a guiding and stabilizing influence on Edgar for the rest of his life. After his marriage to her daughter Virginia, Edgar referred to his Aunt Maria as mother or \"Muddy.\"<br /> <br /> Described by acquaintances as a \"rather ordinary, uncultivated woman\" with an \"almost masculine aspect\" Muddy served as the \"ever vigilant guardian of the house.\" Devoted to Virginia and Edgar, she kept the house clean and neat, cooked the meals, and \"served as messenger, doing the errands, making pilgrimages between the poet and his publishers...\" <h4> </h4> <h3>My Dear Muddy</h3> <em>Edgar Allan Poe to Maria Poe Clemm, April 7, 1844</em> <div style=\"text-align: right;\">New York City, Sunday Morning just after Breakfast</div> My dear Muddy,<br /> We have just this minute done breakfast, and I now sit down to write you about everything. I<br /> can't pay for the letter, because the P.O. won't be open today. In the first place, we arrived at<br /> Walnut St. wharf. The driver wanted to make me pay a dollar, but I wouldn’t. Then I had to<br /> pay a boy a levy to put the trunks in the baggage car. In the meantime I took Sis in the Depot Hotel. It was only a quarter past 6, and we had to wait till 7. We saw the Ledger & Times—nothing in either—a few words of no account in the Chronicle.—We started in good spirits, but did not get here until nearly 3 o’clock. We went in the cars to Amboy about 40 miles from N. York, and then took the steamboat the rest of the way.—Sissy coughed none at all. When we got to the wharf it was raining hard. I left her on board the boat, after putting the trunks in the Ladies’ Cabin, and set off to buy an umbrella and look for a boarding-house. I met a man selling umbrellas and bought one for 62 cents. Then I went up Greenwich St. and soon found a boarding-house. It is just before you get to Cedar St. on the west side going up—the left hand side. It has brown stone steps, with a porch with brown pillars. “Morrison” is the name on the door. I made a bargain in a few minutes and got a hack and went for Sis. I was not gone more than ½ an hour, and she was quite astonished to see me back so soon. She didn’t expect me for an hour. There were 2 other ladies waiting on board—so she was’nt very lonely.—When we got to the house we had to wait about ½ an hour before the room was ready. The house is old & buggy, but the landlady is a nice chatty ol [section missing] gave us the back room on the [section missing] night & day & attendance, for 7 $--the cheapest board I ever knew, taking into consideration the central situation and the living. I wish Kate [the family cat] could see it—she would faint. Last night, for supper, we had the nicest tea you ever drank, strong & hot—wheat bread & rye bread—cheese—tea-cakes (elegant) a great dish (2 dishes) of elegant ham, and 2 of cold veal, piled up like a mountain and large slices—3 dishes of the cakes, and every thing in the greatest profusion. No fear of starving here. The landlady seemed as if she couldn’t press us enough, and we were at home directly. Her husband is living with her—a fat good-natured old soul. There are 8 or 10 boarders—2 or 3 of them ladies—2 servants.—For<br /> breakfast we had excellent-flavored coffe, hot & strong—not very clear & no great deal of<br /> cream—veal cutlets, elegant ham & eggs & nice bread and butter. I never sat down to a more plentiful or a nice breakfast. I wish you could have seen the eggs—and the great dishes of meat. I ate the first hearty breakfast I have eaten since I left our little home. Sis is delighted, and we are both in excellent spirits. She has coughed hardly any and had no night sweat. She is now busy mending my pants which I tore against a nail. I went out last night and bought a skein of silk, a skein of thread, & 2 buttons a pair of slippers & a tin pan for the stove. The fire kept in all night.—We have now got 4 $ and a half left. Tomorrow I am going to borrow 3 $--so that I may have a fortnight to go upon. I feel in excellent spirits & have’nt drank a drop—so that I hope soon to get out of trouble. The very instant I scrape together enough money I will send it on. You ca’nt imagine how much we both do miss you. Sissy had a hearty cry last night, because you and Catterina [family cat] weren’t here. We are resolved to get 2 rooms the first moment we can. In the meantime it is impossible we could be more comfortable or more at home than we are.—It looks as if it was going to clear up now.—Be sure and go to the P.O. & have my letters forwarded.  As soon as I write Lowell’s article, I will send it to you, & get you to get the money from Graham. Give our best loves to Catterina.<br /> <br /> Be sure & take home the Messenger, to Hirst. We hope to send for you very soon. <h4> </h4> <h3>A Tribute</h3> In 1849, Poe wrote this poem as a tribute to both Muddy and his deceased wife.<br /> <br /> <strong>To My Mother</strong><br /> Because I feel that, in the Heavens above.<br /> The angels, whispering to one another,<br /> Can find, among their burning terms of love,<br /> None so devotional as that of “Mother,”<br /> Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—<br /> You who are more than mother unto me,<br /> And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you.<br /> In setting my Virginia’s spirit free.<br /> My mother—my own mother, who died early,<br /> Was but the mother of myself; but you<br /> Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,<br /> And thus are dearer than the mother I knew<br /> By that infinity with which my wife<br /> Was dearer to my soul than its soul—life. <h4> </h4> <h3>Conceal Nothing From Me</h3> <em>Excerpt from Muddy's letter to Neilson Poe (Poe’s cousin). Fordham, New York. October 9, 1849</em><br /> I have heard this moment of the death of my dear son Edgar—I cannot believe it, and have<br /> written to you, to try and ascertain the fact and particulars—he has been at the South for the last three months, and was on his way home—the paper states he died in Baltimore yesterday—If it is true God have mercy on me, for he was the last I had to cling to and love, will you write the instant you receive this and relieve this dreadful uncertainty—My mind is prepared to hear all—conceal nothing from me.<br />  ",

Virginia’s father died when she was four years old. Afterwards the family depended on the grandmother's small government pension of $240, which she received each year for her husband's service during the American Revolution. Edgar moved in with the family in early 1831 and would remain with them until he moved to Richmond, Virginia in 1835. Virginia’s grandmother died in the same year leaving her and her mother Maria, without a steady source of income.<br /> <br /> Virginia and Maria joined Edgar in Richmond in 1835. Edgar and Virginia were married in 1836. She was 13 years old and he was 27 years old. In 1842, Virginia became ill with tuberculosis. She died of the disease on January 30, 1847, at the age of 24. <h3><br /> Valentine to her Husband</h3> On Valentine’s Day in 1846, Virginia wrote this acrostic poem to her husband. Note that the first letter of each line spells out his name.<br /> <br /> <strong>E</strong>ver with thee I wish to roam—<br /> <strong>D</strong>earest my life is thine.<br /> <strong>G</strong>ive me a cottage for my home<br /> <strong>A</strong>nd a rich old cypress vine,<br /> <strong>R</strong>emoved from the world with its sin and care<br /> <strong>A</strong>nd the tattling of many tongues.<br /> <strong>L</strong>ove alone shall guide us when we are there—<br /> <strong>L</strong>ove shall heal my weakened lungs;<br /> <strong>A</strong>nd Oh, the tranquil hours we’ll spend,<br /> <strong>N</strong>ever wishing that others may see!<br /> <strong>P</strong>erfect ease we’ll enjoy, without thinking to lend<br /> <strong>O</strong>urselves to the world and its glee—<br /> <strong>E</strong>ver peaceful and blissful we’ll be.<br />   <h3>My Little Darling Wife</h3> Edgar Allan Poe to Virginia Clemm Poe, New York City,  June 12, 1846.<br /> <br /> My Dear Heart, My dear Virginia! Our Mother will explain to you why I stay away from you<br /> this night. I trust the interview I am promised, will result in some substantial good for me, for<br /> your dear sake, and hers—Keep up your heart in all hopefulness, and trust yet a little longer—In my last great disappointment, I should have lost my courage but for you—my little darling wife you are my greatest and only stimulus now. To battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life—I shall be with you tomorrow P.M. and be assured until I see you, I will keep in loving remembrance your last words and your fervent prayer!<br /> Sleep well and may God grant you a peaceful summer, with your devoted<br /> Edgar <h3><br /> My Poor Virginia Still Lives</h3> Edgar Allan Poe to Marie L. Shew, Fordham, New York, January 29, 1847.<br /> <br /> Kindest—dearest friend—My poor Virginia still lives, although failing fast and now suffering<br /> much pain. May God grant her life until she sees you and thanks you once again! Her bosom is full to overflowing—like my own—with a boundless—inexpressible gratitude to you. Lest she may never see you more—she bids me say that she sends her sweetest kiss of love and will die blessing you. But come—oh come to-morrow! Yes, I will be calm—everything you so nobly wish to see me. My mother sends you, also, her \"warmest love and thanks.\" She begs me to ask you, if possible, to make arrangements at home so that you may stay with us tomorrow night. I enclose the order to the Postmaster.<br /> Heaven bless you and farewell<br /> Edgar A Poe<br />   <h3>Her Life Was Despaired Of</h3> Excerpt from Edgar Allan Poe's letter to George W. Eveleth, Fordham, New York ,January 4, 1848.<br /> <br /> Six years ago, a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a blood-vessel insinging. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of her forever & underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered partially and I again hoped. At the end of a year the vessel broke again—I went through precisely the same scene. Again in about a year afterward. Then again—again—again & even once again at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the agonies of her death—and at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly & clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive—nervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these fits of absolute unconsciousness I drank, God only knows how often or how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to the insanity. I had indeed, nearly abandoned all hope of a permanent cure when I found one in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a man—it was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could no longer have endured without the total loss of reason. In the death of what was my life, then, I receive a new but—oh God! How melancholy an existence.”<br />  ",

Like many Anishnaabek warriors, Assiginack’s ability to fight for his people exended beyond the warpath.</p> <p>Assiginack’s war party included Mookmanish (Little Bad Knife), Kishigopenasi (Day Bird), Makadepenasi (Blackbird), Eshquagonabe (Looking Back) and Clap of Thunder at Night. The war party traveled by canoe to fight American soldiers throughout the Great Lakes, sometimes travelling 1,600 miles round trip. Assiginack and his warriors followed a long lineage of Odawa warriors who fought against the Muschodesh, Fox, Iroquois, Winnebago, Chickasaw, British and American forces to protect their homelands.</p> <p>Assiginack was a renowned orator for the Odawa, once giving a speech from sunrise to sunset, for the purpose of securing warriors to fight the Americans. In addition to his speaking skills, Assiginack led by example as well. He led warriors from Little Traverse successfully into combat, including the Niagara Theater of the war. Every battle Assiginack and his warriors fought in, they won. After the war ended, Assiginack recognized new enemies that must be confronted, one of which was the disastrous effects alcohol had on the Odawa. On one occasion, Assiginack got word that a boat planned on bringing a large quantity of rum to his village. Assiginack quickly gathered his warriors, boarded the vessel and dumped all the rum into the lake.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the war, Assiginack became an interpreter for the British on Drummond Island, Michigan. Assiginack relocated back to Waganakising in 1827 to help create a Catholic mission at Little Traverse with his brother Apawkausegun. Apawkaugeum was instrumental in helping to negotiate the 1836 treaty between the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the United States. But American policies were not favorable to Assigianck and he later relocates his villages to original Odawa homelands on Manitoulin Island, Ontario. Assiginack and his brother constantly strove to improve their tribe’s position and rights, whether it was through battle, treaty negotiations or finding a more suitable village location.    </p>",

Francis, also known as Hillis Harjo (“crazy-brave medicine”), was born to a South Carolina frontier silversmith and a Creek Indian mother in central Alabama around 1770. Partially under the influence of the Shawnee leader Tecumseh, he became a “prophet” of the Red Stick movement which attempted to purify Creek culture of foreign elements.  In 1812, he and other prophets began a civil war against the Creek Indian National Council which sought closer relationships with the United States. Following an attack at Burnt Corn Creek in southern Alabama by American militia, William Weatherford and Francis planned counter attacks on the American Fort Mims in Baldwin County in August 1813. After the major U.S victory over the Creeks at Horseshoe Bend in March, 1814, Francis and some 1000 Red Sticks fled to north Florida where they soon aligned with British forces and became known as Seminoles. In 1815, Francis traveled to London in hopes of ratifying an agreement recognizing the Creek nation. The British government, reluctant to restart the war in America, honored Francis as a valuable ally, but made no official recognition of his diplomatic mission.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>After returning to his settlement near Fort San Marcos de Apalache on the coast in northwest Florida in 1817, Francis attempted to reconcile with the Americans in Alabama, but was soon outraged by American assaults on Indian settlements He reverted to counterattacks on U.S. military outposts and vessels.  Some scholars regard this as the beginning of the First Seminole War.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">General Andrew Jackson invaded west Florida with a U.S. army and Creek allies on March 15, 1818, burning Indian towns between the Apalachicola and Suwannee Rivers.

On April 8, 1818, Andrew Jackson, ordered that Francis and Homathlemico be brought ashore and executed. Both Red Stick warriors were later buried outside the gates of the fort.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>\"Vat you tink dem Yankees do, if dey get me prisoner, up Nort-eh?... Dey will kill me sure! But I shall take care dey vill no catch me – but if dey do I am certain dey will kill me so quick – so quick, I tell you – dat I shall know nothing about it!\"</em><span> </span><em>– Sgt. Henry Wirz, Richmond, VA, 1861</em></p> <p>Today few Civil War figures are as controversial as Henry Wirz. To some people, he is a martyr or a scapegoat for a failed Confederacy. To others he is the vilest criminal of the war. Few scholars have attempted to tell Wirz's story, leaving it open for supporters and detractors alike to create a mythology to fit their respective agendas. Today, people often approach Wirz with a confirmation bias.<span> </span>They see in his story only that which fits what they already believe. In truth, Wirz was an incredibly complicated figure whose path to Andersonville and the gallows began years before the prison ever opened.</p> <p>Henry Wirz was born in 1823 in Switzerland. In 1849 he immigrated to the United States and attempted to go into business as a physician in New York City. Failing at this, he moved to Connecticut and then to Northhampton, Massachusetts where he worked as a translator in several small factories. There he took a job working at a water-cure establishment before moving to Kentucky to work as a homeopathic physician. He operated water-cure establishments in Cadiz and Louisville until 1857, when he moved to Louisiana to \"take charge of\" Cabin Teele, a 2,200 acre plantation owned by Levin R. Marshall. At Cabin Teele, Wirz continued to practice homeopathic medicine while overseeing the hundreds of slaves in bondage there. This was Wirz's first experience with controlling large numbers of people, a skill that would serve him later.</p> <p>At the outset of the Civil War, Wirz enlisted in the 4<span>th</span> Battalion of Louisiana Infantry, organized in his home of Madison, Louisiana. In the aftermath of Bull Run in July 1861, the unit was sent Richmond, where Wirz was assigned to guard duty at Howard's Factory Prison. He immediately began to organize prisoners, and developed a reputation for efficiency and callousness. He was, as one prisoner wrote in 1862, \"the essence of authority at the prison… [he] thought himself omnipresent and omniscient.\" By the fall of 1861, Wirz attracted the attention of General John Winder, who at that time was in charge of the Richmond prison system. Winder placed Wirz on detached duty as a part of his prison management team. In November 1861 the Richmond newspapers reported that Sergeant Henry Wirz was one of seven men on the city's Prison Board, charged with ensuring the security of all military prisons in Richmond. Serving with Wirz on this board was Captain George C. Gibbs. Three years later the two men worked together at Andersonville, and Gibbs later testified against his colleague.</p> <p>Wirz's time on the Richmond Prison Board was relatively short-lived. In late November, 1861 he was sent to the prison at Tuscaloosa, Alabama to serve as the assistant to Captain Elias Griswold. At Tuscaloosa, like at most prisons that Wirz worked, prisoners remembered him with mixed feelings. Some recalled that he was instrumental in securing shelter in an unused hotel. At the same time one wrote that, \"We have a Sgt Wertz over us as big a tyrant as ever was.\" Inconsistency proved to be a theme of Wirz's prison management, as one Richmond prisoner described, \"He was a good fellow at times, and a very bad one at others. He would show his angular smile of half-stubborn good humor today, and curse us in his fragmentary English tomorrow.\" Regardless of how prisoners felt about him, the citizens of Tuscaloosa felt Wirz was a competent leader deserving of promotion. When Captain Griswold was transferred, they petitioned General Winder to place Wirz in command of the prison in Tuscaloosa.</p> <p>In the late spring of 1862, the prisoners from Tuscaloosa were transferred elsewhere for exchange, and Wirz was sent back to Richmond. On June 1, 1862 he was reassigned to serve as the Provost Marshall of Manchester, a community in Richmond that was later consolidated into the city. After only a few days Wirz requested another duty assignment and was placed on General Winder's staff and promoted to Captain, effective June 12, 1862. Within a few months, he was in command of Belle Isle & Libby Prison in Richmond, an assignment which brought him greater responsibilities and a higher profile within the Confederate military prison system. In September he was ordered to go south and document how many prisoners for the purpose of exchange. Reporting directly to Robert Ould, Confederate agent of exchange, Wirz traveled as far as Houston, Texas between September 1862 and the spring of 1863. Upon his return he held a variety of positions, including Chief of Secret Police in Richmond, none of which he liked. He volunteered to deliver recently acquired weapons and ammunition from Charleston to the trans-Mississippi department. In mid-March 1863, Wirz applied for a medical furlough in order to seek treatment for an arm injury that he sustained at some point in the summer or fall of 1862. Wirz claimed that he was injured at the Battle of Seven Pines while serving as an aid to General Joe Johnston. However, his service records are unclear as to the details of this injury, and he was not yet commissioned as an officer when this battle took place. All that is certain is that he sustained a deep tissue injury to his right arm, and that this injury prompted him to request a furlough for medical treatment. What was supposed to have been a four month furlough to Europe for medical care was eventually extended by several months.</p> <p><span>By February 1864, Wirz returned and reported to General Winder. Winder, having worked with Wirz before, assigned this experienced officer to the new prison at Camp Sumter Military Prison at Andersonville. Colonel Alexander Persons of the 55<span>th</span> Georgia Infantry commanded the post when Captain Wirz arrived in early March. Wirz bore a letter from General Winder instructing Persons to give command of the prison's interior to Wirz, whom he called \"an old prison officer, a very reliable man and capable of governing prisons.\" Complicating the situation, the Confederate government sent Major Elias Griswold, whom Wirz had worked for in Tuscaloosa, to Andersonville with similar orders to take charge of the stockade around the same time. This mix up was resolved later in the month, and Wirz formally took command of the prison stockade on March 27, 1864.</span></p> <p>Wirz immediately began to reorganize the prison to make it more secure and to improve efficiency. He ordered the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/deadline.htm\">construction of a deadline</a> to keep prisoners away from the stockade walls. Drawing on his experience documenting prisoners in 1862, he ordered a daily headcount to be taken. Throughout his time at Andersonville he was frustrated by unclear lines of responsibility. He was charged with daily operations inside the prison – this included taking roll, security, and the issuing of rations and supplies. However, a separate officer was in command of the overall Confederate post of Camp Sumter. Each guard regiment had their own command staff of officers that outranked Wirz. The quartermaster's office operated independent of these two commands, as did the hospital. Wirz could request guards or rations, but had no direct authority to acquire these necessities, although he could order them withheld. Wirz's letters to his superiors in Richmond belie his desperation to solve this command debacle. In an effort to alleviate these bureaucratic struggles, General John Winder reported to Andersonville in the summer of 1864. However, he lacked a clear command directive, and the presence of a brigadier general further complicated the chain of command at the prison.</p> <p>As in Richmond and Tuscaloosa, Wirz displayed inconsistent behavior towards the captives in his care. At times, he proved helpful and sympathetic. On other days he flew into what one prisoner described as a \"spasmodic rage.\" Unable to carry out his orders to maintain the stability and security of the stockade by military means, Wirz used his reputation and behavior to maintain order. Threats were an important tool in his arsenal of control, and he used them liberally. Prisoners who feared him were less likely to challenge the delicate security of the site. He maintained control by employing techniques such as withholding food from individuals and squads. Supplies sent from the north were distributed to guards and a small number of paroled prisoners. Rumors that he murdered prisoners were commonplace. Threats to kill prisoners were even more common; threats that sometimes were fulfilled. In one instance Wirz ordered a guard to shoot a prisoner, which the sentinel did. Wirz later testified that he meant the order as a threat and that he did not think that the guard would actually do it. His experience on a plantation before the war influenced how he punished prisoners – plantation hounds and iron shackles were used to capture and punish escaped prisoners. Verbal threats created an aura of fear. He routinely made statements in front of his staff and prisoners that were intended to cement his tough reputation. For example, one Confederate soldier testified that Wirz ordered a prisoner into the stocks during a rainstorm. The soldier, observing the prisoner was drowning, placed an umbrella over the prisoner and approach Wirz, who replied, \"Let the damned Yankee drown.\" Wirz was unable to control the bureaucracy that plagued the Confederate military prison system, so he controlled the prisoners in the only way he could – through intimidation and punishment.</p> <p>It was these actions towards the prisoners that ultimately doomed Wirz. As early as 1861, he predicted that he would be hanged for his treatment of prisoners in Richmond, long before he ever imagined the existence of Andersonville. He was arrested at the prison site on May 7, 1865. In a statement to General John Wilson the day of his arrest, Wirz denied responsibility for the atrocity of Andersonville, referring to himself as \"…the tool in the hands of [his] superiors.\"</p> <p>He was taken to Washington, DC and held in the Old Capitol Prison. He was charged with conspiracy to kill or injure prisoners in violation of the laws of war, which stipulated the prisoners could not be denied access to available food, water, clothing or medical supplies. He was also charged with multiple counts of murder. A few of these murder charges accused Wirz of personally killing prisoners, but most stemmed from orders that he gave to others. His trial received national attention, as the country demanded justice for the deaths of 13,000 American soldiers. Far more soldiers died in captivity at Andersonville than at any battlefield, a fact that was not lost on former prisoners or the northern public. Wirz's attorneys argued that he did all he could, given the difficult circumstances. The shortage of supplies and medical care were well beyond Wirz's authority, and dozens of letters document Wirz's efforts to solve the logistical problems. However, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/wirztestimonies.htm\">nearly 150 former prisoners, guards, Confederate officials, civilians, and medical staff</a>, testified that Wirz had indeed violated the laws of war by not only withholding available food and supplies, but also by issuing orders that directly resulted in the death of prisoners of war.</p> <p>One of the great paradoxes of the Wirz Trial is that both prosecution and the defense sought to prove that Wirz was following orders; the prosecutors hoped to convict higher ranking Confederate officials and Wirz hoped to absolve himself by passing responsibility up the chain of command. As in nearly every military tribunal, the \"following orders\" defense did not work. Wirz could blame the poor logistics and overcrowding on his superiors. But he could not escape his own orders and actions, and was convicted of conspiracy and murder. He was hanged on November 10, 1865 and was eventually buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, DC.</p> <p><span>For over one hundred fifty years Henry Wirz has remained a polarizing figure. In 1866, President Andrew Johnson ordered a halt to further military tribunals, saving most of Wirz's named co-conspirators from suffering a similar fate. In the bitter years of Reconstruction, many Southerners turned to Wirz, the most prominent Confederate to be </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/wirztribunal.htm\">punished for war crimes</a><span>, as a symbolic martyr of their Lost Cause. Several former Confederates associated with the prison, including </span><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/southernsideoran00stev\">Surgeon Randolph Stevenson</a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://archive.org/details/escapeofconfeder00davi\">Lt. Samuel Davis</a><span> published books in defense of Wirz. Prisoners continued to publish memoirs vilifying the side of the man that they saw from inside the stockade – a cruel tyrant that threatened them and their comrades. In the heat of these acrimonious debates, conflicting mythologies emerged. Stories were fabricated – stories that Wirz had personally killed hundreds of men, or that </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/felixdelabaume.htm\">the supposed star witness perjured himself</a><span>, thus proving Wirz's innocence. Every story imaginable to absolve Wirz was concocted – placing blame on </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner-exchange.htm\">Generals Grant</a><span> or </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/shermanandersonville.htm\">Sherman</a><span>, or even on the prisoners. A </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/wirz-mon.htm\">monument was erected in memory of Henry Wirz</a><span> in the town of Andersonville that further reinforced these increasingly popular notions. In response, prisoners and their descendants further exaggerated the cruelties of Wirz. In the absence of scholarship on the man or the trial, these myths have permeated the popular understanding of Andersonville.</span></p> <p>Whether or not Wirz violated the existing laws of war is not subject to debate. The existing legal frameworks of the day stipulated that prisoners must be given access to the same supplies available to the armies in the field. Wirz's own staff members, including his colleague from Richmond who also worked at Andersonville, George Gibbs, testified that Wirz failed to meet that legal obligation. His threats to kill or injure prisoners as a means of control by intimidation backfired on him and reinforced the belief that he was withholding things not to exact a degree of control, but to purposefully torment and kill his captives. The real debates and legacies of Henry Wirz are much bigger than his own actions in the prisons of Virginia, Alabama, and Georgia. Did the difficult circumstances of managing an overcrowded prison in a crumbling Confederacy justify Wirz's decisions and behavior? Should Wirz have been tried by a military tribunal or civil court? Was he legally protected from prosecution? What responsibilities do officers bear for their commands? These are difficult issues that have resurfaced again and again in our history. The legality and process of military justice continue to divide us well into the 21<span>st</span> century.</p> <p>***<em>A Note on Sources***</em></p> <p>Many of the published materials on Henry Wirz were influenced by the political agenda of their authors, and these books and articles frequently perpetuate inaccurate myths of Andersonville and Henry Wirz.

The next year, following the Montgomery bus boycott, he ruled against segregated city buses. In later actions, he was the first judge to order names of qualified African Americans added to county voting rolls, and he wrote the first statewide school desegregation decree. He outlawed discrimination in Alabama's libraries, transportation centers, and agricultural extension service. He placed numerous state agencies under judicial review. </span></p> <p><span>After brutal beatings of Freedom Riders at Montgomery's Greyhound Terminal, he temporarily restrained the city and the Klan from future wrongs against the protestors. He helped strike down literacy tests and other unfair practices when he ordered voting registrars to apply consistent standards. </span></p> <p><span>One of Johnson's major accomplishments was his opening of U.S. Route 80 for the </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/selmatomongtomerymarch.htm\">Selma-to-Montgomery March</a> for Voting Rights.<span> After watching the CBS footage of \"Bloody Sunday,\" he ruled that the right of assembly--in this case, the right to march--far outweighed the right to unobstructed sidewalks and highways. The enormity of the wrongs being protested should be the deciding factor, he said. </span></p> <p><span>Johnson's decisions put him at great risk. His mother's home was bombed and a cross burned in his yard. Often he and his family needed overnight protection. His actions also won the ire of law school classmate Governor George Wallace, who branded Johnson an \"integrating, scalawagging, carpetbagging liar.\" </span></p> <p><span>In 1977, President Carter asked Johnson to head the FBI, but the judge refused for medical reasons. Instead, he accepted a 1979 appointment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Johnson's decisions then and earlier not only affected civil rights, they also influenced most of the public policy in the state. </span></p> <p><span>In 1993, Judge Johnson was the second recipient (after Thurgood Marshall) of the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award for his work for civil rights. In 1995, President Clinton awarded Judge Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian award. President Clinton remarked that, \"during 40 years on the bench, Judge Johnson made it his mission to see to it justice was done within the framework of law. </span></p> <p><span>In the face of unremitting social and political pressure to uphold the traditions of oppression and neglect in his native South, never once did he yield. His landmark decisions in the areas of desegregation, voting rights and civil liberties transformed our understanding of the Constitution.\"</span></p>",

His father was a prominent physician who lectured on anatomy at Edinburgh and had authored a book on the movements of muscles.</span></p> <p>Young Barclay studied medicine in Edinburgh and, beginning in 1834, spent several summers as a surgeon with exploring expeditions to the Arctic.</p> <p>One of these voyages ended in shipwreck, but Barclay was one of the survivors who were rescued by Eskimos and eventually returned to Britain in Sir John Franklin's ship. He was granted his medical diploma by the Royal College of Surgeons, London, on July 5, 1838.</p> <p>The Barclay family had connections with the Hudson's Bay Company. Archibald Barclay, said to have been an uncle of Dr. Forbes Barclay, was appointed the firm's secretary in London in 1843; but either he or another uncle, the Reverend Thomas Barclay, had been known by Governor George Simpson for at least several years prior to that time.</p> <p>Perhaps this association was related to the fact that on June 4, 1839, Forbes Barclay entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company in the dual capacity of clerk and surgeon and was placed on the list of those awaiting assignment. That fall he sailed in the Columbia for Fort Vancouver, where he arrived in the spring of 1840.</p> <p>Relieving Dr. W. F. Tolmie, Barclay at once went to work in the Indian Trade Shop and in the medical department. He served with distinction both as fur trader and physician until he retired from the Company's employ during 1850. He then moved to Oregon City, became an American citizen, and was prominent in professional and political affairs until his death in 1873.</p> <p>In 1842 Dr. Barclay married Maria Pambrun, eldest daughter of Chief Trader Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun and Catherine Humpherville, herself the daughter of an Englishman in the service of the Company. Born at Fraser Lake, New Caledonia, on October 5, 1826, Marie, as she was known to her largely French-speaking family, was a girl of character and beauty.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_122118\" class=\"CS_Layout_SpacingHeight\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_122118\" class=\"cs_control CS_Element_Custom\"> <div class=\"Component text-content-size text-content-style ArticleTextGroup clearfix\"><img title=\"Image of the front porch of the Barclay House\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/images/285-Barclay-House-2.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the front porch of the Barclay House\" /></div> <div class=\"Component text-content-size text-content-style ArticleTextGroup clearfix\"><em>The Barclay House, built in 1849, remained in the Barclay family until the 1930s.</em> <p class=\"figcredit\"><em>NPS Photo</em></p> <p>Early in 1841, while living with her parents at Fort Walla Walla, she became engaged to Cornelius Rogers, an associate of the American Board's Oregon Mission. This event stirred up a storm among the Whitmans and Spaldings chiefly, it seems, because Marie was a Catholic, though the facts that she had Indian blood, could speak little English, and could boast of only a scant formal education evidently were also taken into consideration.</p> <p>Chief Trader Pambrun died as the result of a fall from a horse during May of that year, and soon thereafter Catherine Pambrun moved with her children to Fort Vancouver, where she did 'fine needlework' to support and educate her brood. Although described as 'distressed,' the family was not in desperate circumstances, because Pambrun left an estate then estimated at not 'much short of 4000£'</p> <p>The elder Pambrun had much favored his daughter's planned marriage to Rogers, but shortly after his death Maria terminated the engagement. Her acquaintanceship with Dr. Barclay evidently began with the family's arrival at the depot and resulted in union during the next year.</p> <p>The couple's first child, Jean Jacques, was born on December 13, 1845. He died of diptheria on December 31, 1847. A second son, Peter Thomas, was born on April 6, 1847, and a third son, Alexander Forbes, on September 23, 1849. Four other children were born to the pair after they moved to Oregon City in 1850.</p> <p>It is known that prior to October 1850 Catherine Pambrun and her children moved from Fort Vancouver to live with her daughter and her son-in-law, Dr. Forbes, in Oregon City. Whether the Pambrun family had also dwelt with the Barclays at Fort Vancouver between 1842 and 1850 has not yet been discovered.\"</p> </div> </div>",

            "bodyText": "Mary Ann Shadd Cary was an African American activist, writer, teacher, and lawyer. She was born in 1823 in the slave state of Delaware. Her parents were free African Americans who were dedicated to abolitionism. When she was 10 years old, Shadd moved with her family to the free state of Pennsylvania where she attended school and became a teacher.<br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> Shadd and her family actively helped freedom seekers (people who escaped slavery). The Shadd family’s participation in the Underground Railroad became even more dangerous after 1850 when Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act. This law made it legal to force freedom seekers in free states to return to enslavement. The law could also punish people like the Shadd family, who helped freedom seekers escape.<br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> After the passage of this law, Mary Ann Shadd moved to Ontario, Canada to join other black Americans who left the United States. While in Canada, she married a man named Thomas J. Cary and they had two children. Now Mrs. Cary, she opened a school for black and white students. She also wrote and lectured about the importance of freedom while she was living Canada. Cary became the first black, female newspaper editor in North American history when she published Canada’s first antislavery newspaper, <em>The Provincial Freeman.</em><br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> In 1860, Cary’s husband passed away. A year later, Civil War broke out in the United States between northern and southern states. Cary returned to the U.S. to help recruit soldiers for the Union Army. After the war, she enrolled in the first class of Howard University Law School located in Washington, DC. She attended evening classes at Howard and taught local children during the day.<br /> <br /> While living in DC, Cary continued to work as a political activist, a teacher, and a writer. She also wrote for a local African American newspaper <em>The New National Era </em>and gave public speeches to encourage African Americans to work together to recover from the slavery era. Cary was also a founder of the Colored Women's Progressive Franchise Association. <br /> <br /> Cary also became involved in the women’s suffrage movement. She was a member of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and spoke at the NWSA's 1878 convention. She also advocated for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. The Fourteenth Amendment defined citizenship and the Fifteenth Amendment granted African American men the right to vote. While Cary spoke in support of the Fifteenth Amendment, she was also critical of it as it did not give women the right to vote.<br /> <br /> Toward the end of her life, Cary lived in a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-mary-ann-shadd-cary-house.htm\">brick row house</a> on W Street in Northwest DC. Today, the house is listed as a National Historic Landmark as it <span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\">helps us understand her life and work as an advocate for the equality of all people.<br /> <br /> Mary Ann Shadd Cary died of stomach cancer on June 5, 1893. She was buried at Columbian Harmony Cemetery in Washington, DC. In the late 1950s, the approximately 37,000 interred here were moved to National Harmony Memorial Park in Landover, Maryland. <br /> <br /> <strong>Sources:</strong><br /> Rhodes, Jane.

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902)</strong> stirred strong emotions in audiences from the 1840s to her death in 1902. Was she catalyst, crusader or crank? Dedicated wife and mother? Privileged white woman, hiding her family's slave-holding past and stealing credit for other's work in the women's rights movement? Feminist firebrand, alienating coworkers with unnecessary controversy and uneasy alliances? Political strategist? popular speaker, philosopher and writer, who returned to the argument of individual rights in her last published speech? Lifelong friend?</p> <p>For different people and at different times, Stanton was all of these. The fruits of her long life are still under scrutiny and up for debate. One thing is sure: she attracted attention and used it to push her ideas about women, rights and families for more than fifty years.</p> <p>Stanton got her start in Seneca Falls, New York, where she surprised herself with her own eloquence at a gathering at the Richard P. Hunt home in nearby Waterloo. Invited to put her money where her mouth was, she organized the 1848 First Woman's Rights Convention with Marth Coffin Wright, Mary Ann M'Clintock, Lucretia Mott and Jane Hunt. She co-authored the <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/declaration-of-sentiments.htm\">Declaration of Sentiments</a></em> issued by the convention that introduced the demand for votes for women into the debate. Her good mind and ready wit, both well-trained by her prominent and wealthy family, opened doors of reform that her father, Daniel Cady would rather she left shut. She studied at Troy Female Seminary and learned the importance of the law in regulating women through her father's law books and interactions with him and his young male law students.</p> <p>At nearly six feet tall, Stanton's mother, Margaret Livingston Cady, \"an imposing, dominant and vivacious figure who controlled the Cady household with a firm hand,\" modeled female presence. As Elizabeth entered her twenties, her reform-minded cousin Gerrit Smith introduced her to her future husband, Henry Brewster Stanton, a guest in his home. Stanton, an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society and an eloquent speaker for the immediate abolition of slavery, turned Elizabeth's life upside down. In 1840, they married against her parents' wishes departing immediately on a honeymoon to the World's Anti-Slavery convention in London. There, the convention refused to seat American female delegates. One, though short, slight, and gentle in demeanor, was every bit as imposing as Stanton's mother. Lucretia Mott, a Hicksite Quaker preacher well-known for her activism in anti-slavery, woman's rights, religious and other reforms, \"opened to [Stanton] a new world of thought.\"</p> <p>At the First Woman's Rights Convention, Mott and her wide circle of fellow Quakers and anti-slavery advocates, including M'Clintocks, Hunts, Posts, deGarmos, and Palmers, opened a new world of action to Stanton as well. Between 1848 and 1862, they worked the Declaration of Sentiments' call to \"employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the State and national Legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and the press in our behalf.\" They worked on conventions in Rochester, Westchester, PA, and Syracuse and organized, sent letters to, or attended national conventions between 1850 and 1862. Stanton met Susan B. Anthony, wrote articles on divorce, property rights, and temperence and adopted the Bloomer costume. By 1852, she and Anthony were refining techniques for her to write speeches and Anthony to deliver them. In 1854, she described legal restrictions facing women in a speech to the New York State Woman's Rights Convention in Albany. Her speech was reported in papers, printed, presented to lawmakers in the New York State legislature, and circulated as a tract. Though an 1854 campaign failed, a comprehensive reform of laws regarding women passed in 1860. By 1862, most of the reforms were repealed. The Stantons moved from Seneca Falls to New York City in 1862, following a federal appointment for Henry Stanton.</p> <p>In the early 1860s national attention focused on the Civil War. Many anti-slavery men served in the Union Army. The women's rights movement rested its annual conventions; but in 1863, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony created the Women's Loyal National League, gathering 400,000 signatures on a petition to bring about immediate passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to end slavery in the United States. The war over, the women's movement created its first national organization, the American Equal Rights Association, to gain universal suffrage, the federal guarantee of the vote for all citizens. Elizabeth Cady Stanton's signature headed the petition, followed by Anthony, Lucy Stone, and other leaders. But the political climate undermined their hopes. The 15th Amendment eliminated restriction of the vote due to \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\" but not gender. Campaigns to include universal suffrage in Kansas and New York state constitutions failed in 1867. Anthony's newspaper, <em>The Revolution, </em>edited by Stanton and Parker Pillsbury, male newspaperman and woman's rights supporter, published between January 1868 and May 1870, http://www.placematters.net/node/1440 with articles on all aspects of women's lives.</p> <p>Between 1869 and 1890, Stanton and Anthony's National American Woman Suffrage Association worked at the national level to pursue the right of citizens to be protected by the U.S. constitution. Despite their efforts, Congress was unresponsive. In 1878, an amendment was introduced and Stanton testified. She was outraged by the rudeness of the Senators, who read newspapers or smoked while women spoke on behalf of the right to vote. Between 1878 and 1919, a new suffrage bill was introduced in the Senate every year. Meanwhile, the American Woman Suffrage Association turned its attention to the states with little success until 1890, when the territory of Wyoming entered the United States as a suffrage state. By then, Anthony had engineered the union of the two organizations into the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Colorado, Utah and Idaho gained woman suffrage between 1894 and 1896. There is stayed until well after Stanton and Anthony's deaths.</p> <p>Nothing seemed to stop Stanton. In the 1870s she traveled across the United States giving speeches. In \"Our Girls\" her most frequent speech, she urged girls to get an education that would develop them as persons and provide an income if needed; both her daughters completed college. In 1876 she helped organize a protest at the nation's 100th birthday celebration in Philadelphia. In the 1880s, she, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage produced three volumes of the <em>History of Woman Suffrage.</em> She also traveled in Europe visiting daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch in England and son Theodore Stanton in France. In 1888, leaders of the U.S. women's movement staged an International Council of Women to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. Stanton sat front and center. In 1890, she agreed to serve as president of the combined National American Woman Suffrage Society. In 1895, she published <em>The Woman's Bible,</em> earning the censure of members of the NAWSA. Her autobiography, <em>Eighty Years and More,</em> appeared in 1898. Her final speech before Congress, <em>The Solitude of Self,</em> delivered in 1902, echoed themes in \"Our Girls,\" claiming that as no other person could face death for another, none could decide for them how to educate themselves.</p> <p>Along the way, Stanton advocated for Laura Fair, accused of murdering a man with whom she was having an affair. She allied the movement and her resources to Victoria Woodhull, who claimed the right to love as she pleased without regard to marriage laws. She supported Elizabeth Tilton, a supposed victim of the sexual advances of clergyman Henry Ward Beecher. She broke with Frederick Douglass over the vote in the 1860s and congratulated him on his marriage to Helen Pitts of Honeoye, NY in 1884, when others, including family, criticized their interracial marriage. Stanton was a complicated personality who lived a long life, saw many changes and created some of them. Her writings were prolific. She often contradicted herself as she and the world around her progressed and regressed for the better part of a century.</p> <p>Read more by and about Stanton at the following links.</p> <p>Read Stanton's favorite public speech, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/solitude-of-self.htm\">Solitude of Self</a>. 1892.</p> <p>Read Stanton's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/address-to-the-new-york-legislature-1854.htm\">Address to the Legislature of New York, 1854</a>.</p> <p>View or print more information about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/upload/site%20bulletin%20ECSH%20final.pdf\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her life in Seneca Falls</a>.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Born into an illustrious acting family, John Wilkes Booth was raised in Bel Air, Maryland where he followed in his family's acting footsteps, making his first appearance on stage at the age of 17. Booth was noted for his energetic performances, and for his habit of being a bit of a scene stealer. <br> <br> Following John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in October 1859, Booth joined the Richmond Grays, a militia unit, and was in attendance at Brown's execution. Booth expressed his satisfaction with Brown's fate, though he also applauded how stoically the condemned man had faced his death. <br> <br> When the Civil War began President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imprisoned pro-secession Maryland politicians and many Marylanders, Booth included, saw this as unconstitutional. A fervent southern sympathizer, Booth covertly shipped quinine to the South to get the desperately needed drug past the Union blockade. <br> <br> In late 1864, Booth and others began to craft a plot to kidnap Abraham Lincoln in order to ransom him for the release of southern prisoners of war. However, following the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, Booth decided to assassinate Lincoln instead, as well as have his cohorts kill Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. <br> <br> On April 14, while Lincoln was attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater, a venue that Booth was extremely familiar with, Booth crept into the Presidential box and shot Lincoln in the back of the head. He then leapt to the stage, cried out \"Sic Semper Tyrannis,\" (Thus Ever to Tyrants), and fled the scene. Pursued for 12 days by the largest manhunt in United States history, he was trapped in a barn on the Garrett farm in Virginia, where he was fatally shot.</p>",

He easily won both his 1858 and 1860 campaigns for governor, one of his biggest accomplishments both before and during his terms being his promotion of the North Carolina Railroad's construction.<br> <br> As the son of a planter, Ellis, a staunch Democrat, definitively supported slaveholder's rights, but he did not believe secession was necessary to preserve the institution of slavery. When secessionists seized the state's Forts Caswell and Johnston before North Carolina had officially left the Union, Governor Ellis interceded with sent envoys, demanded the return of the forts to the federal government. <br> <br> However, when President Lincoln called for 75,000 troops in the wake of the bombardment of Fort Sumter, Ellis made clear that his loyalties lay with the South, replying to the president, \"I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.\" <br> <br> North Carolina seceded from the Union on May 20, 1861 and the forts were retaken by Southern forces. Ellis did not live to see much else of the war, however. In delicate health for some time, Willis traveled to the convalescent resort at Red Sulphur Springs, Va. (now West Virginia), he died on July 7, 1861.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A dedicated abolitionist, shipwright and sea captain from New England, Jonathan Walker became famous for the unusual punishment he received for aiding seven slaves to escape. In 1835, Walker joined with abolitionist Benjamin Lunday on an expedition to Mexico to assist with the colonization of escaped American slaves. Shortly thereafter Walker moved his family from Massachusetts to Pensacola, Florida. In June 1844, he arranged to take seven runaway slaves to the Bahamas in a whaleboat he constructed himself. While at sea, Walker fell ill and his boat drifted for days before being rescued by a salvage sloop. Put ashore at Key West, he was arrested for aiding escaped slaves and returned to Pensacola to stand trial.<br> <br> After languishing in jail for several months, Walker was tried and convicted on November 14, 1844 of stealing slaves . He was sentenced to one hour in the public pillory, time in prison, pay court costs and a $600 fine, and to receive a branding of \"SS\" denoting slave stealer on his right hand. The branding of his hand occurred two days later. Walker's fine and court costs were paid for by Northern abolitionists, and he was subsequently released from prison in 1845. Undeterred, Walker returned to New England and lectured extensively on the evils of slavery. He often closed his speeches by lifting his right hand to the audience and proclaiming it \"the seal, the coat of arms of the United States.\" The photograph of Walker's hand was taken at the daguerreotype studio of Southworth and Hawes, probably in 1845. The daguerreotype process results in a reverse image so although the subject appears to be of Walker's left hand, it is in fact his right hand.<br> <br> Around 1850, Walker moved to Muskegon County, Michigan, where he lived until his death. The poet and abolitionist, John Greenleaf Whittier, paid tribute to Walker in his poem, \"The Branded Hand,\" which became a rallying cry for those advocating the end of slavery in the United States. A monument to Walker's memory was erected on his grave and dedicated on August 1, 1878.</p>",

He served in Florida, Texas, and Kansas, and fought with distinction in the Mexican-American War and by 1860 achieving the rank of brigadier general as Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. When his native state of Virginia seceded from the Union, Johnston resigned his commission, the highest-ranking United States officer to join the Confederacy. To his dismay, however, Jefferson Davis made him only the fourth highest-ranking officer in the Confederate army.<br> <br> Johnston was the senior Confederate commander at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 where his direction of arriving reinforcements throughout the day was one of the keys to the Confederate victory and which contributed to his promotion to full general the following month. In the spring of 1862, Johnston defended the Confederate capital of Richmond during the Peninsula Campaign, executing a series of tactical withdrawals up the Virginia Peninsula under pressure of a superior force under Union Gen. George B. McClellan. Seizing the offensive at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, 1862, Johnston was severaly wounded and his commandewas given to his West Point classmate, Robert E. Lee. <br> <br> Returning to service in November 1862, Johnston was given command in the Western Theater. He was criticized for his failure to prevent the capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi in July 1863. His long-simmering feud with Confedeate President Jefferson Davis came to a head in the wake of the Atlanta Campaign, where Johnston was relieved of his command by Davis after allowing William T. Sherman's Union army to reach the outskirts of Atlanta unchecked. In the final days of the war, he was given command of the small remaining Confederate forces in the Carolinas and surrendered his armies to Sherman on April 26, 1865.<br> <br> After the war Johnston served as an executive in the railroad and insurance businesses, served a term in Congress and was commissioner of railroads under President Grover Cleveland. On March 21, 1891, Joseph E. Johnston died of pneumonia, contracted while serving as pallbearer for his former adversary, William T. Sherman.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Mansfield's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>At age 59 Joseph King Mansfield was one of the oldest field officers in the Army of the Potomac. Until the Maryland Campaign Mansfield had commanded the Suffolk Division of the VII Corps of the Department of Virginia, but when Lee invaded the North in September Mansfield was given command of the XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac. <br> <br> He took command of the Corps on September 15, only two days prior to the Battle of Antietam. He brought 40 years of army experience with him, but had seen no recent combat. His officers considered him nervous and fussy, but his men, many of whom were new recruits, enjoyed his shows of blustery enthusiasm and fatherly assurance. Though white-haired and white-bearded, he possessed a vigorous manner that belied his age.<br> <br> On the morning of September 17, when Joseph Hooker's I Corps smashed into the Confederate left flank, Mansfield's corps came up to support the attack.<br> <br> As his lead brigade moved through an open field east of the Miller farmstead, they came under Confederate artillery fire, which took a fearsome toll on the unseasoned soldiers. In an effort to reduce the casualties being taken from the artillery the brigade was ordered to shift from column of march into open battle line. Mansfield quickly countermanded these orders, insisting the men stay in column, arguing that the officers could maintain better control and move more rapidly. <br> <br> In order to insure the proper movement of his men Mansfield personally led the troops on his left flank, from the Samuel Crawford's brigade, into the East Woods. <br> <br> Returning to the rear to bring up more troops, he saw the 10th Maine Infantry regiment firing into the woods. Mansfield, assuming that men from I Corps were in the woods, rode down the regimental line crying out, \"You are firing on our own men!\" Even as the infantrymen informed Mansfield that they were firing at Confederates and were themselves receiving heavy fire from the woods, that fire intensified and Mansfield was hit squarely in the chest. <br> <br> Tottering in his saddle, Mansfield pushed his bleeding horse (which had also been hit) away from the men, and rode north until he came upon the 125th Pennsylvania. Noticing that the General seemed ill Captain Gardner called for some men to help him dismount. <br> <br> Forming a chair of sorts with their muskets, five men picked up Mansfield and carried him to a lone tree in the rear of their line, where they left him to await the arrival of a surgeon. <br> <br> Regimental Surgeon Dr. Patrick Henry Flood described what he found when he arrived: \"I found the clothing around his chest saturated with blood, and upon opening them, found he was wounded in the right breast, the ball penetrating about two inches from the nipple, and passing out the back, near the edge of the shoulder blade.\" <br> <br> Mansfield was taken to a field hospital at the George Line farm in Sharpsburg, where he died the next morning. <br> <br> He is one of six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam.</p>",

Prior to the Civil War he was stationed with the Regiment of Mounted Rifles in the New Mexico Territory. While fighting a skirmish with Indians, Wheeler earned the nickname \"Fighting Joe.\"<br> <br> At the onset of hostilities, Wheeler joined the Confederate army on March 16, 1861 as a first lieutenant in the Georgia militia artillery. Less than six months later he was promoted to colonel in command of the 19th Alabama Infantry. Wheeler led his regiment at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, successfully covering the Confederate retreat on the second day. Transferring to the cavalry, he was given command of 2nd Cavalry Brigade in General Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi. Wheeler's troops conducted a successful rearguard action after the Battle of Perryville in October, and again after the Battles of Stones River and Chickamauga. He was promoted to brigadier general on October 30, 1862, leading cavalry attached to Bragg's forces, now renamed the Army of Tennessee. In December 1862, Wheeler's cavalry skillfully delayed Union General Rosecran's advance from Nashville, destroying four Union wagon trains and capturing around 1,000 Union soldiers. <br> <br> General Bragg promoted Wheeler to major general on January 20, 1863 and gave him command of one of the army's two cavalry corps, which he led at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863. In October 1863, Wheeler commanded 5,000 cavalrymen in devastating raids against Union supply lines west of Chattanooga, destroying several railroad bridges, hundreds of wagons and more than a thousand mules. In 1864 and early 1865, he kept his cavalry in almost continual action against Sherman's Union forces, first during the Atlanta Campaign, then in the March to the Sea, and subsequently, during the Carolinas Campaign.<br> <br> Wheeler's capture near Atlanta in May 1865, while covering Jefferson Davis' flight from Richmond, ended his hope of reaching Confederate General Kirby Smith and continuing the fight in the West. During the war, he was wounded three times, had 16 horses shot from under him, and lost 36 staff officers to combat. Along with Nathan Bedford Forrest, he earned a reputation as one of the top Confederate cavalry commanders. After the war, Wheeler served eight terms as a Democratic congressman from Alabama, and fought once more as a commanding officer, this time wearing the blue uniform of the United States, in both the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Early's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>Jubal Anderson Early was a native Virginian and member of the Whig party who did not particularly support secession. However, when President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to support the Union in 1861, he was moved to defend the South. <br> <br> Having graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1837 and with previous military experience fighting the Seminole Wars in Florida, Early rose quickly through the ranks of the Confederate army. He was supported by Lee, who affectionately called him the \"Bad Old Man\" because of his temper. This temper made him an apt commander, but it did not make him popular amongst his subordinate officers, of whom Early was extraordinarily critical. <br> <br> Serving in Virginia for most of the war, he was involved in all the Army of Northern Virginia's major engagements from 1862 to 1864. Early was wounded at Williamsburg in 1862 while leading a charge and spent the next two months recuperating at his home in Rocky Mount, Virginia. After his wounds had healed he returned to the war, under the command of Jackson, in time for the Battle of Malvern Hill. There, Early was unable to efficiently navigate and his brigade was lost in the woods, missing any significant action. <br> <br> In the Northern Virginia Campaign, Early was noted for his performance at the Battle of Cedar Mountain and arrived in the nick of time to reinforce Major General A.P. Hill on Jackson's left on Stony Ridge in the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run). At Antietam, when Early's division commander was wounded, he took command of the division. Lee was so impressed after his performance during the battle that he kept Early on as a division commander. <br> <br> After his successful counterattack in response to George Meade's advance at the Battle of Fredericksburg, Early was again promoted, this time to Major General, on January 17, 1863. Early's ascendency continued as a result of his performances in the 1864 Overland Campaign and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign. In the Shenandoah Valley Campaign Early mounted the Confederacy's last invasion of the North, driving Union forces westward and ultimately threatening Washington, D.C. before being turned back at the Battle of Fort Stevens. In the war's final months, however, Early suffered a string of defeats, some of which included the Battle of Winchester, the Battle of Fisher's Hill, the Battle of Cedar Creek, and the Battle of Waynesboro. He was eventually relieved of command by Lee in March of 1865.<br> <br> After the war Early moved abroad, attempting to escape charges of treason for his role in defending the Confederacy until he was pardoned by President Johnson in 1868. He then returned to Lynchburg, Virginia where he returned to practicing law until his death in 1894.</p>",

Kilpatrick graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1861, just after the start of the Civil War, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery, though within three days he was a captain in the 5th New York Infantry. <br> <br> Less than two months after graduation from West Point, he became the first regular army officer to be wounded in battle during the fight at Big Bethel, Virginia on June 10, 1861. Recovering from his wounds, he returned to service as lieutenant colonel of the 2nd New York Cavalry and quickly he rose through the ranks to become a brigadier general by June 1863. Though aggressive and fearless in battle, Kilpatrick had a poor reputation within the Union army due to his use of political influence for advancement, the poor manner in which he maintained his camps, his frequent run-ins with the law. Despite, this, Kilpatrick served with distinction in the Battle for Beverly's Ford, Stoneman's Raid, and the Battle of Gettysburg.<br> <br> In April 1864 after his attempted raid on Richmond, Virginia, he was sent to take charge of a division of Sherman's cavalry in the Western Theater. During the Atlanta campaign he was badly wounded at the Battle of Resaca and was forced to sit out the rest of the war guarding Sherman's communications and commanding the Union forces during the skirmishes at Lovejoy's Station and Buck Head Creek. In June 1865, after the end of the war, he was brevetted major general. He resigned both of his commissions in December 1865.</p>",

The Paynes then returned to Gettysburg where Kitty remarried. Kitty Payne died in 1851, but Eliza Jane, one of Kitty's daughters, was still living in Gettysburg when the Union and Confederate armies collided there in July 1863. Eliza recalled hiding during the battle, not only from shot and shell but also from Confederates roaming the town in search of blacks to abduct. Another of Kitty's children, James Arthur Payne, would later enlist in the 27th U.S. Colored Troops and fight at the Battle of the Crater.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Laura Ingersoll was born to Thomas Ingersoll and Elizabeth Dewey in Great Barrington, in the colonial province of Massachusetts. The Ingersolls had been in the colonies for generations, and Thomas fought with the American patriots during the Revolutionary War. In the economic depression following the war, he sought better opportunities for his family, and petitioned Canadian governor John Simcoe for a land grant. The grant was approved, and Ingersoll moved his family and 10 children, including Laura, up to Queenston, Ontario in 1795.</p><p>Queenston was a small and recently established community, populated by loyalists who fled colonial America during and after the Revolution. As more “late loyalists” like the Ingersolls began to arrive looking for land from the government, tensions increased among the settlers. The Ingersoll family eventually moved to York, but Laura remained in Queenston. She married wealthy shop owner James Secord in 1797, and moved with him to nearby St. Davids.</p><p>The Secords owned a shop in St. Davids and had five children between 1799 and 1810. When the war broke out in 1812, James served in the First Lincoln Militia under Isaac Brock. James fought and was wounded in the Battle of Queenston Heights in October 1812, prompting Laura to be called to his side on the battlefield, as was customary. According to legend, she arrived just as a group of American soldiers attempted to kill off this wounded militiaman, but Laura intervened and saved him.</p><p>But Laura Secord’s most legendary contribution to the War of 1821 came a year later, in June 1813. While American officers were quartered in her home following the capture of Fort George in May, she overheard the American plan to surprise Lieutenant James Fitzgibbon’s small army at Beaver Dams, about 20 miles from St. Davids. Laura took this information, and pretending to go visit a sick brother, sought out Lieutenant Fitzgibbon to inform him of the plan of attack. Laura exited the American-occupied territory and walked 20 miles to warn the army. Now aware of and able to anticipate the American attack, Fitzgibbon launched a preemptive ambush as they arrived the next day, protecting the Canadian army and capturing 500 American prisoners.</p><p>Laura Secord’s role in the War of 1812 was never formally celebrated in her lifetime. Following the end of the war, Laura and James had two more children, but had little income with their store destroyed. James eventually found work as a clerk and judge, but were never able to return to their pre-war affluence.</p><p>James died in 1841, leaving Laura destitute to move in with her daughters. She lived another 27 years, passing away at the age of 93 in 1868.</p><p>After her death, Laura Secord’s story of Canadian patriotism began to gain prominence, especially in the late 1800s with the women’s suffrage movement . As her story was revealed, she became enshrined in Canadian lore as a heroine who navigated dangerous enemy terrain for her love of Canada. Today, her home in Queenston is a Niagara Parks site, and a monument to her is erected in Queenston Heights. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Leonidas Polk was a West Point graduate, planter, slave-owner and Episcopal bishop who, through the influence of his friend Jefferson Davis, began the Civil War as a major general in the Confederate army. Polk was initially charged with securing the Confederacy's northwestern frontier and in this capacity, he ordered the occupation of Columbus, Kentucky in September 1861, thereby provoking the Kentucky legislature to appeal for Federal troops to repel the invaders. <br> <br> He was a corps commander during the Battles of Shiloh, Perryville and Murfreesboro, and in October 1862, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. Following the Battle of Chickamauga - and in the culmination of a long-running feud - Polk was removed from command by Braxton Bragg. He was then inactive for several months, not returning to the field until December 1863 when President Davis assigned him to oversee the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Davis shifted Polk again in January 1864 to the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi. <br> <br> In May 1864, Polk was ordered to merge his forces with those of Joseph E. Johnston and together arrest the advance of three separate Union armies moving on Atlanta, Georgia. Polk was scouting Union positions with his staff on June 14, 1864 when he was killed by a cannon shot near Marietta, Georgia.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Levi Coffin was born in North Carolina on October 28, 1798 into a Quaker family who greatly influenced by the teachings of John Woolman a Quaker preacher, who believed slaveholding was not compatible with the Quaker beliefs and advocated emancipation. Growing up in the South, Coffin was frequently exposed to slaves throughout his childhood and sympathized with their condition.<br> <br> By the age of 15, William was helping his family assist escaping slaves by giving them food and shelter on their farm. In 1821, William became a teacher and opened up a school for slaves to teach them how to read, though it was not successful as slave owners would not permit their slaves to attend. In 1826, he moved to Indiana and over the next 20 years he assisted more than 2,000 enslaved persons escape bondage, so many that his home was known as the \"Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad.\" <br> <br> Moving to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1847, he operated the Western Free Produce Association, a store that sold only goods produced by free labor, and continued to operate his home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. During the Civil War he visited numerous contraband camps and continued to aid slaves in their quest for freedom on the Underground Railroad. <br> <br> After the war ended, Coffin raised over $100,000 for the Western Freedman's Aid Society to provide food, clothing, money, and other aid for recently freed blacks. With the war over, slavery illegal, and passage of the 15th Amendment, granting African Americans the right to vote, Coffin retired from public life and wrote his memoirs.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A Union army officer, diplomat and best-selling author, Lewis Wallace joined the Union army as colonel of the 11th Indiana Infantry in April 1861. Wallace initially served with his unit in the Department of Western Virginia. After advancing to the rank of brigadier general in September 1861, he played a key role in the capture of Fort Donelson. Wallace was promoted to major general in March 1862. In command of a reserve division under Grant at the Battle of Shiloh, he may have misinterpreted Grant's orders to move his division up in support of Gen. Sherman's troops at Shiloh Church. By the time Wallace's division arrived on the scene, the fighting had virtually ceased for the day. Although, Union forces carried the battle the next day, the casualty toll was horrific. Wallace received the lion's share of the blame from his superiors and was eventually reassigned to a regimental command protecting the city of Cincinnati during Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky. <br> <br> Wallace's greatest battlefield contribution may have been in the defense of Washington, when he cobbled together a force of 5,800 men and checked the advance of Gen. Jubal Early's 15,000-man Confederate army at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864. In 1865 he served on the military tribunal that tried those charged with the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Later that year, Wallace presided over the military tribunal that condemned Confederate Major Henry Wirz, commandant of the notorious Andersonville prison camp.<br> <br> After the war, Wallace served as governor of the New Mexico Territory from 1878 to 1881. In 1881 he accepted an appointment as U.S. Minister to the Ottoman Empire, serving until 1885. Today, Wallace is perhaps best remembered as a novelist, especially for his work Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, which became a stage play and a major motion picture and is to this day the best selling American novel fo all time (from the date of its publication).</p>",

A committed Unionist, Rousseau resigned his Kentucky senate seat in 1861 in order to recruit volunteers for the Union cause. <br> <br> He was appointed colonel of one of the 5th Kentucky Infantry who, in combination with Home Guard troops, helped save Louisville, Kentucky from advancing Confederates in the fall of 1861. In October 1862, Rousseau was promoted to brigadier general, and less than two weeks later, to major general. He served valiantly at the Battles of Shiloh, Stones River and Perryville, during the Tullahoma Campaign and in movements around Chattanooga, Tennessee in the summer of 1863. Between November 1863 and November 1865, Rousseau oversaw units defending Nashville, Tennessee and carried out a successful raid on the Montgomery and West Point Railroad. <br> <br> Rousseau resigned his commission in 1865 to take a seat in the 39th U.S. Congress. He left office a year later following a confrontation with a fellow representative that drew a formal reprimand from the House, but took back his seat in 1867. He returned to the army a brevet major general in 1867 and was assigned to duty in Alaska where he assisted in the transfer of that territory from the Russian Empire to United States. On July 28, 1868, he was placed in command of the Department of Louisiana. He died in New Orleans on January 7, 1869.</p>",

Northrop left the army again in the midst of the secession crisis. <br> <br> In March 1861, he was commissioned a colonel in the Confederate army by Davis and then appointed Commissary-General for the military forces of the Confederacy. Northrop, in his role as Commissary-General, was responsible for all logistical services for the Confederate military, including the procurement and transport of supplies to the armies and navy, the transport of troops, and the supply of necessities to inmates in prisoner-of-war camps. Northrop served in this role from March 1861 until February 1865 when he was forced from office. <br> <br> While it is true the Confederacy lacked many of the resources and much of the infrastructure necessary to maintain its armies and prison camps, it is also clear that Northrop magnified these deficiencies through the incompetent administration of his department. Nevertheless, Davis refused to abandon his friend and even promoted Northrop to brigadier general in 1864, an appointment that was never ratified by the Confederate Senate. After the war, Northrop was briefly imprisoned by Union forces but then retired to his farm near Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>",

Involved in New York state politics from the age of 17, Van Buren organized the first state-wide political organization, the Bucktails, whose leaders were known as the Albany Regency. Along with other New York political clubs, including Tammany Hall, the Albany Regency helped develop the \"spoils system,\" a system of dispensing public offices and largesse in exchange for votes. Van Buren became the principal organizer of the first national party, the Jacksonian Democrats, explaining that \"Without strong national political organizations, there would be nothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states.\"<br> <br> Recognizing Van Buren's contributions to his election as President, Andrew Jackson appointed Van Buren as Secretary of State in 1829, even though Van Buren had just been sworn in as Governor of New York on January 1. Van Buren's support for Jackson following the latter's dispute with Vice President John C. Calhoun over issues such as the Bank of the United States made Van Buren the pre-eminent choice to succeed Calhoun as Vice President. In 1832, Jackson, with Van Buren as his Vice President, won re-election in a landside, chiefly due to Jackson's popularity as a war hero.<br> <br> Van Buren won election to the presidency in 1836 despite lukewarm support in the South due to suspicions regarding his position on the issue of slavery. Van Buren's stated intention to \"follow in the footsteps of my illustrious predecessor\" was eclipsed by the Panic of 1837 and ensuing depression, with high unemployment and wide-spread bank failures. Bereft of tools to combat the depression, Van Buren failed in his 1840 re-election bid, losing to the popular William Henry Harrison. In 1848 Van Buren, now representing the anti-slavery Free Soil Party, failed in his attempt to reclaim the presidency.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><span>Mathew B. Brady first became interested in photography in 1839 after meeting Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph. After meeting Louis Jacques Daguerre, the inventor of the daguerreotype, Morse opened a studio in New York City at which he also offered classes and Brady was one of his first students. </span><br /><br /><span>In 1844 Brady opened his own photography studio and quickly made a name for himself by taking photographs of famous Americans and exhibiting them. In 1849 Brady moved his studio to Washington, D.C. and throughout the 1850s experimented with different styles of photography. </span><br /><br /><span>When the Civil War broke out Brady became enraptured with the idea of documenting the war and requested permission to do so from Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln agreed to Brady's request with the provision that he fund the effort himself. Brady agreed and set out to capture the war in photographs. He employed more than a score of men, including Alexander Gardner and George Barnard, to accomplish this feat and his photographers capture over 10,000 images during the course of the war.</span><br /><br /><span>Brady himself spent most of his time in Washington organizing his assistants and the photographs they submitted, rarely visiting the battlefields himself. This may have been due to his eyesight, which had begun deteriorating several years earlier. Brady's most famous exhibition from the war was entitled \"The Dead at Antietam,\" which featured numerous photographs of corpses on the battlefield and brought the war home to the American people in a way not previously seen. </span><br /><br /><span>All in all, Brady spent over $100,000 to document the war, expecting the government to purchase the photos after the war concluded. However the government refused, offering in 1875 to pay Brady only $75,000 for the prints. This pushed Brady into bankruptcy and he was forced to sell his studio. Mathew Brady died penniless and alone in a charity ward in 1896.</span></p>",

This resulted in the publication of several well-received texts on meteorology and navigation, which in turn led to his appointment as U.S. Naval Superintendent of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in 1842. <br> <br> While employed in this capacity, Maury published \"The Physical Geography of the Sea,\" considered today the first modern textbook of oceanography. His system of recording oceanographic data was exceptional and was eventually adopted by seafaring nations the world over.

After the war, he was briefly involved with the resettlement of Confederates in Mexico and the establishment of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in Blacksburg, Virginia (now Virginia Tech).

Lee to improve access to that city's river boat landing. <br> <br> Between 1852 and 1860, Meigs designed and supervised the construction of the Washington Aqueduct, a gravity-fed water delivery system for the city of Washington D.C. that is still in operation today. Also during this period, Meigs designed and supervised the construction of a new dome and larger wings for the U.S. Capitol. Soon after the Civil War began, Meigs was appointed Union Quartermaster General, a position he held throughout the war. <br> <br> Meigs' honesty, determination and professional skill were legendary. Any number of Union victories can be ascribed to the efficiency with which his department procured and delivered vast amounts of war materiel over equally vast distances. Meigs is also remembered as the officer who, in his official capacity as army cemeteries superintendent, recommended Robert E. Lee's former estate at Arlington as a fitting resting place for hundreds of Union soldiers who died in the war, including Meigs own son First Lieutenant John Rodgers Meigs.

            "bodyText": "<p>Nelson Appleton Miles was working as a crockery store clerk in the fall of 1861 when he organized a company of volunteers for the Union cause. He was elected its captain and rose rapidly through the ranks, serving with distinction at the Battles of Fair Oaks, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and Petersburg. He was wounded several times during these engagements and finally promoted to major general of volunteers in October 1865. <br> <br> Immediately following the war, he was appointed commander of the District of Fort Monroe where he oversaw the incarceration of Jefferson Davis. He then departed for the West where, as a Colonel and later General in the Regular Army, he was involved in numerous campaigns against Native American bands resisting their confinement on government reservations. In 1890, Miles was promoted to Major General and two years later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Chancellorsville in 1863. <br> <br> In 1895 Miles was promoted to Commanding General of the U.S. Army in recognition of his actions directing a 12,000-man Federal force that successfully suppressed a nationwide railroad worker strike. During the Spanish-American War, Miles led an invasion of Puerto Rico and became its military and civilian administrator after the island was subdued. In 1900, in recognition for his services in Puerto Rico, Miles was promoted to Lieutenant General of the Army. Miles retired in 1903 and lived a further 22 years. His offer to return to active service at the beginning of America's entry into World War I was politely declined by President Wilson.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The commodore who led the Lake Erie fleet to victory during the War of 1812 had the sea in his blood. His father, Christopher Raymond Perry, was a Navy captain, and growing up in the seaside town of South Kingston, Rhode Island, Perry anticipated his future career from an early age. His opportunity arrived in 1799 when the frigate <em>General Greene </em>was commissioned and in search for crew. As the son of a prominent captain, Perry received a coveted midshipman appointment.   <br></p><p>For the next six years, Perry served on the renowned ships <em>Constellation</em>, <em>Nautilus</em>, and <em>Constitution</em>, but never saw any of the action that made them famous. This luck ran dry in April 1809 when Perry received his first command, the schooner <em>Revenge. </em>After an uneventful year patrolling northern waters, en route to Charleston, South Carolina the <em>Revenge </em>was caught in and damaged by storms, and Perry fell ill by the heat and humidity of a southern summer. <em>Revenge </em>set course back to Newport, Rhode Island, but ran aground and sunk near Watch Hill, a mere 40 miles from its destination. The still-ailing Perry seized the opportunity to take a leave of absence, marrying Elizabeth Champlin Mason on May 5, 1811 and enjoying a leisurely honeymoon.  <br></p><p>When war was declared on June 18, 1812, the honeymoon was literally over. Perry was recalled to active service, and seeking glory petitioned for a posting at sea. Although he was promoted to master commandant, he was assigned not to the high seas, but to command the flotilla then under construction on Lake Erie. Although somewhat of a disappointment, this turned out to be fortuitous, giving Perry at last his opportunity for victory. Perry famously commanded the successful American navy at the Battle of Lake Erie, and for the first time in history ordered the surrender of an entire British naval squadron.</p><p>Perry was promoted to captain, and offered command of the <em>Java</em>, a new frigate under construction in Baltimore. Waiting for its fittings, Perry participated in the defense of both Washington and Baltimore during the late summer British invasion of the Chesapeake Bay region, but ironically these land engagements would be Perry's swan song; peace was declared before the new captain could get his ship to sea.</p><p>After the war, Perry’s short temper embroiled him in several controversies, including a narrowly avoided duel with another Lake Erie hero, Captain Jesse Duncan Elliott. To placate and distract this impetuous young hero, Perry was promoted to the rank of commodore, and sent on a diplomatic mission to Venezuela. There, the heat and humidity which plagued Perry on his first voyage south returned, but this time paired fatally with yellow fever. Perry died on his ship of the disease on his way back to safe harbor in Trinidad. </p>",

He was a circuit court judge for a time and active in Democratic politics, but was expelled from the state party in the mid-1850s for his anti-slavery stance. He ran for Governor of Indiana unsuccessfully under the banner of the short-lived Know-Nothing Party, then became a founding member of the Republican Party and delegate to its first convention in Pittsburgh in 1856. <br> <br> Morgan was elected Lieutenant Governor of Indiana in 1860 and then ascended to the governor's office after Henry S. Lane was elected U.S. Senator. Morton became a fierce Union partisan during the war as he attempted to circumvent the will of Indiana's more conservative legislature. Relations between Morton and the assembly gradually deteriorated until, in 1862, the legislature attempted to remove the state militia from his command and transfer it to a state board of Democratic commissioners. Morton immediately dissolved the General Assembly and announced his intent to administer the state without its representatives. As the state approached bankruptcy, Morton successfully solicited the donation and loan of millions of dollars in private money that were then used to fund the government. He continued to harass and suppress the activities of his political opponents whom he occasionally accused of treason. <br> <br> It is thought that because of his scrupulous honesty during this period of one-man rule he was able to escape post-war retribution for his actions. He was reelected governor in 1864 and served until his appointment to the U.S. Senate in 1867. In the Senate, Morton joined the most radical faction of the Republican Party as it attempted to punish the South and reconstruct its culture and politics. He was elected to a second term in 1873 and died in office in 1877.</p>",

He settled Helena, Arkansas in June 1850 and became an American citizen in 1855. <br> <br> In 1861, Cleburne joined the Confederate army and was elected colonel of the 15th Arkansas Infantry. In March 1862, he was promoted to brigadier general and he led a brigade into battle at Shiloh (April 1862), Richmond, Kentucky (August 1862) and Perryville (October 1862) and Stones River (December 1862). Cleburne was promoted to major general on December 13, 1862, leading a division with distinction at the Battle of Chickamauga (September 1863a) and the Battle of Missionary Ridge (November 1863), for which he and his troops received an official thanks from the Confederate Congress. <br> <br> Concerned that the Confederacy was losing the war due to limitations of its manpower and resources, Cleburne on January 2, 1864 gathered the leadership of the Army of Tennessee and presented a plan to emancipate slaves, arm them and enlist them in the Confederate army to secure a victory for the South. He stated that slavery was the Confederacy's \"most vulnerable point, a continued embarrassment, and in some respects an insidious weakness.\" The proposal was met with silence during the presentation, and was never officially recognized by Confederate officials. <br> <br> In the spring of 1864 the Army of Tennessee moved towards Atlanta, Georgia, where Patrick Cleburne led his men at the Battles of Dalton, Tunnel Hill, Resaca, Pickett's Mill, Ringgold and Kennesaw. On November 30, 1864, at the Second Battle of Franklin, Major General Patrick Cleburne was killed leading an assault on the Union lines.</p>",

Nevertheless, in an act of paternal devotion that was extraordinary for its time and place, and in defiance of law and custom, Healy was sent north by his father to receive an education. He later traveled to Europe to complete his studies and received a doctorate in philosophy in 1865 from the Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. <br> <br> In 1866, Healy returned to America to teach philosophy at the Jesuit College in Georgetown, District of Columbia, and eight years later, was selected as its president. The Reverend's influence on the development of Georgetown College was profound. He modernized the curriculum, improved the quality of its law and medical schools and oversaw the expansion of the school's physical plant to such an extent that by the time of his retirement in 1882, Georgetown College had evolved into Georgetown University. <br> <br> Healy was fair-skinned enough to pass for European-American, but if one accepts the racial classification system of his day, Father Healy may be considered the first African-American to earn a doctorate, the first African-American to become a Jesuit priest, and the first to serve as president of a predominantly white college.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>New York shipping merchant, nine-term Democratic Congressman and three-term Mayor of New York City, Fernando Wood turned to politics after amassing a fortune shipping goods to California during the gold rush. His public career began with his election to Congress in 1840. After failing in his reelection bid in 1842, Wood was appointed to the post of dispatch agent at New York's port authority by Secretary of State John C. Calhoun. Calhoun's successor, James Buchanan, extended his appointment until 1847, after which he focused his sights on the mayor's office.<br> <br> After an initial unsuccessful attempt in 1850, Wood was elected Mayor of New York City in 1854. He immediately set out to reform city government, sponsoring a number of progressive programs, including the hiring of unemployed laborers for public works, and preserving Central Park. During his second term in office, Wood's administration fell into disarray after the Republican-dominated legislature created a competing police force, ostensibly to control the rampant corruption in the existing police department. Gangs ruled the streets. At one point, Wood himself was arrested. After being defeated for a third term in 1857, Wood established Mozart Hall, a rival political machine to Tammany Hall.<br> <br> Elected to a third term as mayor in 1859, Wood favored compromise with the South before the war. He led a pro-Southern delegation to the Democratic National Convention in 1860. During the secession crisis in 1861, Wood even suggested that New York City secede from the Union and declare itself a free city republic in order to protect its lucrative cotton trade with the Confederacy. He recognized that his patronage power depended on the profits from the cotton trade.<br> <br> Wood briefly supported the Union war effort after the first shots were fired at Ft. Sumter, but as the war dragged on he joined with Clement Vallandigham and other anti-war Democrats, known as Copperheads, to form the Peace Democrats. Wood seized upon voters' discontent with the war to win election to a second term in Congress in 1862. He was rejected in his reelection effort in 1864 after the tide of war turned in the Union's favor. His career in the House of Representatives however, was far from over. <br> <br> Beginning in 1866, Wood was elected seven more times to Congress, the last in 1880, shortly before his death. He steadfastly opposed the reconstruction policies of the Radical Republicans. During Wood's last years in Congress, he served as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, working on tariff reform.</p>",

In 1878, a special government commission exonerated Porter when it found that the general's reluctance to attack Longstreet's forces on August 30, 1862 probably saved Pope's Army of Virginia from an even greater defeat. Eight years later, President Chester A. Arthur formally reversed Porter's 1863 conviction and Congress restored Porter's commission as an infantry colonel in the U.S. Army, backdated to May 14, 1861, but without back pay.

Following a series of conventions held in Wheeling, Virginia in 1861, representatives of 32 north Virginia counties agreed to form a government separate from the one in Richmond and appointed Pierpont its provisional governor. This \"Restored government of Virginia\" drafted a new Virginia Constitution, sent representatives to the U.S. Congress and established offices in Alexandria, Virginia. <br> <br> But Pierpont was unsatisfied with these half-measures and continued to work toward a permanent separation of north and south. He finally succeeded when representatives of the Restored Government voted to secede from Virginia 1862, and the United States agreed to admit the fledgling State of West Virginia in 1863. After Arthur I. Boreman became West Virginia's first governor, Pierpont was assigned to oversee the Restored State of Virginia, a disjointed territory then comprising several Union-held districts of southern Virginia. In 1865, Pierpont was appointed Provisional Governor of Virginia. He retired from public service in 1868 to resume his law practice in West Virginia.</p>",

When the war began Sigel joined the Union army in Missouri, serving under the command of Nathaniel Lyon. When Lyon was killed, Sigel was appointed Brigadier General in the summer of 1861. Over the next year Sigel was involved in numerous campaigns and was promoted to the rank of Major General. Sigel was known for rallying German-Americans to enlist for the Union as they declared: \"I goes to fight mit Sigel.\"<br> <br> When John C.

He chose Franz Sigel. <br> <br> Sigel was generally praised for his efforts in the Second Battle of Bull Run. His troops defended against \"Stonewall\" Jackson's assault on August 29th and attempted to hold back General James Longstreet's massive assault the following day. After suffering ignominious defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run and retreating back to Washington, Sigel's First Corps were disbanded and reassigned as the Army of Potomac's Eleventh Corps. <br> <br> Franz Sigel commanded the XI Corps over the winter of 1862-63, but saw no action, remaining in reserve during the Battle of Fredericksburg.

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: McClellan's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>After his push toward Richmond was thwarted by Robert E. Lee in July, the Army of the Potomac began withdrawing back to Washington. When Lee responded by advancing North to try and end the \"total war\" of John Pope's Army of Virginia on the people of Northern Virginia, McClellan was ordered to send assistance to Pope from the Army of the Potomac McClellan was slow to respond, sending only minimal reinforcements, even when directly ordered to do so, and delaying their arrival on the battlefield of the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).<br> <br> His failure to properly support Pope greatly benefited the Confederates. With Longstreet's arrival and subsequent attack on Pope's position the Confederates carried the day on August 30, 1862, once again driving the Union soldiers back to Washington. <br> <br> Despite McClellan's failure to support Pope at Manassas, when Lincoln reorganized Federal forces, consolidating Pope's Army of Virginia into the Army of the Potomac, he decided to reappoint McClellan as the head of the new force.<br> When Lee launched an invasion into Maryland in September 1862, McClellan, in rare exception to his usual slowness of action, rapidly led the Army of the Potomac northwest to cut him off in Maryland. Fortune favored McClellan when one of his soldiers discovered a copy of Special Orders 191 near Frederick, Maryland. These orders outlined Lee's plans and revealed that he had split up his army, providing McClellan with a splendid opportunity to destroy Lee's army in piecemeal. <br> <br> Recognizing the significance of the opportunity McClellan declared, \"Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home.\" He quickly sent a telegraph to President Lincoln in which he stated, \"I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency.\" Yet, after sending this message at noon on September 13, rather than ordering his army to set out to engage the disparate elements of Lee's forces immediately, he awaited further reconnaissance and ordered them to depart the following morning. This eighteen hour delay allowed Lee time to react and take action to consolidate his forces to meet the Union threat. Though it is often asserted that Lee received intelligence from a Confederate sympathizer that McClellan knew of his plans, Lee himself stated that he was unaware that McClellan had a copy of the orders until a year later when McClellan published his account of the campaign. <br> <br> The delay in McClellan's response to the opportunity provided by Special Orders 191 helped to secure the fate of the federal garrison at Harpers Ferry since the relief column McClellan dispatched on the morning of September 14 was unable to reach them before they surrendered to \"Stonewall\" Jackson. It also allowed Lee to successfully defend the passes at South Mountain long enough for the full strength of the Army of Northern Virginia to arrive on the field of Antietam on September 17. <br> <br> Despite the tactical advantages and numerical superiority McClellan enjoyed at the Battle of Antietam, he failed to utilize many of the means available to him, achieving an inconclusive outcome on the battlefield where he might have had a clear victory. He committed only 50,000 of the available men to the contest which meant that a third of his army never even fired a shot.<br> <br> On the morning of September 18, Lee's army prepared to defend against a Federal assault that never came. Since McClellan did not attack, that night, under the cover of darkness, Lee's campaign into Maryland came to an end when his army withdrew across the Potomac River into Virginia. <br> <br> Despite repeated entreaties from the War Department and the president himself, McClellan declined to pursue Lee once after his initial push was stopped at Shepherdstown on September 19. Following this repulse McClellan remained in place for more than 5 weeks, finally beginning to move again on October 26. <br> <br> This failure was the final straw for Abraham Lincoln who relieved McClellan of his command of the Army of the Potomac on November 7, effectively ending the general's military career.</p>",

As he led his men during the fight a minie ball struck Anderson near his ankle, injuring it badly. Anderson was pulled off the field and transported to Shepherdstown, and then by wagon up the Shenandoah Valley to Staunton, Virginia, to recuperate. From Staunton he was moved via train to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he died on October 16 following surgery to amputate what had by that point become a badly infected foot.<br> <br> He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded on the field of Antietam.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>George Pickett was a career U.S. Army officer and Mexican-American War veteran who graduated last in his class at West Point (1846). He resigned his commission in 1861 to join the Confederate army and was first commissioned a colonel. He was then promoted to brigadier general in 1862 and was wounded the Battle of Gaines' Mill. <br> <br> After recovering from his injuries, Pickett was promoted to major general and placed in charge of a two-brigade division of Longstreet's Corps in the Army of Northern Virginia. It was this division Pickett would lead up Cemetery Ridge at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, and to which Pickett would refer when Robert E. Lee directed him to organize his unit for the defense, when he said, \"General, I have no division.\" Pickett lost over one half of his command in this attack, killed, wounded or captured, including all three of his brigadier generals. Although not directly responsible for the disaster, Pickett's name came to be associated with it and his reputation suffered. <br> <br> After Gettysburg, Pickett commanded the Department of Southern Virginia and North Carolina, then served as a division commander in the forces opposing Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 advance on Richmond. Pickett's defeat at the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865 precipitated Robert E. Lee's decision to evacuate Richmond, and after the Battle of Sailor's Creek, he was relieved of command. Following the war, Pickett became an insurance salesman in Richmond.</p>",

Hill's men approached him to inform him of surrender, Stannard was reluctant and was said to have tears upon his face. His men tried their best to break their weapons as they marched up the hill to be paroled. Stannard, when asked to sign the parole papers, at first refused to do so for his men, but eventually did when the Confederates threatened to imprison him in Richmond. Stannard and his men were paroled to Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois. Upon his exchange in January, 1863, he was commissioned as Brigadier General of Volunteers and by March was placed in command of the 2nd Vermont Brigade. <br> <br> Stannard fought and was wounded at Gettysburg, Cold Harbor, and at Fort Harrison during the Petersburg Campaign.

Welles began his political life as a Jacksonian Democrat, using his newspaper, The Hartford Times, to support Jackson's candidacy for President in 1828. He was elected to the Connecticut legislature, serving until 1835. The following year, Jackson appointed Welles as postmaster of Hartford, a position he held until 1841. From 1846 until 1849, he served in the Polk administration as Chief of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing for the Navy. Welles left the Democratic Party in the 1850s over the issue of slavery.<br> <br> During the 1850s Welles shifted his political allegiance to the newly organized Republican Party and founded the Hartford Evening Press to trumpet Republican views. After failing in his run for governor of Connecticut, he served as member of the Republican National Committee and member of the party's executive committee, leading Connecticut's delegation to the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago. After his election as President in 1860, Lincoln rewarded Welles' support by appointing him Secretary of the Navy.<br> <br> Welles oversaw the modernization and buildup of the U.S. Navy, including the development of ironclads. His effective stewardship of the Navy Department enabled the successful implementation of a blockade against Confederate ports, which limited the Confederacy's ability to finance the war through the cotton trade. After Lincoln's assassination, Welles continued to serve as Secretary of the Navy in the Johnson administration. He also supported Johnson's reconciliation policies toward the South, putting himself at odds with the Radical Republicans in Congress. <br> <br> In 1869, Welles left Washington and the Republican Party. He focused his remaining years on editing his journals and writing books, including a biography, \"Lincoln and Seward,\" published in 1874. Welles' three volume diary of his service to Lincoln and Johnson is recognized as an invaluable resource by Civil War and Lincoln scholars alike.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A career U.S. army officer and civil engineer, Godfrey Weitzel graduated from West Point in 1855 with a commission in the Corps of Engineers. On his first assignment he assisted with the design, construction and repair of fortifications guarding New Orleans. Weitzel returned to West Point in 1859 to teach civil and military engineering. While stationed at Washington, D.C., in March 1861, his engineering company served as President Lincoln's bodyguards during the inauguration.<br> <br> After the Civil War started, Weitzel served under various engineering commands tasked with improving the defenses of Cincinnati and Washington. He was then appointed appointer chief engineer of the Department of the Gulf during Gen Benjamin Butler's expedition that captured New Orleans. Weitzel's knowledge of the city's defenses was critical to Butler's success. In August 1862, he earned a promotion to brigadier general of volunteers, and the following year commanded a division of troops under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks during the assault and siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana. Weitzel received a transfer in April 1864 to Gen. Butler's Army of the James, where he served in the dual role of Chief Engineer and commander of 2nd Division, XVIII Corps. In August 1864, he was brevetted major general. The next month, Weitzel assumed command of XVIII Corps and led his troops in the capture of Fort Harrison, a key component of the defenses of Richmond. After his promotion to full major general of volunteers in November 1864, Weitzel took command of XXV Corps, composed of U.S. Colored Troops, and led them in a land assault on Fort Fisher, North Carolina in December. Though the attack failed miserably, blame fell not on Weitzel, but his commander Gen. Butler.<br> <br> In February 1865, Gen. Grant directed Weitzel to take command of all Union forces north of the Appomattox River. After the fall of Petersburg, Weitzel's troops entered the Confederate capitol of Richmond on April 3, 1865. He was subsequently sent to command the District of the Rio Grande and guard the border between Texas and Mexico. Weitzel mustered out of the volunteer service in March 1866. He resumed his duties with the Corps of Engineers, designing ships canals at Louisville and Sault Sainte Marie.</p>",

Teaching mathematics at West Point when war broke out, Warren helped form and lead the 5th New York Infantry.<br> <br> In the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Warren put his considerable skills as a civil engineer to work leading reconnaissance teams and developing maps for the Army of the Potomac's advance up the Virginia Peninsula. He commanded a brigade during the Seven Days' Battles. At the Battle of Malvern Hill, his troops stopped a division-sized Confederate force. Warren later led his brigade at the Battles of Second Manassas, Antietam and Fredericksburg. Based on his service at Malvern Hill, he received a promotion to brigadier general in September, 1862. Following Hooker's reorganization of the Army of the Potomac in February 1863, Warren was appointed chief topographical engineer, then chief engineer.<br> <br> Though commended for his service at Chancellorsville, Warren's greatest achievement in battle came at Gettysburg, when, on the second day of battle, he directed Union troops to seize Little Round Top on the far left end of the Federal line. Warren's quick action protected the exposed left flank of the Union army. Promoted to major general, Warren commanded II Corps and later V Corps. On April 1, 1865, Maj. Gen. Sheridan relieved him of his command for \"unskillful\" conduct during the Battle of Five Forks. After the war, Warren resumed his career in the Corps of Engineers. He sought, and finally received, a court of inquiry in 1879, which largely exonerated Warren's actions at Five Forks. Unfortunately, the court's findings were not published until after Warren's death.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Henry Clay was born in Hanover County, Virginia, on April 12, 1777. After his father died, his mother remarried and Clay moved to Richmond. Despite little formal education, his stepfather secured him a position with the clerk of the High Court of Chancery, where Clay displayed a great affinity for law. He began law studies in 1796 and, after finishing a year later, moved to Lexington, Kentucky where he earned a reputation as a skillful lawyer and a dynamic speaker. <br> <br> Clay entered politics as a state legislator in 1803 and exerted such influence that just three years later he was elected to serve out the last year of John Breckinridge's vacated U.S. Senate seat. From 1811 to 1821 and 1833 to 1825, Henry Clay served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and was Speaker of the House from 1811 to 1820. In 1820, Clay spearheaded the Missouri Compromise, which dealt with the expansion of slavery. Although himself a slaveholder, he was in favor of gradual emancipation. He served as Secretary of State under John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), though his appointment was tainted by charges of a \"corrupt bargain\" with Adams as a means of defeating Andrew Jackson.<br> <br> Returning to the Senate, Clay in 1833 brokered a deal of the Nullification Crisis, indicative of the growing conflict between interests in the North and South. In 1832 and 1844, Clay was the presidential nominee of the new Whig Party, though he was defeated both times. After losing the Whig Party nomination to Zachary Taylor in 1848, Clay decided to retire to his Ashland estate in Lexington, Kentucky. However, the very next year, he was returned to the Senate from Kentucky. During his term, with the addition of the lands acquired during the Mexican-American War, the controversy over the expansion of slavery into new territories had reemerged. <br> <br> Once again, Henry Clay, the \"Great Compromiser,\" drafted legislation to reduce the conflict between slave states of the South and the free states of the North; the Comprise of 1850 passed in September of 1850 and delayed secession and civil war for another 10 years. Henry Clay died in 1852, still serving his country and home state of Kentucky in the Senate and was the first person accorded the honor of lying in state at the United States Capitol.</p>",

But Henry Thomas Harrison's actions during the Civil War forever changed the course of history.<br> <br> Born in Nashville in 1832, the Confederate soldier joined the 12th Mississippi Infantry in May 1861. He was discharged the same year though and became a spy for Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon. After meeting General James Longstreet in April 1863, he then became a spy for him.<br> <br> Known only as \"Harrison\" for decades, the tips he provided (for which he was usually paid in gold), proved both reliable and invaluable, but the one for which he'll be forever famous was the one delivered on June 28, 1863. On that night, he shared with Longstreet the news that Federal forces were located around Frederick, Maryland and advancing north, as well as the information that Union General George Meade had replaced Joseph Hooker as commander of the Army of the Potomac.<br> <br> With Confederate troops being stretched thin along a wide swath of land in south central Pennsylvania, so alarmed was Longstreet by the news that he sent Harrison to relay it to General Robert E. Lee, who then made the decision to concentrate his troops at Gettysburg. The move prevented the Union from being able to take on smaller groups of the enemy, but it also resulted in the epic three-day Battle of Gettysburg, where over 50,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, captured or missing in action. <br> <br> After the war, Harrison moved his wife and daughter to Mexico, but left them in 1866 to go search for gold in Montana, disappearing for 25 years while his wife presumed him dead and remarried.<br> <br> He later worked as a detective in Cincinnati from 1901 to 1911 before moving to Covington, Kentucky, where he died in poverty 12 years later. Longstreet took Harrison's true identity to the grave and an application for a military pension in 1912 lists him only as a Confederate veteran.</p>",

He then furthered his education at the United States Military Academy, ranking third in his class of 31 upon his graduation in 1839.<br> <br> During the Mexican-American War Halleck spent several months in the West where, in addition to building fortifications in California and serving as lieutenant governor of the captured port of Mazatlán in Mexico, he translated Henri Jomini's Vie politique et militaire de Napoleon. Prior to the Civil War, he also lectured at the Lowell Institute, wrote Elements of Military Art and Science, and built San Francisco's first fireproof building.<br> <br> Despite having sympathies for the Confederacy, he was staunchly in favor of preserving the Union and became a U.S. Army major general in August 1861, after a recommendation from Union general Winfield Scott. The fourth highest ranking gneral in the Union army, Halleck was given command of the Department of the Missouri where he oversaw ealy Union operations, including the successes at Forts Henry and Donelson and the costly victory at Shiloh.<br> <br> He was considered a good general, with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman once calling him the \"directing genius\" of several Union victories. Despite his impressive skill in military strategy and logistics, however, Halleck was distant towards his subordinates, considered difficult to work with, and provided little control when it came to field operations. As such, President Lincoln once described him as \"little more than a first rate clerk.\" Following the Peninsula Campaign, Halleck was moved East and named General-in-Chief of all Union armies. In 1864, when Ulysses. S. Grant became General-in-Chief, Halleck was reassigned as chief of staff, where he was much more effective as an administrator. He served as pall-bearer for Abraham Lincoln, following the president's assassination in April 1865.<br> <br> After the war, he visited the newly purchased Alaska territory with photographer Eadweard Muybridge and is credited as one of the people to give the state (then called Russian America) its name. Halleck spent his last years assigned to the Military Division of the South, dying at his post in 1872.</p>",

He served in western Virginia and in Kentucky but he did not distinguish himself.

Disappointed with his standing in the Confederate army, he resigned in June 1862 but was reinstated. He resigned a second time in June 1863 to take a seat in the Confederate Congress where he remained until the end of the war.

After completing his education, McDowell served as a tactics instructor at the Academy before joining John E. Wool's staff in the Mexican War. By the outbreak of the Civil War, McDowell was a brigadier general and was given command of the Army of Northeastern Virginia despite a complete lack of experience commanding troops in the field.<br> <br> Troops under McDowell's command were defeated at the First Battle of Bull Run, resulting in the transfer of the leadership of the new Union army in Virginia, the Army of the Potomac, to General George McClellan. When the Army of the Potomac was divided into corps, McDowell oversaw I Corps, which defended Washington before serving valiantly at Cedar Mountain in 1862, an accomplishment that earned McDowell the regular army brevet of major general in 1865. As fate would have it, McDowell returned to lead his troops at the Second Battle of Bull Run later in 1862 and was held partially responsible for the disastrous Union defeat that ensued. Second Bull Run was the last combat command McDowell held in the Civil War.<br> <br> In July 1864, following a two-year hiatus, McDowell was chosen to lead the Department of the Pacific. In later years, he commanded the Department of California, the Fourth Military District (the military government for Arkansas and Louisiana during Reconstruction), and the Department of the West. In 1872, McDowell was promoted to permanent major general of Regulars in 1872. Following his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1882, McDowell served as Park Commissioner of San Francisco before his death in 1885.

            "bodyText": "<p>Growing up on the Connecticut shore, Isaac Chauncey had the sea in his lungs and began commanding ships as early as age 19. Joining the navy in 1798, Chauncey distinguished himself through leadership in the Quasi-War with France. He served on such notable vessels as <em>Constitution</em>, <em>Chesapeake</em>, and <em>President</em>, rising to the rank of master-commandant by 1804, and captain by 1806.</p><p>Chauncey’s new leadership role was tested as he served as commander of the New York Navy Yard from 1807 to 1812. But when war broke out, his expertise was needed elsewhere. In September 1812, Chauncey was given command at Lakes Erie and Ontario, put in charge of recruitment and construction of a fleet for the Lakes. He worked quickly and efficiently to grow a fleet.</p><p>Although his eye for logistics was keen, his successes as a commander were few. He successfully supported General Henry Dearborn’s amphibious April 1813 attack on York, but chafed at later repeated requests to use the naval fleet to serve as transport vessels. He proved not to be an aggressive leader in failed attacks on Sir James Lucas Yeo’s Royal Navy on Lake Ontario in 1813, and was outshined by his subordinate, Oliver Hazard Perry, in the Battle of Lake Erie.</p><p>But in spite of this lackluster tactical output, Chauncey shined as a practical leader who could build a fleet quickly and efficiently. The naval station at Sacket’s Harbor grew to be the largest and most productive under Chauncey’s eye.</p><p>He continued in this support role following the war as a member and eventually president of the Board of Navy Commissioners in Washington, D.C. He filled this position until his death in 1840.</p>",

Left behind, his daughters Louiza and Laura became the focus of a steadily increasing campaign of harassment and abuse. Then in December 1862, a detachment of U.S. cavalry that had escorted Murphy's daughters through the lines after a visit to their father was largely destroyed by a guerilla band. In a possible reaction to these events, members of Co. G of the 8th Missouri Cavalry (U.S.) executed nine Southern soldiers and civilian sympathizers, including Murphy's son-in-law and grandson-in-law. In the uproar that followed, two local colleges managed and supported by the Murphys were shuttered. <br> <br> In 1864, Murphy was elected Governor of Arkansas where, for the next four years, he struggled to navigate between a population evenly divided between unrepentant Confederates and impatient reconstructionists. He remained in office until 1868 when Arkansas ratified the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and was readmitted to the Union.</p>",

He was engaged and the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) and again at South Mountain.<br> <br> During the Battle of Antietam his First Division helped to attack the Confederate positions in the center of the Sunken Road in support of the Third Division of William H. French. <br> <br> Though they met stubborn resistance, between 12:30-1:00 p.m., Richardson and his men gained control of the high ground in front of the apex of the defensive line, which allowed his men to enfilade the remaining defenders in what would come to be known as \"Bloody Lane.\" Richardson's arrival proved to be the tipping point in helping to push the Confederate's out of the sunken road. He was unable to follow up this initial success with a continued advance, however. Even as he attempted to reorganize his men, direct the fire of his artillery, and bring up additional support, he was struck by a shell fragment and carried to the rear.<br> <br> Richardson was taken to a field hospital where his wound was deemed non- life threatening, and he was taken to a room in the Pry House, which was serving as George B. McClellan's headquarters. <br> <br> When President Lincoln came to visit the battlefield in October he paid his respects to the wounded Richardson. Shortly thereafter infection set in, followed by pneumonia, which claimed the life of the popular general on November 3, 1862.<br> <br> He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded on the fields of Antietam.</p>",

In 1839 he received his commission as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army and participated in the Aroostook War (a boundary dispute with Canada) and Mexican War prior to the Civil War. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Carleton was appointed colonel of the 1st California Infantry, and in 1862 lead the regiment on an epic march of 2,000 miles to recapture Federal forts and frontier settlements from the invading Confederates and sweep the enemy from Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas. Promoted to brigadier general after this success, Carleton served as commander of the Department of New Mexico for the remainder of the war, where his primary concern was with threats from the American Indians. Following the war, Carleton remained in the army, serving with the 4th U.S. Cavalry until his death in 1873.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Stuart's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>James Ewell Brown Stuart, often identified by his initials as \"Jeb\", was a man who came from an acclaimed military lineage. He put his breeding to good use in March 1862 when he was given command of all the cavalry brigades in what would soon become the Army of Northern Virginia. <br> <br> Soon after he took command of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee sent Stuart on a mission to perform reconnaissance to determine the vulnerability of the right flank of the Union army. On the morning of June 12 Stuart set out with 1,200 troopers and, upon determining that the flank was indeed vulnerable, took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the Union army. They returned to Lee's headquarters on July 15 after having ridden 150 miles, bringing with them 165 captured Union soldiers, 260 horses and mules, and various other supplies.<br> <br> Largely due to this success, combined with other effective raids, on July 25, 1862, early in the Northern Virginia Campaign, Stuart was promoted to major general and his command was officially upgraded to the Cavalry Division. <br> <br> Stuart continued raiding Federal positions following this promotion and was nearly captured during a raid on August 18. Though he managed to escape, he lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing Federals. The following day he launched a retaliatory raid at Catlett's Station, in which he managed to overrun Union army commander Major General John Pope's headquarters. Stuart not only captured Pope's full uniform (to make up for his own lost hat and cloak), but also intercepted orders which included valuable intelligence regarding the arrival of reinforcements for Pope's army from the Army of the Potomac.<br> <br> At the Second Battle Manassas (Bull Run) Stuart and his cavalry entered the fray following the massive assault by Longstreet's infantry, successfully protecting the Confederate flank and artillery positions. <br> <br> As the Union forces retreated Stuart ordered General Beverly Robertson's brigade to pursue the fleeing Federals. This brought on a sharp fight against Union General John Buford's brigade, which Stuart's troopers eventually pushed back across Lewis's Ford after capturing over 300 Union troopers. <br> <br> Stuart's men continued to harass the retreating Union columns until the campaign ended at the Battle of Chantilly. When the Army of Northern Virginia crossed the Potomac and launched the Maryland Campaign in September 1862, Stuart's cavalry successfully screened the army's movement north into Maryland, but failed to keep Lee fully abreast of the position and movements of the pursuing Army of the Potomac. For five days after crossing into Maryland, Stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians in Urbana. Although he filed reports, they made no reference to any intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols. <br> <br> This meant that when McClellan moved out of Washington and in pursuit of Lee much more rapidly than expected, the Confederate forces were unprepared to meet him. <br> <br> Stuart and his men were involved in the fighting at South Mountain and Antietam, but failed to achieve significant results at either battle. Misjudging the Union routes of advance and ignorant of the Union force threatening Turner's Gap, Stuart was saved by the timely arrival of the infantry of Gen. D.H. Hill in his efforts to defend the passes during the Battle of South Mountain. <br> <br> On the afternoon of September 17 at Antietam, \"Stonewall\" Jackson ordered Stuart to attempt to turn the Union flank, promising infantry support if Stuart was successful. Stuart began probing the Union lines, but was quickly answered by \"murderous\" counterbattery fire, and the cavalry movement intended by Jackson was never fully launched.<br> <br> Following the withdrawal of the Army of Northern Virginia back into Virginia, Stuart performed another circumnavigation of the Army of the Potomac: a total of 120 miles in less than 60 hours, riding from Leesburg, Virginia, as far north as Chambersburg and Mercersburg, Pennsylvania.<br> <br> Though demoralizing and embarrassing to the Union, this ride gained little military advantage. Jubal Early described it as \"the greatest horse stealing expedition\" which did little more than annoy the enemy. <br> <br> When McClellan finally pushed his army south, crossing the Potomac beginning on October 26, Lee sent Stuart to obstruct the movement. Stuart screened Longstreet's Corps as they advanced and his troopers engaged in skirmishes with both Union cavalry and infantry numerous times in early November near Mountville, Aldie, and Upperville.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A career U.S. Army officer and topographical engineer, James Harrison Wilson graduated from West Point near the top of his class in 1860. After the war the broke out, he served as topographical engineer for the Port Royal Expeditionary Force from September 1861 to March 1862. For his service at the Battle of Fort Pulaski, Wilson received a brevet promotion to major in the regular army. He then served as aide-de-camp to Major General George McClellan and topographical engineer to McClellan's Army of the Potomac from April 1862 through the Maryland Campaign. Wilson joined Major General Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee, serving as topographical engineer and inspector general during the Vicksburg Campaign. After being promoted to brigadier general of volunteers, he became chief engineer under Major General William T. Sherman.<br> <br> In early 1864, Wilson was assigned to lead the newly formed Cavalry Bureau in Washington, D.C. where he lobbied the War Department to equip the cavalry with fast-loading Spencer repeating carbines. Grant then promoted Wilson to brevet major general in May 1864, and assigned him to command Third Division in Major General Philip H. Sheridan's cavalry corps. He led his cavalry troops in both the Overland and Valley Campaigns of 1864. In October 1864, Grant promoted Wilson to major general of volunteers and assigned him to the Military Division of the Mississippi as commander of Sherman's cavalry corps. <br> <br> In March 1865, Wilson led a force of 13,500 troops in an invasion of Alabama whose objective was the strategically important Confederate arsenal at Selma. In the largest, and arguably most successful, cavalry raid of the war, Wilson led his disciplined troops 300 miles in 12 days and defeated General Nathan Bedford Forrest's Confederate troops at Ebenezer Church, Alabama, on April 1, 1865, and then again at Selma two days later. His forces captured Montgomery, Alabama's capital, on April 12th, followed by Columbus, Georgia, on the 20th. Wilson's Raid resulted in the capture over 7,000 combatants and 300 cannon. On May 10, 1865, his troops also captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which earned Wilson a promotion to major general in the regular army.<br> <br> After the war, Wilson reverted to the Regular Army rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was assigned to lead the 35th U.S. Infantry. He also managed engineering projects along the Mississippi River for the Army Corps of Engineers. After resigning from the Army in December 1870, Wilson worked as a railroad construction engineer and executive. In 1898, Wilson rejoined the Army, serving as a major general of volunteers in Puerto Rico and Cuba during the Spanish-American War. In 1900, he was sent to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion. The following year, Wilson retired with the rank of brigadier general in the Regular Army.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Gifford Pinchot was born to wealthy parents in Simsbury, Connecticut. His father, wallpaper merchant James Pinchot, and mother, daughter of one of New York’s wealthiest real estate developers, were devout Episcopalians. They were passionate about their son’s education. As a child, Gifford Pinchot was sent to a series of prominent schools, first attending boarding school at Phillips Exeter Academy and then entering Yale University. On his father’s recommendation, Pinchot then traveled to France to train at the French National School of Forestry. When he returned to the United States, he applied the skills he learned abroad to growing the forestry movement in the United States.<br /> <br /> Pinchot had a national and far-reaching idea of American forestry that recognized natural lands as interconnected. He advocated for this perspective, helping found the Yale School of Forestry and eventually being tapped by Teddy Roosevelt to serve as the first chief of the US Forest Service. Pinchot made major strides in this position. He moved many public lands into official federal custody and emphasized the government’s role in protecting these lands rather than giving them to private interests.<br /> <br /> As government interests shifted, Pinchot began to lose some of his political power. When William Howard Taft was elected in 1908, he dismissed Pinchot from his chief position. A great forest fire in 1910 also undermined Pinchot’s authority and sent the US Forest Service reeling as public lands burned across the American West, affecting 22 national forests across several states.<br /> <br /> This incident damaged Pinchot’s environmental career and led to his shift into the broader political sphere. Over the course of his life, Pinchot would run several times for public office, identifying as a member of the Progressive Party. He ran for governor of Pennsylvania in 1922 and succeeded. The course of his term was challenging, as his progressive values clashed with many power-players in the state. He retired after one term.<br /> <br /> After several unsuccessful attempts to become governor again, Pinchot served as governor again from 1931 to 1935. In 1934, he lost a bid for the US Senate and never returned to politics.<br /> <br /> Pinchot died in 1946 at age 81 from leukemia. He was survived by his wife Cornelia and his son, Gifford II. Grey Towers, the family’s summer house, is now preserved as a national historic site.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Minor White was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1908. He was an only child and spent much of his time with his grandparents. It was his grandfather, who was an amateur photographer, who gave White his first camera. However, he would not seriously focus on photography until later in his life. White would take a variety of images, including black and white landscapes of the locations he visited in national parks, that changed the field of photography.</p> <p>In 1927, White attended the University of Minnesota and majored in botany. He did not finish his degree the first time he attended college. He left college and became interested in poetry. White wrote about his struggles with his sexuality, notes about his photography, and thoughts about his life. When he re-entered college in 1932, he double majored in botany and poetry. By the time he graduated, White had lost interest in becoming a scientist, and instead focused his interests on the arts.</p> <p>White moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1937. He landed a job teaching photography to groups of students at the YMCA and, within a year, was offered a position at the Works Progress Administration. He primarily photographed old buildings in Portland. White was asked to teach photography at the La Grande Arts Center but left the position within a year to pursue his own photography. He photographed landscapes, buildings, and farms. In 1941, the Museum of Modern Art in New York accepted three of his images, which was the first time White’s photos were launched into the public eye.</p> <p>White’s photography took a pause when he was drafted into the Army in 1942. When he was discharged in 1945, White traveled to New York City, where he met Beaumont and Nancy Hall, photography curators for the Museum of Modern Art. He was offered a photography position and was heavily influenced by Newhall, another influential photographer.</p> <p>In 1946, White met a number of prominent photographers who influenced his work. Ansel Adams offered White a position at the California School of Fine Arts in the newly formed photography department. White accepted. During his time there, he continued to hone his skill with landscape photography. He was influenced by the landscapes of national parks and took many of his iconic photographs in parks. Ansel Adams was a major influence for his landscape photography as both traveled to national parks to photograph the natural beauty found there. White continued to struggle with his sexuality, which also heavily influenced his photography during this time. He created several series of photographs that reflected his emotional state.</p> <p>In 1952, White helped create Aperture magazine with several other prominent photographers of the time. The magazine depicted photographs and contained articles that were influential to the field of photography. White did not produce as many pictures during this time of his life, but he dabbled with color images for the first time in his career. From 1953 to 1957, White worked at the George Eastman House. He also taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology during this time.</p> <p>White moved to Boston in 1965 to teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He continued to share his knowledge with students while creating his own photography works. White continued to edit Aperture until 1970 and, in that same year, won a Guggenheim Fellowship. He continued to work hard on his photography and teaching, despite his declining health. He became more spiritual in his practices and in his photography. After a particularly grueling work schedule, White suffered from a heart attack. He continued his work until his death from a heart attack in 1976.</p> <p>Minor White’s philosophy on photography, his passion, drive, and focus makes him one of the most influential figures in photography. His work continues to inspire photographers to this day.</p>",

Less than a year later, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This was an executive order that freed enslaved African Americans in the southern states. Despite being free, Walker’s parents decided to stay and work on plantations around Spring Hill. After Walker’s former owner passed away, his son, Lt. William J.  Baytop, took over the plantation. Lt. Baytop and his wife never had children. They convinced Walker’s parents to let them keep him when he was a child. The Baytop’s treated Walker well, and named him after his father and South Carolina senator, John C. Calhoun. After a few years, Walker’s father sent for him and the Baytops returned him to his family.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-738407a1-3b49-2604-197c-f0587cf2f246\">T</b>he Walker family lived near Edge Hill and rented a two-bedroom shed and kitchen. Walker began working when he was ten doing odd jobs to help support his family. Though he wanted an education, Walker’s father told him at 10 years old he was too old to learn. By the time he was 13 he could neither read or write. He finally learned to read after a sunday school teacher gave him a spelling book called, “John’s Common Book.” Walker saved 92 cents and went to Hampton Institute to gain a higher education. However, his limited education and resources did not prepare him to pass the entrance exam.Though he was denied admission, Walker returned to the school to persuade General Samuel J. Armstrong, the school’s founder, to make an exception. Armstrong awarded Walker admission under two conditions. Walker had to be given work to do on campus during the day and attend classes at night.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-738407a1-3b49-2604-197c-f0587cf2f246\">B</b>y 1883, Walker was studying law. He did not make much progress until 1887. At that time he began studying under former Confederate General William B. Taliaferro. Taliferro granted Walker much needed access to law books in his private library. That same year, Walker was admitted to the Virginia Bar. From that point on, Walker worked to defend his fellow African Americans. He took on many cases of black men being falsely accused of sexually assaulting white women.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-738407a1-3b49-2604-197c-f0587cf2f246\">I</b>n 1891, at the age of 29, Walker entered politics. He was elected to the Gloucester County Board of Supervisors.  He was appointed Virginia’s first black Collector of Customs by President William McKinley in 1896. In 1934, President Roosevelt appointed Walker as the advisor and consultant of Negro affairs for the Virginia Emergency Relief Administration. This appointment earned him the nickname “Black Governor” of Virginia.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-738407a1-3b49-2604-197c-f0587cf2f246\">I</b>n addition to his career in law and politics, Walker was also interested in education.

            "bodyText": "Charles Lincoln Terry had a long military career that spanned the southwestern United States to Cuba and the Philippines. In a time when it was not easy to travel overseas, Terry was able to see the world.<br /> <br /> While Terry was stationed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">Bonita Canyon</a>, in Arizona Territory, he was a Private, but by the end of his career, he had spent more than fifteen years as a Trumpeter in various military bands.  Terry was among more than 60 soldiers who carved their names or initials into stone which composed a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">stone monument</a> to President Garfield. In the 1920s, these stones were incorporated into the fireplace at Faraway Ranch. Almost immediately after leaving Bonita Canyon, Terry and a few other soldiers were involved with capturing Chief Mangus, the last major Chiricahua Apache chief, on October 18, 1886. Terry received a commendation from Brigadier General N.A. Miles for “valuable service rendered in the capture.”<br /> <br /> During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/spanish-american-war-a-splendid-little-war.htm\">Spanish-American War</a>, Terry participated in the Battle of El Caney and San Juan Hill. Later he was with the Foreign Service and the 10th Cavalry, and then was stationed in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/the-philippine-insurrectiothe-philippine-war-a-conflict-of-consciencen-a-war-of-controversy.htm\">Philippines</a> with the 25th Infantry. In 1911 Terry was discharged for disability because of pulmonary emphysema incurred during line of duty— blowing on brass instruments. He spent 27 years in the military, and in 1919 Terry married Grace Clayton. He was 49 and she was 25, but they remained married until Terry’s death in 1951.<br /> <br /> In a letter to the Veteran’s Administration, Grace, Terry’s wife of 31 years, writes, “Years ago he had a barber shop he managed but was not able to work but a little himself. But he was a first class barber and taught four other men. I was always proud that he was willing to teach others what he knew. He was a good husband, but always had bad health.” <br /> <br /> Much of Terry's biographical information was first compiled in <em>Warriors of Color,</em> by Harold Ray Sayre.

            "bodyText": "<h3>Early Life</h3> John Franklin Casey’s military career was as fascinating as his personal life. Casey joined Troop H of the 10th Cavalry September 28, 1872, when he was around 20 years old. He stayed with Troop H for his entire military career, and was stationed primarily in Arizona and Texas, with forays into other southwestern states and transport duty by train, to Florida. Over his fifteen years of service, Casey reached the rank of First Sergeant, was demoted to Private (the lowest rank), and later regained his status of First Sergeant.<br /> <br /> According to Casey’s enlistment papers, his complexion was very fair. He was born into slavery in Missouri, and his mother had a very fair complexion, as well. His father was likely his master. His half-sister, Dilce Suggs, said “I know we had the same mother, she was part negro and part white and I have understood she may have had Indian blood in her too. Mother died at my birth, so I have understood since my childhood. Mother was called Ellen and she was a slave, owned by David Inyard (?).<br /> <br /> I believe mother had had a husband named Brown, I don’t know his given name or the name of his owner. He and mother had been owned by a man named Brown and he sold mother to Davis Inyard. I believe he was her last owner. I really don’t know whether John F. Casey and I had the same father, though I believe we did. Now I guess that is wrong. I believe John was born while mother was the slave of Mr. Brown and that his father was named Casey, a white man, I don’t know his given name, I am only telling what I heard from others when I was young.”<br /> <br /> According to Casey’s second wife’s son, Madison J. Evans, “[John Casey] claimed among the white folk here that he was a Spaniard, but to mother he admitted that he was partly of the colored race and partly of the white race. … both of my parents (Eliza Turner and her first husband) were mulatto’s.”<br /> <br /> Casey’s first wife, Pabla, was Mexican and they had two children, Mary and Frank; Mary died at a young age. In pension documents, officials raise a concern that this marriage, between a black soldier and a Mexican woman, might not have been legal at that time. In later court martial documents, the Army calls Pabla Casey’s “lawful wife.” They were married in Texas, in 1877 and separated by 1888. It seems they never were officially divorced, or if they were, those documents were lost by the 1920s. Both Casey and Pabla remarried. <h3> </h3> <h3>Military Career</h3> While Casey was stationed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/foda/index.htm\">Fort Davis</a>, in Texas, he was court martialed in 1885. First Sergeant Casey was accused of hunting with “public women” (“ladies of the night”) while he was married. His wife, Pabla, and their children lived within the garrison. Casey denied the charges, and despite a glowing recommendation from his captain, he was found guilty and “reduced to the Grade of a Private soldier and to forfeit to the United States (10) ten dollars per month of his pay for six (6) months.”<br /> <br /> In Casey’s court martial defense, Captain Charles Cooper said, “I have known him [John Casey] since I took the company, or since I have been at this post rather, since August, 1882, and for the last two years or eighteen months since I have been captain of the company his character has been good and excellent in every respect. Always proved to be a good, efficient soldier and was about one of the best men I had in my company, --was my First Sergeant.”<br /> <br /> By the time Casey arrived in Bonita Canyon in 1885, he had worked his way up to the rank of Corporal. Many of the soldiers stationed in Bonita Canyon, including Casey, carved their names or initals into stones which they assembled into a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">stone monument</a> to President Garfield. After Bonita Canyon (they left when Geronimo and Chief Naiche surrendered, in September 1886), Casey, Captain Cooper, and a few other men in Troop H captured Chief Mangus, the last major Chiricahua Apache chief. Casey was instrumental in negotiating a peaceful surrender. He translated English into Spanish, for Mangus’ mother, who then translated Spanish into the Chiricahua dialect of Apache, an Athabascan language. After Chief Mangus and his band surrendered, they, along with many other Chiricahua Apache, were transported by train to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/casa/learn/historyculture/apache-incarceration.htm\">Florida</a>. Casey and other men from Troop H guarded the prisoners on their journey, and later received promotions for their roles in ending the Apache Wars. <h3> </h3> <h3>Later Life</h3> Casey’s last enlistment ended in March, 1888 and he returned to Missouri, his home state. After Casey’s time in the Army, his primary occupation was barber, and many white men went to his barbershop, including his future wife’s son, Madison J. Evans. Casey married his second wife, Eliza Turner June 20, 1888, and they may have had a daughter together. They remained married until Eliza passed away April 28, 1905.<br /> <br /> Casey was his third wife’s third husband. Emma Louise Thomas was a white woman, also from Missouri. Because interracial marriage was illegal in Missouri until <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/388/1.html\">1967</a>, Emma and Casey were married in Kansas, although they continued to live in Missouri. In 1920 Emma and Casey moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, so that Casey could become a member of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/western-branch-leavenworth-kansas.htm\">National Military Home</a> there. Because of his small pension, Casey and Emma lived in a house near the Military Home, where Casey took his meals. They remained married until Casey died on August 11, 1924 at their house near the Leavenworth National Military Home.<br /> <br /> John Casey liked to claim his very first marriage (before Pabla) was to the notorious Belle Starr, also from Missouri. The pension officials took his claim seriously and looked into it, although his half-sister Dilce Suggs told them, “his besetting sin was to tell tall tales, based upon his own imagination, exaggerated about a great many things, though he was honest in his business and was very kind-hearted.” The pension officials never found any support that Casey was married to Belle Starr, but it was a tall tale he told quite a few people throughout his life.<br /> <br /> Much of what is known about John Casey and other Buffalo Soldiers stationed at Bonita Canyon is gleaned from enlistments, court documents, and other official records. Some of his biographical information was first compiled in <em>Warriors of Color</em>, by Harold Ray Sayre.

            "bodyText": "Ralph Bunche (1904-1971) was the first African American to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. Bunche received the 1950 prize for his late 1940s work for mediation in Israel. He is also an American political scientist, academic, and diplomat. Dr. Bunche is an American Hero.<br /> <br /> Bunche was born in Detroit Michigan in 1904. His father, Fred, was a barber and his mother, Olive Agnes, was an amateur musician. Before moving to Toledo, Ohio, Bunche was baptized at the Second Baptist Church. The family returned to Detroit after his sister Grace was born in 1909 with the help of their maternal aunt, Ethel Johnson. Fred Johnson did not live with the family after they returned from Ohio, and was not a good provider for the family. Following the declining health of his mother and uncle, Bunche moved with his maternal grandmother, Lucy, to Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1915. Olive, his mother, died in 1917 and his uncle committed suicide just three months later. In 1918, Bunche, his sister, and his grandmother moved to Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Bunche was a brilliant student, having graduated the valedictorian of his class at Jefferson High School. He then attended University of California, Los Angeles and graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1927. Again he was the valedictorian of his class. Bunche completed his graduate work at Harvard University, where he earned his master's degree and doctorate in political science. Before he completed his doctorate, Bunche had started teaching at Howard University. In 1934, Bunche became the first African American to gain a PhD in political science from an American University. He published his first book, <em>World View of Race</em>, in 1936 before conducting his postdoctoral research in anthropology at the London School of Economics and the University of Cape Town.<br /> <br /> During the World War II years, Bunche worked at the Office of Strategic Services, which was the precursor to the CIA, as a senior social analyst on Colonial Affairs. Alger Hiss appointed Bunche to Associate Chief of the Division of Dependent Area Affairs in 1943 after he was transferred to the State Department. While at the State Department, Bunche participated in the preliminary planning for the United Nations at the San Francisco Conference in 1945. The year before he participated in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington,D.C. were he served as an adviser to the U.S.. delegation for the 1945 conference. Bunche, along with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, were considered instrumental in the creation and adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br /> <br /> In 1947, Bunche served as the assistant to the United Nation Special Committee on Palestine. In his effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict in Palestine, Bunche traveled to the Middle East as the chief aide to Sweden's Count Folke Bernadotte. Bernadotte had been appointed by the U.N. to mediate the conflict. In September 1948, Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem by members of the underground Jewish Lehi group, led by Yitzhak Shamir. Following Bernadotte's death, Bunche became the U.N.'s chief mediator. In 1950, Bunche was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for achieving the 1949 Armistice Agreements. <br /> <br /> In 1953, Bunched moved to the Kew Gardens neighborhood in Queens, New York after buying a home with the Nobel Prize money. Bunched lived there with his wife, Ruth, who was one of his students at Howard, and their children: Joan Harris (b. 1931); Jane Johnson (b.1933); and Ralph Jr. (born 1943).<br /> <br /> Bunche resigned from the United Nations due to ill-health. He passed away on December 9, 1971 from complications related to diabetes. He was survived by his wife Ruth, daughter Joan, son Ralph, and three grandchildren. It is believed that his daughter Jane committed suicide after jumping from the roof of her Bronx apartment building. She left no note.<br /> <br /> Ralph Bunche is associated with several properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places:<br /> <br /> The <strong>Ralph Bunche Peace & Heritage Center</strong> is located within his boyhood home in South Los Angeles.

Though she claimed to be from Detroit, early records show she may have been born in Pinehurst, Georgia. Her birth certificate has not been located.  Most accounts show that Shabazz’s mother abused her, and she was taken by Lorenzo and Helen Malloy when she was 11. Malloy was a prominent business man, while his wife was a founding member of the Housewives League of Detroit. This was a group of African American women who organized campaigns to support black-owned businesses and boycott stores that refused to hire black employees. Helen Malloy was also a member of the National Council of Negro Women and the NAACP.

In a 1995 issue of Ebony Magazine, Shabazz wrote:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-43cf0161-2052-397d-37bf-27b62a288739\">“R</b>ace relations were not discussed and it was hoped that by denying the existence of race problems, the problems would go away.

There she encountered extreme racism as she settled into life in the Jim Crow South. Shocked and frustrated, she left Alabama to attend the Brooklyn State College of Nursing in New York in 1953. During her second year, she was invited to a dinner party at the Nation of Islam temple in Harlem. Though she declined to join the organization at that time, it was there that she met Malcolm X.  Shabazz began attending Malcolm’s services and in 1956 converted to Islam, changing her surname to X. The X represented the loss of her African ancestry.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-43cf0161-2052-397d-37bf-27b62a288739\">M</b>alcolm and Betty were married on January 14, 1958 in Michigan. Together the couple eventually had six daughters. They left the Nation of Islam in 1964, changed their surname to Shabazz, and became Sunni Muslims. A year later, Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21 while giving a speech in New York City. Betty and one of her daughters looked on as angry onlookers caught and beat one of the assassins. Witnesses helped identify two more suspects, all of whom were members of the Nation of Islam.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-43cf0161-2052-397d-37bf-27b62a288739\">S</b>habazz never remarried.

Though she never challenged white supremacy like Malcolm X, she fought for education and human rights causes in her own style. Shabazz earned her Master’s in Public Health Administration in 1970. After she earned her doctorate in higher-education administration at the University of Massachusetts. Shabazz accepted a position as an associate professor of health sciences at Medgar Evers College, in New York in 1976.

He became the first African American performer to host a variety TV. series in 1956. For his contributions as a musician and vocalist, Nat King Cole is an American Hero.<br /> <br /> Cole was born on March 17, 1919 in Montgomery, Alabama. Around the age of four, Cole began learning to play the piano from his mother, who was a church choir director. His father was a Baptist pastor. By his early teens, Cole received formal classical piano training. He eventually abandoned classical music for jazz. Earl Hines, a leader of modern jazz, was one of his biggest inspirations. At 15, Cole decided to drop out of school to become a jazz pianist full time. After joining forces with his brother Eddies, Cole produced his first professional recording in 1936. He later joined a national tour for the musical revue <em>Shuffle Along.</em><br /> <br /> That same year, Cole married Nadine Robinson, who he later divorced in 1948. Soon after he met his second wife, singer Maria Hawkins Ellington the couple had five children, three biological children: Natalie, Casey, and Timolin, and two adopted children, Carol and Nat Kelly.<br /> <br /> In 1937, Cole put together the King Cole Trio, who toured extensively and landed on the charts in 1943 with \"That Ain't Right\". Another song penned by Cole, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" was inspired by one of his father's sermons and began another hit for the group in 1944. The King Cole Trio continued rising to the top with hits such as the \"Christmas Song\" and \"(I love You) For Sentimental Reasons.\" <br /> <br /> By the 50s, Cole emerged as a solo performer. He had several hits, including \"Nature Boy,\" \"Mona Lisa,\" \"Too Young,\" and \"Unforgettable.\" He worked with some of the country's most popular talents, including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nelson Riddle. Cole also became good friends with Frank Sinatra.As an African American performer, he struggled to find his place in the Civil Rights Movement. He encountered racism firsthand, especially while touring in the South. Cole was attacked by white supremacists during a integrated performance in Alabama. African Americans, on the other hand, rebuked him for his unsupportive comments about racial integration he made after the show. Cole claimed that he was an entertainer, not an activist.<br /> <br /> Despite his controversial comments. Nat King Cole made television history in 1956. He became the first African American performer to host a variety TV series,<em> The Nat King Cole Show.</em> The show featured many contemporary performers, including Count Basie, Peggy Lee, Sammy Davis Jr., and Tony Bennett. The show went off air in 1957, which Cole blamed on the lack of a national sponsor. No company seemed willing to back a program that featured African American performers. Despite not having his own show, Cole continued his presence on TV. He appeared on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em> and <em>The Garry Moore Show. </em>Cole also appeared on the big screen. He started off in small roles in the 1940s by playing some version of himself. He appeared in<em> Instanbul (1957) </em>and <em>China Gate (1957). </em>His only major starring role was i<em>n St. Louis Blues</em> which aired in 1958. Cole starred alongside Eartha Kitt and Cab Calloway. His final film was<em> Cat Ballou, </em>which he starred in with Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin in 1965.<br /> <br /> In 1964, Cole discovered he had lung cancer. He passed away just months later on February 15, 1965. He was 45 years old. His music continues to live on. His rendition of The Christmas Song has become a holiday classic and many of his other songs have been frequently selected for film and television soundtracks. Of the five children, only Natalie pursued a career in music. In 1991, she helped give her father a posthumous hit when she combined their vocals together in a duet for \"Unforgettable.\"<br /> <br /> Nat King Cole is associated with the Historic Resources Associated with African Americans in L.A.Multi-Property Submission (MPS). It was approved and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 2009.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Franklin G. Lowell was born around 1848 in West Bath, Maine. His father died before he was five years old and by age 11, Frank was apprenticed to his mother’s brother, a ship builder. He grew up among ship builders and sea captains, leaving Maine with an uncle when he was about 15 years old. They sailed around Cape Horn, came through San Francisco, and arrived in Sitka between 1867 and 1868. We know that Frank arrived first in Sitka, Alaska through interviews with Frank’s daughter, Eva Lowell Revell Simons. Sitka was also the place where most ships coming up from California entered the new territory. Eva says her father first married an Aleut woman and they had a son. One year later, he moved west to the Kenai Peninsula at English Bay, present day Nanwalek, where he married Mary Forgal Lowell.</p> <p>Like most sourdoughs, Frank had his hand in many enterprises: taking the census, selling salted salmon, and setting up trading posts. He outfitted Native parties who hunted fur-bearing mammals in return for their supplies and other European goods. With the drop in fur prices, the eruption of Mt. Augustine in 1883, and the economic conditions in the villages along Cook Inlet, Frank and Mary, along with several Native families, moved to the shores of Resurrection Bay. For Frank, it was a short but prosperous period living in the present day area of Seward. Eva tells us Frank had a trading post affiliated with the Alaska Commercial Company, buying fur from Native hunters and selling dried goods. She says the family had several houses in the vicinity, including a cabin beyond Lowell Point, their home on the waterfront, and several other small out-buildings as far inland as Bear Lake.</p> <p>It is not clear exactly when Frank began working directly for the Alaska Commercial Company, but in 1889 he became the new agent for the Wrangell station on the outer coast of the Alaska Peninsula. As an agent for the Alaska Commercial Company and a private entrepreneur, Frank Lowell employed Alutiiq Natives to hunt sea otters and other fur-bearing mammals (black bear, fox, marten, mink, and river otter) on the outer coast of what is now Kenai Fjords National Park. The story of Frank Lowell’s outpostsand stores are integral to the park’s cultural history in Aialik Bay. His crews hunted and set up winter camps along the coast between English and Resurrection bays, including Aialik Bay and Nuka Bay.</p> <p>Eva tells us her father operated a trading post from Resurrection Bay until 1892. Perhaps Frank traveled between the two sites, providing for his family as the fur trade declined after years of over hunting. Frank was the Alaska Commercial Company agent for the Wrangell fur trading station until 1898, a year when no sea otters were taken. The station could not pay expenses and the Alaska Commercial Company halted all credit to Native hunters.</p> <p>Eva Lowell says her mother, Mary Forgal, refused to leave Resurrection Bay when Frank left the Alaska Commercial Company in the Cook Inlet area. From Alaska Commercial Company records, we know that Frank continued to send supplies to Resurrection Bay, paying for the supplies with fur traded to the company. Frank and Mary’s older children ran trap lines, hunted, and fished. In 1903, with her children almost grown, Mary sold her homestead rights to Frank Ballaine, who’s brother John was the future founder of Seward.</p> <p>On August 26, 1895, Frank married Aralena Koshon and they eventually had four children together. Their oldest daughter, Anna, married Benny Benson’s father. Benny was the Alutiiq orphan boy who designed the Alaska state flag.</p> <p>In 1910, census records identify Frank living on Chirikof Island fox farming. The same census records his daughters, Anna and Emma, living in the Herman Orphanage of Kodiak. It is assumed his wife, Aralena Koshon, died in the measles epidemic that swept through Native villages, including Port Wrangell, before the census was taken. Eva visited her father on Chirikof Island in 1912 just after the eruption of the Katmai Volcano. Shortly after her visit, Frank began blue fox farming with John Benson. Frank died at Chignik in 1923. His obituary mentions that three daughters and three sons survived him.</p>",

The slave quarters where Hannah lived was one mile west of the village of Appomattox Court House. Federal troops camped in the vicinity of the Coleman home the night of April 8, 1865. The closeness of the soldiers prompted the family to leave for a relative’s home a few miles away. Hannah remained behind at the house and soon found herself surrounded by fighting. <h4><strong>Tragedy Strikes</strong></h4> At one point on April 9th, Hannah was near a door when a solid shot passed through the house. The shot struck Hannah, leaving her wounded in the arm.  A surgeon from a nearby Maine regiment saw to her wound and she lingered for three days. On April 12, 1865, Hannah died from her wound. Her death made Hannah the only known civilian killed in the fighting at Appomattox. ",

            "bodyText": "John Brown was born May 9, 1800 in Torrington, Connecticut. Soon after Brown’s birth, the family moved to Hudson, Ohio. As a youth he saw an enslaved boy, with whom he had become friends, badly beaten and harshly treated. This and his religious belief that slavery was a sin against God influenced his thoughts and actions throughout his life. <br /> <br /> In 1816 he traveled east to study for the ministry but an inflammation of the eyes and a lack of funds forced him to give up this calling. He returned to Ohio and took up his father’s trade of tanning leather. In 1820 he married Dianthe Lusk. She gave birth to seven children, five of whom lived to maturity. In 1826 he moved his family to Richmond, Pennsylvania, built a tannery (with a secret room to hide escaping slaves), organized a church, and served as postmaster to the community. Dianthe died in 1832 and the following year he married Mary Ann Day. She bore thirteen children but only six lived to maturity. <br /> <br /> In the ensuing years between 1835 and 1846, Brown pursued various occupations; farmer, tanner, surveyor and real estate speculator. In 1846, he formed a partnership in a wool business known as Perkins and Brown. The firm opened a warehouse in Springfield, Massachusetts, and Brown soon moved his family there. <br /> <br /> At this time, he heard of the abolitionist Gerrit Smith of Peterboro, New York. Smith had opened up thousands of acres of land in New York State for the express purpose of giving the land to African American farmers. Much of this land was in the untamed Adirondack wilderness. In spite of many hardships, families came to this colony Brown called “Timbukto.” Brown wanted to join this venture and bought 244 acres at $1.00 per acre. In 1849 Brown moved his family there, to North Elba, New York. He surveyed his neighbors’ land, showed them how to clear their land, build cabins, and become self-sufficient. <br /> Brown also continued to cultivate his interest in the wool business. He sailed for London to establish an English market for Perkins and Brown. His plan failed, forcing him to return to Ohio in 1851 and work off his debts to his partner. He eventually returned to North Elba, but his unceasing interest in the anti-slavery movement soon compelled him to go to Kansas. <br /> <br /> Several members of his family were settling in the territory and they were in desperate need of assistance. The Kansas-Nebraska Act had created a battleground over the spread of slavery. Brown went there to help his family and strike a blow for freedom. His participation in the violence and bloodshed in Kansas resulted in the second most controversial period of his life. Brown was convinced that a bold strike at the heart of slavery would do more than fighting slavery on the plains of Kansas. He laid the groundwork for his final campaign at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). <br /> <br /> On the night of October 16, 1859, John Brown and 21 followers captured the U.S. Armory, Arsenal and Rifle Factory at Harpers Ferry. He called it a “trumpet blast” that would lead to an extended mountain campaign in the slave states and make “property in slaves insecure.” Brown’s so-called raid only lasted 36 hours. He underestimated how quickly white people would rise up to put down what they saw as insurrection. Ten of Brown’s men were killed and five escaped.<br /> <br /> Brown was captured on October 18, 1859, by a detachment of U.S. Marines under the command of Army Colonel Robert E. Lee. Brown and six of his men were imprisoned in nearby Charles Town. Virginia seized the opportunity to try “the insurgents.” Brown was soon found guilty of treason against Virginia, conspiring with slaves to rebel and murder. He was hanged on December 2, 1859. <br /> <br /> John Brown’s last written words on the day of his execution predicted the Civil War. “I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much blood shed it might be done.” ",

At the beginning of the Civil War, Dr. Mayo attempted to obtain an appointment as a regimental surgeon in Minnesota but was rejected.<br /> <br /> For this reason, when the U.S. Dakota War erupted on the Minnesota frontier in August 1862, he was available to accompany an expedition from LeSueur and St. Peter to relieve the besieged town of New Ulm. There, Dr. Mayo and several other physicians established emergency hospitals to care for the refugees and wounded. In 1863, Dr. Mayo was appointed examining surgeon of the draft enrollment board in Rochester, Minnesota. He fared well there and so moved his family to Rochester from LeSueur the following year. He quickly established himself as a Rochester community leader.<br /> <br /> In 1883, in the wake of a tornado that devastated Rochester, Dr. Mayo came into contact with Mother Alfred Moes of the Sisters of St. Francis who eventually persuaded him help her establish a new hospital under her direction. With Dr. Mayo and his two physician sons as the hospital's only professional staff, this new institution was inaugurated in 1889 as St. Marys Hospital. By 1919, St. Marys Hospital had evolved into the Mayo Clinic, today one of America's most distinguished hospitals.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A Private in Company H, First Tennessee Infantry, Sam R. Watkins is today one of the most well-known common soldiers in Civil War history.Despite his low rank, Watkins has found immortality through his 1882 memoir Company Aytch.<br /> <br /> Born in Maury County, Tennessee, south of Nashville in 1840, Watkins rushed to enlist in the army when Tennessee left the union in 1861.His unit had served in the mountains of Western Virginia during the brutal winter of 1861-62, and received its baptism of fire at Shiloh that April.Two of the First's sternest tests had come in late 1862 at Perryville, Kentucky in October and at Murfreesboro, Tennessee – only miles from Sam's home – on the last day of the year.Watkins and the First Tennessee fought on both days at Chickamauga, and his account of the chaos in the woods along Brotherton Road on September 19th stands as one of the best accounts of the battle by any participant.<br /> <br /> The First Tennessee continued its hard service in the Army of Tennessee through the end of the war, and Watkins recorded his and his comrade's wartime experience for posterity two decades later with his wildly successful memoir.Filmmaker Ken Burns gave Watkins' fame a boost when he used selections from Company Aytch in the popular Civil War documentary (1990).<br /> <br /> As enduring a piece of Civil War literature as Company Aytch has been, though, it is not without its limitations.In framing his war narrative, Watkins was careful to exclude any significant discussion of the war's causes and its continuing effects on the Middle Tennessee society in which he lived.The absence of slavery from the memoir is staggering, particularly considering Watkins' background.Census and tax records of antebellum Maury County show that Sam's father, Frederick, owned more than 100 enslaved African Americans on two plantations in the county.The Watkins family was the third wealthiest in one of the most prosperous counties in the state.Incredibly, Watkins was not an outlier in his company.Nearly half of the company with which he left Maury County in 1861 came from slaveowning households.<br /> <br /> Nor was the issue of slavery left at home in Tennessee.As many as fifty African American servants were brought into the field to serve the privileged soldiers of the First, Watkins brought a slave of his own, a man named Sanker. As constant a presence as these enslaved men were in the unit, however, Watkins never acknowledged them in the pages of his memoir, effectively purging slavery from his account of the war.Watkins's memoir is a case study in the processes of both remembering and forgetting that help shape what we teach, think, and believe about the Civil War – and a great read as well.</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p><br /> Blight, David W.

            "bodyText": "Mark Thrash was rumored to be over 120 years old by the time he died in December 1943. Much about his early life is unknown. He claimed to have been born on Christmas Day in 1820, enslaved by a man named Christopher Thrash. The Thrashes moved to Meriwether County Georgia sometime before the Civil War. Like many African Americans in the 1800s, there is little documentary evidence of his live in slavery or immediately after it. By 1900, Mark was living in rural northwest Georgia and employed by United States government as a laborer in the recently established Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. <br /> <br /> He lived in a small cabin just downhill from the site of General Rosecrans' headquarters on Dyer Field. Over the years, stories of his age began to spread, and by the 1930s he was somewhat of a celebrity. People would come from all around to hear Mark Thrash tell stories about his life. He claimed to have been a servant to a soldier in the Confederate Army, and taken prisoner twice. He claimed to have served both General Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, met Abraham Lincoln, and frequently wore a coat that he said had been a gift from General Grant. He was said to have been put to work burying the dead at the Battle of Chickamauga along with his son, Chris, who was a body servant to Lt. Elmo Thrash. However, service records indicate that Elmo Thrash had only been a private in a state guard unit for a few months in late 1863 and early 1864. Almost everything about Mark Thrash's life is shrouded in mystery and memory.  <br /> <br /> Known to the local white community as \"Uncle Mark,\" Thrash would enthrall visitors for hours. It is unknown how much of his life's story was fictional or fact. Census records in 1870 and 1880 show a \"Doc Thrash\" (Thrash was sometimes known as \"Doc\") living near Griffin Georgia - only about thirty miles from the home of the Thrash family that had enslaved Mark. Both of these census records indicate Thrash may have been born in 1840. However, it is impossible to positively identify this as the Mark Thrash of Chickamauga Battlefield. Much of the 1890 Census was largely destroyed, and the 1900 Census shows Mark Thrash living in Chickamauga and giving his date of birth as 1822. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how old he really was, or how many of his public stories were true, Mark Thrash was an icon of the early years of the park. People would travel from miles around to hear him tell stories. National media ran coverage of him, declaring Thrash the nation's oldest pensioner. In the end, it is somewhat irrelevant how many of his stories are true. Thash's carefully crafted public image of \"Uncle Mark\" was a means by which he could not only survive, but thrive in an era in which African Americans were considered second class citizens. And in doing so, he promoted the preservation of this park, and inspired people to care about this place. Even now, decades after his death in 1943, visitors will often share with park staff stories of meeting Mark Thrash when they were younger, and how he inspired them to learn about the battle.  ",

            "bodyText": "Hubbard Pryor was enslaved from birth near Rome, Georgia. At some point after the Union Army captured Chattanooga in November 1863, Pryor escaped and made his way to Chattanooga. On April 7, he enlisted in the 44th United States Colored Troops, one of several regiments of USCTs being organized in the city. In October 1864, Pryor was taken prisoner near Dalton, but the Confederates refused to consider black soldiers as prisoners of war. The captured men of the 44th USCT were rounded up into a pen where local farmers could claim them as lost property. Those who went unclaimed were forced into labor by the Confederate Army. Pryor spent the rest of the Civil War back in slavery. But he survived. He lived in Georgia, and reportedly moved to Texas, where he died in 1890. <br /> <br /> However, Pryor is most known for his photograph. Around the time he arrived in Chattanooga, a photographer captured an image of Hubbard Pryor in the tattered clothes of an enslaved man. Some time later, the photographer took Pryor's photo in the uniform of a United States soldier. The images were widely reprinted to not only recruit black men into the ranks, but also to show the northern public the transformative power of the war.<br /> <br /> The abolitionist Fredick Douglass had said \"Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letter, U.S., let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, there is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship.\" Hubbard Pryor and his famous photograph illustrate the power and truth of Douglass' words, and the struggle for emancipation and citizenship. ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Zachary Taylor was still an infant when his family left Virginia and moved to Louisville, KY. Young Zachary grew up on his family’s plantation and eventually joined the Kentucky militia. In 1808, Zachary Taylor began his long career in the U.S. Army, serving in the 7th Infantry Regiment.</p> <p>The future general steadily rose through the ranks. Taylor served in the War of 1812, Black Hawk War, and the Second Seminole War. Taylor gained the rank of Commander of the Second Department of the Army's Western Division after his service in Florida. As annexation of Texas pressed forward, tensions with Mexico increased. In preparation of the impending conflict, Taylor took command of a U.S. garrison at Fort Jesup, Louisiana.</p> <p>Known as “Old Rough and Ready”, Zachary Taylor was a seasoned U.S. Army veteran by the time he led his men into Texas. Taylor’s Army of Occupation encamped at Corpus Christi and then moved on to the banks of the Rio Grande. After some posturing by the U.S. and Mexican armies along the river banks, Taylor’s army would hold their own against General Arista's force on the prairie of Palo Alto. Taylor would go on to defeat the Mexican general the following day at Resaca de la Palma.</p> <p>The veteran U.S. general would continue his push into northern Mexico. He clashed with the Mexican army at Monterrey and captured the city after taking heavy losses. He would then battle the mercurial Antonio López de Santa Anna at Buena Vista and secure a victory there even though he was badly outnumbered.</p> <p>Zachary Taylor returned to the U.S. a war hero and rode the wave of popularity all the way to the White House. The 1848 election pitted Taylor against the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass. Taylor’s military service and his slaveholder status appealed to both northern and southern voters.</p> <p>Although he ran as a Whig candidate, Taylor did not commit firmly to party politics. Some northerners were not pleased with the choice of Taylor and Cass. They were opposed to the extension of slavery to territories gained in the U.S.-Mexican War and created third party in opposition, the Free Soil Party. The new party pulled enough votes from Cass to elect Taylor the 12th President of the United States.</p> <p>Sadly for Taylor, his term in office would be cut short. President Taylor became violently ill with a stomach ailment after attending Fourth of July celebrations on the future grounds of the Washington Monument.</p> <p>While at the event, Taylor consumed large quantities of cherries and iced milk. His exact cause of death is still debated. Some believe it was a bout of severe gastroenteritis, while others believe it was cholera. President Zachary Taylor died on July 9, 1850.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>His name will always be synonymous with the victory over HMS <em>Java,</em> or the capture of USS <em>Philadelphia</em> but Commodore William Bainbridge was more than just a sea captain. With a fledgling nation, and an even more fledgling navy, Bainbridge converted the struggling Charlestown Navy Yard into an effective, operating machine of war. He was given this task just before \"America's Second Revolution\"- the War of 1812- broke out. In a time when many Americans associated a standing navy with tyranny, Bainbridge fought the odds and made the Charlestown Navy Yard into one of the greatest in the land.</p> <p>Bainbridge was given the opportunity when the previous commandant, Samuel Nicholson, suddenly died. Nicholson was described as a \"weak and ineffective commandant\" (frequently by Bainbridge himself in more colorful terms) and the overall quality of the Charlestown Navy Yard suffered under his leadership. Over the course of his eleven years in charge, no ships had been built though a few were upgraded or converted. Nicholson had allowed those below him to call the shots in the yard. Disagreements between the Army and Navy were decided by capitulation to the Army. In fact, he had rendered the position so ineffective that upon his death, the Navy Department decided to fill other lower positions in the Charlestown Navy Yard first.</p> <p>William Bainbridge to that point had had a fairly checkered career himself. He had made a name for himself as a bold sea captain after fighting off a privateer ship. After being slighted by the British navy, he boarded HMS <em>Indefatigable</em> and impressed a sailor in retaliation. For this he earned a reputation of being fearless in battle, but also excessively strong-willed. However, he did give up his ship, USS <em>Retaliation</em>, to two French frigates without putting up a fight, and in 1803 he ran USS <em>Philadelphia</em> aground off the coast of Tripoli. He and his men were imprisoned in Tripoli for nineteen months following his action. Upon his return, the Navy Department thought it best to keep him off American ships for a while. Needing money, he returned to captaining merchant vessels.</p> <p>By the beginning of 1812 war with Britain seemed imminent, and Paul Hamilton, Secretary of the Navy, made Bainbridge Commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard. He officially took over duties on April 12, 1812. The first tasks given to him were to repair USS <em>John Adams</em> and USS <em>Chesapeake</em>. Both of these ships were rotting in Boston Harbor (the <em>Chesapeake</em> since 1809!), but war seemed on the horizon and every ship was needed. With the state of the navy yard, fixing the ships would be difficult. Timber was just sitting in the yard and had rotted out so much that it was of no use. Perhaps worse was that the navy yard didn't even have a wharf on which to fix the ships. Like his predecessor, he would have to rent private wharf space along Boston Harbor if he wanted to fix the vessels. Before he could fix the ships, Bainbridge had to upgrade the yard.</p> <p>Perhaps what he found most astonishing was how many liberties the previous Commandant and Secretary of the Navy had granted the Army. As an example, the Charlestown Navy Yard had a magazine for joint use of the Navy and Army. However, the war department was able to push the Navy completely out forcing the Navy to rent a facility <em>inland</em> that cost the Department of the Navy up to $700 in rent a year. a fence, built to separate the War Department's and Navy Department's sections, was badly in need of repair and allowed easy access for Army personal to trespass into the Charlestown Navy Yard.</p> <p>Bainbridge was at a stalemate - he needed to repair ships but had no wharf to repair them, his navy yard was not functioning at capacity, and the Army had pushed the Navy out of some of its own facilities. With the outbreak of the War of 1812, Bainbridge started petitioning the Secretary of the Navy in order to be given command of a vessel. He probably felt hopeless in his current position. However, Bainbridge was not a man to let adversity get the best of him and he started making changes in the yard - with or without official approval. The bull-headedness that he displayed in his early career reappeared in Charlestown.</p> <p>First, he had to do something about the Army-Navy relationship. His course of action was simple - he took the timbers too rotten to be put on USS <em>Chesapeake</em> and used them to repair the fence to help keep the Army out. Bainbridge was also able to establish that the powder magazine in the Charlestown Navy Yard should belong to the Navy and the Navy alone. While the Secretaries of the Army and Navy would argue back and forth over these issues, Bainbridge just took it upon himself to act.</p> <p>On June 1, 1812, Congress declared war on Britain which started the War of 1812. On September 15, 1812, Bainbridge took command of USS <em>Constitution</em>. On December 29, 1812 under Bainbridge's command, USS <em>Constitution</em> defeated (and ultimately destroyed) HMS <em>Java</em> off the coast of Brazil. The wounded Bainbridge returned to Boston a hero and was made Commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard again. Bainbridge took the job on the condition that he would be allowed to captain the newest vessel built there- the 74 gun, monolith ship-of-the-line, USS <em>Independence</em>.</p> <p>It appears as though being a hero gave Bainbridge more clout with the higher-ups. By April, 1813, Bainbridge was able to bother the Navy Department enough where they could see that a wharf was necessary in the Charlestown Navy Yard, provided it cost less than $28,000. Built alongside would be a Navy Store (known in the Navy Yard as Building 5). Despite complaints from his superiors, Bainbridge ignored the price limit and built a wharf to his specifications. Building 5 still stands today, serving as one of Boston National Historical Park's visitor centers.</p> <p>Recognizing Boston's cold weather, Bainbridge had shiphouses built in the Charlestown Navy Yard and thus allowed the workers to complete vessels without being exposed to the harsh New England elements and extreme weather. Weather frequently prevented exposed workers from getting anything done in the Navy Yard, yet they demanded half-pay for these days (just as they would have received under Nicholson). By building shiphouses to cover the area where ships were being built, workers could complete their task unhindered, and saved the navy money for days when work could not be accomplished.</p> <p>By the end of Bainbridge's term, the Charlestown Navy Yard had shiphouses and wharfs. The navy was fully in control. Damaged vessels were being repaired and new ones were being built. And while it still had a long way to go, the Charlestown Navy Yard was becoming a functioning navy yard. Bainbridge's lucky streak ran out, however - by the time he captained the USS <em>Independence</em> the War of 1812 had ended.</p> <p>Bainbridge left, giving the commandant title over to Captain Isaac Hull (who captained the USS <em>Constitution</em> with her victory over the HMS <em>Guerriere</em>). Bainbridge returned briefly in 1823, but only for a year before he was promoted to the Board of Navy Commisioners. It was from this position that Bainbridge retired from Navy life. And while his victories at home in the Charlestown Navy Yard are less glamorous than his victories at sea, they deserve to be remembered. Had it not been for Bainbridge's tireless efforts, the Charlestown Navy Yard would never have been able to become one of the most respected yards in the United States.</p> <p><u>References:</u></p> <p>Bears, Edwin C. <em>Charlestown Navy Yard, 1800-1842.</em> Vol. 1.

There were also not many African American schools in Charleston. Cardozo tried to address this by founding the Avery Normal Institute in 1865. It was the city’s first free secondary school for African Americans. A “Normal” school is one that trains teachers. Today, the Avery Normal Institute is known as the Avery Research Center and is part of the College of Charleston. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-29300f1d-2eee-2d95-898e-b902dd77528d\">Soon after he founded the school in Charleston, Cardozo was elected the Secretary of State of South Carolina.

This was particularly important after the Civil War. Slavery was permitted in the United States until 1865, and it was illegal to teach an enslaved person to read and write. When enslaved men, women, and children were freed after the Civil War, many could not read or write.

            "bodyText": "<p>Few park visitors give much thought to how national parks are established, but dedicated park boosters will probably mention the names of Ferdinand Hayden (Yellowstone), John Muir (Yosemite), and Enos Mills (Rocky Mountain) when asked to name people who promoted the founding of national parks. These were outdoorsmen in keeping with the rugged and heroic western landscapes. Asked to name a woman connected with the founding of a national park, a few might offer Marjorie Stoneman Douglas as a champion of Everglades National Park.</p> <p>Not many will recall Minerva Hamilton Hoyt and her tireless efforts on behalf of California desert protection. In fact, without her leadership, Joshua Tree National Park might never have become part of the National Park System. How a transplanted southern belle born on a Mississippi plantation became a staunch backer of the protection of desert landscapes is perhaps one of the more unlikely stories in the annals of national park history.</p> <p>Minerva Hamilton led a genteel early life attending finishing schools and music conservatories. Her marriage to Dr. Sherman Hoyt led her away from the deep south to New York and eventually to South Pasadena where she immersed herself in southern California high society and civic causes. She demonstrated talent as an organizer of special charity events and developed a passion for gardening, which introduced her to some of the native desert vegetation commonly used in southern California landscaping. Trips to the desert instilled in Ms. Hoyt a strong appreciation for the austere beauty and wonderful inventiveness of desert plants that somehow managed to thrive in the harsh climate. She also saw the widespread destruction of native desert plants by thoughtless people who dug up, burned, and other wise destroyed so many of the cacti and Joshua trees that Minerva found beautiful.</p> <p>Following the deaths of her son and husband, Minerva dedicated herself to the cause of protecting desert landscapes. She organized exhibitions of desert plants that were shown in Boston, New York, and London. She founded the International Deserts Conservation League with the goal of establishing parks to preserve desert landscapes. Hoyt was tapped by noted landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmstead, Jr. to serve on a California state commission formed to recommend proposals for new state parks. She prepared the commission’s report on desert parks and recommended large parks be created at Death Valley, the Anza-Borrego Desert, and in the Joshua tree forests of the Little San Bernardino Mountains north of Palm Springs.</p> <p>In time Hoyt became convinced that a national park was the best option for preserving large desert areas. She hired well known biologists and desert ecologists to prepare reports on the virtues of the Joshua Tree region. She was introduced to President Franklin Roosevelt whose New Deal administration became active in the establishment of national parks and monuments as a jobs-creation initiative and she developed an ally in Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes.</p> <p>Minerva had a major success when President Roosevelt asked the National Park Service to prepare a recommendation on the site. Problems with the inclusion of certain railroad lands forced a reduction in the size of the proposed park from over one million acres to a more modest 825,000 in the final proposal. On August 10, 1936, President Roosevelt signed a presidential proclamation establishing Joshua Tree National Monument. Minerva finally had her grand desert park.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Longstreet's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br /> <br /> In the Northern Virginia Campaign of August 1862, Longstreet did not play his customary defensive role he is most well known for. At the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run), in fact, he did precisely the opposite. While \"Stonewall\" Jackson held a strong defensive line Longstreet played Jackson's usual role of maneuvering quickly in order to unexpectedly attack the Union army.<br /> <br /> Following the successful execution of a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his command in the rear of John Pope's Army of Virginia, Jackson took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. Pope obliged and beginning the evening of August 28 Pope pounded Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched north to reach the battlefield.<br /> <br /> Postwar criticism of Longstreet claimed that he marched his men too slowly, leaving Jackson to bear the brunt of the fighting for two days, but Longstreet's men moved very quickly covering roughly 30 miles in a little more than 24 hours, arriving on the field of the Second Battle of Manassas around midday on August 29.<br /> <br /> Longstreet's actions after his arrival are significantly more controversial. Despite three separate suggestions from Lee urging him to attack, Longstreet demurred, recommending instead that a reconnaissance in force be conducted to survey the ground in front of him.<br /> <br /> It was not until 6:30 p.m. on August 29 that John Hood's division moved forward against the troops of the Union V Corps, and they were forced to withdraw only two hours later.<br /> <br /> Although this delay earned Longstreet significant criticism, his careful preparations of the afternoon of August 29 paid dividends the following morning. Longstreet's artillery proved to be of great assistance to Jackson's resistance of the Union attack that morning. Then, as Pope pushed Jackson, believing he was starting to retreat, Longstreet capitalized on Federal confusion and launched his own attack on the Union army's left flank with over 28,000 men, anticipating an order from Lee that had not yet arrived. This attack is regarded as \"the largest, simultaneous mass assault of the war,\" and changed the tide of battle.<br /> <br /> Longstreet's success on the fields of Manassas established a strategic model he believed to be ideal--the use of defensive tactics within a strategic offensive. He would advocate similar strategy for the remainder of the war.<br /> <br /> The Maryland Campaign proved to be a further testing ground of such tactics for Longstreet. His first success came in his orchestration of the delaying action at South Mountain on September 14, which allowed the majority of Jackson's men time to arrive on the field north of Sharpsburg where Longstreet's command joined them after pulling back from South Mountain.<br /> <br /> At the Battle of Antietam on September 17 Longstreet used the terrain to his advantage and held his part of the Confederate defensive line against Union forces nearly twice as numerous, further validating his idea that the tactical defense was now vastly superior to the exposed offense.<br /> <br /> On October 9, Longstreet was promoted to Lieutenant General one day earlier than Jackson, making the \"Old War-Horse\" the senior Lieutenant General in the entire Confederate Army. <p><br /> <strong>Longstreet Goes West</strong></p> After the Gettysburg Campaign in the summer of 1863, Confederate leaders began to realize the strategic importance of the city of Chattanooga in eastern Tennessee. General James Longstreet, along with around 10,000 men from his corps in the Army of Northern Virginia, were dispatched towards Chattanooga. Moving across hundreds of miles through the Confederate heartland, Longstreet's men arrived in Ringgold, Georgia just as the Battle of Chickamauga commenced. <br /> <br /> His troops boosted Confederate numbers to give the rebels a rare numerical advantage. Rumors quickly swirled through Union ranks about Longstreet's presence, and both Union soldiers, and Confederates from the Army of Tennessee, marveled at the soldierly appearance of Longstreet's men. By nightfall on September 19, 1863, Longstreet was on the field, and Confederate General Braxton Bragg reorganized the army, giving Longstreet command of an entire wing of his army. In confusion of the wooded battlefield, the dawn attack never materialized on the morning of September 20. Finally, at around 11 am, Longstreet ordered his wing forward towards the center of the Union line. Longstreet's command split the Union Army, and effectively routed the Army of the Cumberland.<br /> <br /> Moving towards Chattanooga, Longstreet's men took up positions around Lookout Mountain. From this vantage point, James Longstreet helped plan the Battle of Wauhatchie, which resulted in Confederate defeat in Lookout Valley and opened a vital Union Army supply route known as the Cracker Line. Frustrated by the leadership of Braxton Bragg, Longstreet was ordered to Knoxville, where he engaged with Union forces, before returning to Virginia in the spring of 1864.  <h4> </h4>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Hans Christian Heg was one of four children born at Lier, near Drammen, Norway, on December 21, 1829. The Heg family immigrated to America in 1840 and settled on the shores of Lake Muskego, Wisconsin. For some years Muskego had the distinction of being the destination point for the majority of Norwegian immigrants to America, and the Heg family barn became the gathering point for many of the new arrivals. Heg was active in Republican politics, and was a member of the Wide Awake chapter in Waupin, Wisconsin during the 1860 Election. </p> <p>Wisconsin Governor Randall appointed Heg a colonel on October 1, 1861, and assigned him the task of raising a Scandinavian Brigade in response to the pending war that faced their adopted country. Recent immigration from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark provided more than 75,000 able bodied citizens in 1861. Heg's recruiting efforts included an editorial in the Emigranten, Oct. 5, 1861. In this call, Heg asked for a thousand men—Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes. He said, \"The officers of the regiment will be men who speak the Scandinavian languages. Thus an opportunity to enter the service is afforded those Scandinavians who do not yet speak English.\" From this call, Norwegian volunteers from Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois formed the Fifteenth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. Heg was a gifted volunteer officer in the Union Army, his first military command being the Fifteenth. Notable engagements of the Fifteenth Wisconsin included Island No. 10, the Battle of Perryville, the Battle of Stones River, the Tullahoma Campaign, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Siege of Chattanooga (Missionary Ridge), the relief of Knoxville, Rocky Face Ridge and Dalton, the Battle of Resaca, and the Atlanta Campaign.</p> <p>Colonel Heg's final battle was at Chickamauga on September 19, 1863. The Fifteenth Wisconsin was fully exposed to enemy fire during repeated attacks and counter attacks throughout the day. While actively rallying his brigade from one of these repulses, Heg received a mortal wound, of which he succumbed to in a nearby field hospital. A triangular pyramid monument of eight inch shells, ten feet in height, marks the spot where Colonel Heg was mortally wounded (seven more of these pyramids can be located throughout Chickamauga Battlefield). The monument can be found in Viniard Field beside the LaFayette Road at Tour Stop #5.</p> <p align=\"center\"><em><u>Bibliography</u></em></p> <p>Blegen, Theodore C. \"Colonel Hans Christian Heg.\" The Wisconsin Magazine of History 4 (1920-1921): 139-165.</p> <p>Dyer, Frederick H. <em>A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion, Vol. III.</em> New York: Thomas Yoseloff, 1959.</p> <p>Cozzens, Peter. <em>This Terrible Sound: The Battle of Chickamauga.</em> Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1996.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>James Deshler was born February 18, 1833, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, the middle child of David and Eleanor Deshler. James's father was a member of a prominent Pennsylvania family and traveled with his English born wife to Alabama in 1825 to work on the construction of Alabama's first railroad, the Tuscumbia Railway. David became a very wealthy merchant and was able to rear his children in comfort and ease, yet tragedy would seem to haunt them. In 1844, James's sister, Charlotte Ann, died at the age of thirteen. The eldest son, David Jr., was appointed to attend West Point but sadly this honor ended in tragedy as well. David Jr. drowned swimming in the Hudson River in 1845, leaving James as the only child. James now became the focus of his father's attention, and he soon had James following in his brother's footsteps, entering West Point in 1850. James did very well in his studies, being described by fellow cadet Edward P. Alexander as \"a first class man…fine looking fellow with very attractive manners & qualities.\" James graduated seventh in the Class of 1854, which included future Confederate generals James Ewell Brown Stuart, George Washington Custis Lee, Archibald Gracie Jr., and Stephen D. Lee.</p> <p>James was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to duty with the 3rd United States Artillery, then serving in California. In 1855, he transferred to the 10th United States Infantry and saw his first combat in an expedition against the Lakota Sioux in Nebraska Territory, which resulted in the massacre of a Sioux village. In 1857, James participated in the Mormon War in Utah, being promoted at the conclusion of the conflict, in 1858, to the rank of first lieutenant. During this time, the sectional crisis between North and South rapidly escalated, and despite his northern birth, David Deshler firmly sided with his adopted home. He noted to a friend in Philadelphia, \"You speak of the Union as glorious, Well, I can say Amen to the glorious part, as long as it was permitted to be what our fathers made it; but for the last thirty years or more, there has been no peace for the South on account of the everlasting and infernal agitation of the negro question by your section, whom it really did not concern. Where there is nothing but strife in a house, I would be for separation, if I had to take the outside.\" His father undoubtedly exercised strong influence over his son because in May of 1861 at Fort Wyse, Colorado Territory, James resigned his commission in the United States Army and departed home to Alabama, where he was soon commissioned a captain in the Confederate artillery and ordered to report to General William Loring in the mountains of western Virginia where he was assigned to act as adjutant general for General Henry Jackson's brigade.</p> <p>James would now see his first combat against his old flag, being involved in the Battle of Cheat Mountain in September of 1861. Deshler next saw action in a fight at Alleghany Summit and was wounded there on December 13, 1861. When he returned to service, James was promoted to the rank of Colonel and sent to North Carolina to serve on the staff of General Theophilus Holmes as his chief of artillery. After the fighting outside Richmond, Virginia, in the summer of 1862, Holmes was transferred to the Trans Mississippi Theater with his staff. In October 1862, Deshler was given command of a brigade of Texas infantry that was being organized near Austin, Arkansas. Deshler was ordered with this command to become part of the garrison of Arkansas Post. This garrison soon came under attack by a dual Union army and naval operation that resulted in the surrender of the fort on January 11th, 1863. After the battle, General William T. Sherman recalled of Deshler at the time of the surrender, \"Wishing to soften the blow of defeat, I spoke to him kindly, saying that I knew a family of Deshlers in Columbus, Ohio, and inquired if they were relations of his. He disclaimed any relation with people living north of the Ohio, in an offensive tone.\" Deshler and his men soon found themselves prisoners of war.</p> <p>Upon their exchange in May 1863, Deshler's brigade was ordered to the Army of Tennessee, then encamped around Tullahoma, Tennessee. Upon his exchange, Deshler was promoted to brigadier general and rejoined his command in July at Chattanooga. Deshler was with his command during the Battle of Chickamauga, where, on September 20th, he was killed while checking the ammunition of his men. Captain Irving Buck of Cleburne's staff noted, \"a shell exploded in Gen. Deshler's bosom and tore him to pieces. We thus lost one of the nicest & most gentlemanly officers I have ever known.\" Deshler's remains were buried on the field by his body servant and were later removed by his father to Tuscumbia to be buried with the rest of his family.</p> <p align=\"center\"><em><u>Bibliography</u></em></p> <p>Warner, Ezra J. <em>Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders</em>.

            "bodyText": "<p>Hernando de Soto was born in either Badajoz or Barcorrata, Estremadura, Spain, around 1496 to a noble, yet impoverished family. His education was facilitated by Pedrarias Davila, Count of Puño en Rostro. Soto accompanied Davila to Panama, where he was to supersede Vasco Nuñez de Balboa as governor. Davila and young Soto landed in 1519, and it was not long until contemporaries noticed that Soto was being trained \"in the bad school of Pedrarias Davila in the destruction and dissipation of the Indians of Castilla del Oro, graduated in the deaths of the inhabitants of Nicaragua, and canonized in Peru, according to the order of the Pizarros.\" Between 1519 and 1532, Soto explored the coasts of Guatemala and the Yucatan, learning the ways of a conquistador. However, in 1532, Soto, by now a \"famous\" captain, led a group of men from Nicaragua to assist Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Peru. He assisted in the capture of the Inca (Atahualpa) at Cajamarca. Pizarro sent approximately fifteen men to invite Atahualpa to meet with him. However, the Spaniards attacked the Inca in what became known as the Battle of Cajamarca. Pizarro held Atahualpa captive until a room could be filled with Incan gold as a ransom. When this was accomplished, Pizarro, fearing a non-existent Incan army was approaching, killed Atahualpa. Soto eventually made his way back to Spain where he was awarded gold and a new title. He was to become the Governor of Cuba and charged with colonizing North America.<br />  </p> <p>In May 1539, Governor Hernando de Soto landed in Florida with 620 men and 220 horses. By 1540, the conquistadors were making their way along the coast of Georgia, South and North Carolina, and into the Ridge and Valley Province of Tennessee, northwest Georgia, and north Alabama looking for gold. While traversing the Ridge and Valley Province, Soto made contact with the cacique (chief) that controlled over 400 miles of land (known as a chiefdom) that ranged from northeast Tennessee to central Alabama. This chief, known as Coosa, ruled over nearly 50,000 inhabitants. Soto and his expedition party lived among the Coosa Indians for several weeks, devouring their food stores. Upon leaving the principle city of the chiefdom, Soto took Coosa hostage in order to gain safe passage through the remaining villages and towns. Once he reached the chiefdom of the Mabilas, ruled by Chief Tuskasoosa, Coosa was awarded his freedom. The governor passed through Tuskaloosa's land but not without trials. The largest battle fought between the Spaniards and Indians was the Battle of Mabila, where the nine hour fight claimed over 200 Spanish lives and approximately 2,000 of the Mabila Indians' lives.</p> <p> </p> <p>In his continued quest for gold, Soto moved through Mississippi and Arkansas. However, he did not make it out of North America alive. The governor died on May 21, 1542, of fever. In order to perpetuate the deception of having the Indians believe he was a god, expedition members shrouded his body with blankets filled with sand and sank it in the Mississippi River.</p>",

After graduating high school, she taught briefly at a local one-room schoolhouse. In 1919, she joined the staff of the town’s weekly newspaper, the Independent Reporter as the circulation manager. She left the paper in 1928, and in 1930 married Clyde Smith, the paper’s owner.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Margaret became active in politics, and in 1930 was elected to the Maine Republican State Committee, serving through 1936 when Clyde was elected to the US House of Representatives. Margaret moved to Washington, DC with her husband, where she served as his secretary and speech writer. When Clyde suffered a heart attack early in 1940, he asked Margaret to run for his House seat. He died on April 8, and Margaret won the following special election. Three months after the special election, she won the regular election with more than 60% of the vote.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">She was the first woman to serve in both houses of the </span></span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">United States Congress</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> and the first woman to represent Maine in either. From 1940 to 1949, she was a U.S. Representative in the House representing Maine’s 2nd District. During her victorious 1948 campaign for Senate, she was faced with considerable anti-woman bias – despite her insistence that her gender had nothing to do with her running for office. “The little lady… is simply over-reaching herself,” wrote one reporter. When she was asked whether a woman could make a good Senator, Smith replied, “Women administer the home. They set the rules, enforce them, mete out justice for violations. Thus, like Congress, they legislate; like the Executive, they administer; like the courts, they interpret the rules. It is an ideal experience for politics.” [1]</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">From 1949 to 1973, Smith represented Maine in the U.S. Senate, and from 1967 until 1973 served as the Chair of the Senate Republican Conference. She was the longest-serving woman in Senate history until 2011, when Senator Barbara Mikulski was sworn into her fifth term. Margaret Chase Smith remains the longest-serving Republican woman in the Senate.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 1946, Smith became a member of the House Armed Services Committee. During her time on this Committee, she sponsored and helped pass the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act. This Act was signed into law by President Truman in June of 1948. It enabled women to serve as permanent, regular members of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force). Although they could serve, the law excluded women from ships and planes that might engage in combat. Before the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act, women (except nurses) served in the military only during times of War.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Smith was an early critic of McCarthyism during the Red and Lavender Scares of 1947 through 1957. These scares were fueled by several high-ranking US government officials admitting to spying for the Soviet Union. Senator Joseph McCarthy and members of his House Committee on Un-American Activities capitalized on this fear to purge the federal government of “undesirables.” Those accused of Communism or Communist sympathies (Red Scare) and of being homosexual (and therefore seen as easily blackmailed to become a Soviet spy – the Lavender Scare) were forced out of their jobs and housing. Supportive of rooting out foreign influence, Smith became disillusioned when McCarthy and his cronies refused to provide evidence of Communists and Communist interference in the US government.  In 1945, Margaret Smith voted against making the House Committee on Un-American Activities permanent. In 1950, she gave a speech called the “Declaration of Conscience” in which she identified some of the basic principles of Americanism:</span></span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The right to criticize</span></span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The right to hold unpopular beliefs</span></span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The right to protest</span></span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">and the right of independent thought[2]</span></span></li> </ul> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In January 1964, Smith announced her candidacy for President of the United States. Although she was not selected as the Republican Party presidential candidate, she was the first woman in the United States to be in the running to be a major party’s presidential candidate (in 1972, </span></span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Shirley Chisholm</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> became the first woman to be considered as the Presidential candidate for the Democratic Party).</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In her later career, Margaret Chase Smith supported increased education funding, civil rights, and Medicare. She also argued for the use of nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, and was an active supporter of NASA and the space program.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 1972, she lost the election for her seat in the US Senate and retired from Congress in January 1973.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In July 1989, President George H. W. Bush awarded Margaret Smith with the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the highest civilian award of the United States. The medal is awarded to those who have made especially noteworthy contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant endeavors.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Margaret Chase Smith died at age 97.</span></span><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">References</span></span></strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">[1] United States Senate. “First Woman Elected to Both Houses of Congress” <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/First_Woman_Both_Houses.htm\">https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/First_Woman_Both_Houses.htm</a></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> </span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">[2] Smith, Margaret Chase. “Declaration of Conscience,” delivered June 1, 1950, Washington, DC.

About the five years she spent with her grandmother, Shirley said, “Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody.”</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 1934, Shirley returned to Brooklyn, where she finished grade school and high school. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Brooklyn College in 1946. In 1949, she married Conrad Chisholm, who had immigrated to the United States from Jamaica a few years earlier. In 1952, she completed her Master’s degree in elementary education at </span></span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Columbia University’s</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> Teachers College.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">After graduating, she spent from 1953 to 1964 working in early childhood education, becoming an authority on issues of early education and child welfare. It was during this time that she became interested in politics, becoming involved with white-dominated political groups in Brooklyn, the Bedford-Stuyvesant Political League, and the League of Women Voters.  </span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 1964 Shirley was elected to the New York State Assembly, serving from 1965 through 1968. By early 1966, she was a leader in the efforts by the Council of Elected Negro Democrats to increase Black representation in the various committees of the State Assembly.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The first Black woman elected to the </span></span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">United States Congress</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">, Chisholm ran under the campaign slogan, “Unbought and Unbossed.” She represented New York’s 12th Congressional District from 1969 to 1983. Early in her Congressional service, Chisholm was assigned to serve on the House Agricultural Committee where she played an important role in expanding the food stamp program and the creation of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 1971, Shirley Chisholm was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and of the National Women’s Political Caucus.

She said that she ran for office “in spite of hopeless odds…to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo.” She did not win the Democratic Party nomination; that went to George McGovern.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">She left politics in 1983. From 1983 to 1987, Chisholm taught politics and sociology at Mount Holyoke and Spelman College, as well as giving speeches across the country urging people to not succumb to intolerance, and to get involved in local politics.

When William’s wife discovered he had taken Anne in, she cut off his financial support.<br /> <br /> William, Mary, and Anne moved to <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Charles Town</a> in the Province of Carolina. After a rough start, William made money as a merchant, buying both a townhouse in Charles Town (Charleston) and a nearby plantation. Mary died when Anne was twelve years old.<br /> <br /> Anne married a small-time pirate named James Bonny. Her father disapproved of James; he disowned his daughter and kicked her out of his house. Anne may have burned her father’s plantation in retaliation (she was known for her temper).<br /> <br /> Sometime between 1714 and 1718, Anne and James moved to the island of Nassau in the Bahamas. This area was known as the Republic of Pirates, a sanctuary for English pirates. James turned informant to the governor in 1718, resulting in the arrest of many pirates. At the same time, Anne was socializing with them in the local taverns. It was in the taverns that Anne met the pirate John “Calico Jack” Rackham (so named for the colorful pants he wore). He was captain of the REVENGE. When James Bonny refused to divorce Anne, she joined Calico Jack as a crew member aboard the REVENGE. Over the next years, they were active in and around Jamaica, capturing other vessels and taking their riches.<br /> <br /> In October of 1720, Calico Jack and his crew were captured by a “King’s Ship” under commission from the Governor of Jamaica. They were taken to court in Jamaica, where they were convicted of piracy and sentenced to be hanged. In accordance with English common law, Anne “pleaded her belly,” asking for mercy because she was with child. She received a temporary stay of execution until she gave birth.<br /> <br /> That is the last that we know of Anne Bonny. Some say she was eventually hanged; others that she was later released and returned to her father in Charleston.</p>",

Together they traveled to Philadelphia and New York City, eventually finding their way to Boston.<br /> <br /> When George left her, she took a job as a domestic servant in Boston's wealthy Beacon Hill neighborhood. She was, she said, \"very contented.\"<br /> <br /> George returned, and convinced her to leave her job and join him as a pirate in 1781. Together, they stole the boat ESSEX, and preyed on vessels off the New Hampshire coast. They lured in their targets by disguising the ESSEX as a damaged ship, with Rachel calling to passing vessels for help. When they docked to the ESSEX to provide aid, Rachel and George and their crew would board and rob the crew. They robbed at least 12 ships and killed at least 24 sailors.<br /> <br /> In 1782, George and several of their crew drowned when their ship wrecked in a storm. Rachel survived, and returned to Boston. She continued to steal from ships, sneaking aboard vessels docked in the city, robbing the crew while they slept.</p> <blockquote>Sometime in the spring of 1787, not being able to ascertain the exact time, I happened to go on board a ship, lying at the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Long-Wharf</a>, in Boston;—the Captain's name I cannot recollect, but think he was a Frenchman: On my entering the cabin, the door of which not being fastened, and finding the Captain and Mate asleep in their beds, I hunted about for plunder, and discovered, under the Captain's head, a black silk handkerchief containing upwards of thirty pounds, in gold, crowns, and small change, on which I immediately seized the booty and decamped therewith as quick as possible. [1]</blockquote> <p>Rachel racked up several charges for petty theft and larceny. But it was one she claims she was innocent of that ended her life. On March 18, 1789 Rachel Wall was accused of stealing a bonnet, shoes, and buckles from 17-year old Margaret Bender who was walking along the road. Rachel was arrested for highway robbery. During her trial, she denied the theft, claiming she never saw Margaret, but admitted to several acts of piracy.<br /> <br /> Despite her claims of innocence on the charges of highway robbery, she was found guilty. Rachel Wall was hanged in front of a crowd of thousands on <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Boston Common</a> on Thursday, October 8, 1789.<br /> <br /> [1] <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Life, Last Words and Dying CONFESSION, OF RACHEL WALL, Who, with William Smith and William Dunogan, were executed at BOSTON, on Thursday, October 8, 1789, for HIGH-WAY ROBBERY</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Dawn Langley Simmons challenged social norms at a time when Americans were demanding greater civil liberties in the 1960s and 1970s. One of the first individuals to receive sex-reassignment surgery in the United States, Simmons was also well-known in Charleston society for her marriage to John Paul Simmons. Theirs was reportedly the first documented interracial marriage in South Carolina.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Dawn was originally born Gordon Langley Hall. Raised in southern England, Gordon immigrated to the United States in the 1950s. He settled in New York and later Charleston where he and artist Isabella Whitney purchased an old house located at 56 Society Street. Dating to 1840, the Greek Revival house was originally built by Dr. Joseph Johnson, author of \"Traditions of South Carolina.\"</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">This part of Charleston had a large gay community as well as a high number of African American residents. While many houses in the area were listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including 56 Society Street, many were dilapidated and in need of restoration. Whitney died shortly after purchasing the property, but Gordon took an active role in restoring the house.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Shortly after relocating to Charleston, Gordon received a sex-reassignment surgery at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in the late 1960s. After the surgery, she officially adopted the name Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Dawn was the talk of Charleston social circles not only due to her sex-reassignment surgery - she also married an African American man, John Paul Simmons, in 1969. Interracial marriages were illegal in many other southern states (including South Carolina) until 1967. Even though Dawn and Simmons legally married, white society was not so accepting of their union. The couple became targets of threats and violence and Dawn was even assaulted on one occasion.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Dawn and John Simmons welcomed a daughter in the early 1970s and eventually went on to have three grandchildren. Throughout her life, Dawn also served as a teacher and she authored a series of fictional books for both children and adults. She died in Charleston in 2000 at the age of 77.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><br /> <br /> Works Referenced:<br /> Fordham, Damon L. Voices of Black South Carolina: Legend & Legacy.

At six years old, Ruby's bravery helped pave the way for Civil Rights action in the American South.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Ruby was born on September 8, 1954 to Abon and Lucille Bridges in Tylertown, Mississippi. She was the eldest of five children. When Ruby was 2, the family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana in search of better opportunities.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Though the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling passed in 1954, southern states resisted integration. Ruby first attended a segregated kindergarten in 1959. The following year a federal court ordered Louisiana to desegregate. Ruby's school district created entrance exams for African American students. These exams determined whether African American students could compete academically at an all-white school. Ruby and five other students passed the test. Two students decided to stay at their school. The others, including Ruby, were sent to the all-white McDonough Elementary School.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">On November 14, Ruby and her mother were escorted into the William Frantz Elementary School by four federal marshalls. This escort continued all year. Despite the racial slurs, screaming crowds, and only having one teacher willing to accept her, Ruby did not miss a day of school.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The community was torn. Some families supported her bravery. Some northerners sent money to aid her family. Others protested. The entire family suffered for their bravery. Abon Bridges lost his job. Grocery stores refused to sell to Lucille. Her grandparents were evicted from the farm where they had sharecropped for a quarter-century.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Eventually, other African American students enrolled. Ruby went on to graduate from a desegregated highschool, became a travel agent, married, and had four sons. Today, Ruby continues to be a civil rights activist. She established The Ruby Bridges Foundation to help promote tolerance and create change through education.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Ruby Bridges is associated with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jela/index.htm\">Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve</a> in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>",

Gilmore was also a civil rights advocate in her community. She pioneered efforts to integrate her state's schools, housing, and public accommodations. For her business savvy and civil rights work, Elizabeth Harden Gilmore is an American Hero.<br /> <br /> Before the Brown v. Board of Education decision mandating school desegregation, Gilmore formed a women's club which opened Charleston's first integrated day care center. At about the same time, she succeeded in getting her black Girl Scout troop admitted to Camp Anne Bailey near the mountain town of Lewisburg. After co-founding the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1958, she led CORE in a successful 1 ½-year-long sit-in campaign at a local department store called The Diamond. In the 1960s Gilmore served on the Kanawha Valley Council of Human Relations, where she participated in forums on racial differences and where she helped black renters, displaced by a new interstate highway, find housing. Her successful push to amend the 1961 state civil rights law won her a seat on the powerful higher-education Board of Regents. Gilmore was the first African American to receive such an honor. She stayed on the Board from 1969 to the late 1970s serving one term as vice-president and one term as president. Gilmore's tireless commitment to civil and human rights didn't end there. She was also involved with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and community education and welfare committees. \"She was always there,\" says her friend Betty Hamilton. \"Her commitment was ongoing and steadfast.\"<br /> <br /> The Elizabeth Harden Gilmore House, where Gilmore and her husband lived and ran the Harden and Harden funeral home, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.</p>",

            "bodyText": "\"Seaman: Captain Lewis's Canine Voyageur\"<br /> <br /> Arguably, Captain Meriwether Lewis's four-footed companion, a Newfoundland waterdog by the name of Seaman, eventually became one of the most famous members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He began his tour, however, in almost total obscurity and there he remained for more than a century. The Biddle/Allen paraphrase of the original journals, first published in 1814, edited out all mention of Lewis's dog. It was not until the complete journals were published under the editorship of Reuben Gold Thwaites in 1904-05 that the dog came to light as an acknowledged member of the Corps of Discovery. At that time it became clear that Seaman had proved his worth over and over throughout the arduous wilderness journey as a powerful hunter, vigilant watchdog and devoted companion.<br /> <br /> In his first journal entry, Lewis said this about his long-delayed departure from Pittsburgh as be began his historic journey: \"Left Pittsburgh this day [August 31, 1803] at 11 ock [o'clock] with a party of 11 hands 7 of which are soldiers, a pilot and three young men on trial they having proposed to go with me throughout the voyage.\" That's it; there's no mention of a dog being aboard.<br /> <br /> Indeed, Lewis did not acknowledge the presence of his dog until September 11th, when he had been underway almost two weeks. On that date he wrote: \"…observed a number of squirrels swiming [sic] the Ohio and universally passing from the W. to the East shore…I made my dog take as many each day as I had occation for, they wer fat and I thought them when fryed a pleasent food…my dog was of the newfoundland breed very active strong and docile, he would take the squirel in the water kill them and swiming bring them in his mouth to the boat.\" This is only the first of numerous subsequent mentions of the dog's hunting prowess.<br /> <br /> From that time onward when the canine voyageur was mentioned in Lewis's journal entries it was as \"my dog,\" rarely by name. When mentioned by William Clark, or one of the other journal-keepers, he was usually \"Captain Lewis's dog\" or \"the dog.\" As time wore on and Seaman established himself as a valued member of the expedition, Clark and the men began referring to him as \"our dog.\"<br /> <br /> Lewis conveyed a little more information about \"his dog\" when the Corps of Discovery stopped on November 16th at the junction of the<br /> <br /> Ohio with the Mississippi River to take measurements and celestial readings. He related this exchange with a group of Shawnee and Delaware Indians they encountered at that location: \"…one of the Shawnees a respectable looking Indian offered me three beverskins for my dog with which he appeared much pleased, the dog was of the newfoundland breed one that I prised much for his docility and qualifications generally for my journey of course there was no bargan, I had given 20$ for this dogg myself.\"<br /> <br /> The dog's name has been the subject of some debate over the years since the original journals were published in their entirety by Thwaites. It's either Seaman or Scannon, depending on the vintage of the journals one happens to consult. Since 1985, or thereabout, Seaman seems to have won out. But that's another story for another day.<br /> <br /> H.

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Modjeska Simkins was the matriarch of the Civil Rights Movement in South Carolina. She was also a leader in African-American public health and social reform. For her contributions to the struggle for civil rights, Simkins is an American Hero.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Modjeska Monteith was born on December 5, 1899 in Columbia, South Carolina. Her father, Henry Clarence, was a brick mason. Her mother was Rachel Evelyn Hall. Throughout her childhood Monteith lived on a farm near Columbia. She continued her education, and graduated from Benedict College in 1921.  After graduation, Monteith, began teaching at Booker T. Washington High School. Public Schools in Columbia did not allow married women to teach, so Monteith was asked to resign in 1929 after she married Andrew Whitfield Simkins.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1931, Simkins began working in the public health field as the Director of Negro Work for the South Carolina Tuberculosis Association. Simkins became the state’s only full-time, statewide African American public health worker. Southern racism and poverty helped tuberculosis, pellagra, and other-illness increase African American mortality rates. Simkins created alliances with black and white groups and helped raise funds which made a substantial health impact for African Americans.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">By 1942, Simkins was fired from the Tuberculosis Association. Her increasing involvement with the NAACP was a contributing factor. She was a member of the local Columbia NAACP branch and program committee chair when the South Carolina NAACP was formed. She was one of the founders of the state conference. Simkins was elected to the first executive board and was the first chair of the state programs committee. In 1941, Simkins was elected as Secretary of the state conference-- she was the only woman to serve as an officer. Simkins served as Secretary from 1941-1957. Her work helped push the state closer to racial equality. Some of her most significant work took placed in 1950 with the Briggs v. Elliot South Carolina federal court case. Simkins worked with Rev. Joseph DeLaine  to write the declaration for the school lawsuit that called for equalization of Clarendon County Schools. DeLaine was the President of the Clarendon County, South Carolina NAACP. The Clarendon case was reworked to become one of the several individual cases that would directly challenge the “separate but equal” doctrine in the Brown v. Board of Education case in Topeka.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Her activism, which at times was controversial, drew negative attention. Simkins' life and home became the targets of violence. An unknown assailant fired shots at her house while she was active with the NAACP. By the late 1950s, she was accused of being a communist because several of her friends were members of the American Communist Party. The F.B.I. and House Un-American Activities committee accused her of subversive activities. In 1957, she was not nominated as a candidate for secretary for the South Carolina NAACP. It was the first time in 16 years. Some officials suggested that her association with communists and alleged subversive groups were the cause of this.  Despite this, Simkins remained active. She was active with the Southern Conference Education Fund, a southwide interracial civil rights organization, for many years. Simkins also served in many leadership positions that were traditionally unavailable to women in the civil rights movement.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Modjeska Montieth Simkims passed away on April 5, 1992 in Columbia, South Carolina. Speaking at her funeral, Judge Matthew J. Perry stated:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">“She probably will be remembered as a woman who challenged everyone. She challenged the white political leadership of the state to do what was fair and equitable among all people and she challenged black citizens to stand up and demand their rightful place in the state and the nation\". Simkins is associated with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-carolina-modjeska-monteith-simkins-house.htm\">Modjeska Monteith Simkins House</a> in Columbia, South Carolina. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1994. It is not open to the public.</p>",

Upon their return Jefferson appointed Lewis as Governor of the Louisiana Territory, a post that he began in early March 1807. Lewis had difficulty in this post, which included personality conflicts and questions about how government money was being spent. He began drinking more heavily, and his relationship with Jefferson became increasingly strained. In 1809 Lewis decided to travel to Washington DC to plead his case in front of the new administration. On October 11, 1809, while staying in a Tennessee inn along the Natchez Trace Parkway, Meriwether Lewis shot himself, taking his own life. </span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">He is buried near Grinder’s Stand, and in 1848 a memorial was erected in his memory.</span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"font-weight:700\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">Sources:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/meriwether-lewis.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><span style=\"text-decoration-line:underline\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/meriwether-lewis.htm</span></span></span></span></span></span></a></span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/meriwether-lewis.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><span style=\"text-decoration-line:underline\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/meriwether-lewis.htm</span></span></span></span></span></span></a> </span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/mlewi.html\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><span style=\"text-decoration-line:underline\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">http://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/mlewi.html</span></span></span></span></span></span></a> </span></p> <div> </div>",

            "bodyText": "<h3>A Soldier's Soldier</h3> George Jordan was born into slavery in 1847 in Williamson County, Tennessee. At age 19, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, assigned to the 38<sup>th</sup> Infantry Regiment. Three years later in 1869, the 38<sup>th</sup> Infantry would be grouped with the 41<sup>st</sup> Infantry to become the 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry Regiment. Jordan would eventually wind up with the 9<sup>th</sup> Cavalry Regiment as he made his way through posts in the southwest. Like many African Americans during that period, he was illiterate when he entered the service. Jordan proved to be dedicated to his unit and the Army and rose in rank to Sergeant by 1879. During his early years in the Army, Jordan learned to read and write which likely helped him in his ascension through the ranks. Jordan spent most of his 30 year career in the 9<sup>th</sup> Cavalry K Troop.<br /> <br /> While his citation reads mostly for his action at Carrizo Canyon, NM, he exhibited exemplary combat conduct on two occasions, both battling Indian forces during the Indian War Campaigns. The first action was on May 14<sup>th</sup>, 1880 at Fort Tularosa, NM where Sergeant Jordan, his men and the town citizens were surprise attacked by a band of more than 100 Apaches. Jordan and his men successfully fought back the invaders and saved the town and the town’s cattle. The second action occurred on August 12<sup>th</sup>, 1881 in Carrizo Canyon, NM. Jordan and his troopers were detached from a larger force when they were ambushed by Apache Indians. Sergeant Jordan and the 19 men under his command performed valiantly in combat and Jordan’s actions were responsible for repelling the attack, likely saving the company’s command from being surrounded and suffering further casualties. The citation for Sergeant Jordan reads as follows: <em>While commanding a detachment of 25 men at Fort Tularosa, N. Mex., repulsed a force of more than 100 Indians. At Carrizo Canyon, N . Mex., while commanding the right of a detachment of 19 men, on 12 August 1881, he stubbornly held his ground in an extremely exposed position and gallantly forced back a much superior number of the enemy, preventing them from surrounding the command.</em><br /> <br /> Sergeant George Jordan retired from the Army in 1896 at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. Afterwards, he became a successful land owner in the Fort Robinson area. By 1904 Jordan’s health was declining and he attempted to get medical care at the Fort Robinson hospital. As was the case with many African-American veterans, he was denied entry into the base hospital. Jordan would die shortly thereafter from his medical conditions. A complaint by the post Chaplain noted that Jordan <em>“died for the want of proper attention.”</em> Sergeant George Jordan was buried in the Fort Robinson cemetery where he received a funeral with full military honors.<br /> <br /> Despite the appaling circustances surrounding his death, George Jordan's name and legacy as a Buffalo Solider Medal of Honor recipient live on. During WWII, an Army facility was named after Jordan, Camp George Jordan in Seattle, Washington. In 1999 the Army’s 6<sup>th</sup> Recruiting Brigade in North Las Vegas, Nevada named their new headquarters building after Sergeant George Jordan.",

            "bodyText": "<h3>From Illiteracy to Immortality</h3> Moses Williams entered the world on October 10<sup>th</sup>, 1845 in Carrolton, Louisiana. Like the thousands of other African Americans in the south at the time, he would grow up illiterate. Shortly after the Civil War in 1866, Congress established the six segregated African-American regiments that would become known as the Buffalo Soldiers. That same year, 21 year old Moses Williams enlisted in the Army by signing an “X” on his enlistment papers since he was unable to read or write. Five years later at the end of his first enlistment, he re-enlisted and this time his official documents show a penned signature as “Moses Williams.” Williams took advantage of the opportunity given to him by the Army and learned how to read, write and do mathematics.<br /> <br /> Moses Williams was originally assigned to the 9th Cavalry, Company F. Initially stationed in Louisiana, Williams and his fellow troopers would also serve in Texas and then in New Mexico. By 1876 he was transferred and assigned to Company I (Eye). In 1881, Williams and his fellow troopers of Company I (Eye) were ordered to pursue and capture renegade Apaches in New Mexico. On August 16<sup>th</sup>, Company I (Eye) engaged a band of spirited Apaches in the foothills of the Cuchillo Negro Mountains. During the ferocious battle, Williams led multiple flanking attacks and personally rallied his fellow troopers to reorganize and continue fighting. Upon the company’s withdrawal under intense fire, Williams and his Lieutenant exposed themselves to draw enemy fire which enabled the company to rescue three other troopers who had been cut-off by the Apache renegades.<br /> <br /> Williams would go on and enjoy a storied Army career as he achieved the coveted and distinguished position of Ordnance Sergeant by 1885 at Fort Niobrara in Nebraska. While stationed there, he learned that two other troopers who were involved in the Cuchillo Negro Mountains battle had been awarded the Medal of Honor. Williams decided to petition the Army for the honor as well. His former commanding officer concurred in his decision to petition the Army for the honor and provided a detailed letter of recommendation of his valiant actions that day. In 1896, six years after Williams petitioned the Army, and 15 years after the battle, the Army immortalized him by awarding the Medal of Honor for his valiant and selfless actions that fateful day in New Mexico. The citation for William’s Medal of Honor reads as follows: \"<em>Rallied a detachment, skillfully conducted a running fight of 3 or 4 hours, and by his coolness, bravery, and unflinching devotion to duty in standing by his commanding officer in an exposed position under a heavy fire from a large party of Indians saved the lives of at least 3 of his comrades.\"</em><br /> <br /> Sergeant Moses Williams would continue his military career until 1898 when he retired after 32 years of honorable service to the country. Only one year after his retirement though, Moses Williams died on August 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1899 at age 52. He was buried at the <a href=\"http://www.vbma.us/projectsCemetery.html\">Vancouver Barracks Post Cemetery</a> at Fort Vancouver, Washington (now known as Fort Vancouver Military Cemetery). In 1991, a monument to Moses Williams and three other Medal of Honor recipients was dedicated by General Colin Powell on the Vancouver National Historic Reserve.",

He worked for the National Park Service for many years and is best known for his photography at the White House.</p> <p>Rowe was employed by the Bureau of Public Roads in 1930. This was his first position with the federal government. In 1932, he joined the Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks, which later became National Capital Parks East within the National Park Service. It was in this position that he first became interested in photography. He started by taking pictures of birds at a sanctuary he frequented. The photographs of birds caught the eye of the National Park Service, which offered Rowe an apprenticeship. Eventually, he was promoted to an official photography position. Rowe documented public roads and buildings that surrounded the nation's capital and parks such as Blue Ridge Parkway. </p> <p>In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt wanted a photographer to document his daily activities. At the time, there was no official White House photographer like there is now. The National Park Service assigned Rowe to photograph the president, especially taking part in activities away from the White House.</p> <p>One of Rowe’s most famous photographs was of Mrs. Roosevelt on a horse ride in the morning. The president liked this photograph, and others that Rowe had taken, and continued to expand Rowe’s photography duties. Rowe began documenting life inside the White House in addition to events off the grounds. He was designated as the ex-officio presidential photographer.</p> <p>Rowe remained as photographer for the duration of Roosevelt's presidency and did not leave after Roosevelt left office. He served as photographer for five presidents. From 1941 to 1967, Rowe photographed presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. A search for photographs during this time period will include the credit line “National Park Service photo by Abbie Rowe.\"</p> <p>In 1963, Rowe received the Distinguished Service Award of the Department of the Interior. He is also known as an eminent photographer through the National Park Service, a distinction given to few photographers. Rowe died in 1967 from cancer. His presidential photography and contributions to the National Park Service live on.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Ansel Adams was born in San Francisco in 1902 as the only child of Charles Hitchcock Adams and Olive Bray Adams. He grew up in relative solitude and had few friends. Charles and Olive focused on restoring the family timber business, which had fallen in the financial panic of 1907, and left the young Ansel to pursue his education and hobbies. Unengaged at school, Ansel received a home school education from his father. He attended several private schools, never completing a high school education.</p> <p>During adulthood, Adams channeled his wild spirit to explore the great outdoors through photography and hiking and eventually became one of America’s most famous landscape photographers. He was honored and respected for his boldness in taking climbing risks to get the best photos and for his willingness to endure difficult hikes and terrible conditions to practice his craft. Adams became famous throughout the nation for his photographs of Yosemite and other national parks. He perfected many photographic techniques and captured the beauty of nature for all to appreciate.</p> <p>The photography of Ansel Adams is often recognized for its dramatic and important subject matter in portraying nature. It is also distinct for the technical innovations that Adams developed throughout his artistic career. His first portfolio of art was quite profitable, giving him the financial freedom to experiment extensively with new techniques. He shot many photos in black and white to clarify the beauty of natural elements and to create intensity and drama in them. He used the technique of chiaroscuro, contrasting light and dark to create impressive scale.</p> <p>Today, the works of Ansel Adams have been exhibited and distributed across the world, from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, to the Young Museum in San Francisco to the Ansel Adams Gallery, now located in Yosemite Valley itself.</p> <p>Ansel Adams had a long photography career and was an important figure in the American conservation movement. During his life, he photographed some of the most beautiful sites in America and held dozens of gallery shows that promoted the High Sierra, the Grand Canyon, and more. Adams died in 1984 in California from complications of cardiovascular disease.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Carleton Watkins was born in New York as the oldest of eight children. Watkins moved to California early in his life, living in San Francisco. He worked odd jobs in the city until he found work looking after a photography studio. The owner taught Watkins photography basics. It was in California where Watkins’ love and skill of photography was developed.</p> <p>In 1858, Watkins started his own photography business. He was best known for his landscape photography, specifically of Yosemite. His photographs were seen by people who lived in the eastern United States and had never seen the West. Watkins’ photography became popular after he was hired by the California Geological Survey to take photographs of Yosemite. His pictures of Half Dome made the landscape famous.</p> <p>Watkins created iconic photographs that influenced decision-makers; it is rumored that Watkins’ photographs of Yosemite were passed around Congress. In 1864, President Lincoln signed the Yosemite Act, which protected Yosemite Valley as state park. This first designation, and Watkins’ continued work with photography, helped pave the way for the National Park System.</p> <p>A few years after his success with Yosemite landscapes, Watkins opened his own art gallery. Unfortunately, he was not a great businessman. He lost the gallery, and the new owners took possession of his photos and refused to give Watkins credit. There was no copyright to protect Watkins at the time. As a result, Watkins had to create a new series of photos.</p> <p>In 1878, Watkins got married and had two children. In the 1890s, he started to lose his vision and could no longer take pictures. He lost his income, and his family was faced with homelessness. Watkins’ luck continued to go downhill. All of the new work he had created after losing his gallery of photographs was destroyed by natural disasters in 1906. He lost everything.</p> <p>Watkins retired in California. He was declared mentally unfit to live alone shortly after retiring. His daughter cared for him but eventually had to send Watkins to the Napa State Hospital for the Insane. Watkins died in 1916 at the hospital and was buried on the grounds.</p> <p>Despite his misfortune, Watkins left a profound legacy that helped preserve the national parks for future generations.</p>",

Grant fell in love with the beautiful landscapes in the West and, after the war, wrote to Yellowstone National Park to see if any ranger positions were open. He would not hear back until 1922, when Horace M. Albright offered him a ranger position for the summer. </p> <p>Over the summer of 1922, Grant taught himself photography and took pictures in Yellowstone. Once summer was over, he did not take a full-time ranger position. Instead, he decided to take photography courses in New York City. He kept in touch with Albright and other employees of the National Park Service, holding onto the hope that the Service would one day create a position for a photographer.</p> <p>That day finally came in 1929. Albright became the NPS director, found funding, and created a staff photographer position for Grant. Grant took pictures for reports, public information, educational purposes, and any other reason the Service needed photos. He traveled primarily around the West and Southwest in his first few years as a staff photographer. In 1931, Grant received a promotion and became the Service’s first chief photographer.</p> <p>From 1929 until his retirement in 1954, Grant created more than 30,000 photographs of national parks. His photos included staff, events, landscapes, and architecture. He captured images of places many people had never seen before. Thousands of visitors came to national parks because of Grant’s photography. His work was featured in a variety of places, but the credit line for the images did not feature his name. All images were credited to the National Park Service.</p> <p>The National Park Service recognizes Grant as an “eminent photographer,” a title given to photographers who have documented work and art that feature national parks. He also received the Meritorious Service Award from the National Park Service. His work has been seen by millions, though few people know his name. Though his work was previously overlooked, Grant’s contributions to art, to the National Park Service, and towards documenting the stunning landscapes in the West and Southwest will never be forgotten.</p>",

In 1918 she encountered the sequoias of the Giant Forest for the first time and was immediately captivated. She became an advocate for an expansion of Sequoia National Park and began travel in the High Sierras in 1923.</p> <p>Thew covered hundreds of miles of terrain in the High Sierras, documenting as much of the landscape as she could. She photographed areas few people had seen before. She believed that if people could see the area’s beauty, they would want to expand and preserve it as a national park. Thew created the largest work of this region at the time.</p> <p>In the hopes of convincing Congress to expand the park, she published a book titled, “The Proposed Roosevelt-Sequoia National Park.” She included the photographs she had taken of the High Sierra, along with descriptions. Thew was inspired by the landscape. She is quoted as saying, \"If you are weary with the battle, either of business or the greater game of life, and would like to find your way back to sound nerves and a new interest in life, I know of no better place than the wild loveliness of some chosen spot in the High Sierra in which, when you have lost your physical self, you have found your mental and spiritual re-awakening.\"</p> <p>In 1926, Thew's advocacy efforts paid off. Congress tripled the size of Sequoia National Park. The National Park Service sent her a telegram to thank her for her efforts. Her advocacy approach would be used again by other prominent photographers, including Ansel Adams in the creation of Kings Canyon National Park.</p> <p>Susan Thew will be remembered for her advocacy and belief that the beautiful landscapes of the High Sierras should be protected for all time.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>George Perkins Marsh was born on March 15, 1801, in Woodstock, Vermont. He grew up in a wealthy American family. His father, Charles Marsh, was a US Congressman, and his mother was a homemaker. Marsh was raised as a strict Christian with a top-notch education. Because of poor eyesight, Marsh spent much of his childhood indoors, first reading and then being read to. Marsh attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for high school and then went to college. He graduated from Dartmouth with highest honors at age 19. Following college, Marsh returned to Vermont to study law in Burlington. He passed the Bar in 1825 and became a lawyer.</p> <p>Marsh married Harriet Buell, a songwriter, and they had two children, Charles Buell Marsh and George Ozias Marsh. By 1832, both mother and oldest son had died. George Perkins Marsh continued to practice law to support his younger son, but gave up in 1842 to pursue, like his father, a career in politics. From 1843 to 1849, he represented the Whig party in Congress as a representative from Vermont.</p> <p>In 1849, then-President Zachary Taylor appointed Marsh ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. He worked as a civil servant until 1853, travelling abroad and negotiating for the release of American prisoners. In 1854, he returned to Vermont, where he began to focus on his writing. He published some of the earliest conservation status reports for the Governor of Vermont and eventually wrote his most important text, <em>Man and Nature</em>.</p> <p>Marsh went abroad again in 1861, when Abraham Lincoln appointed him the minister to Italy. He served as a diplomat in Italy for 21 years until he died in 1882.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Thomas Moran was born in Lancashire, England, to two handloom weavers. As England began to industrialize, Moran’s parents had trouble making a living. They emigrated with young Thomas to the United States, where they settled in Philadelphia.<br /> <br /> Adjusting to life in the United States, Moran took on an apprenticeship at the age of 16 with a woodcutting firm in Philadelphia under the name of Scattergood & Telfer. At the firm, he learned to cut wood in decorative pictorials. He also began to experiment with painting and watercolors.<br /> <br /> After practicing woodcutting for two years, Moran left to become an illustrator for Scribner’s Monthly magazine, eventually rising to the position of chief illustrator. During his tenure, Moran studied the work of J.W. Turner extensively, learning about European styles of painting and honing the landscape art skills that would eventually make him famous. Moran even traveled back to England, the land his parents left behind, to view Turner’s work firsthand.<br /> <br /> During this early part of his career, Moran also traveled to Lake Superior, where he painted and etched the landscapes of the Great Lakes. Here he married Mary Nimmo, a fellow Scottish-born etcher and landscape artist. The couple had two daughters and a son.<br /> <br /> The moment that became the turning point in Moran’s career came in 1971, when Ferdinand V. Hayden invited Moran to go on the Geological Survey Expedition to the stretch of Western land that is now preserved as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm\">Yellowstone National Park</a>. Moran was hired to portray the landscapes and to bring images back to the public so they could view the wonders themselves. After a brief return home to his family, Moran returned to the American West in 1873 on Major John Wesley Powell’s expedition.<br /> <br /> Over the next 20 years, Moran would travel frequently between the East and the West, participating in many more expeditions and contributing his talents to documenting natural wonders. He is known for his vast landscapes of western scenes.<br /> <br /> Even as he aged, Moran continued to paint and produce works of art that can be seen in museums across the United States, including the Smithsonian Gallery in Washington, DC. One of Moran’s paintings, <em>The Three Tetons</em>, has been exhibited in the White House. <br /> <br /> The Thomas Moran house is preserved in East Hampton, New York, as a national historic landmark. Moran died at the age of 89 in Santa Barbara, California. His remains were transported to New York, where he is buried.</p>",

Martha died when James was young, and Loyalist John fled to Canada because of escalating tensions with the American Revolution. James was raised by an aunt, and with few other options available to him joined the United States Navy in 1798.</p><p>Lawrence worked his way up in the ranks during peace and during the Quasi War with France. He was commissioned as a lieutenant, and served as second-in-command with Stephen Decatur on the USS <em>Enterprise </em>during the raid at Tripoli harbor in 1804 to sabotage the frigate <em>Philadelphia. </em>Lawrence served on several other warships for the next decade, promoted to Master Commandent in November of 1810 and taking control of USS <em>Hornet.</em></p><p>During the War of 1812, Lawrence distinguished himself through several high-profile victories, including seizing $23,000 in gold from HMS <em>Resolution </em>and sinking HMS <em>Peacock.</em> These successes earned him a promotion to captain in 1813 and command of the frigate <em>Chesapeake, </em>one of the Navy’s most elite vessels.</p><p>However, this power and prestige proved intoxicating. Sailing out of the port of Boston in June 1813, Lawrence foolishly engaged HMS <em>Shannon </em>commanded by Captain Philip Broke which was at the time blockading the harbor. Although Lawrence’s team was largely inexperienced, the crew of <em>Shannon </em>was well-seasoned, and guided by one of the Royal Navy’s most accomplished captains.</p><p>This mistake ended up costing Lawrence both the frigate and his life. <em>Chesapeake </em>was badly damaged and seized by the British, with Lawrence mortally wounded in just a few minutes of gunfire. As he was carried below deck to die, he famously called out a final order to his sailors: “Don’t give up the ship!” These supposed final words were immortalized by friend and fellow naval officer Oliver Hazard Perry, who stitched them onto a flag and used it to lead his troops victoriously at the Battle of Lake Erie.</p>",

Finally, he participated in the 1864 campaign against Nashville. <br> <br> Following the war, Chalmers returned to Mississippi where he resumed his law career and became a prominent Mississippi political figure during Reconstruction. He served as a member of the state senate from 1876 to 1877 and, after Mississippi was re admitted into the Union, Chalmers was elected to the U.S. House of Representative for three terms.

In March, 1863, Waddell traveled to England, where he and other Confederate naval officers oversaw shipbuilding contracts. In October, 1864, Waddell assumed command of the CSS Shenandoah. Off the coast of Portugal, the Shenandoah surreptitiously received additional naval personnel, as well as guns and provisions, transforming the former merchant vessel into a warship. Under Waddell, the Shenandoah embarked on a voyage through the south Atlantic, across the Indian Ocean and into the north Pacific.<br> <br> Unaware of the Confederacy's defeat, the Shenandoah terrorized the U.S. flagged whaling fleet, capturing over 20 vessels during June 1865. Finally, en route to attack San Francisco, Waddell received a confirmed report on August 2, 1865 of the Confederacy's demise. Hoping to escape prosecution, the officers and crew disarmed the ship and sailed to England, arriving in Liverpool in November 1865.<br> <br> Waddell returned to the U.S. in 1875, becoming captain of the commercial steamer, City of San Francisco.

Clarke and Company, a banking house where he was schooled in finance and banking operations. In 1861 Cooke opened up his own banking house, Jay Cooke and Company, where he dealt gold, sold and bought notes of state banks, traded foreign exchanges, and served as a broker. </span><br /><br /><span>The outbreak of the Civil War 1861 created a great opportunity for a man of Cooke's financial acumen, as the Union war effort required considerable financing. Shortly after the war began he floated a three million dollar loan to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In the months that followed, he helped Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase secure loans from other leading banks in the North. He also succeeded where the Treasury Department had failed in selling half a billion dollars worth of \"five-twenty\" bonds (so-called as they could be cashed in in five years and matured in 20). Cooke reaped an enormous commission from the sale, which he use do finance a successful nationwide bond-marketing campaign, appealing to both the patriotism and desire to turn a profit of Americans. </span><br /><br /><span>Due to his previous success in marketing and selling war bond, in January 1865, Cooked was again called on to handle a handle the sales of bonds where the Treasury Department had failed. In six months, he sold nearly a billion dollars worth of bonds whose proceeds allowed the Union armies to be equipped and pad for the last months of the war. After the war, Cooke assisted in the development of the American northwest, financing the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1870. However, Cooke overestimated its capital for the project and in the ensuing Panic of 1873, his company suspended operations and Cooke himself was forced into bankruptcy. By 1880, though, Cooke had met all his financial obligations and rebuilt his fortune though the investment in a Utah silver mine.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Reno's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>Jesse Lee Reno was a career United States Army officer, serving with distinction in the Mexican-American War and out west in Utah before the Civil War. Though born in Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), Reno's family moved to Pennsylvania in 1830. He graduated from the United States Military Academy eighth in his class of 59 cadets in 1846 after establishing a close friendship with Thomas Jackson. <br> <br> Reno was a man who was willing to fight regardless of his official position. He quickly gained a reputation as a \"soldier's soldier,\" often fighting beside his troops without a sword or any sign of his rank. <br> <br> In 1859, Captain Reno took command of the Mount Vernon Arsenal in Alabama. On January 4, 1861 Reno was forced to surrender this arsenal to Alabama militia as a result of an order from Governor Andrew B. Moore a week before Alabama seceded from the Union. Now without a command Reno transferred to Virginia where he was appointed to command of the 2nd Brigade of Major General Ambrose Burnside's expeditionary force during the North Carolina Expedition from February-July, 1862. <br> <br> Following this campaign Reno was promoted to division command in Burnside's IX Corps, when it was integrated into the Army of the Potomac.<br> <br> During the Northern Virginia Campaign, Reno's division directly opposed the troops of his friend and classmate \"Stonewall\" Jackson on two occasions, during the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) and the Battle of Chantilly. Just before the fighting at Manassas, on August 20, Reno was appointed to the rank of Major General. When the Army of the Potomac departed from Washington to face Lee during the Maryland Campaign in September Burnside was appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac's Right Wing, which in turn elevated Reno to command of the IX Corps in Burnside's stead. <br> <br> On September 13, 1862, Reno's IX Corps advanced from Frederick, Maryland in an effort to intercept Confederate troops in the South Mountains. This movement pitted Reno against the troops of D.H. Hill at the Battle of South Mountain. On September 14, as Reno reconnoitered the Confederate position at Fox's Gap during the battle, he was shot in the chest by a Confederate sharpshooter. <br> <br> He was removed from the field and brought by stretcher to the command post of Brigadier General Samuel D. Sturgis. When he arrived Reno greeted Sturgis with the words, \"Hello, Sam, I'm dead!\" Sturgis, thinking that Reno was exaggerating, responded that it was not as bad as all that. Reno in turn declared: \"Yes, yes, I'm dead--good-bye!\" and died a few minutes later. <br> <br> D.H. Hill's official report included this statement of Reno's death: \"The Yankees on their side lost General Reno, a renegade Virginian, who was killed by a happy shot from the Twenty-third North Carolina.\" <br> <br> In 1889, a memorial to Reno was erected by IX Corps veterans at the location of his mortal wounding. This memorial can be found on present-day Reno Monument Road in the South Mountain State Battlefield.</p>",

Born in Owingsville, Kentucky in 1831, he pursued a military career early on, graduating from West Point at the age of 22. When war officially began in April, 1861 Hood was unwilling to either continue to serve in the United States army, or to maintain the neutrality of his native Kentucky. He decided instead to resign his commission in the US military and became a Confederate Cavalry Captain. He was soon promoted to Colonel, commanding the Texas 4th Infantry. <br> <br> On February 20, 1862 Hood was elevated to brigade command in the Confederate Army of the Potomac, whereupon he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General 11 days later. <br> <br> Hood distinguished himself as commander of what had come to be known as the \"Texas Brigade\" during the Peninsula Campaign, firmly establishing his reputation as an aggressive commander who was willing and even eager to personally lead his troops into combat. <br> <br> He performed especially well at the Battle of Gaines' Mill on June 27, 1862 in which he led his brigade in a charge that broke the Union line and helped to carry the day. Though he, himself, escaped injury, every other commissioned officer in the Texas Brigade was killed or wounded. <br> <br> Following the Seven Days Battles, Hood was promoted to division command and subsequently led a division in Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps in each of the campaigns of 1862 thru 1863. <br> <br> He demonstrated his skill in leading this division during the Northern Virginia Campaign when he became one of the primary leaders of shock troops during the large assault on Pope's left flank at the Second Battle of Manassas, an assault which nearly destroyed the Union army. <br> <br> As he pursued Union forces in retreat from the field, Hood became embroiled in a dispute with a superior officer involving captured ambulances. In response Longstreet had Hood arrested and then attempted to have him court-martialed <br> <br> During the opening phases of the Maryland Campaign Hood remained in the rear in virtual arrest. Just before the Battle of South Mountain, Hood's Texans implored Gen. Lee: \"Give us Hood!\" Despite Hood's continued refusal to apologize for his conduct, Lee intervened and decided to overrule Longstreet and restore Hood to command.<br> <br> During the Battle of Antietam, Hood's division came to the relief of \"Stonewall\" Jackson's corps on the left flank of the Confederate line, arriving in time to turn back an assault in the West Woods by the Union I Corps. His division subsequently engaged the Union XII Corps and sustained 50% casualties in the ensuing fighting. <br> <br> That evening, after the battle had come to a close, when Hood was asked by Lee where his division was he responded, \"They are lying on the field where you sent them. My division has been almost wiped out.\" <br> <br> Jackson was so impressed with Hood's performance at Antietam that he personally recommended his promotion to Major General, which was made official effective October 10, 1862. <br> <br> Hood went on to lead the assault on the Union left flank at the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. He was wounded during this assault, rendering his left arm useless for the remainder of his life. Hood was wounded again at the Battle of Chickamauga, this time requiring the amputation of his right leg. Even so, he went on to command an army during the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, though his performance at that level of command was notably less successful than as a division commander.</p>",

Gen. George B. McClellan that his opponent's army was much larger than it actually was. Still, he failed to gain the confidence of Robert E. Lee who, after the Peninsula Campaign ended, reassigned him to the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. In 1863, forces under his command successfully lifted the Union blockade of Galveston, Texas for a short time.</p>",

Despite the U.S. flag flying from the camp and a white flag that was flown soon after the attack started, Chivington's 700 men destroyed the encampment, killing and mutilating an estimated 70-133 Indians, about three quarters of whom were women and children. This attack, known as the Sand Creek Massacre, was investigated and condemned by the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, though no charges were brought against Chivington or his men.

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Wool's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>John Ellis Wool was the oldest officer actively serving in the United States Army during the Civil War. His military career spanned more than 50 years, beginning when he organized a volunteer brigade in 1812 and became the Captain of the Thirteenth United States Infantry. He served as the Inspector General for the entire army for several years until in 1832 he was sent to Europe to study other nations' military systems. In 1836, he took charge of driving the Cherokee Nation west over the \"Trail of Tears\" and in 1838 led a survey of the Maine/Canadian border to ensure defenses in case the difficulties in Canada at that time began to spread into the United States. By 1841 Wool had risen to the rank of Brigadier General.<br> <br> Wool organized troops in the West and was given credit by General Zachary Taylor for many of the successes during the Mexican-American War. Between this time and the Civil War, Wool continued to command divisions of the army and lead expeditions as assigned. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he organized and equipped the first regiments sent from New York to defend the nation's capital. He secured Fortress Monroe for the Union in 1861 and was promoted to Major General in May 1862. <br> <br> During the Maryland Campaign, Wool was in Baltimore in charge of the Middle Department. Uncertain of what Confederate General Robert E. Lee was planning, on September 5, 1862 he ordered Colonel Dixon S. Miles, commander of the Harpers Ferry garrison, to \"be energetic and active, and defend all places to the last extremity... There must be no abandoning of post, and shoot the first man that thinks of it.\" Despite those orders, Harpers Ferry would fall into Confederate hands ten days later.<br> <br> Upon his retirement in 1864, he was the fourth ranking general in the United States. He died at in 1869 at the age of 85. A painting of him, circa 1858, is on display at the National Portrait Gallery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Although born and raised in Sweden, John Ericsson eventually immigrated to America where in 1861, he signed a contract with the U.S. Navy to build an ironclad vessel. At the outbreak of the Civil War, both the Union and Confederacy began experimenting with ironclad warships. As the Confederacy began converting the captured USS <i>Merrimac</i> into the ironclad CSS <i>Virginia</i>, Ericsson began working on the Union's answer. <br> <br> Ericsson's contract stipulated that if his design failed, he would have to return his payment for the ship to the U.S. government, but he didn't care, since he was doing the ship out of love for America. \"I love this country, I love its people and its laws; and I would give my life for it just as soon as not,\" he explained. <br> <br> Fortunately, no repayment was necessary. Ericsson's design, conceived eight years earlier and presented to Napoleon III of France (who, though impressed, did nothing to develop the concept) included his invention of the \"screw\" propeller, a low silhouette, and revolving two-gun turret, and was a success. Although its famous four-hour duel with the <i>Virginia</i> at the Battle of Hampton Roads in March 1862 was a tactical draw, the <i>Monitor</i> prevented the destruction of the Union fleet at Hampton Roads. After the battle, the Navy ordered another 56 of Ericsson's \"monitors,\" as the design came to be known.<br> <br> Ericsson's engineering works were numerous, and in addition to the <i>Monitor</i>, he is also best known for his circa 1829 design of the <i>Novelty</i> steam locomotive, built with partner John Brathwaite in England.<br> <br> His achievements revolutionized naval warfare and gained him international recognition. Today his contributions towards both the Civil War and the engineering field are remembered in America with the John Ericsson National Memorial, located on the National Mall.</p>",

He and his 4,000 men waited for the word from \"Stonewall\" Jackson to bombard their opponents below. By the next day at 1pm, with growing impatience, Walker ordered the artillery to fire. By the morning of the 15th, the Confederates had completely surrounded the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry and its commander, Colonel Dixon S. Miles, called for surrender. Leaving A.P.

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Gibbon's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>John Gibbon was born on April 20, 1827 in the Holmesburg neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a boy Gibbon's father moved the family to Charlotte, North Carolina where he was a slaveholder. Gibbon graduated from West Point in 1847 and served in the Mexican-American War. He was considered an expert at artillery tactics and wrote an artillery manual in 1859 which would be used by both sides during the Civil War.<br> <br> At the outbreak of the Civil War Gibbon decided to side with the Union despite his southern ties. In 1861 Union Commander Irvin McDowell appointed Gibbon chief of artillery. He would serve in this position until May of 1862 when he was appointed Brigadier General of an infantry brigade then known as King's Wisconsin Brigade.<br> <br> Gibbon's first major conflict with his brigade was at the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run). On August 28, 1862 Union and Confederate forces clashed in Manassas for a second time. The day before the battle, on August 27, Confederate General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson's men were able to seize Union General John Pope's supply depot at Manassas Junction. After destroying Manassas Junction, Jackson fell back to the old battlefield of Manassas. Reuniting his troops along Stony Ridge, north of the Warrenton Turnpike, they settled in to await the arrival of Lee and Longstreet. <br> <br> But before they arrived, Jackson touched off the battle on the afternoon of August 28, when the four brigades of King's Union division moved east along the turnpike to reunite with Pope in Centreville. Jackson ordered his artillery to open fire on the enemy column. Gibbon sent his men to capture the guns, but after advancing up the slope, they realized that they were facing several brigades of Confederate infantry. Despite being outnumbered Gibbon and his brigade continued to fight as the two sides traded volleys only 75 yards apart. By 9:00 P.M. Gibbon broke off the engagement and withdrew to the turnpike in an orderly fashion, the Confederates too exhausted to pursue. The fighting at Brawner Farm had ended in a hideous tactical stalemate. After two more days of fighting the Union forces had been defeated and the <br> Confederates launched the Maryland Campaign, what would be their last major invasion of the North. <br> <br> Following the Second Battle of Manassas Gibbons and his men moved on to South Mountain. Days before the conflict there Major General George B. McClellan obtained a copy of Special Order 191 which detailed that Confederate General Robert E. Lee's forces would be divided and vulnerable to attack. Acting quickly, McClellan ordered men to South Mountain where the Union troops could move against the isolated Confederate forces. Fighting erupted on September 14, 1862 in the mountain passes: Crampton's, Turner's, and Fox's Gaps. Gibbons and his brigade were charged with taking Turner's Gap from the Confederates, a task they successfully completed. Upon hearing of the valiant fighting of Gibbon's brigade McClellan commented that \"they must be made of iron.\" From that point forward Gibbon's brigade would be known as The Iron Brigade.<br> <br> Despite a victory at South Mountain, McClellan failed to crush Lee's remaining forces, allowing the Confederates to reassemble and take the garrison at Harper's Ferry - the stage was set for the Battle of Antietam. On September 16, McClellan confronted Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Sharpsburg, Maryland. At dawn September 17, Hooker's corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee's left flank that began the single bloodiest day in American military history. Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller's cornfield, where Gibbons' Iron Brigade attacked from the turnpike, pushing back Jackson's men. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. Late in the day, Burnside's corps finally got into action, crossing the stone bridge over Antietam Creek and rolling up the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and counterattacked, driving back Burnside and saving the day. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout the 18th, while removing his wounded south of the river. McClellan did not renew the assaults. After dark, Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah Valley. <br> <br> Gibbon would serve as the commander of the Iron Brigade until November of 1862. His famous brigade would go on to suffer the highest percentage of casualties of any brigade in the war, while Gibbon would go on to command the 2nd Division and the XVII Corps. He would fight at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Chancellorsville Campaign, the Overland Campaign, the Siege of Petersburg, and in the Appomattox Campaign. Gibbon would be one of three commissioners of the Confederate Surrender. Following the war Gibbon stayed in the military and would retire as a Major General in 1891. He passed away five years later at the age of 68.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Poet, journalist and abolitionist, John Greenleaf Whittier was known as one of the Fireside Poets, a group of popular American poets during the latter half of the 19th century. The Fireside Poets' adherence to poetic convention made their work suitable for memorization and recitation in school and at home around the fireplace. Whittier's immersion in Quakerism heavily influenced his thinking, as did his association and friendship with noted abolitionist, journalist and publisher William Lloyd Garrison. <br> <br> Whittier's first poem to be published, The Exile's Departure, appeared in Garrison's newspaper, the Newburyport Free Press in 1826. Thereafter, Garrison encouraged his education, writing and active participation in the abolitionist cause. Under Garrison's tutelage, Whittier edited newspapers in Boston and Hartford. He also continued to write, publishing his first volume of poems, Legends of New England, in 1831. Two years later, Whittier published his antislavery pamphlet, Justice and Expediency, which catapulted him to prominence in abolitionist circles. He became a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society that same year. From 1838 to 1840, Whittier served as editor of one of the leading anti-slavery papers in the North, The Pennsylvania Freeman.<br> <br> By the 1840s, Whittier broke with Garrison over how best to accomplish abolitionist goals. He favored gradual change via established political methods, while Garrison called for \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves\" and the use of passive resistance. After suffering a physical breakdown, Whittier ended his active involvement in the abolitionist movement and returned home to recuperate. He incorporated his views of justice, tolerance and humanitarianism into his writing, publishing Voices of Freedom, a collection of antislavery poetry, in 1846. <br> <br> Following the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment, Whittier shifted his focus, depicting nature, rural life and pastoral scenes. In 1866, he published his best known poem, Snow-Bound. Whittier's later collections of verse, including The Tent on the Beach (1867), Among the Hills (1868), and The Pennsylvania Pilgrim (1872), were also well received.</p>",

He was a poet at Brown and, always an avid writer, became a published author after the war, even co-writing with Nicolay a 10-volume Lincoln biography. In 1870, he took a six-year break from politics to work as a journalist for the New York Tribune.<br> <br> His respite from government did not last long, though. Upon his return, he became the Assistant Secretary of State under Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and James A. Garfield. In 1897, he was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain, and a year later, John Hay was named Secretary of State, a position he held under both Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.<br> <br> A skilled diplomat, Hay's accomplishments as Secretary of State included the Open Door Policy toward China, negotiation of more than 50 treaties, and preparations for construction of the Panama Canal. Hay was serving as Secretary of State at the time of his death in 1905.</p>",

It ended in disaster as Morgan and 700 members of his cavalry brigade were captured attempting to re-cross the Ohio River. In November, Morgan and several other officers escaped from prison and made their way back to Kentucky where Morgan was assigned command of the Trans-Allegheny Department.

Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia soundly defeated Pope's army at the Second Battle of Manassas in August 1862 and Pope was relieved of his command. The Army of Virginia was then folded into George McClellan's Army of Potomac and Pope was reassigned to the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota where he spent the remainder of the war pursuing renegade Plains Indians. </span><br /><br /><span>Pope remained in the army after the war and was appointed governor of the Third Military District, but was then sent west to assist in the wars against the Apache. Pope's reputation suffered a serious blow in 1878 when a Board of Inquiry affirmed his responsibility for the army's defeat at Second Manassas, but the resulting publicity had little effect on the general's career. Pope was promoted to major general in the regular army in 1882 and retired in 1886.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>John Price was a runaway slave who was arrested by a federal marshal on September 13, 1858 in Oberlin, Ohio under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act. Because of Oberlin's reputation as an abolitionist stronghold, Price was removed to nearby Wellington to await transfer to Columbus, Ohio and then Kentucky. However, anti-slavery activists in Oberlin and Wellington learned of Price's arrest and rushed to the hotel where Price was being held to demand his release. Negotiations failed and the crowd then stormed the hotel, removed Price by force and conducted him to freedom in Canada. A federal grand jury brought indictments against 37 of the men who freed Price, including 12 who were free blacks. State officials then arrested the federal marshal, his deputies, and several other men involved in John Price's detention. After lengthy negotiations, state officials agreed to release the marshal and his men in exchange for 35 of the men 37 men facing federal indictment. The two remaining men were convicted of assisting in the escape of a fugitive slave but received light sentences. They then appealed their conviction of the grounds that the Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional. The appeal failed and the convicted men served their sentences. The Price affair became a national sensation and like the Dred Scott decision, helped propel the nation toward Civil War. Two participants in the rescue - Lewis Sheridan Leary and John A. Copeland - along with Oberlin resident Shields Green went on to join John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859. Leary was killed during the attack. Copeland and Green were captured, tried, convicted of treason and executed on December 16, 1859.</p>",

A graduate of West Point, Sedgwick quickly rose to the rank of Brigadier and later Major General in the Union army. This was largely due to his previous military experience; he had served in the Mexican-American War, the Seminole War, and other Native American conflicts through the 1850's. <br> \"Uncle John\" was a born leader who, early in the war, established himself as one who commanded not only men, but also their respect. When the war began Sedgwick first served as acting inspector general for the city of Washington DC before being promoted to Brigadier General in August of 1861. He led a division in Maj. Gen. Edwin Sumner's Corps during the Peninsula Campaign, during which he was wounded in the arm at the Battle of Glendale on June 30, 1862. <br> <br> During the Maryland Campaign, Sedgwick commanded a division in the newly reorganized Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Antietam, Sedgwick's division played a key role in the first phase of the battle. II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner sent Sedgwick's division in a mass assault toward Jackson's lines without first engaging in an effective reconnaissance of the field. As a result Sedgwick's division took heavily Confederate fire from three sides as they advanced, resulting in extensive causalities. <br> <br> Sedgwick himself had his horse was shot out from under him and was his three times, in the wrist, leg, and shoulder. He had to be carried off the field after being rendered unconscious by his wounds, and spent the next 90 days recovering before returning to the army after the Battle of Fredericksburg.<br> <br> When Sedgwick returned to duty, he was promoted to corps command, eventually settling on the VI Corps, which he commanded for the remainder of his life. His Corps took part in the fighting at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and the Overland Campaign. On May 9th, 1864 Sedgwick was killed by Confederate artillery fire at Spotsylvania Courthouse shortly after commenting that his position was out of range of the Confederate gunners. His death earned Sedgwick recognition as the highest ranking Union officer to be killed in the war. When the news of Uncle John's death reached General Grant, his response was, \"is he really dead?\"</p>",

By the age of 35, Garrett owned much of the stock in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and was subsequently elected to the railroad's Board of Directors. He was elected president of the B&O Railroad on November 17, 1858 and would serve in that position for 26 years. <br> <br> Despite sympathizing with the southern cause, Garrett's business allegiance was with the Union. His railroad was utilized to transport Union soldiers, equipment, supplies, and it linked Washington, D.C. to the rest of the country. The B&O was the first railroad in history to carry out a military transport. At the beginning of the Civil War, B&O operated 514 miles of rail. <br> <br> Any ties Garrett and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had with the Confederate cause were severed after 1861. The B&O Annual Report documented the damage and sabotage that the Confederates, mainly troops under the command of Stonewall Jackson, had inflicted to the rails. The report noted 36.5 miles of track, 26 bridges, 102 miles of telegraph, and two water stations destroyed by the Confederates. Much of this damage was being repaired in the fall of 1861 but Jackson returned and destroyed the track between Harpers Ferry and Martinsburg, Virginia again in December 1862.<br> <br> Garrett worked well with the Edwin Stanton, the U.S. Secretary of War. Garrett worked with Stanton to have the railroad protected by the Union forces. By the summer of 1862, the B&O Railroad, and its employees, swore an allegiance and loyalty to the Union. This cooperation resulted in formations of units such as the \"Railroad Brigade\" under the command of Dixon S. Miles at Harpers Ferry. <br> <br> Garrett would continue to support the Union in 1863 with transporting 20,000 soldiers to Chattanooga along protecting Washington, D.C. in 1864, when his railroad workers reported Confederate activity in the Shenandoah Valley.<br> <br> After the war, Garrett focused on rebuilding and expanding the railroad. He also spent time with philanthropic pursuits; he was a trustee of the Peabody Institute, a supporter of the creation of the Johns Hopkins University and Medical Institutions. The state of Maryland honored him by naming Garrett County after him.</p>",

When Virginia seceded her father enlisted in the 2nd Virginia Infantry and Belle returned home to Martinsburg, where she worked as a nurse. <br> <br> Union troops occupied Martinsburg on July 3, 1861 and the next day, Independence Day, several Union soldiers noticed that the Boyd house displayed Confederate flags. The Union soldiers attempted to raise the American flag over the house to the protest of the occupants. When one of the soldiers cursed at Boyd's mother, she drew a pistol and killed him. Boyd was acquitted of any wrongdoing, but guards were posted around the home. <br> <br> Boyd used this as an opportunity to charm one of the officers into providing her with information on Federal troop movements prior to the First Battle of Manassas, which she sent to Confederate officers via her slave. Belle would continue to provide Union secrets to the Confederacy and achieved much fame for her exploits. She was ultimately betrayed by her lover in July 1862, was arrested and imprisoned for a month. <br> <br> In 1864 Boyd volunteered to carry Confederate papers to England aboard the blockade runner Greyhound, but during her journey the ship was stopped by a Union naval vessel. Boyd fell in love with her captor, Captain Samuel Hardinge, and the two were married in England. When Hardinge returned to the United States he was arrested and brought up on charges of aiding and abetting the enemy, who just so happened to be his wife, and died in prison. Boyd remained in England for two years and would go on to achieve success as a stage actress.</p>",

In 1864 Grierson was appointed commander of a cavalry division in the Army of the Tennessee, then commander all cavalry units in the District of West Tennessee, and finally commander of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Mississippi. <br> <br> When the war ended, Grierson chose to remain in the Regular Army and was appointed a colonel in the cavalry. In 1866, he organized the 10th U.S. Cavalry, a unit composed entirely of African American troopers, which came to be known as the Buffalo Soldiers. Grierson's faith in these troops, his respect for Native American culture and his lack of West Point credentials all combined to distance him from his fellow officers and superiors. Nevertheless, Grierson went on to a distinguished career in the post-war army and he retired a brigadier general in 1890.</p>",

It's no wonder he went on to become the nation's 23rd president, but a lesser known fact about him might be that he also served in the Civil War. <br> <br> Although initially reluctant to get enlist in the Union army because of concern about his family's financial well-being, Harrison found himself lured in by the shortage of recruits answering the call to serve. After offering his help, if needed, to Indiana Governor Oliver Morton, he was tasked with organizing a regiment and commissioned as a second lieutenant. In August 1862, his regiment was sent south to Louisville, Kentucky to join the Union army as the 70th Indiana Infantry, with Harrison promoted to the rank of colonel.<br> <br> The infantry spent much of the war conducting reconnaissance work and protecting railroads, but in 1864, finally made it to the front lines as part of William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign.<br> <br> In the campaign, Harrison was given command of a brigade in the XX Corps and participated in the Battles of Resaca, Cassville, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, Kennesaw Mountain, Marietta, Peachtree Creek and Atlanta. His brigade also fought in the Battle of Nashville. With a final rank of brigadier general, Harrison remained in the army until June 1865, after having marched in the Grand Review in Washington, D.C in May.<br> <br> A lawyer before the war, Harrison resumed his law practice afterwards, while remaining active in state politics. He served as a U.S. Senator from 1881 to 1887 before winning the White House in 1888, one of five Union veterans to become president after the war.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Though destined to become a general in the Confederacy, Bushrod Rust Johnson was born in Ohio. At age 18, defying the pacifism of his Quaker family, Johnson enlisted in the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, from which he graduated in 1840 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry. He fought in the both the Seminole War in Florida and the Mexican-American War, but was forced to resign from the army in 1847 after conspiring to sell government goods for personal profit. He then worked as a teacher, professor of philosophy and chemistry at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky, and as professor of engineering at the University of Nashville. <br> <br> After the start of the Civil War, Johnson re-entered military service on June 28, 1861, as a colonel of engineers in the Tennessee Militia, although a week later this commission was changed to be in the Confederate States Army. He was instrumental in the construction of Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River in Tennessee and was promoted to brigadier general on January 24, 1862. Just days before the Battle of Fort Donelson, he was placed in command of the fort but served in that capacity only briefly, as the higher ranking Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow arrived just hours after Johnson assumed command. The fort and its army surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on February 16, 1862, but two days later Johnson was able to walk unimpeded through the porous Union army lines and escaped capture.<br> <br> At the Battle of Shiloh, Johnson was severly wounded while in command of a division. He recovered from his wounds and served in major battles of the Western Theater, including Perryville, Stones River, Chickamauga, and the Siege of Knoxville.<br> <br> Promoted to major general on May 21, 1864, Johnson moved to the east where he served the remainder of the war in the Army of Northern Virginia. At the Battle of the Crater, his troops captured three stands of colors and 130 prisoners. His service in the Siege of Petersburg also included the battles at White Oak Road and Five Forks. His division was shattered at the Battle of Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865, although he was again able to escape capture. He was paroled at Appomattox Court House without a command.<br> <br> Johnson returned to teaching and became a professor and co-chancellor of the University of Nashville with former Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. His health failing, Bushrod Johnson retired in 1875 to a farm Brighton, Illinois, where he died in 1880.</p>",

Like many future Civil War officers, Wilcox fought in the Mexican-American War, earning a brevet promotion to first lieutenant for gallantry at Chapultepec in 1847. After the war, he served as an instructor of military tactics at West Point, later publishing what became the standard textbook on rifles and rifle firing. <br> <br> After Tennessee's secession from the Union, Wilcox resigned from the U.S. Army in June 1861 and accepted appointment as colonel of the 9th Alabama Infantry the following month. Although present at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, his unit saw no action. In October 1861, Wilcox was promoted to brigadier general and assigned to Longstreet's division of the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. <br> <br> His brigade played important roles during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, and the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. At the Battle of Salem Church, part of the Chancellorsville campaign, Wilcox's brigade fought a successful delaying action, which ultimately prevented Union VI Corps from reuniting with General Hooker's Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville, causing Hooker to abandon the entire campaign.<br> <br> Wilcox was promoted to major general in August 1863, and given command of a division within A.P. Hill's Third Corps. His division was heavily engaged at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, during the Siege of Petersburg, and up to the end at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. Wilcox's desperate stand during the final days at Petersburg allowed Longstreet to maneuver into position to cover Lee's retreat.<br> <br> Wilcox lived quietly in Washington after the war. President Grover Cleveland appointed him chief of the railroad division of the Land Office, where he worked until his death in 1890.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Businessman, politician and Union army officer, Cadwallader Colden Washburn studied law at Rock Island, Illinois, before moving to Mineral Point, Wisconsin, where he established a legal practice in 1842. During this time, Washburn also speculated in real estate, founded the Mineral Point Bank, and obtained financial interests in lumber, water, railroading, and flour-milling. <br> <br> In 1854, Washburn was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican, and served three terms (one brother, Israel, was a founding member of the Republican Party, another brother, Elihu, was a nine-term congressman from Illinois). He served as a delegate to the 1861 Washington Peace Conference, a final effort by the states to prevent war. When the Civil War started, Washburn was appointed colonel of the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry. He rose to the rank of brigadier general in July 1862, then major general on November 29, 1862. Washburn led a cavalry division during the early stages of Grant's VicksburgCcampaign, and commanded three divisions from XVI Corps during siege operations at Vicksburg. During the fall of 1863, he led a division of XIII Corps in support of Union Gen. Banks' coastal campaign against Texas. In August 1864, Washburn narrowly escaped capture during a nighttime raid on his Memphis headquarters by Confederate forces under General Nathan Bedford Forest. He served out the war in an administrative role, resigning his commission in May 1865. <br> <br> After the war, Washburn returned to Wisconsin and resumed his business and political careers. He was elected again to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving two terms. In the fall of 1871, Washburn successfully ran for governor of Wisconsin and served from 1872 to 1874. Failing to capture a U.S. Senate seat in 1875, he retired from politics. Washburn founded Washburn, Crosby & Company, which eventually became the General Mills Corporation.</p>",

Not wishing to create a martyr, Lincoln sent Vallandigham through the lines to the Confederacy, from where he travelled by ship to Canada. There Vallandigham won the Democratic nomination for Governor of Ohio in absentia, but lost the general election in a landslide.<br> <br> After the war, Vallandigham returned to Ohio and attempted to resurrect his political career, running on an anti-Reconstruction platform.

H. Hill's division remained in the Richmond area, and did not move north with the rest of the Army of Northern Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign of August 1862.<br> <br> He was, however, moved north to rejoin the rest of the army before Lee launched an invasion into Maryland in September 1862, hoping to shift the war's focus away from Virginia and beat Union forces on their own soil.<br> Hill's reputation was tarnished when he received the blame for the lost copy of Special Orders 191, which had fallen into the hands of Union commander George McClellan. This order detailed the movements of Lee's army, and revealed that Lee had split his force into five separate groups. Hill's division was ordered to \"Cross South Mountain west of Middletown and go into camp at Boonsboro.\" Hill's movement in response to these orders placed his division as the primary barrier to impede the advance of the Army of the Potomac, which was marching to cut off the disparate elements of Lee's command before they could rejoin together. Hill's men performed admirably at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14-15, buying enough time for the full strength of Lee's army to arrive on the field of Antietam on September 17.<br> <br> During the fighting at Antietam Hill's division again saw fierce action, this time in the sunken road (\"Bloody Lane\"). Despite having three horses shot out from under him, Hill rallied detached forces from several different brigades to successfully hold the line against repeated Union attacks and prevent a Union breakthrough for nearly four hours, from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.<br> <br> Even when the Federals were finally able to overwhelm Hill's position, successfully driving his men from the sunken road and piercing the center of the Confederate line, sheer exhaustion and confusion kept them from following up this success with any additional attack on this part of the battlefield.</p>",

He narrowly avoided disaster in 1864 when one of his a gunboat squadrons was briefly stranded on the Red River and he finished the war as commander of the North Atlantic Squadron. Porter was appointed Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy in 1865, and was promoted to Vice Admiral a year later. In 1870 he became the navy's senior officer when he was promoted to Admiral.

            "bodyText": "<p>A U.S. Congressman (1845-1851) and later Senator (1861-1863) from Pennsylvania, David Wilmot sponsored an amendment to an appropriations bill in the House of Representatives on August 8, 1846, which proposed the banning of slavery in land gained from Mexico in the Mexican-American War. The resolution, which became known as the Wilmot Proviso, passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. During the next session of Congress, the appropriations bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, was bought up again and passed by the House, only to again languish in the Senate.<br> <br> In the Presidential election of 1848, Wilmot threw his support behind the new Free Soil Party and its candidate, Martin Van Buren, after Democrats rejected the inclusion of the Wilmot Proviso in their platform. The Free Soilers distilled the Proviso down to the campaign slogan: \"No more slave states and no more slave territory.\" Unlike mainstream abolitionists, Wilmot did not abhor the practice of slavery on moral grounds; rather he feared that the South, with its peculiar institution, was gaining too much power.<br> <br> Having left the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, Wilmot was forced to give up his House seat in 1851. He was elected as a presiding judge of the 13th Judicial District of Pennsylvania. Wilmot then worked to establish the newly founded Republican Party, chairing the platform committee and serving as a delegate to the 1856 national convention. In 1857, he ran unsuccessfully as the first Republican candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania, and three years later he served again as a delegate to his party's national convention. Wilmot helped secure the nomination for Abraham Lincoln, but refused to accept a cabinet post in the Lincoln administration. Instead, he was elected to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Lincoln's Secretary of War, Simon Cameron. Wilmot participated as a member of the Ceace Conference of 1861, a last-ditch attempt to bridge the country's divisions exacerbated by the resolution which bears his name.</p>",

After serving as commander of the Mississippi Militia, Van Dorn received a commission in the regular Confederate army as a colonel of infantry in March 1861. <br> <br> In January 1862, Van Dorn, now a major general, was given command of the newly-formed Trans-Mississippi military district. Van Dorn immediately faced a Union invasion of Arkansas. He personally took charge of his two Confederate armies and devised a complex flanking maneuver designed not only to defeat the smaller Union force, but also to advance north through Missouri, capture St. Louis and threaten Grant's armies. Despite his numerical advantage, Van Dorn's two-pronged attack on entrenched Federal positions at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, failed due to delays, lack of supplies, and the loss of his top two army commanders. The Union forces counterattacked and drove Van Dorn's armies from the field.<br> <br> Van Dorn suffered a similar fate at the Second Battle of Corinth. Again failing to properly reconnoiter the defensive position of his opponent, Van Dorn's attack on Gen. Rosecran's Federal troops fell short and was eventually repulsed, forcing the Confederates to retreat. Following the battle, Van Dorn was relieved of his army command and reassigned to command Gen. John C. Pemberton's cavalry. As a cavalry commander Van Dorn would achieve his greatest success in a raid on Grant's supply depot at Holly Springs, Mississippi, on December 20, 1862. Van Dorn's raid thwarted Grant's initial plan to attack Vicksburg and cut the Confederacy in half. On May 7, 1863, Van Dorn was shot dead at his headquarters by a husband jealous of the attentions Van Dorn paid his wife</p>",

Pollard was then rearrested by order of U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, imprisoned at Fort Monroe, paroled again, and exchanged for Albert D. Richardson, a well-known correspondent for the New York Tribune. Pollard published several books on slavery and the war including, in 1866, The Lost Cause, in which the phrase \"lost cause\" and its definition made their first appearance.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Born the son of a Boston reverend in 1794, Edward Everett - arguably a genius - was admitted to Harvard University at the age of 13, and his list of accomplishments in the years that followed is long.<br> <br> He served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 10 years, was governor of Massachusetts, a U.S. Senator, the 20th U.S. Secretary of State, president of his alma mater, a U.S. minister to England, and the vice presidential candidate for the short-lived Constitutional Union Party.<br> <br> In addition to all that, he happened to be a very gifted lecturer and orator, once raising $70,000 for the preservation of George Washington's Mount Vernon just through his speeches. It was a talent for which Everett was invited to deliver the keynote address at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19, 1863, speaking prior to President Lincoln, who had been invited to deliver \"a few appropriate remarks.\" <br> <br> Speaking to the crowd for more than two hours, Everett, after hours of meticulous research, brought to life the three-day Battle of Gettysburg - in which over 50,000 troops were casualties - moving many in the audience to tears. He connected the heroic struggle for freedom in the classical and modern worlds with the valor and sacrifice demonstrated on America's battlefields. He went on to predict that North and South would eventually reconcile and the result would be a stronger Union. <br> <br> The words most remembered on that day are, of course, Lincoln's, although the president was actually only at the podium for three minutes. The two congratulated each other afterwards, with Lincoln noting \"In our respective parts yesterday, you could not have been excused to make a short address, nor I a long one.\" Later, Everett wrote to Lincoln, expressing his admiration of the president's words, saying \"I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.\"<br> <br> A vehement supporter of the Union, Everett campaigned extensively for Lincoln's re-election in 1864, exhausting himself in the process and dying just two months after the election. He is today interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>",

Like many young men of his station, Pakenham purchased a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Army at only 16 years of age. However he proved to be a very capable leader, distinguishing himself in battles in the West Indies and early in the Napoleonic Wars. Wounded twice through this travails, and brother-in-law to another famous general, the Duke of Wellington, he earned the respect of troops and was reported to be generally liked by soldiers and officers alike.</p><p>His tactical expertise and successes earned him a promotion to general in 1814 at age 36, and an appointment to command the British forces in North America in the war against the United States. Although personally opposed to Britain’s involvement in the war, Pakenham was the consummate gentleman and eminently dedicated to his post, and so headed to the United States dutifully, but tragically.</p><p>When he arrived to lead an army to invade the important trading port of New Orleans, he was appalled by Andrew Jackson’s decision to send troops in the middle of the night to raid the British camp. Preferring what he thought to be more noble warfare of open field sieges, he arranges his men to attack New Orleans in two flanks in early January 1815.</p><p>Underestimating the power of the American guns, this decision turns out to be disastrous. In the 30-minute Battle of New Orleans, Pakenham was first hit by grapeshot, killing his horse and wounding him in the knee. As he rose from the battlefield to mount another horse and continue riding forward he was hit in the arm. The final shot proved fatal, hitting him in the chest. Sir Edward Michael Pakenham died on the battlefield, shortly after giving the order to call forward the reserves and keep pushing toward New Orleans.</p><p>Pakenham’s body was shipped back to Ireland to be interred in a family cemetery.  A generation after his death, Pakenham was remembered in an essay written by his subordinate officers at the Battle of New Orleans, published in the 1941: “in the discharge of his duty to his king and country, so eminently upheld the character of a true British soldier.”</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A homeopathic doctor and Union officer in the Civil War, Edward A. Wild graduated from Harvard with a medical degree in 1846. He joined his father's homeopathic practice after studying medicine in Paris, France. In 1855, Wild received his first taste of military action in the Crimean War while serving as a medical officer in the Ottoman Army. Following the war, Wild returned to his native Massachusetts and resumed his medical practice. <br> <br> At the outbreak of the Civil War, Wild, favoring the command of troops over the practice of medicine, recruited a company of men to serve in the 1st Massachusetts Infantry. As a captain, he led his company into battle at First Bull Run and later in the Peninsula Campaign, during which he was wounded in the hand. He was promoted to colonel of the 35th Massachusetts Infantry in the Army of the Potomac. In September 1862, Wild was wounded at the Battle of South Mountain which required the amputation of his left arm.<br> <br> In April 1863, Wild recovered sufficiently from his wound to accept an assignment as a recruiting officer with the rank of brigadier general. Strongly against slavery, he labored hard to recruit black soldiers into the United States Colored Troops, as well as officers to lead them. Wild assumed command of a unit of black volunteers and freed slaves, known as \"Wild's African Brigade,\" which served in numerous skirmishes and battles around Charleston, South Carolina, such as Camden Court House in December 1863. In an expedition along the North Carolina coast during the winter of 1863--1864, Wild's troops terrorized the local white population. Freeing and recruiting slaves along the way, Wild's frightening reputation among Southerners grew after he allowed former slaves to whip their former owner. He generated even more controversy by taking three women as hostages and sanctioning the wanton destruction and looting of property.<br> <br> In 1864, Wild's command was transferred to the Army of the Potomac, participating in the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. At the Battle of Wilson's Wharf in May 1864, his brigade became famous in the North for fending off a determined attack by Confederate General Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, despite Lee's vast superiority in numbers. In April 1865, Wild's brigade, as part of a larger force of African American troops under Godfrey Weitzel, occupied the former Confederate capital of Richmond.<br> <br> Following the war, Wild's wounds precluded a return to his medical practice. He worked in Georgia for the Freedmen's Bureau, but became mired in controversy and was relieved from duty by General Grant. Wild then moved west and operated silver mines in Nevada and Ontario, Canada. He died while surveying a rail line in Columbia, South America.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>\"Now He Belongs to the Ages.\" - Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton on Lincoln's death, April 15, 1865<br> <br> Edwin M. Stanton was born in 1814 in Steubenville, Ohio, the oldest of four children. He attended Kenyon College and went on to become a lawyer in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. before being appointed U.S. Attorney General in 1860. Stanton was known for his tenacity and antislavery political views. <br> <br> At the start of the Lincoln administration Stanton resigned from his post as Attorney General to serve as Secretary of War Simon Cameron's legal advisor. However, Cameron and Lincoln did not agree on strategies for the war, and after Cameron suggested arming freed slaves to serve in the Union army he was dismissed. Unaware of Stanton's role in this proposal Lincoln appointed Stanton to the post of Secretary of War in 1862. <br> <br> The Maryland Campaign began just a few short months after Stanton took on the role of Secretary of War. In this role Stanton was aggressive but effective, known to throw his weight around to pressure action from politicians and military leaders. Though his forcefulness made him unpopular, Lincoln stood by Stanton, once calling him \"the rock on the beach of our national ocean against which the breakers dash and roar.\" <br> <br> On April 15, 1865 when Stanton arrived at the Preston House, where President Lincoln passed away following his mortal wounding at the hands of John Wilkes Booth, it is thought that Stanton said of Lincoln \"now he belongs to the ages.\" Stanton would continue to serve as Secretary of War during the Johnson administration, however, his service to Johnson was fraught with conflict. Stanton did not agree with Johnson's more relaxed Reconstruction policies which allowed the Southern states to rejoin the Union without guaranteeing rights for African Americans. When Johnson attempted to remove Stanton from office the House initiated the impeachment of Johnson, arguing that this action violated the Tenure of Office Act. Johnson escaped impeachment by one vote in the Senate, and Stanton remained in his post until 1868.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Sumner's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>When David E. Twiggs was removed from command in March 1861, Abraham Lincoln chose Edwin Sumner as his replacement, appointing him as one of only three brigadier generals in the regular army. This made Sumner the first new Union general created by the secession crisis. <br> <br> Sumner was initially dispatched to the Department of the Pacific in California, which meant he took no part in the 1861 campaigns. He was, however, brought back east to command a division in November 1861. This meant that Sumner was ideally positioned to take command of one of the new corps when the Army of the Potomac was reorganized in the spring of 1862. Although he was the oldest general in the Army of the Potomac, Sumner led the II Corps throughout the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. <br> <br> Despite performing poorly during the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, Sumner's initiative in sending reinforcements across the dangerously rain-swollen Chickahominy River prevented a Union disaster at the Battle of Seven Pines and garnered Sumner a brevet promotion to Major General. <br> <br> When the Army of the Potomac pulled away from Richmond, Sumner's II Corps sailed from Fort Monroe back to Washington, where they awaited orders. On August 27 Halleck extracted a promise from McClellan to immediately advance Sumner's and Franklin's corps to support Pope at Manassas, but later that same day McClellan cancelled the orders of march. He instead held Sumner in Washington for the next three days while the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) was being fought.<br> <br> On the 29th Halleck again ordered Franklin and Sumner to march to Pope's assistance early in the morning, but though Franklin moved his men to Annandale, Sumner's corps did not even leave the Washington fortifications.<br> Sumner remained in Washington until midday on August 30, when his corps finally began marching toward Centreville, arriving on the 31st, the day after the Second Battle of Manassas had ended. <br> <br> Sumner found himself in the center of controversy in the aftermath of the Battle of Antietam. When he saw the developing fight between the Union I and XII Corps and Jackson's Confederates on the morning of September 17, without waiting for orders Sumner ordered John Sedgwick's division to push forward into the West Woods even as William French's division pushed toward the Confederate center. Though French's attack met with some success, the advance of Sedgwick's division was devastated by a Confederate counterattack, and Sedgwick and his men were forced to retreat back to the position from whence they had started their advance, sustaining over 2,200 casualties. <br> <br> This action has earned Sumner criticism for numerous reasons: the recklessness of the attack, his lack of coordination with the other corps commanders, personally accompanying Sedgwick's division into the fight, poor reconnaissance of the area before moving forward, his failure to secure his flanks as the division advanced, and losing contact with and control of French's division during the advance.</p>",

Sherrill and some of his officers, however, were not willing to give up and tried to rally their men, distributing cartridges and lending general inspiration. <br> <br> As a result of these actions Sherrill was shot in the jaw and had to be taken to the rear to be tended. The Harpers Ferry garrison was forced to surrender two days later and Sherrill's men were paroled and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois.

            "bodyText": "<p>Inventor, mechanical engineer and manufacturing pioneer, Eli Whitney is best known as the inventor of the cotton gin, patented in 1794. An unforeseen byproduct of Whitney's invention, a labor-saving device, was to help preserve the institution of slavery in the South by making cotton production highly profitable. Exports of cotton from the U.S. skyrocketed exponentially after the introduction of the cotton gin. Between 1820 and 1860, cotton represented over half the value of U.S. exports. <br> <br> Prior to the invention of the cotton gin, slavery was in decline. The profitably of crops grown with slave labor, such as rice, tobacco, indigo and cotton was steadily decreasing. Some slaveholders began freeing their slaves in response. By effortlessly separating the seeds from the cotton fibers, the cotton gin removed the main obstacle to producing cleaned cotton. As the price of cotton decreased, the demand for cotton soared; so too did the demand for more land and more slaves to grow and pick the cotton. The number of slave states increased from six in 1790 to 15 in 1860. By 1860, one in three Southerners was a slave. The labor-saving device Whitney created effectively rejuvenated the institution of slavery in the South, split American society and thus was a significant factor leading to disunion and the Civil War.<br> <br> Whitney struggled unsuccessfully to make money from his invention; a lack of capital and the ease with which the cotton gin could be pirated conspired against him. Patent infringement litigation drained his dwindling resources even further. Knowing nothing about the manufacture of small arms, Whitney signed a contract with the Federal government in 1798 to deliver 10,000 guns in just over two years. He delivered the last guns to the government in January 1809, almost nine years late. In the process, Whitney experimented manufacturing his guns with uniform and interchangeable parts, which themselves were created by special-purpose machines. Although he did not originate the idea of mass manufacture of products, Whitney contributions to the development of American technology helped transform the North into the industrial powerhouse it would later become.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Prior to his becoming the first conspicuous casualty of the Civil War, Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth led a short but interesting life. During his 24 years, he was a lawyer, a colonel, and a close friend of President Abraham Lincoln, whom he met in Springfield, Illinois after moving there to work in Lincoln's office and who he followed to Washington.<br> <br> With an interest in military science that began well before the start of the Civil War - he would have gone to the U.S. Military Academy if he could have afforded it - Ellsworth responded enthusiastically to Lincoln's 1861 call for troops by raising of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry, which he dressed in distinctive Zouave-style uniforms, fashioned after those worn by French colonial troops.<br> <br> Ironically, perhaps, for all of his drills and militia training, Ellsworth's death came not in a battle, but instead inside the long-demolished Marshall House hotel in Alexandria, Virginia. The building's owner had a raised a large Confederate flag from its roof, which was visible from the White House. Offering to retrieve the flag for the president, Ellsworth led his 11th New York across the Potomac River and into Alexandria. Ellsworth succeeded in removing the flag, but as he descended the stairs from the building's roof, the hotel's owner, James W. Jackson, shot and killed Ellsworth with a single shotgun blast to the chest.<br> <br> Lincoln had the body of Ellsworth, whom he called \"the greatest little man I ever met,\" laid in state at the White House before it was taken to his home state of New York for burial. His memory lived on throughout the war as \"Remember Ellsworth\" became a rallying cry for supporters of the Union, regiments were named in his honor and artifacts related to his death became popular souvenirs.</p>",

Grant, Parker was appointed an engineer in the Army of the Tennessee. When Grant became commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, Parker was selected as Grant's adjutant. Parker then accompanied Grant to Washington after Grant was appointed Chief of the Armies. In late 1864, Parker was appointed Military Secretary to Grant with the rank of lieutenant colonel. <br> <br> He was present at the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia where he helped draft the surrender documents and render them in his own hand. At the time of the surrender, General Robert E. Lee is said to have mistaken Parker for a black man, but apologized saying, \"I am glad to see one real American here,\" to which Parker responded, \"We are all Americans, sir.\" <br> <br> Parker was brevetted a brigadier general of volunteers on April 9, 1865 and continued to serve as Grant's secretary until the general's retirement from the army in 1869. Grant created a sensation in 1871 when he appointed Parker the nation's first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Caught up in scandal, Parker resigned his office after only two years and accepted a modest position with the New York City Police Department. He died in poverty in 1895.</p>",

Although distinguishing himself numerous times in the field, Upton is perhaps best remembered for his work on military strategy and tactics, posthumously published in 1904 as \"The Military Policy of the United States.\" Upton's book, based on both his experience as a Union commander and his study of European and Asian military establishments, analyzed American military policies and practices and presented the first systematic examination of the nation's military history. In \"Military Policy\" Upton advocated for a strong, standing regular army, a general staff system, promotions through examinations, advanced military education, and for severing civilian influence on the battlefield. <br> <br> Upton graduated from West Point in May 1861. He was wounded while serving at the First Battle of Bull Run, but refused to leave the field. In 1862, Upton commanded artillery units during the Peninsula Campaign, Seven Days' Battles and Maryland Campaign. He led regimental and brigade units at Fredericksburg and Gettysburg, respectively, and was cited for gallant service at Rappahannock Station in November 1863, earning a brevet promotion to major in the regular army.<br> While commanding infantry units during the Overland Campaign in 1864, Upton developed a revolutionary tactic to breakthrough an entrenched enemy line by deploying swift-moving columns of massed infantry against a small portion of the enemy line without pausing to exchange fire. At the time, both sides used the standard French tactic of employing a slowly moving wide battle line, which fired at the enemy as it advanced forward. Upton's columnar assault tactic worked brilliantly during Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps attack on the Confederate Mule Shoe salient on May 12, 1864.<br> <br> After recovering from wounds received at the Third Battle of Winchester, now-General Upton closed out the war as a cavalry commander.</p>",

Two years later, as the Red Stick Creeks became more bellicose towards other Creeks and Americans, American officials reached out to Pushmataha.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In the aftermath of the 1813 Red Stick <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/August-1813-Fort-Mims.htm\">attack on Fort Mims</a>, Pushmataha met with U.S. General Thomas Flournoy in Mobile and gained recognition as a Captain in the U.S. Army. Pushmataha led a grand council meeting of several thousand Choctaws in September 1813 to unite the Choctaws and call for volunteers to fight against their old Creek enemies. By October, Pushmataha commanded a battalion of four companies and enjoyed the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. The Choctaws experienced significant fighting alongside their American allies during the battle at the Creek village of Econachaca (the \"Holy Ground\") on December 23-24, 1813. For this success, Pushmataha and his warriors returned to their homes to great acclaim. Pushmataha led additional Choctaw fighting forces against the Redsticks along the Tombigbee River in the spring of 1814. Promoted to the rank of brigadier general, he and his men then joined Major Uriah Blue's detachment that patrolled the Gulf Coast that fall and captured Pensacola in November.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">After the War of 1812, Pushmataha no longer participated in war but continued to represent his people in diplomatic meetings with the United States. On October 18, 1820, the Choctaws met with U.S officials, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/andrew-jackson.htm\">Andrew Jackson</a>, and ceded land in the Treaty of Doak's Stand. Under the terms of the treaty, the Choctaws were to cede half of their land in what was by then the state of Mississippi in exchange for land in Arkansas. During the proceedings, Pushmataha accused Jackson of exaggerating the quality of the western land. In 1824, Pushmataha and other Choctaw chiefs travelled to Washington, D.C. for further negotiations about this flawed treaty. While there, Pushmataha posed for a portrait by renowned painter Charles Bird King, yet not long after his portrait was completed, Pushmataha fell ill and died. He was given a military funeral and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington.</p>",

Following a series of murders and robberies along the Federal Road and on the Tennessee frontier, Americans demanded immediate justice for the crimes and threatened the Creek nation with invasion. Big Warrior and the Creek National Council called on special warriors known as Law Menders to punish and, in many cases, to execute those guilty of crimes in order to prevent a break in Creek-American relations. Yet not all Creek supported these actions, and as a result, a sizeable portion of the Creek people turned against their “old leaders.” Known as “red sticks,” they besieged Tuckabatchee and sought ammunition in Spanish Florida for their war against the National Council.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Big Warrior called on his American allies for assistance, promising to pay for the expense of the war. The Red Stick war came at a high price. On August 9, 1814, Big Warrior and the National Council chiefs were forced to sign the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/treaty-of-fort-jackson.htm\">Treaty of Fort Jackson</a> by which the United States declared the Creeks a defeated people and took nearly 22 million acres of land in payment for war expenses.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In the years following the war, Big Warrior worked tirelessly to obtain compensation for a portion of land taken at Fort Jackson and worked against all future land cessions, including one made by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-mcintosh.htm\">William McIntosh</a> in 1825. That treaty, known as the Treaty of Indian Springs, was not authorized by the National Council. Big Warrior traveled to Washington, D. C. in early 1825 as part of the Creek delegation sent to protest the ratification of the treaty and died there on March 8.</p>",

He headed the group of warriors appointed by the Creek National Council known as “Law Menders.” These warriors were responsible for apprehending and punishing by beatings, ear cropping, or execution those who had committed crimes against Americans. The actions of McIntosh and his Law Menders in executing a number of Upper Creek warriors responsible for murders and robberies along the Federal Road and home invasions along the Tennessee border directly led to a rebellion by many Creeks against the National Council. That civil war quickly became an American-Creek war after the rebellious Creeks, known as Red Sticks, attacked the hastily constructed Fort Mims in the Mississippi Territory.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During the Creek War, 1813-1814, McIntosh served the Creek National Council first as an emissary to the Cherokee Nation, informing them of Creek troubles. As outright war engulfed the Creek country, McIntosh was appointed as major of a regiment of Creek Indians who fought alongside American forces against Red Stick Creeks, notably at Horseshoe Bend. He later fought with the United States during the First Seminole War.</span></p> <p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-05e0815d-65b2-2378-a0fc-bb7203d114a7\"><span>After the Creek war, McIntosh continued to play a prominent role in the National Council, becoming one of the most powerful and wealthy Creeks of his generation. He owned a sizeable plantation and inn operated by slave labor, as well as other business operations. His prestige as high-ranking member of the Wind Clan from the most powerful Lower Creek Town, a status inherited through his Indian mother, was enhanced by his Scots-American father's family connections to wealthy and politically astute kinsman George McIntosh Troup, who served as the governor of Georgia from 1823 to 1827.  During Troup’s term, McIntosh signed the unauthorized Treaty of Indian Springs (1825) which surrendered all Creek lands in Georgia as well as substantial property in Alabama. The National Council pronounced him guilty of treason and sent Law Menders to execute McIntosh and destroy his property. </span></span></p>",

Cochrane joined the Royal Navy as a boy and fought in the American Revolution. Following this war he rose quickly in the Napoleonic Wars, earning renown in the Battle of San Domingo and the Conquest of Martinique in 1809.</p> <p>By the beginning of the War of 1812, Cochrane was a well-seasoned and high-ranking officer. As a vice admiral, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the new North American naval station in Bermuda. He devised a clever plan to weaken the American defenses and turn America’s slaves against the country by inviting any American – slave or free – to join the British Navy. Many slaves took this offer, escaping to British lines for military service in exchange for their freedom.</p> <p>By the summer of 1814, Cochrane had returned to the waters of the United States, overseeing the raids of the Chesapeake.  Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, governor of Upper Canada, suggested launching an invasion somewhere in the United States in retaliation against the sack of York and to weaken the American forces, relieving pressure on Canada. Cochrane landed the ground troops to invade Washington, and presided over the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Battle of Baltimore.</p> <p>After only moderate success in the Chesapeake, Cochrane wanted to push toward New Orleans in order to cement the British position in the United States. He orchestrated an amphibious attack on the city via Lake Borgne, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico that could bring troops close to the city.</p> <p>Although Cochrane was successful in the Battle of Lake Borgne, allowing the British Army to advance toward New Orleans, the disastrous defeat at the Battle of New Orleans damaged his reputation. The influential Napoleonic War hero the Duke of Wellington in particular blamed Cochrane of the death of his brother-in-law, Sir Edward Michael Pakenham, the British general overseeing land troops at the Battle of New Orleans.</p> <p>However, despite the criticisms and ultimate failure to get a foothold in the United States, Cochrane was promoted to admiral after the war, and served out the rest of his military career as Commander-in-Chief of the naval base in Plymouth, England. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Sir George Prévost was the son of Major General Augustine Prevost of the British army, and encouraged from a young age to take up a career in the army. He was born in colonial New Jersey and educated both in America and in England, enlisting in the 60<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot at the age of 11. As the son of a prominent general and with considerable family wealth, Prévost was able to purchase his promotions (a common practice at the time), allowing him to move up the ranks quickly despite having limited battle experience.</p> <p>Prévost was promoted to lieutenant colonel by 1794 and stationed in the West Indies on three different occasions during the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. Although never distinguished as a military commander, here is diplomatic skills began to shine. Prévost was appointed lieutenant governor of St. Lucia in 1798 and later governor of Dominica in 1802. His diplomacy and fluency in French made him popular among the French planter aristocracy and strengthened his reputation. By 1808, Prévost was elevated to the rank of brigadier general and sent to Nova Scotia to serve as lieutenant governor, but he would return to the Caribbean in 1809 to lead a successful campaign to capture the French colony of Martinique.</p> <p>Bilingual and now a military hero, Prévost was a natural choice to serve as governor of Canada when he returned. In 1811, he was promoted to lieutenant general, given command of the British forces in North America, and named governor of Canada. Prévost’s first order of business as the governor of Canada was to help unite a population divided by language and culture by winning support of the French Catholics in eastern Canada. His second focus was to prepare the colony for impending war with the United States. Prévost quickly appointed Major General Isaac Brock as commander of forces in Upper Canada, and raised two new corps of soldiers while requesting more troops and support to be sent from Britain.</p> <p>Although high-ranking, Prévost was largely unskilled and inexperienced as a battle commander and preferred passive defense to aggressive attacks as his military strategy. He personally led the raid on the American naval station at Sacket’s Harbor on May 29, 1813, but the failure to take the port, paired with his poor reputation as a tactician left him open to criticism by top British Army officers.</p> <p>Prévost attempted to take charge again by leading the invasion in the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814, but this ended disastrously as well. Hundreds of his troops were killed, wounded or captured, and this defeat lost the British hold on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. Following the end of the war, Prévost returned to England to answer charges of poor leadership at the Battle of Plattsburgh and face a court martial. He died before the process was completed and never stood trial. </p>",

Educated at Eton College and Oxford University and demonstrating a great talent for academics, John Graves ultimately followed in his father’s footsteps by pursuing a military career. He enlisted in the 35<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot in 1770 and was sent to the American colonies. There, Simcoe fought in several battles of the American Revolution, including the Siege of Boston, the Battle of Brandywine, and the Siege of Yorktown.</p> <p>The experience of fighting against the American Patriots, and subsequently Britain’s decision to end the war and grant independence to the United States left a permanent bad taste in Simcoe’s mouth. For the rest of his career, Simcoe would hold on to a poor opinion of Americans. Upon returning to England following the war, Simcoe was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, and married Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim. Together they had five children.</p> <p>In 1791, the young family relocated to the newly established Upper Canada, where Simcoe was appointed Lieutenant Governor. Simcoe was eager to establish a British Utopia in what he perceived as an otherwise savage continent, built upon British law and government. Simcoe initiated a land grant program enticing loyalist Americans to settle in Upper Canada to increase its population and productivity, although he remained distrustful of the emigrants.</p> <p>Realizing the tension between the United States and Great Britain would only grow, Simcoe began preparations for war as early as 1794. He supplied Indian allies with weapons, fortified the fleet on the Great Lakes, and established a capital further inland at the Indian settlement of Toronto, renaming it York after King George III’s second son, the Duke of York.</p> <p>Poor health sent Simcoe back to England in 1796, and resulted in his resignation as Lieutenant governor in 1798. After a few minor commissions, Simcoe was appointed commander-in-chief of India in 1806, the most prestigious foreign posting at the time, but Simcoe died before setting sail for his new position.</p>",

His father, Ignace-Michel-Louis-Antoine d’Irumberry de Salaberry, was a former British officer and served on the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. Following in his father’s footsteps, at the age of 14, Charles enlisted in the British army in the 44<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot.</p> <p>Salaberry spent the French Revolution in the Caribbean and was part of successful invasions of Saint-Dominique, Guadeloupe and Martinique. He was slowly promoted throughout the Napoleonic Wars, serving in Britain and Ireland. Eventually he was posted to the Canadas in June 1810 to serve as aide-de-camp of Colonel Francis de Rottenburg, his former commander from Ireland.</p> <p>He was promoted to brevet major July 2, 1811, and began creating a new corps of volunteers, les Voltigeurs canadiens. Salaberry’s passion for a French Canadian defense, his growing reputation as a strong leader, and a poor economy made recruiting easy. Salaberry’s vision for les Voltigeurs came together by the spring of 1812. Although known as a strict, demanding officer, Salaberry was also well-respected by his troops. He held his volunteers to the same exacting standards of the regular army units, demanding loyalty, discipline, and professionalism. This respect, along with his understanding of the delicate position commanding French Canadians to fight alongside the British earned him in turn respect and trust from the troops he led.</p> <p>Salaberry’s unit of Voltigeurs fought in the advance guard at Lacolle Mill in November 1812 that repulsed Henry Dearborn’s northern attack, and again against a combined American attack at the Chate<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">â</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">uguay River on October 21, 1813. This protected Montréal from American invasion, showcased the contributions of French Canadians in the war effort, and elevated Salaberry to the level of war hero.</span></p> <p>Despite his popularity and success, as a French Catholic, Salaberry recognized that he was unlikely to rise any higher in the ranks of the British army. He retired in January 1814 after a long and successful career.</p> <p>After the war, Salaberry continued to follow in his father’s footsteps by becoming a justice of the peace back at his home in Québec, and later joined his father in serving on the legislative council of Lower Canada. He married Marie-Anne-Julie Hertel de Rouville and had seven children. He amassed much wealth and a large estate through investments in transportation infrastructure. Following his father’s death in 1828, Salaberry became the Seigneur of St. Mathias, overseeing the community of Chambly, Québec, where he lived out the rest of his life. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Henry Dearborn was a doctor in New Hampshire at the outbreak of the American Revolution. Upon hearing of the events at Lexington and Concord, he led his militia company to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and joined the American army. Dearborn and his company were present at some of the most key moments of the American Revolution, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Siege of Fort Ticonderoga, the Battles of Saratoga, the winter encampment at Valley Forge, and the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown. Dearborn was finally discharged from the army in July 1783 after eight years of service.</p> <p>But Dearborn’s military career was just beginning. Following the Revolutionary War, Dearborn settled in Maine and was made brigadier general of the militia in 1787, and a major general in 1789. This military service increased his public profile, and he was elected to the House of Representatives for two terms, from 1793 to 1797. His political career took off from here as well. He was appointed Secretary of War by President Thomas Jefferson in 1801, a position he held until the end of Jefferson’s administration in 1809. He was appointed to collect duties from the port of Boston under the administration of President James Madison, a position he held until the War of 1812 broke out and he was appointed senior major general of the United States Army.</p> <p>Although Dearborn proved to be a capable militia commander, his grasp over the entire northeastern sector of war proved to be flawed. Dearborn initiated assaults on Canada and had moderate successes in York and at Fort George in 1813, but his inability to reinforce Brigadier General William Hull in Detroit proved fatal to his military career. Dearborn was recalled from the field on July 6, 1813, and he served out the rest of his military service in an administrative role.</p> <p>After Dearborn was honorably discharged from the army on June 15, 1815 following the conclusion of the war, Madison nominated him to be reappointed as Secretary of War. However, his mediocre record in the most recent war caused his nomination to be rejected by Federalists in the Senate. He served briefly as a foreign minister to Portugal before retiring to his home, near Boston. </p>",

He was the oldest surviving War of 1812 veteran, passing away at age 105.</p> <p>Born in a small town in central New York along the Mohawk River, Cronk lived his entire life in the region. He enlisted in the New York militia as a teenager in 1814 with his father and two older brothers, but had an uneventful military career. Cronk served at the naval station at Sackets Harbor, but only for about 100 days and after both battles fought there were over. Although playing only a minor role in the War of 1812, he was recognized as a veteran and received a pension.</p> <p>After the war, Cronk married Mary Thornton, also of New York, in 1825 and had seven children. He worked as an itinerant shoemaker and helped dig the Erie Canal, but otherwise lived an unremarkable life. However, as Cronk aged he began belonging to an elite fraternity of sorts, a small group of War of 1812 veterans who not only survived bloody conflict but who outlived all their fellow comrades in arms.</p> <p>Following the Civil War as America struggled to assimilate its unprecedented losses, and a growing wave of European immigration, Americans increasingly looked with nostalgia back to the Revolutionary and War of 1812 eras to find heroes. Cronk and other survivors and artifacts of the War of 1812 and the Revolutionary War became objects of great national fascination and enshrinement. Cronk’s mere existence created for many a tangible connection to simpler times and great patriotism.</p> <p>When he eventually died at the age of 105, the West Virginia <em>Bluefield Daily Telegraph, </em>anointed him as, “the last link connecting the simplicity of Jefferson’s day with the strenuous complexity of the present.”</p> <p>Cronk was honored with a state funeral in New York City, a place remote and foreign to him, attended by thousands who he did not know. These mourners lined the streets of New York City as his funeral cortege, “an imposing and unusual spectacle,” passed by. Police, military units and city officials, including the mayor, joined in the procession. Cronk lay in state in City Hall before burial in Brooklyn’s Cypress Hill Cemetery.</p> <p>This exuberant display was more than Cronk as a humble shoemaker from upstate New York would have expected or perhaps even wanted. But as an icon and unlikely hero of the War of 1812, honoring Cronk and the time of great nostalgia that he represented was necessary for the American people.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Although lacking a formal education, General Sir Isaac Brock established himself as a clever and popular general. His willingness to fight alongside his troops and dedication to the defense of Canada made him an inspiring leader and a war hero for the colony, however also contributed to his untimely death at the Battle of Queenston Heights.</p> <p>From an early age, Brock was a studious and scholarly child, interested in learning and reading anything he could get his hands on. This clever nature helped him rise rapidly through the ranks of the British army. He was sent to the Caribbean upon enlisting at the age of 15, and had his first combat experience in 1801 at the Battle of Copenhagen. He gained a great appreciation for Lord Nelson’s tactics and would use this as he became a military leader.</p> <p>In 1802, he was assigned to Canada and faced with resolving the common issues of mutiny and desertion that plagued Canadian troops. Brock realized that the Americans’ low opinion of Canadian militias would likely result in a possible invasion. A full decade before the War of 1812 was declared, Brock was organizing for Canada’s defense. Some of the innovations to help war preparations that Brock instituted included improving recruitment and training for militia, making alliances with First Nation leaders, and improving defense fortifications.</p> <p>As soon as war was declared, Brock was eager to guide his army into battle. Despite the protests of General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/george-prevost.htm\">George Prevost</a> overseeing all operations in Canada, Brock led a successful attack on Fort Mackinac in upper Michigan. After an unsuccessful push by the Americans, led by General William Hull, to invade Canada from Detroit, Brock felt justified in pushing ahead with an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/surrender-of-detroit.htm\">invasion of Detroit</a> that he had already been planning. Brock met with Shawnee leader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/tecumseh.htm\">Tecumseh</a> in July 1812 and organized an attack capitalizing on Hull’s fear of Indians. This tactic ended up being very successful, with Hull surrendering immediately. This cleverness impressed Tecumseh and the Shawnee warriors, and cemented their alliance against the Americans.</p> <p>Brock knew that this offense would result in retaliation, and hurried to prepare defenses throughout Upper Canada. The retaliation came a few months later, along the Niagara Peninsula at Queenston Heights. Brock was stationed at nearby Fort George at the time and ordered an immediate attack. Brock personally led the charge on foot, but his considerable height and conspicuous officer’s uniform made him an easy target. A single musket ball entered his heart and Sir Isaac Brock died almost immediately.</p> <p>Brock was never satisfied with his Canadian posting and frequently requested transfers back to Europe to fight in the Napoleonic Wars. However, unwilling to abandon Canada to the Americans, even when a transfer order came through early in 1812, he stayed on. Although Brock never identified himself with Canada, he has been adopted by Canadians as a favorite war hero, referred to as “the hero of Upper Canada.” Statues, towns named after him and even a university bearing his name are spread all over a grateful nation.</p>",

As the nephew of Royal Navy Admiral William Duddingston, Barclay easily won a midshipman appointment in 1798, at only 12 years of age.</p> <p>Barclay’s career in the Royal Navy was eventful immediately. By 1804 he had been involved in the capture of over a dozen ships, and was promoted to lieutenant by 1805. Leadership in his new rank was tested immediately at the Battle of Trafalgar, one of the most decisive victories in British naval history. Barclay was quickly promoted again, and assigned to the HMS Diana. This assignment proved to be more fateful; Barclay was wounded in a deadly foray between the Diana and a French merchant vessel in 1807, costing him his left arm.</p> <p>With the nation gripped by the Napoleonic Wars, every trained and experienced officer was needed, even if not able-bodied. Barclay was shipped to Halifax in 1809, and then dispatched to Lake Erie in 1813. This assignment on the southernmost Great Lake was not a voluntary one; he was ordered to Lake Erie only after another officer declined the command, citing the deplorable conditions of the Lake Erie flotilla, and the fact that there would be little opportunity to gain glory on Lake Erie. The belief that Lake Erie would be an uneventful posting turned out to be inaccurate. Shortly after Barclay arrived on Lake Erie in June 1813, tensions with the Americans began to mount. Over the course of the next three months, the American navy would position themselves to block the British naval base from their supply route, requiring the undermanned, undertrained, and outgunned British flotilla to confront the Americans directly.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/met-the-enemy-4.htm\">Battle of Lake Erie</a> ended disastrously for the British fleet. Barclay himself was severely wounded, and although court-martialed after, it was found that \"the Officers and Men of His Majesty's late Squadron conducted themselves in the most gallant Manner.\" However, despite this acquittal, Barclay’s role leading the first total surrender in British naval history stalled his career. Despite his initial quick rise through the ranks, Barclay would receive only one more promotion, retiring as a captain 11 years after the disastrous Battle of Lake Erie.</p>",

There, he studied an eclectic curriculum of philosophy, languages, mathematics, and science. These diverse interests would help to distinguish Gallatin both as a financier and as a humanitarian. </p><p>Gallatin arrived in the United States in 1780, seeking adventure and fortune as a tea merchant. He ended up along the western frontier of Pennsylvania and Virginia as a land surveyor, falling in love with the rugged, bucolic land and establishing a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frhi/index.htm\">home</a>. He did not remain in the west for long; the newly forming government drew him eastward to Philadelphia in 1790 to help form the constitution of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Gallatin moved into national politics in 1793, serving as Senator of Pennsylvania, and then was elected to the House of Representatives three times. He used these political opportunities as a platform to fight for public education, land acquisition, and the abolition of slavery, as well as to establish the Ways and Means congressional committee overseeing a system of American taxation. This financial expertise became Gallatin’s political legacy. He served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1801 to 1814, with a primary focus on reducing the national debt associated with the $11 million acquisition of the Louisiana territory in 1803.</p><p>Another major fiscal challenge he faced in his position as Secretary of the Treasury was concerns over the nation’s fiscal stability due to the War of 1812. The nation was in no shape financially to fight a war. Gallatin realized this, and immediately began negotiating for peace. As early as 1813, Gallatin along with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-quincy-adams.htm\">John Quincy Adams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-clay-1.htm\">Henry Clay</a>, and other American diplomats, met with British officials in Ghent, Belgium to negotiate peace. Although it would take a full year to navigate the finer points of the peace treaty, the representatives were able to find a peaceful agreement in the waning days of 1814, and sent it to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/james-madison.htm\">President Madison</a> for consideration and ratification.</p><p>After the war, Gallatin continued in this role as a diplomat by being appointed Minister to France, and later as a negotiator to resolve a Canadian Boundary dispute. When he returned to the United States in 1827, he retired from government service and instead dedicated his life to his fields of study at the Academy of Geneva: he became president of a bank, helped found present-day <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/\">New York University</a>, and established the <a href=\"http://aesonline.org/\">American Ethnological Society</a>. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Albert James Myer was a telegrapher and physician who began his military career in 1854 as an Assistant Surgeon in the U.S. Army. Fascinated by non-verbal methods of communication, Myer devised a scheme for transmitting a kind of binary code through the use of a single flag by day and kerosene lamp by night. <br> <br> Called the wig-wag system, or aerial telegraphy, Myer's system of long-distance communication was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1860 and Myer was appointed to oversee its development and deployment as commander of the new U.S. Army Signal Corps. In the American Civil War, both sides adopted the wig-wag system. It was, in fact, the Confederate Captain Edward Porter Alexander who first employed it in combat at the First Battle of Manassas on July 21, 1861.<br> <br> In addition to aerial signaling, Myer deployed mobile field units that were designed to support an electrical device called the Beardslee telegraph, which used a simple dial to transmit messages instead of a key. He continued to experiment with other communication and coding systems throughout the war. By 1864 all military telegraphic operations had been consolidated in the Corps, but in a personal setback, Myer lost his command in 1864 because of the Senate's failure to approve his original appointment, though he returned to lead the Corps in 1866. <br> <br> In 1870, the Signal Corps was assigned the further responsibility of recording and transmitting meteorological data collected at its many stations across the nation, and so became the U.S. government's first weather service. Myer led the Signal Corps until his death in 1880.</p>",

The Kentucky-born Johnston was appointed to West Point from Louisiana and graduated eighth in the class of 1826. After eight years of service he resigned to care for his terminally ill wife. A failure at farming, he went to Texas and joined the revolutionary forces as a private. Within a year, he had risen through the ranks as the force's chief commander and senior brigadier general.<br> <br> He served as Secretary of War in the Republic of Texas and commanded the 1st Texas Rifles in the Mexican War. Reentering the United States army in 1849 as a major and paymaster, he became colonel in 1855. For his services in the 1857 campaign against the Mormons in Utah he was brevetted brigadier general. He resigned his commission on April 10, 1861, but did not quit his post on the West Coast until his successor arrived. <br> <br> Relieved of his command, he began the long trek to Richmond overland. Meeting with Jefferson Davis, he entered Confederate service on August 30, 1861 as a full general and the second ranking officer in the Confederacy. He was given command of all Confederate troops west of the Allegheny Mountains where he attempted to implement a strategy of utilizing isolated commands to hold points withing the invaded Confederate states. <br> <br> Establishing a line of defense in Kentucky from the Mississippi River to the Appalachians, he held it until it was broken at Mill Springs in January and at Forts Henry and Donelson in February 1862. Abandoning Kentucky and most of Tennessee, he fell back into northern Mississippi where he concentrated his previously scattered forces. <br> <br> In early April he moved against Ulysses S. Grant's army in Tennessee, surprising the Federals with an attack near Pittsburg Landing and driving them back, in what would become the Battle of Shiloh. While directing frontline operations he was wounded in the leg, likely by friendly fire. Not realizing the seriousness of his wound, he sent his personal physician to attend to some captured Union soldiers, and he bled to death, the highest ranking officer of either side killed during the war.</p>",

Photographers followed in their footsteps capturing camp scenes and portraits of untested, jubilant greenhorns in their new uniforms. It so happened that Alexander Gardner had just opened a new studio in the capital for the most notable photographer of his era - Mathew Brady. Gardner also took advantage of the coming storm to increase his business. All of the early war photographs were taken in studios or tents. No one had produced images in the field.<br> It wasn't until September of 1862 that the first true images of war were produced. Antietam was the first battle to depict the grim and bloody truth of civil war through the lens of photographer Alexander Gardner and his assistant James Gibson. Gardner made two trips to Antietam. The first was just two days after the battle, the second, two weeks later when President Abraham Lincoln visited the battlefield.<br> <br> During both of his trips, Gardner moved across the battlefield taking advantage of another new photographic technique that increased the impact of war images, the stereograph. A stereograph image uses two lenses capture two simultaneous photographs, and when seen through a viewer, the mind creates a three-dimensional image. Parlors soon filled with viewers and the cards to fill them as stereo views became the rage in America. Of the approximately ninety images Gardner took at Antietam, about seventy were in stereo, adding a new, horrific view of the American landscape.<br> <br> Newspapers could not reproduce photographs, but woodcuts from the Antietam images spread across the country. Gardner's original images were put on display in New York City at Brady's gallery. New Yorkers were shocked and appalled. The New York Times stated that Brady was able to \"bring home to us the terrible reality and earnestness of war. If he has not brought bodies and laid them in our door-yards and along streets, he has done something very like it...\"</p>",

He was appointed deputy sheriff of Kane County, Illinois in 1846, then deputy sheriff of Cook County, then special agent for the U.S. Post Office in Chicago. Around 1850, he organized America's first private detective agency specializing in railway thefts. Its motto was \"We never sleep\" and its logo - a prominent, unblinking eye - came to be associated with all future \"private eyes.\" <br> <br> His agency protected President-elect Abraham Lincoln during his journey from Springfield to Washington in February 1861, and when war erupted, Pinkerton was appointed chief of intelligence for Union army commander George McClellan. In the early months of the Civil War, McClellan's cautious nature was often reinforced by Pinkerton's inflated estimates of Confederate troop strength. <br> <br> After the war, the Pinkerton Agency continued to expand. It helped bring to justice a number of prominent railway express robbers but failed to apprehend the nation's most notorious: the James Gang. Ironically, given Pinkerton's early pro-labor views, the Pinkerton Agency became involved in suppressing labor organizing activity and strikes in the 1870s. The violence it helped foment during the 1892 Homestead Mill strike led to laws in 26 states that banned private guards from participating in labor disputes. <br> <br> In the early 20th century, as public police forces became more professional and the public became less tolerant of the sometimes ruthless tactics employed by private police forces, the Pinkerton Agency gravitated away from detective work and toward security. The Pinkerton National Detective Agency lives on today as Pinkerton Consulting and Investigations, a division of the Swedish security company Securitas AB.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Burnside's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>As a result of his success in North Carolina, Ambrose Burnside was promoted to Major General of volunteers on March 18, 1862. Following George McClellan's failure to take Richmond during the Peninsula Campaign, Burnside was offered command of the Army of the Potomac. He refused, citing his loyalty to McClellan and his own lack of military experience. <br> <br> As a result of this decision McClellan retained command and Burnside detached part of his corps to support John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. After the Union debacle at the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run), Burnside was again offered command of the Army of the Potomac and again refused, which helped influence Lincoln to decide to retain McClellan after the Army of Virginia was consolidated into the Army of the Potomac. <br> <br> When the Maryland Campaign began, Burnside was given command of the \"Right Wing\" of the Army of the Potomac, consisting of the I and IX Corps. He performed superbly in his initial mission of keeping the Confederate from advancing on Baltimore. He was then sent to action at the Battle of South Mountain. Following this battle McClellan separated the I and IX corps as the Army of the Potomac took position on the field of Antietam, placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line. This effectively eliminated Burnside's role as right wing commander.<br> <br> Burnside was hesitant to relinquish his position of higher authority, and funneled his orders to the IX Corps (his normal command) through General Jacob D. Cox (who was acting as corps commander while Burnside was commanding the right wing) rather than issuing them directly to the IX Corps divisions himself. This cumbersome arrangement helped to slow his efforts to execute his orders to turn the right flank of the Confederate line during the Battle of Antietam.<br> <br> McClellan's battle plan called for the Army of the Potomac to strike the Confederates on both sides of their defensive line simultaneously, and when the fighting began it seemed as though this plan might succeed. Even as the Union assaults were being made on the sunken road, a mile and a half farther south Burnside began his attack on the Confederate right. <br> <br> Burnside recognized the importance of finding a crossing other than the bridge that would come to bear his name. He sent Rodman's division downstream with the purpose of doing precisely that. Unfortunately the ground had not been properly surveyed before the advance of Rodman's division and it took nearly three hours to find a suitable crossing. <br> <br> During this interval McClellan sent repeated orders to Burnside to push through and take the bridge. One such order included the missive, \"Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now.\" When McClellan sent his inspector general to confront Burnside, the latter reacted indignantly: \"McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders.\" In accordance with McClellan's orders, while Rodman was attempting to find a crossing Burnside focused his attention on the bridge. Despite multiple assaults by Burnside, however, Robert Toombs' Georgia Brigade on the high ground above the bridge succeeded in delaying the Union advance for three hours. <br> <br> At about 1:00 pm, Burnside's men finally succeed with a consolidated push by the 51st Pennsylvania and 51st New York infantry regiments, driving the Confederates back and securing the bridge. <br> <br> Once Burnside's men had gained the crossing at the bridge it took two additional hours to get all the men across and organized before a general advance could continue. This additional delay allowed just enough time for A.P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. <br> <br> Once engaged with Hill Burnside requested reinforcements from McClellan, and when McClellan refused the battle ended in a tactical stalemate. <br> <br> Despite criticism for his slow response and the delay in moving his men forward, Lincoln still believed that Burnside was his best choice for command of the Army of the Potomac, and when he relieved McClellan in November, Burnside was ordered to accept the command he had twice declined.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Hill's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>In the aftermath of the Peninsula Campaign, A.P. Hill became embroiled in dispute with James Longstreet over a series of newspaper articles that appeared in the Richmond Examiner. Their disagreement caused relations between the two men to deteriorate to the point where Hill was placed under arrest and challenged Longstreet to a duel. In order to settle their dispute Lee decided to send Hill and his division to reinforce Jackson in Gordonsville, Virginia.<br> <br> This positioned Hill in the midst of the fighting at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9. His counterattack helped to stabilize the Confederate left flank, preventing a route, and contributing to Confederate victory. <br> <br> Three weeks later at the Second Battle of Manassas, Hill held a firm line on the Confederate left along the unfinished railroad cut against repeated Union attacks. <br> <br> During this campaign, Hill became involved in several minor disputes with his new commander as well. His clashes with Jackson established ill feeling that persisted until Jackson's death the following year. During the Maryland Campaign, Jackson had Hill arrested and after the campaign charged him with eight counts of dereliction of duty.<br> <br> Despite these issues, Hill's leadership during the Maryland Campaign was particularly exemplary. He helped to capture the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, when on the night of September 14, he led a flanking maneuver on the Chambers Farm. Hundreds of his men worked through the night to drag artillery up the ravines and place them on the farm. After the surrender, the other Confederate forces moved north toward Sharpsburg while he was left with his division to process Union prisoners. Upon receiving an urgent message from Lee, Hill left one brigade to finish the work in Harpers Ferry and led his \"Light Division\" on a grueling 17 mile march to Sharpsburg. Hill arrived at the battlefield just in time to counter the final advance of Burnside's Corps, bringing an end to the battle and staving off defeat.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Andrew Gregg Curtin was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. After establishing a law practice, he joined the Whig party and campaigned on behalf of several of their influential candidates. His first public office was Secretary of the Commonwealth, followed by a stint as Secretary of the Public Schools. He switched his political allegiance from the Whigs to the new Republican Party in 1860 and was instrumental in securing the Republican presidential nomination for Abraham Lincoln in May of that year. <br> <br> He himself agreed to run for governor of Pennsylvania on the Republican ticket and, despite a strong Democratic opponent, won the election by a large margin, serving two terms as governor, from 1861-1867. His victory was instrumental in swinging Pennsylvania's critical electoral votes to Lincoln in the presidential election a month later. <br> <br> During the Civil War, Curtin became a close friend and confidante of the president, visiting the White House several times to discuss the war effort. Also during the Civil War, Curtin organized the Pennsylvania reserves into combat units, and oversaw the construction of the first Union military camp for training militia, a facility that more than 300,000 men passed through during the four years of war. In September 1862, Curtin convened the Loyal War Governors' Conference, during which 13 governors of Union states met to discuss the war effort, state troop quotas, and support for the President Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. <br> <br> Curtin was also very active during the Gettysburg Campaign, working with the Union military leadership to delay Robert E. Lee's advance through Pennsylvania and prevent him from crossing the Susquehanna River. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Governor Curtin was the principal force behind the establishment of the Soldiers' National Cemetery and was seated with President Lincoln when he delivered the Gettysburg Address at the cemetery's dedication on November 19, 1863.<br> <br> At the end of his second term as governor, Curtin accepted the ambassadorship to Russia in 1869. He returned to America in 1872 and supported the presidential candidacy of Horace Greeley, an action which alienated him from many leading Republicans, prompting Curtin to join the Democratic Party. Defeated in an 1878 bid for Congress, he ran again in 1880 and won the first of three consecutive terms in the House of Representatives.</p>",

Stuart. Ford reportedly also spied for Colonel John S. Mosby, leader of a band of Confederate rangers in Northern Virginia.<br> <br> After being reported to authorities by a Union spy, Ford was arrested by the Union Provost Marshal in Fairfax, Major Joseph Willard, and jailed in Washington, D.C. at the Old Capitol Prison in early 1863. She was charged with aiding and abetting Mosby's capture of Union General Edwin H. Stoughton, but no evidence could be found to support her accusers' claims. During her confinement, her arresting officer, Major Willard, had worked for her release. Ford eventually took the Oath of Allegiance, was released from prison, and later married Major Willard on March 10, 1864.

He later joined the United States Army as a private and saw his first action in the Mexican -American War. Following the war, Kautz entered the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 1852. He went on to serve in the Pacific Northwest where he was twice wounded during the Rogue River Wars in 1855. Kautz also served in the Puget Sound War in 1856. He was rewarded for his service with a commission of lieutenant in the regular army. <br> <br> Returning to the U.S. from Europe at the outbreak of the Civil War, Kautz sided with the Union and was commissioned a captain in the 6th U.S. Cavalry. He served in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days' Battles before he was sent to the Kansas-Missouri border. In late 1863 he was transferred back to the East as the cavalry commander for the Union Army of the James in the campaigns against Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. On April 3, 1865, Kautz's division of United States Colored Troops was among the first to occupy Richmond, Virginia. He was active during the Union pursuit of Robert E. Lee from April 2 to April 9, 1865, prior to the surrender at Appomattox Court House. <br> <br> After the war, Kautz served on the military commission that tried the conspirators involved in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. He went on to serve as the commander of the Department of Arizona and commanding officer of Fort McDowell. He resigned from the army in 1892 with the rank of brigadier general. During and after his service he authored several manuals on duties and customs that were eventually adopted by the U.S. military.</p>",

One such example was the hanging of a young Indian boy under the suspicion that he was a horse thief, despite the statements of an English immigrant to the boy's defense. In response to Bear Hunter's raids against Mormon colonists, telegraph workers, and wagon trains, Col. Patrick Edward Connor led a contingent of troops in an attack against Bear Hunter's forces. The resulting Battle of Bear River would prove to be a massacre as around 250 Shoshone were slaughtered by the troops, including approximately 90 women and children.

After the dissolution of the Whig Party in the 1850s, Hawes became a Democrat and supported John C. Breckinridge in the presidential election of 1860. <br> <br> While Hawes had pro-southern views and favored recognition of the Confederacy, he personally opposed secession for Kentucky, instead favoring armed neutrality for the state at the outbreak of the Civil War.<br> <br> Kentucky's armed neutrality ended, however, in support of the Union in August 1861, forcing Hawes to flee to Virginia to avoid arrest.

Although victorious at the Second Battle of Winchester during the opening of the Gettysburg Campaign, Ewell's fortunes changed shortly thereafter. During the Battle of Gettysburg, his failure to pursue the fleeing Union army in the battle's opening hours allowed the Federals to occupy and fortify a strong position. Many of Robert E. Lee's generals criticized the failure to pursue the enemy, claiming it had cost the Confederacy its chance to win the bloody engagement. The criticism would follow him for the rest of the war. Believing the lingering wound from Second Manassas continued to inhibit his abilities, Robert E. Lee reassigned Ewell to command of the Department of Richmond in the spring of 1864. <br> <br> Ewell was captured at the Battle of Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865 and three months imprisoned at Fort Warren in the Boston Harbor.

His admirable performance during the Valley Campaign as well as his distinctive service during <br> the Seven Days Battles of Gaines' Mill and Malvern Hill set him apart as a capable division commander. <br> <br> After stopping McClellan's push toward Richmond and sending the Army of the Potomac retreating toward Washington, Lee turned his attention to John Pope's \"total\" war on the people of Northern Virginia, which had devastated the region between Culpeper and the railroad junction at Manassas. He dispatched Jackson's command, including Ewell to deal with the problem.<br> <br> Ewell played a key role in the defeat of Nathaniel Banks at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9 and, with the rest of Jackson's command, captured the Union supply depot at Manassas on August 27. <br> <br> Two days later Jackson's men advanced to a commanding position near the unfinished railroad cut above the Brawner house. In Jackson's report of what happened next he writes: \"By this time it was sunset; but as [the enemy] column appeared to be moving by, with its flank exposed, I determined to attack at once, which was vigorously done by the divisions of Taliaferro and Ewell.\" This attack transformed into a general engagement and \"both lines stood exposed to the discharges of musketry and artillery until about 9 o'clock, when the enemy slowly fell back, yielding the field to our troops.\"<br> <br> Ewell and his men had helped to carry the day. In Jackson's official report of the action he recorded: \"the loss on both sides was heavy, and among our wounded were Major-General Ewell and Brigadier-General Taliaferro. The latter after a few months was able to resume his duties; the former, I regret to say, is still disabled by his wound, and the army thus deprived of his valuable services.\"<br> <br> Ewell's left leg had been shattered by a minie ball and had to be amputated below the knee. Though he returned to service in June of the following year, Ewell would never again lead with the same fire he had displayed in 1862.</p>",

Lee sent Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson north to disrupt Pope's movement and hold him in one place while the rest of the army moved to engage him. Jackson's success in capturing Union supplies at the railroad junction at Manassas and subsequent holding action at Deep Cut on August 29 allowed the rest of Lee's army to arrive on the field and carry the day at the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).<br> <br> In September 1862, with both Pope and McClellan back in Washington, Lee launched an invasion into Maryland with the hope of shifting the war's focus away from Virginia and defeating Union forces on their own soil. He also hoped that such a victory on the heels of his victories at Richmond and Manassas would result in European support of the Confederate cause. <br> <br> Believing that McClellan would be slow to react to the Confederate invasion, Lee decided to split his army in order to accomplish several goals simultaneously. He issued orders outlining this plan to each of his commanders in Special Orders 191. McClellan surprised Lee, and rather than displaying his usual slowness of action, rapidly dispatched the Army of the Potomac to cut off Lee's advance. When a copy of Special Orders 191 was found by a Union soldier near Frederick, MD, and placed McClellan's hands, Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia were in grave danger. <br> <br> McClellan's delayed reaction to the opportunity to crush Lee's army in separate groups allowed Lee's forces to hold the Army of the Potomac at South Mountain long enough for the full strength of the Army of Northern Virginia to arrive on the field of Antietam on September 17, forcing McClellan into a stalemate. Following this bloodiest day in American history, heavy casualties compelled Lee to withdraw under the cover of darkness and end his campaign into Maryland when his army re-crossed the Potomac River into Virginia.</p>",

Born of a free black women and British immigrant cotton merchant in 1810, Purvis's maternal grandparents were another free woman-of-color and the prominent Jewish-American Charleston flour merchant Baron Judah. When Purvis was nine, his father William moved his family from Charleston to Philadelphia in search of better opportunities for his three multi-racial sons. He enrolled them in the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society's Clarkson School, and when he died in 1826, left them each substantial fortunes. <br> <br> Purvis graduated from Amherst Academy in Massachusetts not long after and then returned to Philadelphia, where he took up the abolitionist cause in earnest. In 1833, Purvis helped abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison establish the American Anti-Slavery Society Philadelphia, signing its \"Declaration of Sentiments,\" and also the Library Company of Colored People. He lectured widely and organized resistance to efforts aimed at restricting free blacks' civil rights. Between 1845 and 1850, Purvis served as president of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, and from 1852 to 1857, chaired the General Vigilance Committee which provided direct assistance to runaway slaves. Purvis supported many progressive causes beyond abolition. He served as the first vice president of the Woman's Suffrage Society and supported the drive to limit the availability of alcohol.</p>",

He attended the Virginia Military Institute where he graduated third in his class before going on to law school at the University of Virginia. When Virginia seceded from the Union in the spring of 1861 Garland left his law practice to join the 11th Virginia Infantry as a Colonel. <br> <br> Garland earned a reputation for bravery in battle and was promoted to Brigadier General. During the Maryland Campaign Garland's brigade was tasked with defending Fox's Gap during the Battle of South Mountain. This battle was a turning point in the Maryland Campaign, which had previously been met with Confederate victory. However, unbeknownst to the Confederates, Lee's battle plans had been discovered by Union forces and when Lee divided his army between Harpers Ferry and South Mountain the Union advanced. At the South Mountain gaps the Union met with a relatively small Confederate force, amongst this force was Garland's brigade. During the fighting Garland was killed. In his official record of the battle D.H. Hill called Garland a \"pure, gallant, and accomplished Christian soldier.\"</p>",

Historians debate how much Dr. Mudd knew of the plot to kidnap or kill the president and others before the event, but certain facts are indisputable: that Mudd was entirely sympathetic to the Southern cause; that Booth visited his farm some weeks before the event; that Mudd met with Booth and other conspirators multiple times in Washington and they with him at his farm; that he lied about knowing Booth; and that he delayed notifying authorities of Booth's presence in his home until days after Booth's departure.<br> <br> Despite the circumstantial evidence, no direct testimony of Mudd's prior involvement in the plot emerged during his trial and, though convicted as a conspirator, Mudd escaped the death penalty by a single vote of the Military Commission. After Mudd's trial, conspirator George Atzerodt claimed that Dr. Mudd played an important role in the scheme. \"I am certain Dr. Mudd knew all about it,\" Atzerodt said. \"Booth sent liquors and provisions for the trip with the [kidnapped] President to Richmond about two weeks before the murder to Dr. Mudd's.\" Samuel Mudd was sentenced to life imprisonment for his association with the assassins and was imprisoned at Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas off the Florida coast, but was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1869.

He was gifted at leading a squad or regiment in combat, but when asked to command a Union corps, he floundered.<br> <br> It was in this latter capacity that he took part in the Peninsula and Northern Virginia Campaigns, commanding the III Corps of the Army of the Potomac. <br> <br> It was Heintzelman who, leading the Union advance at Yorktown, vastly overestimated the strength of the Confederate defenders. This inflation of Confederate numbers was enough to convince the naturally cautious McClellan to pull back from the advance and lay siege to the village, affectively stalling the campaign. This natural caution and penchant for magnifying the difficulties before him only increased for Heintzelman during the Peninsula Campaign. His corps performed well, but the success was due to the fact that Heintzelman commanded two of the army's best combat divisions under Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny. Both men led effectively and fought valiantly while Heintzelman exercised little influence and control. <br> <br> The same can be said of the Northern Virginia Campaign, which proved to be Heintzelman's last as a corps commander as a result of his failure to exhibit the attributes of an officer destined for future responsibilities.<br> <br> After pulling back from Richmond, Heintzelman's corps embarked from Fort Monroe and landed at Alexandria on August 22. His men, along with Porter's corps were immediately pushed forward to join Pope near Manassas. Philip Kearny's division of Heintzelman's corps reached Pope on the 24th and Joseph Hooker's division joined the Army of Virginia the following day. They were among the few divisions of the Army of the Potomac to actually participate in the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run). <br> <br> During the Maryland Campaign the III Corps remained in Washington, D.C. <br> <br> Though the Corps rejoined the Army of the Potomac following the campaign, Heintzelman did not accompany them. After being relieved of corps command on October 12 he was assigned to the Military District of Washington where he remained for nearly 2 years.</p>",

As a young man, Colfax worked as a newspaper reporter and publisher, establishing important political contacts in the process. He joined the Whig party where he developed a reputation as a rising young politician and was selected for a number of party posts, including the party's nomination for Congress in 1850 (he lost). <br> <br> With the Whig party collapsing, he joined the newly formed Republican Party where he ran again for Congress, winning a seat that he would hold from 1855-1869, and serving as Speaker of the House from 1863 to the end of his term. An opponent of slavery, Colfax joined the Radical Republicans and strongly supported the Freeman's Bureau, the Civil Rights Bill and the Reconstruction Acts. <br> <br> After the Civil War, Colfax clashed with President Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction and voted for his impeachment in 1868. Ulysses S. Grant selected Colfax as his running mate during his bid for the presidency in 1868 and, upon Grant's election, Colfax served as vice president from 1869 to 1873. Unfortunately, Colfax was implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandal in 1872 which damaged his reputation and cost him the renomination for vice president that same year. After leaving office, Schuyler, Colfax embarked on a successful career as a lecturer until his death in 1885.</p>",

Orphaned at the age of nine, he was forced to work in printing and editing and during the early 1820s he worked briefly for congressional printers in Washington D.C., where he learned about national politics and established important political connections. In 1824, he returned to Pennsylvania, to run the Republican newspaper and was soon implementing considerable influence in state and national politics. <br> <br> Ambitious and materialistic, Simon Cameron set his sights higher than state politics and won a seat in the United States Senate as a Democrat in 1844. Although not re-elected at the end of his term, Cameron joined the new Republican Party and was returned to the Senate in 1857. He would remain a Republican for the remainder of his career and was largely responsible for making the Pennsylvania Republican party an efficient political machine. <br> <br> Though a candidate for president in 1860, Cameron threw his support to Abraham Lincoln during the Republican National Convention, for which he was rewarded with the appointment as Secretary of War upon Lincoln's election. After less than a year in office, however, Cameron was replaced due to allegations of corruption and was appointed minister to Russia. After the Civil War, Cameron was again elected to the senate in 1867, joining the Radical Republicans. He remained active in politics until his death in 1889.</p>",

He began the Civil War opposed to secession but reversed himself after Federal militia under Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon seized Camp Jackson, where pro-secessionist militia had gathered. <br> <br> At the beginning of the war, Price was given command of the Missouri State Guard and led his forces to two early Confederate victories, the first at Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861 and the second at Lexington, in mid-September. Price was commissioned a major general in the Confederate States Army on March 6, 1862 just before the Battle of Pea Ridge. His forces were defeated there and again at Iuka and Corinth in Mississippi. Price's command fought a series of minor engagements during 1863 which had little effect on the war. <br> <br> Then, in the fall of 1864, Price mounted one final campaign, a large-scale raid into Missouri and Kansas from his base in northern Arkansas. Price cut a wide swath of destruction across his home state but was finally run to ground by two Union armies at Westport in present-day Kansas City and soundly defeated. Price and the remnants of his command then fled south into Indian Territory and finally Texas. <br> <br> Price never surrendered after the war. He led his troops over the border and offered their services to Mexican Emperor Maximilian I, who refused them. Price then settled in a colony of former Confederates in Carlota, Veracruz. He was impoverished and in poor health when he returned to the United States in 1866. He died in St. Louis on September 29, 1867.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Known as the Prophet, Tenskwatawa was born in a time of turmoil for both American Indians in general and also in his family. Native Nations struggled to keep settlers out of the Ohio Valley, and Tenskwatawa's father was killed shortly before his birth in the Battle of Point Pleasant Puckshinwa. At birth, Tenskwatawa was given the name Lalawethika, or “The Noise Maker.” He and brother <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/tecumseh.htm\">Tecumseh</a> were raised by siblings.</p><p>Lalawethika seemed destined to live in the shadow of his deceased father and his older brothers. Small of stature, he did not receive the warrior training Tecumseh would receive. He was so poor with a bow and arrow that he shot his own eye out in a hunting accident, later contributing to a reliance on alcohol, and separation from his family.</p><p>But this life would dramatically change one day during the winter of 1804. Following an alcohol-enduced near-death experience, Lalawethika suddenly awoke and shared a vision. He preached how he was going to change and lead the American Indians to change so they could reclaim what they had lost. From this day forward he would be known as Tenskwatawa, meaning the “The Open Door” or “One With Open Mouth,” or more simply \"The Prophet.\" This and visions that followed called for a united federation of American Indians to give up Euro-American conveniences and distractions and go back to traditional ways of the American Indians.</p><p>This following was cemented in 1806, with a miracle. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-henry-harrison.htm\">William Henry Harrison</a>, Territorial Governor of Indiana, challenged Tenkswatawa to prove that he was truly a prophet. Tenskwatawa correctly predicted a solar eclipse, cementing his follower’s beliefs and attracting more followers. Eventually Tenskwatawa established a headquarters for the united Indian Confederation on the banks of the Tippecanoe River in western Indiana Territory, called Prophetstown. Tensions mounted between the Federation and American settlers in 1811, and the village was attacked and destroyed by William Henry Harrison's army.</p><p>Although devastating to the cause of the Pan-Indian Federation, Tenskwatawa continued to preach and have a substantial following even after the death of his brother Tecumseh in the Battle of the Thames. In 1825, Tenskwatawa established a village for the Shawnee people at the site of modern day Kansas City, Kansas. Tenskwatawa died in 1836 in the village he established.</p>",

Ford organized a company of volunteers in 1847 and was the Captain of that company during the Mexican-American War. From 1856 to 1858, he was the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio under Salmon P. Chase. When the Civil War began, Ford was commissioned as Colonel of the 32nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. <br> <br> In September 1862, Ford was in command of the Federal position on Maryland Heights at Harpers Ferry. He and his troops faced Confederate forces under Major General Lafayette McLaws' command. After several hours of fighting, around 3:30pm on September 13, Ford called for the Union troops to retreat from the heights. Ford's decision to abandon Maryland Heights was a shock to the overall commander of the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, Colonel Dixon S. Miles. Unable to hold Harpers Ferry, approximately 12,700 Union soldiers surrendered to the Confederates on September 15, 1862.<br> <br> Ford was arrested by the War Commission and put on trial by the United States military because of his surrender. He was found to be negligent for abandoning his command and guilty of improper conduct.

            "bodyText": "<p>Thomas Lafayette Rosser was a West Point student who resigned from the academy two weeks before graduation when his adopted state of Texas seceded from the Union. He began the war as an instructor for New Orleans' Washington Artillery and commanded its Second Battery in the First Battle of Manassas. He was promoted to captain as a reward for shooting down a Union observation balloon. <br> <br> He was severely wounded at the Battle of Mechanicsville on June 26, 1862 but recovered and was promoted to colonel of the 5th Virginia Cavalry. He then commanded the advance of Jeb Stuart's expedition to Catlett's Station in August 1862 and participated in the Second Battle of Bull Run, where he captured Union commander John Pope's orderly and horses. <br> <br> He fought at Crampton's Gap at the Battle of South Mountain where, with help from John Pelham's artillery, his cavalry delayed the advance of William B. Franklin's VI Corps. At Antietam, his men screened Robert E. Lee's left flank. He temporarily assumed command of Fitzhugh Lee's brigade during the subsequent fighting against Alfred Pleasonton and was wounded again at the Battle of Kelly's Ford in March 1863. <br> <br> After Gettysburg, Rosser was promoted to brigadier general of the \"Laurel Brigade,\" and during the Battle of the Wilderness, promoted to brigadier general. He was again wounded at Trevilian Station, the bloodiest and largest all-cavalry battle of the war. For distinguished service in the Shenandoah Valley, he was promoted to major general in November 1864. In January 1865, he conducted a successful raid on New Creek, West Virginia where he seized hundreds of prisoners and tons of supplies. He commanded a cavalry division during the Siege of Petersburg and took part in the Appomattox Campaign. His commanded escaped encirclement at Appomattox but was finally captured on May 4, 1865 near Staunton, Virginia. <br> <br> After the war, Rosser became superintendent of the National Express Company and later chief engineer of the Northern Pacific and Canadian Pacific Railroads. In 1886, he bought a plantation near Charlottesville, Virginia and became a gentleman farmer. Rosser returned to the military briefly in 1898 when he was appointed a brigadier general of the volunteers during the Spanish-American War.</p>",

And it was only after a year of medical practice that he joined the U.S. Army, becoming Assistant Surgeon in July 1849, and medical director of Fort Riley in Kansas.<br> <br> He left the military in October 1860 for a chairship at the University of Maryland, only to rejoin in May 1861, shortly after the start of the Civil War. He was soon promoted to camp and hospital inspector, and in April 1862, became the U.S. Army's 11th Surgeon General.<br> <br> As surgeon general, Hammond was very efficient and sought a number of positive changes including the opening of a permanent hospital corps, a permanent general hospital, and a military medical laboratory, and the National Museum of Health and Medicine, almost all of which were eventually implemented.<br> <br> Unfortunately, not everyone in the military community approved of the changes, particularly Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. The friction between the two men resulted in Hammond being reassigned to oversee sanitary conditions at the Department of the South in New Orleans, Louisiana. He demanded either his reinstatement as surgeon general or a trial by court-martial. A trial ensued, at least partially motivated by Stanton's personal dislike of Hammond, and when Hammond was questionably found guilty of charges relating to irregularities in the purchase of medical supplies, he was dismissed from the army.<br> <br> Hammond's medical career did not end with his dismissal from the army in August 1864, however. He went on to teach at several medical schools, co-establish the American Neurological Foundation, and found a sanatorium in Washington, D.C. He also campaigned to have the military charges against him dropped and in 1879 was restored to the army's retired list of personnel with the grade of brigadier general, although without any pay or allowances.<br> <br> He died in 1900 at the age of 72, and is was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<strong>From the Peninsula to Maryland: Barksdale's role in the summer of 1862</strong><br><br>Though born in Tennessee, in 1853 William Barksdale was elected to represent the state of Mississippi in Congress, where he quickly became known for his unwavering pro-slavery and state's rights political views. When Mississippi seceded for the Union in 1861 Barksdale resigned from Congress and accepted a commission as an officer in the Mississippi Militia. On May 1, 1861 he was promoted to Colonel and given command of the 13th Mississippi Infantry, which he led at the First Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) and during the Peninsula Campaign. <br> <br> Barksdale assumed command of the brigade when his brigade commander, Brigadier General Richard Griffith, was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862. After Barksdale led the brigade in an attempt to take the Union position on Malvern Hill the brigade quickly became known as \"Barksdale's Mississippi Brigade\" and Barksdale was promoted to brigadier general on August 12, 1862.<br> <br> Barksdale and his Brigade were sent to the Harpers Ferry region following the Peninsula Campaign and so did not participate in the Second Battle of Manassas. He and his men did, however, fight at the battles of Harpers Ferry and Antietam in the division of Major General Lafayette McLaws. <br> <br> At Harpers Ferry Barksdale was a part of the fighting at Maryland Heights, sent there to protect the rear and block Union retreat. Gaining control of Maryland Heights gave the Confederates a great advantage in the battle and was a key element in securing their victory. At Antietam Barksdale and the rest of McLaws' Division fought in the West Woods, beginning near daybreak on September 17. <br> <br> Following Antietam, Barksdale went on to fight at Gettysburg, where he was mortally wounded and died from his wounds on July 3, 1863. It is reported that his last words were: \"I am killed! Tell my wife and children that I died fighting at my post.\"</p>",

Shortly afterwards he was appointed to be a division commander in the newly created Army of the Potomac. In March 1862, when the army was reorganized into corps, Franklin was selected as the commander of VI Corps, which he subsequently led in the Peninsula Campaign. <br> <br> Franklin had a close relationship with General George McClellan, and it was likely due more to their comradeship, rather than Franklin's skill as a commander, that he rose so quickly through the ranks. <br> <br> Though he was promoted to Major General on July 4, 1862 he did not participate in the Northern Virginia Campaign. The reasons why he did not are closely tied to McClellan's lack of commitment to supporting Pope's Army of Virginia. <br> <br> When the Army of the Potomac pulled away from Richmond Franklin's VI Corps sailed from Fort Monroe to Alexandria, only 25 miles from Manassas. On August 27 Halleck extracted a promise from McClellan to immediately advance Sumner's and Franklin's corps to support Pope at Manassas, but later that same day McClellan canceled the orders for Franklin to march. He instead held Franklin in Alexandria for the next two days, even as the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) was being fought.<br> <br> On the 28th Halleck again ordered McClellan to send Franklin's corps forward to Pope. He also contacted Franklin directly, instructing him to march even if McClellan has not issued the orders. Even so, when he did not receive direct orders from McClellan, Franklin remained in Alexandria.<br> <br> On the 29th Franklin was once again ordered to march to Pope's assistance early in the morning, and finally began to move, but at McClellan's suggestion, he halted at Annandale, only seven miles from Washington. <br> <br> Finally, on August 30 Franklin's corps departed Annandale and pushed ahead as far as Centerville, where he encountered the fragments of Pope's beaten army retreating toward Washington. He had arrived just in time to be of no assistance. <br> <br> Franklin's failure to march forward to support the Army of Virginia elicited charges from Pope that he had failed to obey orders. Nothing ever came of these charges, however, since Pope was removed from command and Franklin's inaction was correctly viewed as a direct result of his deference to McClellan.<br> <br> During the Maryland Campaign McClellan's decision to delay the departure of troops after he received a copy of Special Orders 191 meant that Franklin was unable to reach the beleaguered garrison at Harpers Ferry before it was captured by Jackson on September 15. <br> <br> After the garrison fell Franklin diverted from his path toward Harpers Ferry and marched north to join the rest of the Army of the Potomac outside of Sharpsburg where his corps was placed in reserve.<br> <br> During the fighting at Antietam on September 17, Franklin tried in vain to convince Edwin V. Sumner and McClellan to allow his corps to exploit the weakened position in the Confederate center, as he was perfectly positioned to do so. Believing that the Confederates had far more men than they actually did, McClellan repeatedly refused to commit his reserves. This reserve totaled more than 25,000 men, including Franklin's VI Corps, who remained idle throughout the day. It was a notable lost opportunity.</p>",

Originally a Unionist, Yancey's thinking evolved following his marriage and receipt of 35 slaves as part of his dowry. As a slave owner, he began to identify with other pro-slavery positions arguing against any attempt to expand federal power, including the establishment of a national bank.<br> <br> For Yancey, slavery became the most important issue facing the South. Increasingly drawn to radical Southern politics, Yancey won a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives in 1841, then after opening a law practice, won election to the Alabama Senate two years later. In the state senate he fought against adopting the \"federal ratio\" of counting slaves as three-fifths of a person in determining apportionment in the state legislature.<br> <br> Yancey won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1844 and quickly acquired a national reputation based on his skills as an orator and unyielding proponent of slavery and states' rights. He resigned his seat in 1846 and returned to Alabama from where, as a member of the \"fire-eaters,\" he eschewed any federal attempt to restrict slavery, including the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850. At the 1860 Democratic National Convention, failure to adopt Yancey's pro-slavery platform caused a split in the party between North and South factions, leading to the election of Abraham Lincoln.<br> <br> Following secession, Yancey served as Confederate emissary to Britain and France. Unable to convince either country to recognize the CSA, he returned home in 1863 and served in the Confederate Senate until his death in 1863.</p>",

But ultimately was forced to escape to Missouri to avoid prosecution for theft and murder. <br> <br> After the outbreak of the American Civil War Quantrill first served with the Confederate army in Missouri but by the end of 1861 had put together a guerilla band, perhaps due in part to his dislike for military discipline. Union forces declared Quantrill's raiders to be outlaws; the Confederates made them an official troop in August 1862, giving Quantrill the rank of captain. On Aug. 21, 1863, his troop of about 450 men raided Lawrence, Kansas, killing 183 civilian men and boys and burning most of the town's buildings. <br> <br> Two months later, donning Federal uniforms, the raiders surprised a detachment of Union soldiers at Baxter Springs, Kansas, and murdered about 90 of them. As the Civil War drew to a close Quantrill's followers broke up into smaller bands to continue their criminal pursuits. On May 10, 1865, Quantrill ambushed and mortally wounded in by Union forces near Taylorsville, Kentucky; he died of his wounds on June 6 at the age of 27.</p>",

Perhaps Hariot’s most lasting legacy was the publication of “A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.” First published in 1588, it provided the most detailed account of the new Virginia colony, as the English referred to Roanoke Island. While it in some respects painted too positive a picture of England’s attempt to colonize the New World, it nonetheless proved a valuable resource for researching and studying the native peoples and the surrounding land.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Thomas Hariot died of cancer in London in 1621.</span></p>",

He grew up in Norfolk, Virginia, and was appointed from that state to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. As an undergraduate at West Point, Mahan taught mathematics to underclassmen. Graduating at the top of his class in 1824, he soon returned to the Academy to teach civil and military engineering </span><span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">from 1824 to 1871</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">. He </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">was a noted American military author. He is also the father of accomplished naval historian and theorist Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan. </span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">From 1826 to 1830, the War Department sent him to Europe to study public engineering works and military institutions. On his return to West Point Mahan continued to teach. He taught the course on military science taken by virtually every West Pointer who fought in the Civil War. He was also a recognized authority on military engineering and wrote several books that were considered standards in his field. Some of his works include: <em>Complete Treatise on Field Fortification</em> (1836), <em>Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works</em> (1850), and <em>An Elementary Course of Military Engineering</em> (2 vol., 1866–67). Despite its odd title, his textbook, <em>Elementary Treatise on Advance-Guard, Out-Post, and Detachment Service of Troops</em> (1847, often reprinted), was America’s first comprehensive work on tactics and strategy.<br /><br />Professor Mahan was married to Mary Helena Okill and they raised five children. Their oldest son, Alfred Thayer, chose the U.S. Naval Academy and became a renowned naval strategist and historian. A younger son, Frederick August, graduated from West Point in 1867.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">Shortly after the academy's board recommended his retirement in 1871, Mahan took his own life. H</span>e died near Stoney Point, New York, from suicide during an insanity attack that resulted from his inability to deal with his forced retirement.</p> <p>Fort Mahan, located at Benning Road and 42nd Street, NE, Washington D.C., was named after Professor Mahan. <span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">Over time, Mahan became a highly respected and influential figure at the Academy through his work to shape the school's curriculum. Most Civil War commanders, both Union and Confederate, learned about fortifications and strategy from Mahan's lectures and writing. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </span></p>",

In 1947 as a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, Rustin planned the\"Journey of Reconciliation\", which would be used as a model for the Freedom Rides of the 1960's. He served as a mentor to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/martinlutherkingjr.htm\">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in the practice of nonviolent civil resistance, and was an intellectual and organizational force behind the burgeoning civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s. He organized protests in England and studied Ghandian principles in India. His life as an openly gay man, however, put him at odds with the cultural norms of the larger society and left him either working behind the scenes or outside of the movement for stretches of time.</p> <p>Born 1912 in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Rustin was raised a Quaker and his family was engaged in civil rights activism. He attended Wilberforce University, Cheney State Teachers College, and City College of New York. A charismatic man, he earned a living as a spiritual singer in nightclubs while living in New York City. He took a brief interest in the Communist movement and was a life-long pacifist, due to his Quaker upbringing. His commitment to civil and human rights came at a personal cost. He was arrested multiple times and twice went to jail.</p> <p>In the 1940s he met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/a-phillip-randolph.htm\">A. Philip Randolph</a> and worked with him on various proposed marches on Washington, D.C. to protest segregation in the armed forces and the defense industry. Because of their experiences together, when Randolph was name to head the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm\">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> in 1963, he appointed Rustin as Deputy Director and overall logistical planner. In 1947, Rustin and George Houser, executive secretary of CORE, organized the Journey of Reconciliation which was the first of the Freedom Rides. The Rides were intended to test the U.S. Supreme Court's ban on racial discrimination in interstate travel. Rustin was arrested for violating state laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation and served twenty-two days on a chain gang.</p> <p>With the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, his talents and tireless work were transferred to human rights and the gay rights movement. In the 1970s and 1980s he worked as a human rights and election monitor for Freedom House and also testified on behalf of New York State's Gay Rights Bill. Bayard Rustin died from a ruptured appendix on August 24, 1987 at the age of 75.</p>",

Connor, a staunch white supremacist, was at the center of white efforts to impede the work of the civil rights movement in Birmingham.</p> <p>Connor began his political career in 1934, winning a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives. In 1936, he was elected Commissioner of Public Safety for the city of Birmingham serving until 1952 and again from 1956 to 1963. This position gave him responsibility for administrative oversight of the Fire Department, Police Department, schools, public health service, and libraries.</p> <p>In 1961, during the Freedom Rides, Connor ordered Birmingham police to stay away from the bus station while Klansmen attacked the arriving buses and Freedom Riders. In April of 1963, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/martinlutherkingjr.htm\">Martin Luther King, Jr</a>. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) decided to focus their civil rights efforts on Birmingham. On May 2nd, as part of these efforts, more than a thousand students ranging in age from eight to eighteen left school and gathered at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/16thstreetbaptist.htm\">16th Street Baptist Church</a> intending to march downtown. By the end of the day 1,200 children had been arrested. On May 3rd, another thousand students gathered to march in protest. Connor ordered the use of fire hoses and attack dogs to disperse the marchers, eventually incarcerating over 3,000 demonstrators. These brutal tactics helped focus national attention on the civil rights movement.</p> <p>After leaving office in 1963, Connor was elected to two terms as president of the Alabama Public Service Commission. He died as the result of a stroke on March 10, 1973.</p>",

Born in 1912, she graduated fromRankin High School in Pennsylvania in 1929 and attended New York University, Columbia University, and the New York School of Social Work. Height began her efforts as a civil rights activist at the age of twenty-five when she joined the National Council of Negro Women. Throughout her life she fought for equal rights for both African Americans and women. During the 1930s she was an activist against lynching and for reforms to the criminal justice system.</p> <p>In 1957, Height was appointed president of the National Council of Negro Women, which she led for 40 years. As head of the Council during the most critical years of the civil rights movement, she instituted a variety of social programs aimed at improving the quality of life of African Americans in the South. Height is also credited with being the first person in the movement to view the problems of equality for women and equality for African Americans as a whole, merging issues that had been historically separate. Her focus on political mobilization was vital for African American women who were not able to engage in politics at a level on par with their white counterparts. A prize-winning orator in her own right, Height fostered dialogue and communication between black and white women and was an effective mediator during disputes in planning meetings with leaders of varying philosophies. She was the only woman to serve regularly alongside the “Big Six” on major civil rights projects. Although she was not featured as a speaker during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm\">March on Washington</a> in 1963, Height was one of the event’s chief organizers and represented the only women’s organization recognized in the March.</p> <p>During the 1960s and 1970s, Height served on a number of committees, including the President's Committee on the Employment of the Handicapped, and the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. In 1974, she was named to the National Council for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, which published The Belmont Report, a response to the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004 for her civil rights activism. Dorothy Height passed away on March 25, 2010 at the age of 98.</p>",

Born in Burkhardsdorf, Upper Silesia (now part of Poland), Prinz became a rabbi in Berlin in 1925. During his tenure, he was a well-recognized figure and combined the learned traditions of the rabbinate with a populist touch. An outspoken opponent of the rising National Socialists' German Workers (NaziI) Party, Prinz pleaded with his and other Jewish communities to pay attention to the vitriolic rhetoric coming from the party and its leader, Adolph Hitler. His activism led to his expulsion from Germany in 1937; however his concerns proved correct for Jews across Europe.</p> <p>After his expulsion, Prinz immigrated to the United States and became rabbi of Temple B'nai Abraham in Newark, New Jersey in 1939. He was a dynamic force nationally, serving as president of the American Jewish Congress from 1958 to 1966. He saw the plight of African American and other minority groups in the context of his own experience under the Nazis. From his early days in Newark, a city with a very large minority community, he spoke from his synagogue about the disgrace of discrimination. He joined picket lines across America protesting racial prejudice from unequal employment to segregated schools, housing, and all other areas of life. Prinz met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/martinlutherkingjr.htm\">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in 1958 and recognized a kindred spirit. He was one of the organizers of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm\">March on Washington</a> and stated in <a href=\"http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm\">his speech</a> at the Lincoln Memorial that \"the most urgent, the most disgraceful, the most shameful and the most tragic problem is silence.\"</p>",

In 1960, Lewis, along with students from other universities across the country, founded the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Throughout the early 1960s, Lewis worked with SNCC conducting voter registration efforts and demonstrations throughout the South. Lewis often endured severe physical violence at the hands of segregationists while participating in demonstrations, earning him a reputation as one of the movement’s most courageous leaders.</p> <p>In 1963, Lewis was selected to head SNCC, a position he held through 1966. Lewis was a planner and platform speaker for the 1963 March on Washington. Only 23 at the time, he was the youngest person to speak at the event. Lewis’ commitment to non-violence would be tested the following year as he and hundreds of protesters were brutally attacked by police as they attempted to march peacefully across the Pettis bridge in Selma, AL, in what would be known as <em>Bloody Sunday</em>. The event, which received wide media coverage, showed the cruelty and brutality of segregation in the South and helped hasten passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Lewis became active in politics during the 1970s, and has served as a member of Congress since 1987.</p>",

Born into a respected farm family in Linden, Alabama, Abernathy did not experience overt racism until he joined the Army during World War II. Following the war, he attended Alabama State University, entered the ministry, and earned a master's degree from Atlanta University. He became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery in 1950.</span></p> <p>Abernathy was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/martinlutherkingjr.htm\">Martin Luther King, Jr.'s</a> long-time friend and confidant. He encouraged King to join Montgomery, Alabama's black community in protesting the arrest of Rosa Parks in December 1955. Both men emerged as leaders of the successful 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott, forcing the integration of the city's public transportation. That landmark victory catapulted Abernathy and King to the forefront of the national civil rights movement.</p> <p>Abernathy worked with King and others to establish the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/sclc.htm\">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) in 1957. The SCLC galvanized and supported nonviolent protests that were springing up primarily throughout the South. Abernathy served as the SCLC secretary-treasurer from 1957 to 1968. After King's assassination, he became SCLC's second president (1968-1977) and carried out King's plan for a 1968 demonstration in Washington, D.C. Called the Poor People's Campaign, it was intended to shine a spotlight on hunger and poverty in the U.S. Thousands of people led by Abernathy and the SCLC set up a shantytown, camping on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama\">National Mall</a> for six weeks before being removed by the police.</p> <p>As pastor of West Hunter Street Baptist Church in Atlanta (1961-1990), Abernathy continued his activism until his death in 1990 at the age of 64.</p>",

His connection with disadvantaged groups in society informed his political and personal choices. As a young man, he aligned with the Socialist Movement, before abandoning it for liberal Democrats such as Franklin D. Roosevelt. He led union workers to middle class prosperity through shrewd negotiation tactics and by putting their needs first. Reuther's more liberal convictions convinced him to break away from the AFL-CIO (a re-merger he had negotiated).

Lillian, born in 1888, grew up at the ranch. Lillian taught school for several years and attended Knox College in Illinois. In 1917 her sister, Hildegard, began boarding guests at the ranch on weekends, and Lillian soon gave up teaching to help with the business.</p> <p>In 1923, Lillian married Ed Riggs, a childhood neighbor. Together, Lillian and Ed Riggs managed the Faraway Ranch, now part of Chiricahua National Monument, during its heyday as a guest ranch in the 1920s and 1930s.</p> <p>They also were instrumental in the effort to create Chiricahua National Monument and helped open the area to visitors by constructing riding and hiking trails. Lillian and Ed worked to construct some trails into the rugged area of spectacular rock formations, which Lillian called the “Wonderland of Rocks,” in time for a planned visit by the governor of Arizona in 1923. President Calvin Coolidge signed the legislation creating Chiricahua National Monument a year later.</p> <p>The Riggses also ran cattle on the ranch, but as bad economic conditions persisted in the 1920s and 1930s, their profits from tourism became increasingly important. Even during the Depression, many people continued to visit the national monument and stay at Faraway Ranch. Because Faraway Ranch provided the only lodging close to the national monument, the Riggses had a “virtual monopoly” on profits derived from tourism.</p> <p>Lillian suffered from hearing problems and in 1942 became blind. Ed died in 1950, and Lillian kept the ranch open to guests on an intermittent basis, persevering despite her handicaps. Lillian died in 1977, and the National Park Service acquired Faraway Ranch in 1979.

Adolph graduated from Concordia College in 1925 with a degree in biology, and the following three summers worked as a seasonal ranger in Glacier National Park.

Gen. George B. McClellan appointed him a brigadier general in September 1861 and he joined the Army of the Potomac.<br /><br />Hancock's skill was noticed early on in the war, particularly after his efforts during the Battle of Williamsburg and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/\">Battle of Antietam</a>, and by November 1862, he was promoted to major general. Today he is most noted for his performance as a corps commander during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gett/\">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, however, where his tactical moves and encouragement of his troops, despite sustaining a serious wound from which he never fully recovered, earned him an official thanks from Congress.<br /><br />He remained on the front throughout the 1864 where he performed with distinction at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frsp/index.htm\">Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/rich/index.htm\">Cold Harbor</a>, but complications from his Gettysburg wound forced him to leave the field in November 1864, after watching his II corps suffer in excess of 40,000 casualties during the Overland Campaign alone. He assumed departmental command instead, a position he held until the war's end.<br /><br />After the war, he continued to serve various military assignments including supervision of the Lincoln assassination conspirators' execution and the overseeing of Reconstruction efforts in the south. On the Great Plains in 1867, Hancock struggled to advance U.S. interests, and his actions in Kansas led to a season of violence known as \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fols/learn/historyculture/hancocks-war.htm\">Hancock's War</a>.\" Extremely well-liked and noted for his integrity, Hancock's popularity as a leader continued after the war, most notably with his nomination as the Democratic candidate in the presidential race of 1880, although he was defeated by Republican candidate (and fellow Civil War veteran) James A. Garfield.<br /><br />After the election until his death in 1886, Hancock continued to serve as commander of the Division of the Atlantic and was head of a number of national veterans organizations, including the National Rifle Association, Military Service Institution of the United States, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) and the National Rifle Association.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>William “Wild Bill” Donovan is considered the father of American centralized intelligence. Major General Donovan led the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) from 1942 to 1945. The OSS was the forerunner of today’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Throughout his lifetime of service he was awarded numerous medals. He was the first person in American history to have earned the country’s four highest awards: The Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the National Security Medal.</p> <p>William Joseph Donovan was born January 1, 1883 in Buffalo, New York. The grandson of Irish immigrants, he was very religious and wanted to become a Catholic Priest. He was a life-long Republican, but believed in supporting the best man, no matter what their political affiliation. Donovan graduated from Columbia Law School in 1907 and practiced corporate law. He joined the New York National Guard in 1912 as a captain. Captain Donovan served on the Mexican border during the campaign against Pancho Villa in 1916.</p> <p>During World War 1, Donovan served as a major in the 165th (formerly 69th) New York Infantry Regiment, Rainbow Division. In France he led troops into battle throughout the Champagne-Marne, St. Mihiel, and Argonne campaigns. His courage under fire earned Donovan the nickname “Wild Bill”. He was wounded several times and for his service at Landres-et-St.Georges he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. By the end of WWI, Donovan had been promoted to the rank of colonel and awarded several medals by the United States and its European allies. He became one of the most decorated soldiers of WWI.</p> <p>Colonel Donovan began his intelligence career while serving with the American Expeditionary Force during the Russian Civil War. Donovan continued his intelligence gathering in the 1920s and 1930s through fact-finding trips in Europe. In 1941, President Roosevelt chose Donovan to head the new Office of the Coordinator of information (COI). The main goal of the COI was to get the intelligence braches of the Army, Navy, FBI, and State Department to work more closely together.</p> <p>The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was formed out of the COI after America entered the Second World War. Colonel (and later Major General) Donovan was once again selected to lead this intelligence operation. The OSS conducted espionage, sabotage, and morale operations against Nazi Germany in Europe and Japanese Forces in Asia. The OSS prepared the French resistance for Operation Overlord (D-Day). In Burma, OSS Detachment 101 led successful missions against the Japanese military. President Roosevelt referred to Donovan as his “secret legs” and General Dwight D. Eisenhower though very highly of him as well. However, not everybody appreciated Donovan and the OSS. Some notable critics were FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, General Douglas MacArthur, President Harry S Truman, and several members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p> <p>In September 1945, the OSS was dissolved (the CIA would take its place in 1947). Donovan became a lawyer once again, first during the prosecution of Nazis at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal and later as a Wall Street lawyer. From 1953-1954 he was appointed Ambassador to Thailand by President Eisenhower. In 1956 he was diagnosed with arteriosclerosis. Donovan died on February 8, 1959 in Washington, D.C. and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>No American was better prepared to be president than John Quincy Adams. He was the son of the second president of the United States, John Adams, and his mother, Abigail Adams, was a fervent revolutionary patriot in her own right. Through their example, he learned to value the sacrifices necessary to preserve and protect democracy, and the level-headed temperment required to be an effective leader.</p> <p>As an 8 year-old Adams received letters from his father at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which reflected on the ongoing debate for independence. When war broke out, John Quincy and Abigail watched battles in the distance from a hill near their farm outside of Boston. These experiences made John Quincy Adams literally a child of the American Revolution: sharing a sense of destiny with the new nation, its consolidation, and its expansion.</p> <p>At the age of 10, John Quincy traveled to France with his father, who was on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with Great Britain. There, John Quincy learned about international relations, became close with mentors Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, and perfected his French by teaching English to the new French minister to the United States. His mother implored John Quincy to take great advantage of these opportunities, saying: \"These are the times in which a genius would wish to live. It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed.... Great necessities call out great virtues.\" This opportunity to express “great virtue” finally presented itself in 1781.</p> <p>Although only 14 years of age, Adams was sent to Russia as the private secretary and French interpreter for the U.S. Minister to Russia in 1781. Through this experience, he was able to pursue studies of history, science, and language, and participated in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris that concluded the Revolutionary War. When he returned to Boston, Adams sought to become an attorney, and attended Harvard University.  Adams claimed to be “a man of my whole country,” and indeed he was. Adams was appointed to a diplomatic position by each of the first five presidents of the United States – serving as the foreign Minister to the Netherlands, Prussia, Russia, and England, in addition to serving as a chief negotiator for the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812.  At home, he served as Senator of Massachusetts, and as the Secretary of State under James Monroe. </p> <p>Finally, in 1825, Adams had the opportunity to step into the position he had been grooming for since he was 14: President of the United States. The 1824 election was close, with Adams beating out the popular War of 1812 hero Andrew Jackson in a Congressional run-off. When John Quincy Adams assumed the presidency, he was surrounded by doubters and Jackson’s supporters dedicated to making his tenure difficult. Adams’ vision for the United States was broad and designed for long-term change. He advocated for a national university and naval academy to train future leaders, an extensive commerce system of canals and turnpikes to facilitate trade, a uniform system of weights and measures, and construction of an astronomical observatory to advance the field of science. Many of these proposals were greeted with scorn and derision, and seen as out-of-touch with the American people.</p> <p>As his presidential term progressed, Adams continued to meet opposition from Jacksonian supporters. Adams refused to sign an Indian treaty which would have removed the Creeks from ancestral land in Georgia, but this concern for the rights of American Indians irritated both Southerners and Westerners alike. As Jackson’s supporters took control of both houses of Congress, it became apparent, even before the 1828 election, that like his farther, Adams would serve only one term as President. </p> <p>Yet his political career did not stall. After his presidency, Adams served in the House of Representatives from 1831 until his death in 1848, becoming a tireless champion for the abolitionist cause. In 1839 he presented a constitutional amendment prohibiting any person born in the United States to ever be sold into slavery. After the slave rebellion aboard the ship <em>Amistad, </em>Adams successfully represented the slaves in an 1841 Supreme Court case and ensured their freedom and return to Africa. Adams’ last moments were spent, appropriately, in the U.S. Capitol. He suffered a stroke on February 21, 1848 on the floor of the House of Representatives arguing against the Mexican-American War and died two days later.</p>",

At the time of Ridge’s childhood, Cherokee society dictated that adolescent boys distinguish themselves in the endeavors of hunting and warfare to become a man. These activities were seen as a rite of passage in Cherokee culture. Ridge did not have to wait too long, and in fact, participated in his first battle at the age of 14. He fought with the Chickamauga Cherokees in their raids on white settlements and distinguished himself as a warrior, and by extension, a man.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Once the Chickamaugas made peace with the American government, Ridge moved his family into present-day Georgia and followed many of the aspects of the government’s “civilization” program, by opening a ferry service and becoming a planter and slaveholder. When the Cherokees created a centralized government, Ridge was selected to serve as a Council member at the age of 21. Ridge and other younger Cherokee leaders stifled the revivalist movement in their Nation that spread in other groups such as the Creeks, Shawnees, and Seneca. When the Red Stick movement resulted in civil war among the Creeks, Ridge was encouraged to pick up the mantle of warrior once again. He, along with other younger members of the Cherokee Council, encouraged their neutral leaning elders to go to war against the Red Stick Creeks as allies of the United States government.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">During the Creek War Ridge distinguished himself, and in many ways acted as a good soldier receiving the commission as major. Even so, Ridge continued to act in the role of warrior by taking opportunities for himself on the battlefield rather than waiting for specific orders. An example of such an action is his crossing of the river at Horseshoe Bend. This and the siege with other Cherokee soldiers made General Andrew Jackson’s victory there possible. Ridge, along with many other Cherokee fighters, returned to their homes in the Cherokee Nation with scalps and Red Stick women and children prisoners: the traditional war trophies of successful warriors. Major Ridge kept his commission title, and for the rest of his life he was called Major Ridge. He valued his identity as a United States soldier so much that he wore his military coat when making appearances in public.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Major Ridge embraced both identities of warrior and soldier. His identity as warrior earned him respect among the Cherokees and ultimately a position of leadership within the Nation. Ridge’s identity as a soldier fit best with his desires to be an ally of the United States and adherent of “civilization.” This desire also lead him to sign the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, ceding remaining Cherokee ancestral land for a reservation in Indian Territory. Ultimately, this support would cost him his life. Major Ridge was assassinated in 1839 by oponents to the unpopular treaty.</p>",

He was one of the few Red Stick chiefs to survive the war, and was fully reintegrated into Creek political life after the war. In 1825, he led a party of warriors appointed by the Creek National Council to execute William McIntosh for illegally ceding Creek land to the United States.  Ironically, McIntosh had led the National Creeks allied with the Americans against Menawa and the Red Stick Creeks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In the 1820s and early 1830s, as encroaching Americans poured into Creek county, harassing Creeks and attempting to force them from their homes, Menawa maintained peaceful relations with the United States, even assisting in suppressing a Creek insurgency which erupted in 1836. That war provided an excuse for the forced removal of the entire Creek nation, and Menawa, then around seventy years of age, and his people were moved west in late 1836.</span></p>",

By 1810 he was in Louisiana with his older brother Pierre. They were most likely businessmen in New Orleans or independent privateers before becoming associated with the smuggling and piracy.  </p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1807 the </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">United States outlawed trade with Great Britain and </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">France because of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Merchants in New Orleans began to run out of </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">goods to sell, including slaves. It was around this time that the Lafitte brothers engaged in smuggling and piracy.  </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Merchants </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">and planters were eager to buy the goods and slaves </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Lafitte smuggled into south Louisiana. </span></p> <p><span>By 1812 Lafitte was the leader of the Baratarians with </span><span>headquarters on Grand Terre, a barrier island in the </span><span>Gulf of Mexico near Grand Isle. Lafitte may have </span><span>had as many as 1000 people working for him, including </span><span>free men of color and runaway slaves. </span>The men working for Lafitte were called Baratarians because the waterways they used for smuggling were located in an area called Barataria (the Barataria Preserve of Jean Lafitte National Historical  Park and Preserve is located in this area). Barataria’s swamps and bayous stretched south of New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico. This area had been famous for smuggling even before privateers arrived in 1810 to use the deep water harbor of Barataria Bay.</p> <p>Throughout Barataria, Lafitte built warehouses to store goods and pens to hold slaves. Merchants and planters came to Barataria for auctions, which Lafitte held outside New Orleans to avoid the law. His knowledge of the swamps helped him to make quick getaways. Several times customs officials and soldiers tried to capture Lafitte in the swamps, but they were usually captured, wounded, or killed by the Baratarians. In 1812, several Baratarians including both Pierre and Jean Lafitte were captured but escaped. In the summer of 1814, Pierre was arrested and jailed in New Orleans, but he escaped from jail under mysterious circumstances in September.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Lafitte’s image changed from pirate to patriot during </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">the War of 1812. Britain and the United States </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">declared war in June 1812, but until 1814, most of the </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">fighting took place on the east coast or northern </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">border of the United States. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In September 1814, British military officials sought </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Lafitte’s help in their campaign to attack the U.S. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">from the Gulf of Mexico. Lafitte decided to warn </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">American authorities and offered to help defend </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">New Orleans in exchange for a pardon for his men. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">His warnings were not believed at first and the U.S. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Army and Navy went ahead with a planned attack on </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Lafitte’s base at Grand Terre. </span></p> <p>Although General Andrew Jackson, commander of the American troops, originally described Lafitte as a “hellish banditti,” he finally accepted Lafitte’s help because of the ammunition, cannoneers, and knowledge of the area Lafitte could supply. The expert cannon fire of Jackson’s troops, including Lafitte’s Baratarians, contributed to the American victories during the New Orleans campaign that culminated with the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Most of these battles took place at or near Chalmette Plantation, now Chalmette Battlefield and part of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. </p> <p>Thankful for their help with the American victory, in February 1815 President James Madison offered pardons to the Baratarians for any crimes committed against the United States. Many of the Bartarians settled in New Orleans or in the Barataria area and some of their descendants still live there today. Lafitte eventually returned to smuggling at Galveston Island in Spanish Texas until he was forced out by the U.S. Navy in 1820. His exact whereabouts after that are unknown. His life and death remain as mysterious as the swamps and bayous of Barataria.  </p> <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The name Blackbeard is synonymous with pirating in the eighteenth century. Born Edward Teach (or possibly Thatch), he served England as a privateer in Queen Anne’s War until turning to piracy at war’s end in 1713. </span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">His career in piracy began in the Caribbean with fellow pirate Benjamin Hornigold. In 1717, after Hornigold rewarded him with a hijacked ship, Blackbeard set out on his own. <em>Queen Anne’s Revenge</em>, as Blackbeard now called the ship, carried a crew of approximately 300 men and 40 cannon. He and his men sailed the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast of North America, torturing merchant ship crewmen and passengers, stealing cargo, and gaining a reputation as one of the most notorious pirates in history.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In battle, Blackbeard was a savage opponent with a reputation for inhuman strength. In addition, he cultivated his image to strike fear into the hearts of other sailors, wrapping slow-burning lighted coils in his long, black hair and beard. </span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The image pirates such as Blackbeard cultivated was often just as important as their actions. Flags became an important aspect of that image. In Blackbeard’s case, the flag flying over the <em>Queen Anne’s Revenge</em> depicted a heart dripping blood and a skeleton holding an hourglass and spear. The flag, much like Blackbeard’s personal image, was designed solely to intimidate.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Despite his outlandish persona and reputation as one of the most feared men of the seas, Blackbeard’s time as a pirate was short-lived. </span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Piracy became rampant in North Carolina after Blackbeard bribed colonial governor Charles Eden to ignore criminal activities. With commercial vessels using Ocracoke Inlet to access inland ports, Blackbeard and several other pirates found the coastal waterway an ideal target. </span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">After tolerating Blackbeard’s terrorism for eighteen months, North Carolina residents and merchant sailors begged Virginia’s colonial governor Alexander Spotswood for help. Acting in secrecy, Spotswood arranged an ambush of Blackbeard, offering a bonus for Blackbeard’s death.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard, the commanding officer of the arranged assault, found Blackbeard in Ocracoke Inlet on November 22, 1718. Maynard’s two ships, <em>Jane</em> and <em>Ranger</em>, were immediately fired upon by Blackbeard and his crew, severely damaging the <em>Ranger</em>. When <em>Jane</em> began to take damage, Maynard ordered the crew to go below deck, creating the illusion of an abandoned vessel.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Blackbeard took the bait. Leading a charge aboard the vessel, he and his men were surprised by Maynard’s crew. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Blackbeard suffered twenty-five stab wounds and five gunshots before succumbing to his injuries. He was decapitated, his head hung on the <em>Ranger</em>’s bowsprit, and his body tossed overboard, bringing a literal end to Blackbeard and a symbolic end to Atlantic Coast piracy.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Growing up, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin had a great love for everything military due to his ancestors' service in the American Revolution, War of 1812 and Aroostook War. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1852, where he returned in 1855 to join the faculty and begin a successful career as a professor of languages and rhetoric. <br /> <br /> However, the outbreak of the Civil War weighed heavily upon Chamberlain, who desperately wanted to serve his country. When he was subsequently granted a leave of absence to study abroad, Chamberlain promptly enlisted in the Union army, unbeknownst to those at the college or his family. He was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the newly raised 20th Maine Infantry and studied everything military under the regiment's colonel, Adelbert Ames. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were present at the Battle of Antietam, but did not participate in the battle; suffered relatively minor casualties in the assault on Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg; and were relegated to guard duty at Chancellorsville to a smallpox outbreak in the regiment. <br /> <br /> In May 1863, upon the promotion of Ames, Chamberlain was promoted to colonel and given command of the regiment. At the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863, holding the far left of the Union line and low on ammunition, Chamberlain ordered the 20th Maine forward in a bayonet charge at Little Round Top, dislodging and capturing over 100 Confederate troops and securing the tenuous Union position. This action earned Chamberlain the sobriquet \"Lion of Little Round Top\" and the Medal of Honor for \"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults.\" <br /> <br /> In June 1864, at the Siege of Petersburg, Chamberlain, now in command of a brigade, was gravely wounded in the hip and groin. He survived his wounds, however, and returned to the field in November 1864, now as a brigadier general. During the war's closing chapter at Appomattox, Chamberlain was selected to receive the Confederate surrender of arms, during which he ordered his men to attention as the Confederates passed, as a sign of respect for their defeated foe. <br /> <br /> After the war, Chamberlain returned to Maine, and, riding his wartime popularity, served four terms as the state's governor. He later served as president of Bowdoin College from 1871-1883. He spent his later years writing and speaking about the Civil War. His death in 1914 was attributed to his Petersburg wounds, making him the last Civil War veteran to die of his war wounds.</p>",

Although Raleigh himself never set sail for the colony, his strong desire to establish an English colony in the New World made him a major player in England’s goal of eclipsing the Spanish as a global superpower.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Raleigh believed that a combination of plantations and privateering along the east coast of North America was crucial in establishing an English foothold in these new lands, lands that had already seen the arrival of Spain’s mighty fleets from Florida stretching to South America. If the English could establish functioning colonies just north of Spanish Florida, Raleigh believed that English privateers could harass Spanish shipping enough to obtain the supposed riches that both superpowers were seeking. </span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Raleigh’s plan, on paper, seemed masterful. In 1584, the first reconnaissance to the New World set sail. However, it became clear that many investors in the new English colony were unsure exactly what purpose the colony held. How much direct support from England would it need? Was privateering a logical way to secure a foothold in North America? Did the treasure that both England and Spain sought in the New World really exist? Should the colony truly be a colony or simply a military outpost? All these questions Raleigh never seemed to fully answer.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">By 1587, when John White, Governor of Roanoke Colony, returned to England to ask Raleigh for more supplies and colonists to bolster the already failing venture of 118 men, women, and children, Raleigh was happy to oblige. However, Raleigh’s lack of foresight may have doomed the colony by this point. Spain’s New World colonies had provided them with a plethora of wealth, wealth that Philip II of Spain was unwilling to part with at the hands of Raleigh’s privateers. Rather than continue to fight Raleigh’s privateers piecemeal off the coast of North America, Philip launched a full-scale naval assault on England itself. Raleigh, being so close to Elizabeth I, was forced to abandon White’s request to resupply Roanoke. Instead Raleigh assisted with the repulsion of the Spanish Armada that was at England’s front door.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Although the English fleet of smaller, faster ships was able to defeat the Spanish Armada, thus cementing England as ruler of the seas, the delay prevented any return to Roanoke until 1590. Once John White was able to return to Roanoke, the colony had vanished. After 1590, Raleigh never again seemed to take as much interest in Roanoke. Perhaps he had realized that his initial belief in privateering and plantations had not been a successful combination? Or perhaps his dreams for English dominance lay elsewhere?</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1592, Raleigh married Elizabeth Throckmorton, much to the disdain of Queen Elizabeth. Having fallen out of favor with the Court, Raleigh spent the remainder of his life primarily as a prisoner in the Tower of London or in various forms of exile. In 1618, Raleigh was executed for allegedly plotting to overthrow Queen Elizabeth’s successor, James I.</span></p>",

In 1844, President Tyler appointed him Minister to Brazil, where he served until 1847. <br /> <br /> Returning to the Democratic Party, Wise won election as Governor of Virginia in 1855, serving from 1856 to 1860. Following John Brown's unsuccessful raid on Harpers Ferry, Wise decided not to commute Brown's death sentence after having visited him in prison. With the country on the brink of civil war, Wise cajoled members of the Virginia Convention of 1861 to immediately secede. Though no longer governor, he boasted that Virginia militia units were already en route to seize the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, even though Convention members had yet to vote for secession.<br /> <br /> Without prior military experience, Wise joined the Confederate army at the rank of brigadier general. While his lack of experience was readily apparent in his initial battlefield commands at Kanawha Valley (1861) and Roanoke Island (1862), Wise's brigade fought well during the Petersburg and Appomattox Campaigns (1864-1865). At Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, he urged Lee to surrender after Confederate troops failed to break through Union lines. <br /> <br /> After the war, Wise, unable to reclaim his plantation outside Norfolk, settled in Richmond and resumed his law practice. He served on a commission to fix the boundary line between Virginia and Maryland. In 1872, Wise published a book based on his public service, Seven Decades of the Union.</p>",

McClellan. He was briefly colonel of the 23rd Ohio Infantry but was soon promoted, to brigadier general on May 16, 1861. He was largely responsible the Union's early victories in northern Virginia at the Battles of Rich Mountain and Corrick's Ford, but his superior, George McClellan, garnered most of the credit. <br> <br> When McClellan was summoned to Washington after the First Battle of Manassas, Rosecrans replaced him as head of the Department of the Ohio. In May 1862, Rosecrans was transferred to the Western Theater. There, he assumed command of two divisions of the Army of the Mississippi and saw action at the Battles of Iuka and Corinth. In September 1862, Rosecrans was promoted to major general and a month later assigned command of the Army of the Cumberland. Rosecrans' forces spent the next several months slowly pushing the Confederates out of middle Tennessee. <br> <br> Then, in September 1863, the Army of the Cumberland confronted Braxton Bragg's army at Chickamauga, and a faulty order issued by Rosecrans resulted in the largest Union defeat of the western war. In October 1863, with his army still besieged in Chattanooga, Rosecrans was removed from his command. He was reassigned to the Department of Missouri where, in the summer of 1864, his forces helped deflect Sterling Price's invasion of Missouri and Kansas. Rosecrans resigned from the Army in 1867, settled in southern California and resumed his business career. From 1868 and 1869, he was Minister to Mexico and in 1881 he was elected to Congress and served two terms.</p>",

The Creek combatants killed not only the defenders, but many of the civilians who had taken refuge there. The estimated death toll was 250, with over 100 women, children and enslaved African Americans taken as prisoners by the Red Sticks.  News of the “massacre” spread quickly, leading to American determination to destroy the military power of the entire Creek Nation. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Weatherford, a member of the Wind clan from the town of Coosada, was from a prominent Creek lineage and was raised in a bicultural family whose wealth and authority extended from the Creek towns to the growing settlements in the lower Alabama River, where Fort Mims was located. Most of his immediate family opposed the Red Sticks, but his Creek wife’s extended family did not. Following the attack on Fort Mims, Weatherford continued to lead Red Stick forces, and was among those who established the fortified village site of Econochaca or “Holy Ground.” In late December 1813, Weatherford and his forces defended the inhabitants against General Ferdinand Claiborne and his army of regulars, territorial militia, and Choctaw Indians. Weatherford and a handful of warriors famously held off the assault until the civilian population was evacuated and then escaped by riding his horse off a high river bluff into the Alabama River. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>After the war, he was protected by his powerful family and lived among the white settlements in the lower Alabama River, seemingly taking no part in Creek tribal affairs. He is popularly known as “Red Eagle,” a name that first appeared in a poem by A. B. Meek, published in 1855, that presented a highly romanticized version of Weatherford’s life.</span></p>",

He is also remembered as a flamboyant man and quick to argue, prompting the less savory nickname: “Old Fuss and Feathers.”</p><p>Scott started his military career in 1807, taking a break from studying law to enlist in the Virginia militia as a cavalry corporal in response to the <em>Chesapeake-Leopard </em>affair. Scott’s short temper and propensity for harsh criticism landed him a suspension not long after enlisting, however this allowed him to continue his legal studies. The next year, Scott’s long army career began with his commission as a captain, although his short temper and its consequences were not behind him. In 1810, Scott’s open criticism of Brigadier General James Wilkinson prompted Scott to be court martialed and suspended for a year.</p><p>When war broke out in 1812, Scott was presented with his first opportunity to display his talents. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and sent to the Canadian front. He planned and executed the successful attack on Fort George and was placed in command there, restoring the pitiful defenses by super-human efforts. Ignominious defeats on the Niagara had taught him the need for exacting military training, a lesson he put to great use at Buffalo where he developed the best units of that war. In July, his brigade drove the enemy in a running fight for 16 miles to Chippewa and bore the brunt of battle at Lundy’s Lane, one of the most stubborn and bravely fought contests of the war. His part in the war brought him great honor and he was brevetted a major-general.</p><p>Although quick-tempered, he was also known to be a fair man and a pacifier. He was made general-in-chief of the army in 1841, emphasizing professional schooling and encouraging his officers to associate with those of culture and sophistication, stressing that the military must come to represent the best that society has to offer. As Governor of occupied Mexico his rule was so remarkably humane, a delegation of Mexicans offered him the dictatorship. During the occupation, he sent revenues home to establish the first Soldier’s Home for retired veterans. At the conclusion of the war in 1848, Congress designated him the first lieutenant-general since George Washington</p>",

Vance changed his mind after the firing on Ft. Sumter and President Lincoln's call for troops. He now urged North Carolina to secede.

Vance became his state's most vociferous advocate, allocating funds for blockade running to provide much-needed supplies to both soldiers and civilians. During his second term as governor, Vance was powerless to halt the advance of Sherman's army through North Carolina. With North Carolina's population destitute and its cities in ruin, Vance was arrested by Federal troops on May 13, 1865 and imprisoned briefly in Washington, D.C.<br> <br> Following his parole, Vance returned to North Carolina and moved his law practice to Charlotte.

            "bodyText": "Born a Mohawk, Joseph Brant was a man of two worlds. His sister Molly was the common-law wife of Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the British. Brant was thus exposed to the English culture, becoming a regular part of the Johnson household, while still retaining some ties to the Mohawk way of life.<br /> <br /> In 1755, at age 13 he accompanied Sir William Johnson to the Battle of Lake George. Brant observed the negotiations that brought about the Boundary Line Treaty in 1768 at Fort Stanwix. Traveling to England in 1776, Brant met King George III. Voicing his concerns over the colonists' failure to abide by the 1768 Fort Stanwix Treaty, Brant was assured that the land disputes would be dealt with one the war with the colonies was over. Before leaving England Brant accepted the war belt, meaning that he had decided to support the King in this \"family dispute\" with the colonies. Brant's actions, along with his sister's influence, would be a factor that brought about the split of the Six Nations Confederacy.<br /> <br /> Once home, Brant raised a group of loyalists and Indians. American General Nicholas Herkimer met with Brant in June of 1777. They had been neighbors, and for two days Herkimer tried to convince Brant to stay out of the war. Brant refused, and reasserted his intention to support the British. These men would meet again on August 6, 1777 at Oriskany, as Herkimer attempted to come to the aid of Fort Stanwix. Brant would be on the other side, as part of the force that ambushed Herkimer and his militia.<br /> <br /> At the war's end, the British gave Brant's people land along the Grand River in Canada. This area became known as Brant's Town. Today it is known as Brantford, Canada. Brant often traveled back into the United States; however, on a trip from Philadelphia he stopped by the home of Peter Gansevoort. On another visit, in an ironic twist of fate, Marinus Willett ended up deterring a stalker who had been determined to assassinate Brant. In 1793, he even carried out a mission of peace to the Miami Indians on behalf of George Washington that helped secure peace between the two nations.<br /> <br /> Brant died estranged from both the British and his people. He had made many enemies as he dealt with land disputes and tried to sell off property to make some money for his people to live by. Forty-three years after his death however, his body was carried back to Brant's Town, where he was laid to rest beside the Mohawk church.",

            "bodyText": "Mary, commonly called Molly, Brant was born in 1736, most likely in the Ohio Valley. She grew up in Canajoharie and was educated in a European fashion, possibly at a mission school. In Mohawk she was also known as \"Konwatsi'tsiaienni\" and \"Degonwadonti.\"<br /> <br /> At age 18, she accompanied a delegation of Mohawk Chiefs to Philadelphia to discuss fraudulent land transactions. This was her first introduction into the world of political responsibility. She eventually became a Clan Mother.<br /> <br /> She probably knew Sir William Johnson as an acquaintance during the 1740's and 1750's, but it was not until the 1759 that they became romantically linked. She bore him eight children, seven of which survived, and was officially referred to as William Johnson's \"housekeeper\" but was relied upon for much more.<br /> <br /> Like her brother Joseph, she assimilated both European and Indian culture into her life and was equally at home in both worlds. She spoke Mohawk and dressed in Mohawk fashion all her life and encouraged her children to do so. Her position as Clan Mother helped in Johnson's success as Indian Superintendent.<br /> <br /> After Sir William's death in 1774, she moved her family from Johnson Hall back to Canajoharie and established a trading post. During the American Revolution she sheltered and fed loyalists and supplied them with arms and munitions. In 1777, it was Molly that sent word to Sir John Johnson's and Joseph Brant's forces that Herkimer was marching to rescue the besieged Fort Schuyler. As a result of these actions she was forced to flee her home in the Mohawk Valley, leaving it behind to be plundered and occupied.<br /> <br /> Her family fled to Fort Niagara and Molly began to direct her attention to keeping the Six Nations (particularly Mohawks) on the side of the British. Her position as a Clan Mother and her former relationship with Sir William Johnson meant that she exerted even more influence over them than her brother. A British was once recorded to have said: \"their uncommon good behaviour [was] in great measure to be ascribed to Miss Molly Brant's influence over them, which [was] far superior to that of all their Chiefs put together.\" She also used her position to promote the interests of her people while increasing her own power.<br /> <br /> After the war, Molly settled at Kingston, Canada and received a substantial military pension for her wartime services. In 1785, on a trip to Schenectady, NY the Americans offered her financial compensation for her return. This was rejected \"with the utmost contempt.\" She remained staunchly pro-British and pro-Haudenosaunee the rest of her life.<br /> <br /> Molly Brant died in 1796. The exact site of her burial remains unknown, but it is thought to be somewhere near Mohawk Church.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Degory Prowtt was born May 13, 1761, in Cornwall on the Surrey side of London. His father Thomas Prout was an Irish sea captain. His mother was Charity Hawke, the niece of Edward Hawke who was the Baron of Towton and the First Lord of the Admiralty. Thomas and Charity had three sons, the youngest of whom was Degory. In 1763, Thomas and Charity and their three sons moved to New York where Thomas continued as a sea captain. Unfortunately, on a third trip to India, Thomas and his two oldest sons were lost at sea.<br /> <br /> At about age thirteen, his mother apprenticed Degory to a trade. Feeling ill-treated, Degory ran away and enlisted as a drummer boy under Captain James Greig on March 4, 1776, in the 3<sup>rd </sup>New York Continental Regiment commanded by Colonel Peter Gansevoort. Later he was transferred to Captain DeWitt’s Company and then to Captain Van Sitze of another regiment. In 1780, the last mentioned company was transferred to the 1<sup>st </sup>NY Regiment commanded by Colonel Goose Van Schaick.<br /> <br /> He was present at the siege of Fort Scuyler/Stanwix in August 1777. Col. Peter Gansvoort had refused British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger’s terms of surrender of the fort (which was now renamed as Fort Schuyler). Gansvoort’s soldiers held out valiantly for twenty days until reinforcements under Benedict Arnold arrived, causing St. Leger’s British forces to withdraw. The failure of the British to capture this fort helps to explain why the British did not gain control of the Mohawk Valley during the Revolutionary War. During 1778 and 1779, Prowtt was part of detachments on duty at several points in the Mohawk Valley and Albany. Prowtt took part in the so-called Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois Indians in 1779. This means that Prowtt was on lands that would become Seneca County. Following this Sullivan Expedition, his regiment spent the winter at Morristown, New Jersey. Then they were posted in the Highlands of the Hudson River for much of the remainder of the war.<br /> <br /> The Prowtt family spoke of an incident during General Sullivan’s campaign against the Haudenosaunee which illustrates the brutality of the expedition. As the story goes, Degory was crossing a bridge when he spied a crouching Native. Degory quickly dealt so powerful a hit that it killed him. They further stated that Degory used the tanned skin from the Native’s back for his drumhead. This story, as gruesome and fantastical as it sounds, is likely true, as other horrors similar in nature have been recorded as well.<br /> <br /> Prowtt also served in the battle of Yorktown, Virginia, the last real battle of the Revolution. It must have been quite an experience for Prowtt to witness the surrender of the British General Cornwallis on October 17, 1781. Many of his compatriots and commanders from his time at Fort Schuyler, including Captain Gregg who he first enlisted with, were their fighting along side him.<br /> <br /> During the Revolutionary War, Degory’s mother Charity had tried to reconcile with her family, an estrangement that arose because of their opposition to her marrying Thomas Prout. Charity’s brother, who was a merchant in London, named her and her sons as his heirs. Charity decided to wait until Degory returned from the War before she would return to England. Unfortunately, just a few days after Degory returned home, Charity died of yellow fever. Degory decided to try to make a success of himself here in America before trying to go to England and claim the inheritance that would eventually come from his uncle.<br /> <br /> Prowtt married twice. About 1784, he married a Jemima Sherwood of Massachusetts. They had four children: William, Daniel, Thomas, and Jemima. A few years after his first marriage, Degory learned of his uncle’s death. On two different occasions, his wife’s family scuttled his plans to go to London to claim his uncle’s inheritance. About 1825, Degory entrusted a Methodist minister named John B. Youngs to take Degory’s paperwork for his claim when Youngs went to London. All trace of the minister and Prout’s paperwork was lost.<br /> <br /> In recognition of his services in the army, New York gave Degory 600 acres in the township of Solon, now Cortland County. Like what so many Revolutionary War soldiers did, Degory sold and deeded away these lands—which were then a wilderness—to a Stephen Hogeboom of Claverick for 15 pounds. According to a history of the Town of Romulus, Degory Prowtt settled on Lot 84 in the town of Romulus. It is easy to speculate that he, like other soldiers in the Sullivan Expedition, such as Lawrence Van Cleef, saw the natural beauty and economic potential of the lands they traversed in destroying Iroquois settlements, and decided to settle in this area. According to the December 13, 1834 Assessment Roll of the Town of Romulus, Prowtt owned 8 acres on Lot 84, worth $96 for a tax levy of only 26 cents. He had purchased this property from Asa and Catharine Church on September 27, 1820. Family records report that Degory was so bothered by arthritis that only four acres of his property had been “cleared” for farming.<br /> <br /> While a resident of Seneca County, on May 4, 1818, he applied for a veteran’s pension. He received $8 a month. The history of the town of Romulus stated that he was a local Methodist preacher. He was a member of the First Methodist Church of Varick at McDuffietown.<br /> <br /> His wife, Jemima, died February 26, 1833, and in 1835 he married Hannah Ball, a widow with two daughters. He lived just a few months after this second marriage. On September 15, 1835, he summoned his neighbors Aaron and Titus Phillips to be witnesses to a will Degory made out. He bequeathed his land, his two cows, household goods, the family Bible, his watch, a big clock, and books to various heirs. He died September 20, 1835, at age 77, and was buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery at McDuffietown. His widow Hannah died in 1847 and is buried next to Degory.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Text courtesy of the Seneca County, NY website.</strong></em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Nicholas Stoner born on December 15 in 1762 or 1763. While Stoner gained local fame as an Adirondack hunter and trapper, he started his career as a soldier in the Revolutionary War.<br /> <br /> He was born in Maryland, but his family eventually moved to New York City, and finally to Fonda’s Bush, near Johnstown. In 1777, Nicholas, his father and brother all enlisted in Colonel James Livingston’s Regiment, then stationed in Johnstown. Being 14 or 15, Nicholas enlisted as a fifer. Livingston’s Regiment had originally been raised as a Canadian regiment in November of 1775, but by 1777 also included a large number of New Yorkers.<br /> <br /> Stoner’s first active service occurred as part of General Benedict Arnold’s force that relieved Fort Schuyler (Stanwix). He witnessed Han Yost Schuyler preparing to leave on his disinformation mission to St. Leger’s camps. Marching through the aftermath of the Oriskany ambush and witnessing the state of those left behind made for many gruesome impressions on his young mind that he remembered even in old age.<br /> <br /> As part of Gen. Horatio Gate’s army, Stoner was wounded in a singular manner as the American’s tightened the noose around the British army near the village of Saratoga. A cannon ball striking the head of the soldier near him lead to Stoner being wounded by the bone fragments striking the right side of his head and face. When his friends found him later, they also noted that a large part of the brim of his hat had also been neatly sheared off as well. This wound would affect Stoner’s hearing in his right ear for the rest of his life.<br /> <br /> After recovering from his wound, Stoner served with Livingston’s Regiment during the Rhode Island campaign in 1778. As part of a guard detachment, he was captured during a nighttime skirmish with British troops and spent several months in captivity before being exchanged.<br /> <br /> In 1780, Stoner was the fifer for the guard detachment that escorted British Major John Andre from his prison to the gallows and witnessed him being hanged for his part in Arnold’s treasonous West Point plot. Interestingly, Stoner spends more time recounting how he spent $100 Continental dollars to purchase a pie near the execution site, then he does on Andre’s demise.<br /> <br /> At the end of 1780, Livingston’s regiment was consolidated into the 2nd New York Regiment. As part of the 2nd New York, Stoner participated in the siege of Yorktown. By 1783, Stoner had become part of the New York Brigade band and had switched to the clarinet. As part of the brigade band, he marched into New York City with the American forces reclaiming it from the British in November of 1783. The band also performed for Washington while he was in the city.<br /> <br /> In 1813, During the War of 1812, Stoner enlisted in the 29th New York Infantry Regiment and participated in some of the fighting associated with the Battle of Plattsburgh in September of 1814. The fact that he served as the Fife Major for the regiment earned him the title of “Major” for the rest of his life.<br /> <br /> Between the wars, Stoner began to gain a noted reputation as an Adirondack hunter and trapper, and he resumed this career after the War of 1812. During his 40-50 years at this pursuit, he became something of a local legend in the tradition of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett for his various adventures with and exploits against Indians, French Canadian trappers, wild animals, and Mother Nature herself. Stoner died on November 26, 1853 and is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery in Gloversville, N.Y.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Samuel Kirkland was one of twelve children raised in an impoverished family of a Congregational clergyman. He was born on the first of December 1741 and spent his youth in various parts of Connecticut and appears to have been strongly influenced by his father’s calling.<br /> <br /> Daniel Kirtland (Samuel spelled his surname differently than his father) had graduated from Yale and went on to study theology. He imparted in his son an understanding of the importance of education and enrolled Samuel in More’s Indian Charity School which was run by Eleazer Wheelock (who later was the founder of Dartmouth College).<br /> <br /> Kirkland was strongly influenced in his training by the “New Light” reform movement, inner personal religion and in the religious and social welfare of the local natives. While at Wheelock’s Samuel met and studied with Samson Occum, a native Mohegan who went on to work as a missionary among the Stockbridge and Oneida peoples. In 1761 he met and traveled with another student, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joseph-brant-thayendanegea.htm\">Joseph Brant</a>. Brant was a Mohawk with close ties to the household of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sir-william-johnson.htm\">Sir William Johnson</a>, British Indian Agent and powerful political force in the newly settled Mohawk Valley. Upon reaching the limit of this studies with Wheelock, Samuel enrolled as a sophomore at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton). He left part way through his senior year but was awarded his degree in 1765. He left his studies to pursue missionary work among the Haudenosaunee, originally planning on Christianizing the Senecas but eventually settling among the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-oneida-nation-in-the-american-revolution.htm\">Oneida</a> for the rest of his life.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the French & Indian War, Kirkland served as a secretary for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/1768-boundary-line-treaty-of-fort-stanwix.htm\">1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>, translating for the natives and copying the treaty document. He developed a fluent knowledge of native languages and served for many years as an intermediary between the European settlers and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-six-nations-confederacy-during-the-american-revolution.htm\">Haudenosaunee</a> peoples. Partly because of his friendship with Brant, and through the work he did translating the Bible into Haudenosaunee, and because of his usefulness in communicating with the Oneida, Kirkland was received kindly and assisted by Sir William Johnson in the years between the French & Indian War and on the eve of the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> Kirkland periodically traveled back to his original bases in Connecticut and Massachusetts and interacted with many folks involved with Wheelock and his school. One of Wheelock’s nieces caught his fancy and in September 1769,  Samuel and Jerusha Bingham were united in marriage.<br /> <br /> Joined her husband on the frontier. She waited at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nicholas-herkimer.htm\">Nicholas Herkimer</a>’s home while Samuel expanded his cabin from a structure of 12”x12” to 16”x16”. Jerusha moved into this home with Samuel in December at the Oneida village of Kanawarohare. In August of 1770, Jerusha returned to Herkimer’s home to give birth to twin boys. Herkimer presented her with a bill for expenses during her stay! Then in 1772, with the approach of another child, Jerusha returned to Stockbridge Massachusetts to deliver a daughter, who died shortly after birth. Jerusha decided to stay on a farm which the family purchased, and until the end of the Revolution, Samuel made frequent trips from Oneida lands to visit the family in Stockbridge, MA.<br /> <br /> During his journeys to Massachusetts and Connecticut, Kirkland sometimes traveled with Samson Occum and Occum’s brother-in-law David Fowler (another of Wheelock’s missionaries). In January of 1771, they made the 15-mile trek to Fort Stanwix to obtain other provisions:<br /> <i>“Thursday Jan. 3, 1771. At 3 o’clock in the morning set with two Indians for Fort Stanwix for. Provision, having neither bread nor flour. It rain’d & hailed for most of the day and violently in the Evening.</i><b> [1]</b><br /> This journal entry leads to the inference that there was a sutler at the deteriorating fort and that the sutler was supplying food and materials to the local inhabitants. Kirkland’s account that he preached at the fort in 1774 indicates it was a hub for the few settlers along the frontier and the natives he was trying to Christianize.<br /> <br /> Kirkland was an active missionary to the Oneida during the eight years from the Boundary Line Treaty of 1768 (1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix) to his appointment as chaplain to the garrison at the fort, renamed “Fort Schuyler” in 1776. He taught the natives to sing, to read the Bible and liturgical works, and worked hard to assist in their lives, often acting as advocate in dealings with the encroaching European settlers. He lived just over the boundary line that separated native territory from the land now open to settlement by the Dutch, Germans, English, and Irish settlers of the Mohawk Valley. He stayed for many years and became an influential figure, the spiritual advisor of respected Oneida Chief Skenandoa.<br /> <br /> Kirkland witnessed the native’s struggle for neutrality, then the alignment of allegiances by both the natives and European settlers as war began at Lexington and Concord in April of 1775. Because of his ties to the Congregational and Presbyterian Congregations and their roots in Boston and other parts of New England, Kirkland allied with the “Bostonians” who advocated armed conflict with the English Crown and eventual American independence. A letter in his collection vividly shows the state of mind of some of the Haudenosaunee in the western end of the confederacy and their animosity towards the Bostonians fighting for independence.<br /> <br /> Kirkland witnessed the rebuilding of Fort Stanwix by the Continental Army now occupying it and mentioned it in a letter to Jerusha how hard the soldiers worked on the reconstruction in September of 1776:<br /> <i>“On the whole, I find things here more agreeable than I expected – the hard duty and variety of business that the soldiers are called to, render it inconvenient for public prayer, save once a day – a number are employed continually as scouts – another part for guards, the rest constantly at work. The Fort (which is now called (Fort Schuyler) is almost finished. The scouts which return from Oswego last evening say no troops are yet arrived there, but are daily expected.”<b> </b></i><b>[2]</b><br /> <br /> Kirkland’s whereabouts are unknown during the crucial summer of 1777. He is not mentioned as being at Fort Schuyler, nor are their any letters in his manuscript collection from May of 1777 to the winter of 1778. Perhaps his work was of such a sensitive nature that nothing was recorded. Perhaps he was home visiting and protecting his family during this crucial time. It is possible that he was hiding from death threats against him made by the British loyalists in the Mohawk Valley and the Cayuga, Seneca, and Mohawk.<br /> <br /> Kirkland’s correspondence picks up as he fulfilled his duties as chaplain and interpreter during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-clinton-sullivan-campaign-of-1779.htm\">Sullivan-Clinton Campaign</a> in the summer of 1779. His letters to his wife provide a first-hand glimpse of what life was like for the frontier military men and the depredations they had to endure.<br /> <br /> Kirkland was very much a part of the translation and transcription of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/treaty-and-land-transaction-of-1784.htm\">Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1784</a>. He remained active as an advocate for the Oneida after the war. He helped to secure for them recompense for houses and materials lost in raids by Brant, John Johnson (William’s son), and Butler’s Rangers. In 1793, he realized a life-long dream to begin his own school for educating the natives when <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/general-von-steuben.htm\">General Von Steuben</a> laid the cornerstone for the newly founded Hamilton-Oneida Academy (chartered as Hamilton College in 1812. He remained among the Oneida until his death in 1808, preaching, teaching, and working as their minister and confidant.  It is a testament to Kirkland’s character that when his dear Oneida friend Chief Skenandoa passed several years later he asked to be laid to rest by his side on the campus of Hamilton College.<br /> <br /> <em>Image below of Reverend Samuel Kirkland's tombstone in the Hamilton College Cemetery.
