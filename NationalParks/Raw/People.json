      "bodyText": "<p>Seth Rowley II was born on February 19, 1760, in Kent, CT to Jabez Rowley Jr. and Mary Hamilton. He was one of eight children. He learned to read in his young life, a skill that was required of any non-commissioned officer in the Continental Army.<br /> <br /> Seth Rowley enlisted in the Continental Army at the age of 16 in 1776 and served in both Connecticut and Massachusetts regiments. Early on he was stationed at Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. After a year’s term he was discharged and immediately reenlisted on March 16, 1777 and joined the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment and served with them until April 15, 1779. Rowley was stationed at Fort Schuyler (Stanwix) during Siege of 1777 private in Captain Henry Tiebout's Company of the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment.<br /> <br /> In May of 1780, he exchanged billets with Sergeant Isaac Pennell of Lieutenant Colonel John Harper's Regiment of New York State Levies and served until December of 1780; Pennell taking his place in Captain Simeon Smith's Company of Colonel Seth Warner's Regiment at Fort Edward. In Warner’s Regiment he became a sergeant. In October of 1780, he witnessed the execution of British spy Major John Andre. In May of 1781, he enlisted as a sergeant in Captain Abraham Fonda's Company of Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willett's Levies. Upon the expiration of his term, he reenlisted as an orderly sergeant in Captain Joseph Harrison's Company of Willett's Levies, occasionally serving as sergeant major.<br /> <br /> In early winter of 1783, he marched in Willett's failed Oswego expedition and stated that: many men froze to death, with only about thirty to forty of the regiment being fit for duty upon their return. He was discharged on January 4, 1784, at Schenectady, NY.<br /> <br /> After the war he married Innocent Salsbury on December 14, 1786, in the Village of Spencertown, Hillsdale, NY and became the father of 15 children: five sons and ten daughters. Rowley and his family were some of the earliest settlers of the Sand Hill neighborhood of Otsego County, NY. There he built and owned a sawmill. On January 30, 1792, Rowley signed a power-of-attorney for Jelles A. Fonda to collect for him all monies and goods due to him as pay for his Revolutionary War services. Records show that he transferred multiple parcels of his land to his children over the decades.<br /> <br /> In April of 1818, he was awarded a pension of $8 per month. It should be noted that Rowley's service covers the entirety of the American Revolution, from beginning to end. War Department records from the time indicate that Seth Rowley served as follows:<br /> <br /> December 23, 1776 as Private in the 12<sup>th</sup> MA Regiment<br /> December 23, 1776 in Major Cady's Detachment<br /> March 16, 1777 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment<br /> March 14, 1778 in Thruston's and Warner's New York Regiments<br /> Undated: as sergeant in Harper's New York Regiment<br /> Undated: as Sergeant in Willett's New York Regiment<br /> <br /> He died in the Town of Unadilla, New York on January 26, 1851 at nearly 91 years old.<br /> <br /> Below: Seth Rowley’s signature from a deposition dated June 7, 1832 on his service in the Continental Army. He was 72 years old at the time. <img alt=\"In shaky cursive handwriting: Seth Rowley\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7371845|0|\" src=\"/fost/images/SethRowleyPicture3.png\" title=\"SethRowleyPicture3\" /></p>",

In 1940, McMillan and colleague Phillip Abelson produced element 93 which they named neptunium. Produced by bombarding uranium 235 with neutrons, neptunium was the first artificially-created transuranium element. In 1941, chemist Glenn Seaborg, along with McMillan and several others, produced element 94 which Seaborg named plutonium, following McMillan naming element 93 after a planet. <br /> <br /> In 1942, McMillan moved to Los Alamos to research implosion methods for the Manhattan Project, living on the famous “Bathtub Row” during his tenure. After the war, McMillan won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 for his work on transuranium elements, became a member of the General Advisory Committee to the Atomic Energy Commission, and served as director of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory from 1958 to 1973. Edwin McMillan died in California in 1991.</p>",

In 1927, he became Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Rome. It was here in 1934 that Fermi and his colleagues split uranium without fully realizing it, researched nuclear transformation, and discovered slow neutrons, which aided in the discovery of nuclear fission. For these efforts, Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938. That same year, to escape fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, Fermi and his family left for the United States.</p> <br /> <br /> In 1942, Fermi developed the Chicago Pile (CP-1) at the University of Chicago. An experimental nuclear reactor, CP-1 went critical on December 2, 1942. After this breakthrough, Fermi was recruited by J. Robert Oppenheimer to be associate director at Los Alamos. Fermi was the first person to insert a uranium slug into the B Reactor at Hanford. He was present when the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical at Oak Ridge and witnessed the Trinity test in the New Mexico desert.<br /> <br /> After the war, Fermi became a professor at the University of Chicago, dying of stomach cancer in 1954.",

Admitted to the Boston Bar in 1833, Bolles worked as a \"counsellor\" at 10 Court Street, while keeping his residence in Winchester, outside of the city.<sup>1</sup> He married Catherine Hartwell Dix and had six children.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Bolles involved himself in politics, first with the Democratic party. Over time, his political views shifted as he switched to supporting the Free Soil Party, and later, the Republican party, both of which opposed the extension of slavery.<sup>3</sup> Elected in 1843, he served as Secretary of State for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He also held other positions of public trust including serving as a member of the Board of Education as well as Commissioner of Boston Harbor and Back Bay.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In addition to his work in politics, Bolles also involved himself in reform movements. One obituary stated that Bolles \"was for many years prominent as an anti-slavery and temperance mover.\"<sup>5</sup> With the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, Bolles joined the third and final iteration of the Boston Vigilance Committee, which assisted freedom seekers coming through Boston on the Underground Railroad.<sup>6</sup> He also appears among a list of people calling for a public meeting at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tremont-temple.htm\">Tremont Temple</a> in April 1851 for those \"opposed to the Fugitive Slave Law, and in favor of adopting such measures, within the limits prescribed by the Constitution, as may procure its essential modification or final repeal.\"<sup>7</sup> He also served as counsel for John P.

      "bodyText": "Mannert “Jim” Lincoln Abele enlisted in the Navy at 17, in 1920 as an Apprentice Seaman. He rose through the ranks and eventually became Lieutenant Commander Abele on December 1, 1940. Abele also spent a year teaching Naval Science for the Naval Reserve Officers Training at Harvard University in 1939-1940. Over his career, he served on the battleships <i><a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/u/utah.html\">USS Utah</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/colorado-iii.html\">USS Colorado</a></i>, and the submarines <i>S-23, R-11, R-13, S-31</i>, and <i><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/uss-grunion.htm\">USS Grunion</a></i>. Abele always preferred to go by the name Jim, which is also what his children called him.<br /> <br /> When Abele left his family for his last patrol in 1941, he was almost 39, and his children were 5 (John), 9 (Brad), and 12 (Bruce). He and his wife Catherine Eaton Abele had been married fifteen years.<br /> <br /> On the <i>USS Grunion’s</i> way to Pearl Harbor from New London, CT, the crew encountered 16 survivors from the <i>USAT Jack</i>, which has been torpedoed by a German U-boat. They were able to rescue the 16 men, and looked unsuccessfully for the remaining crew, before taking them to safety at a Naval base in Panama. From Pearl Harbor, the Grunion sailed to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, to patrol.<br /> <br /> By July 1942, the <i>Grunion</i> and Lt. Cmdr. Abele were patrolling off Kiska, which had been attacked and occupied by the Japanese during their attacks in early June. The last transmission from the <i>Grunion</i> was on July 30, 1942, and on August 1 she was listed as lost at sea, along with all 70 people on board. <br /> <br /> As Abele’s son Brad recounts when he and his family learned the news, “That following September we received word via a forwarded telegram that the <i>Grunion</i> hadn’t been heard from since July 30, 1942 and was missing in action and presumed lost. I remember the day. It was an early fall, sunny afternoon and my brothers and I were playing with a football in the road out in front of our house in Newton Highlands, MA. My mother came to the door and called us all in and while we stood in a sunbeam by her desk in the front of the living room, she read us the “first” telegram. Bruce reacted with some exclamations, but I remember being completely devoid of emotional feeling at hearing the news. At that age, I was emotionally extremely phlegmatic. I have speculated that it was perhaps because my father had once told me that a “soldier” never cries (or at least that is what I thought) and I was more or less incapable of ever shedding tears from then on. After hearing the news and reflecting on its meaning for a short while, we returned to our activities out front which we continued to pursue rather listlessly. I remember that my mother never wanted to put any sort of a “gold star” in our window since she considered that the <i>Grunion</i> was officially “missing in action” and not definitely lost – yet.”<br /> <br /> Catherine, Abele’s wife, was able to receive a year of pay for servicemen listed as “Missing in Action,” use Abele’s life insurance, and teach violin lessons to support her family. In April 1944, Catherine sponsored (christened the ship) a destroyer named the <i>USS</i> <i>Mannert L. Abele</i>. It was sunk off Okinawa, Japan in April 1945.<br /> <br /> As an adult, Brad remembers, “Although I was only nine years old when Jim left for the war, I can remember a few things about him still. He was an exceptionally resourceful and excellent craftsman and turned out numerous impressive works made of wood, using only the most basic of tools. When he was not on duty, it seemed that what he loved most to do was to work around the house or in his workshop area. It seemed as if he never enjoyed “relaxing” in the traditional sense but would soon have to get up and start creating something. I remember only rarely ever playing with him in our yard, partly because he couldn’t throw overhand and had to pitch an object underhand instead, but also because it seemed he was always busy doing something else if he were around. The one amount of time he did allocate to each of his boys was when he would cut our hair and tell us stories while doing so. I remember well that he used a hand clipper that tended to pull the hair as he worked it, making the process rather uncomfortable for us.”<br /> <br /> The <i>USS Grunion</i> was lost at sea for over 60 years, until August 2006, when a team spearheaded by the Abele brothers used side scan sonar to find a wreck that was a similar size and shape to the lost <i>Grunion,</i> in the location she was last seen. A year later, the team returned with a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) with HD video that clearly documented the ship. In October 2008, the US Navy confirmed the identity of the <i>Grunion</i>. In 2018, the bow of the <i>Grunion</i> was discovered a quarter mile away from the rest of the wreckage. The final resting place of Lt. Cmdr. Abele and his crew of 69 is now known, and provides solace for the families of the men missing in action since World War II. <h2>Learn more about Lieutenant Commander Abele:</h2> <a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/research-guides/modern-biographical-files-ndl/modern-bios-a/abele-mannert-lincoln.html\">Naval History and Heritage Command's biography of Lt.

She was particularly passionate about women’s rights.<br /> <br /> She was one of the first advocates of women’s equal education and women’s property rights. Adams had strong feelings about marriage and believed women should take more part in decisions rather than simply serve their husbands. Adams believed that women should educate themselves and use their intellect to manage the household affairs, as well as be a moral guide for the family.<br /> <br /> In a letter to her husband John, March 1776, while he was in Philadelphia, Adams wrote, “Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice or Representation.”<br /> <br /> Sources/More information:<br /> Adams National Historical Park: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/abigail-adams-1744-1818.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/abigail-adams-1744-1818.htm</a><br /> Women’s Rights National Historical Park: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/abigail-adams.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/abigail-adams.htm</a></p>",

But more importantly, she helped define the political and social role of a first lady.</p> <p>Dolley Payne was born in a Quaker community in North Carolina, but soon moved to a family plantation in Virginia, and eventually to Philadelphia. She married Quaker lawyer John Todd and had two sons, but lost the younger and her husband to a yellow fever outbreak in 1793. </p> <p>As the nation’s temporary Capital, Philadelphia was the center of society in this period. As a pretty, young widow, Dolley attracted much attention. She met Congressman James Madison through their mutual acquaintance, senator Aaron Burr, and married after only a brief courtship. Dolley converted to James’ Episcopal religion, and quickly abandoned the Quaker fashions of her youth in favor of the latest city styles.</p> <p>After a brief reprisal to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/memories-of-montpelier-home-of-james-and-dolley-madison-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">Montpelier</a>, James’ family plantation in Virginia, Dolley and James Madison moved to Washington, D.C. for James’ new position as Secretary of State in President Thomas Jefferson’s cabinet. Dolley’s long career as a hostess and icon of Washington society was about to begin.</p> <p>Many letters record Dolley as intelligent, charming, and a gracious hostess. As a widower, President Jefferson relied on Dolley and her high reputation to serve as an unofficial first lady: selecting furnishings for the newly constructed White House, organizing parties, and entertaining ladies who came to visit. When Madison succeeded the presidency and Dolley formally became first lady, she was already well practiced, well-known, and very popular. Serving in the position essentially for 16 years, Dolley helped to define the role of first lady as a domestic diplomat.</p> <p>Although James Madison was well-respected as a brilliant man and the father of the Constitution, his terse and bookish qualities did not endear him to Americans. However, Dolley’s effusive and warm demeanor contrasted against, effectively increasing Madison’s popularity. The nation’s high esteem for Dolly became enshrined in legend in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/warof1812/index.htm\">1814</a>. On August 24, when word reached the White House that British were on the way invade Washington, Dolley gave orders to save valuables in the house. In the final minutes before fleeing the city, she had the frame of Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington broken so the painting could be <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">successfully removed from the wall</a> and taken to safety out of the city. This cool action saved these priceless artifacts from destruction and demonstrated the trademark thoughtfulness that has become part of Dolley Madison’s legacy.</p> <p>Following James Madison’s retirement from politics, the couple returned to Montpelier, where they remained until James’ death in 1836. Yet again a widow, Dolley returned to Washington to live out the rest of her life a living legend and the nation’s most beloved matriarch.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt was Theodore Roosevelt's second wife and served as First Lady during his presidency from 1901-1909. She was step-mother to Alice Roosevelt Longworth, and mother to Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Kermit Roosevelt, Ethel Roosevelt Derby, Archibald Roosevelt, and Quentin Roosevelt.<br /> <br /> Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt was born August 6, 1861 in New York City to Charles Carow and Gertrude Tyler. Although originally born into wealth, the family fell on hard times. The Carows then moved into Edith’s mother’s aunt’s home in New York City, where Edith quickly became friends with neighbors Corinne Roosevelt, who was her age, and Corinne’s older brother Theodore. Corinne and Theodore’s mother, Mittie Roosevelt, enjoyed Edith, and invited her to be tutored alongside her children in their early years. Growing up, Edith became an extended member of the Roosevelt family, often being invited along for family vacations out in Oyster Bay. Many in the Roosevelt family believed that when Edith was old enough to marry, she and Theodore would become a couple, as the pair would often write letters to one another when apart and had a close friendship. <br /> <br /> At the age of eighteen, Theodore moved to Boston to attend Harvard University. It was during this time that Edith and he experienced a falling out and no longer corresponded. Around that same time, Theodore met Alice Lee who he would marry in 1880. Alice would die from complications due to childbirth and soon after, a heartbroken Theodore retreated to his ranch in the Dakota Territory. Upon his return to New York, Theodore rekindled his relationship with Edith after a serendipitous meeting at his sister Anna’s home. Edith and Theodore would eventually marry on December 2, 1886. While they spent much of their early marriage apart, Edith in Europe and Theodore embarking on his political career, both corresponded often.<br /> <br /> Edith and Theodore moved into their home in Oyster Bay in 1886, which they named Sagamore Hill and kept it as their permanent residence throughout their entire lives. Edith was fully in charge of running the household affairs, which included managing finances and creating menus, while simultaneously raising six rambunctious children: Ted Jr., Kermit, Ethel, Archibald, and Quentin, along with her stepdaughter Alice. From Ted Jr.’s birth in 1887 to Quentin’s birth in 1897, Theodore held various public offices and was often apart from the family, leaving Edith and the children to continue on in their activities at Sagamore Hill. Edith was an avid reader and loved to take a book or two out to a rose arbor she had built near her home, whenever she needed a quick break from her many responsibilities.<br /> <br /> During her tenure as First Lady of the United States, Edith expanded the West Wing of the White House and updated much of the furniture, which she financed using part of her husband’s salary. From 1901-1909, she continued to manage the family affairs so Theodore could fully focus on the presidency. While remaining uninvolved publicly in political matters, she was an important advisor to her husband. She was known for having an excellent judge of character, and Theodore claimed that “whenever I go against her judgement, I regret it.” Edith Roosevelt was a positive force in Washington D.C., where statesmen, foreign dignitaries, socialites, and politicians of both parties greatly enjoyed the company of the First Lady.<br /> <br /> When Theodore and Edith returned home to Oyster Bay after the presidency, the family had expanded. New sons- and daughters in-law, and grandchildren would dominate Edith and Theodore’s life for the next ten years. Both Edith and Theodore delighted in their grandchildren, who would visit or stay with them often at Sagamore Hill, but they continued to travel, write, and entertain. Edith resumed her role of president of the household, while Theodore remained as adventurous as ever.<br /> <br /> Theodore died on January 6, 1919 at Sagamore Hill. While it was difficult for Edith, she continued her lifelong passions of reading and traveling. With the help of her family she published books and wrote for a political journal. Towards the end of her life, Edith continued to support various philanthropic organizations (including financially supporting some Rough Riders who had fallen on hard times) and would frequently visit her family’s ancestral home, Mortlake Manor, in Brooklyn, Connecticut, which she had purchased in 1927.<br /> <br /> Between 1909 and 1948, Edith traveled to over thirty countries including trips to Italy to visit her sister, Emily, a train journey across Asia with her son Kermit and his wife Belle, and a stay in Puerto Rico with her son Theodore Jr. who was serving as governor there. During this time, Edith co-wrote “Cleared for Strange Ports,” a book that was an account of her travels as well as reflections on motherhood and the legacy she hoped to leave behind. She also researched and wrote a genealogy of her mother’s family, the Tyler’s, titled “American Backlogs: The Story of Gertrude Tyler and Her Family.”<br /> <br /> Edith Roosevelt had an air of confidence and strength, but was also kind, gracious, and welcoming. She saw that her husband followed his career and that her children grew up to be successful. When Edith was nearing the last years of her life, she wanted to be remembered by one line. The line she had engraved on her tombstone; “Everything she did was for the happiness of others.”<br /> <br /> After a long and full life Edith died at the age of 87 on September 30, 1948 at Sagamore Hill. She is buried next to Theodore at Youngs Memorial Cemetery in Oyster Bay, NY.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>The Early Years</strong></p> <p>Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was born in New York City on October 11, 1884. Her father was Elliott Roosevelt, President Theodore Roosevelt's younger brother and her mother was Anna Hall, a member of the distinguished Livingston family. Both her parents died when she was a child, her mother in 1892, and her father in 1894. After her mother's death, Eleanor went to live with her grandmother, Mrs. Valentine G. Hall, in Tivoli, New York. She was educated by private tutors until the age of 15, when she was sent to Allenswood, a school for girls in England. The headmistress, Mademoiselle Marie Souvestre, took a special interest in young Eleanor and had a great influence on her education and thinking. At age 18, Eleanor returned to New York with a fresh sense of confidence in herself and her abilities. She became involved in social service work, joined the Junior League and taught at the Rivington Street Settlement House.</p> <p>On March 17, 1905, she married her fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and between 1906 and 1916, they became the parents of six children: Anna Eleanor (1906-75), James (1907-91), Franklin Delano, Jr. (1909), Elliott (1910-90), Franklin, Jr. (1914-88) and John (1916-81). During this period, her public activities gave way to family concerns and her husband's political career. However, with American entry in World War I, she became active in the American Red Cross and in volunteer work in Navy hospitals. In 1921, Franklin Roosevelt was stricken with polio causing Mrs. Roosevelt to become increasingly active in politics in part to help him maintain his interests but also to assert her own personality and goals. She participated in the League of Women Voters, joined the Women's Trade Union League, and worked for the Women's Division of the New York State Democratic Committee. She helped to establish Val-Kill Industries, a non-profit furniture factory in Hyde Park, New York, and taught at the Todhunter School, a private girls' school in New York City.</p> <p><strong>The First Lady</strong></p> <p>Upon moving to the White House in 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt informed the nation that they should not expect their new first lady to be a symbol of elegance, but rather \"plain, ordinary Mrs. Roosevelt.\" Despite this disclaimer, she showed herself to be an extraordinary First Lady.</p> <p>In 1933, Mrs. Roosevelt became the first, First Lady to hold her own press conference. In an attempt to afford equal time to women--who were traditionally barred from presidential press conferences--she allowed only female reporters to attend. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused to allow Marion Anderson, an African American singer, to perform in their auditorium. In protest, Mrs. Roosevelt resigned her membership in the DAR.</p> <p>Throughout Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, Eleanor traveled extensively around the nation, visiting relief projects, surveying working and living conditions, and then reporting her observations to the President. She was called \"the President's eyes, ears and legs\" and provided objective information to her husband. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered WWII, Mrs. Roosevelt made certain that the President did not abandon the goals he had put forth in the New Deal. She also exercised her own political and social influence;</p> <p>She became an advocate of the rights and needs of the poor, of minorities, and of the disadvantaged. The public was drawn in by the First Lady's exploits and adventures which she recounted in her daily syndicated column, \"My Day\". She began writing the column in 1935 and continued until her death in 1962.</p> <p>During the war, she served as Assistant Director of Civilian Defense from 1941 to 1942 and she visited England and the South Pacific to foster good will among the Allies and to boost the morale of U.S. servicemen overseas.</p> <p><strong>After the White House</strong></p> <p>After President Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945, Mrs. Roosevelt continued in her public life. President Truman appointed her to the United Nations General Assembly. She served as chair of the Human Rights Commission and worked tirelessly to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948.</p> <p>In 1953, Mrs. Roosevelt dutifully resigned from the United States Delegation to the United Nations, so that incoming Republican President Dwight Eisenhower could fill the position with an appointee of his own choosing. She then volunteered her services to the American Association for the U. N., and was an American representative to the World Federation of the U. N. Associations. She later became the chair of the Associations' Board of Directors. She was reappointed to the United States Delegation to the U. N. by President Kennedy in 1961. Later he appointed her to the National Advisory Committee of the Peace Corps and chair of the President's Commission on the Status of Women. Mrs. Roosevelt became a recognized leader in promoting humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>She was in great demand as a speaker and lecturer. Like her husband had done with radio, she also made effective use of the emerging technology of television. She was a prolific writer with many articles and books to her credit including a multi-volume autobiography.</p> <p>In her later years, Mrs. Roosevelt lived at Val-Kill in Hyde Park, New York. She also maintained an apartment in New York City. She died on November 7, 1962, and is buried alongside her husband in the Rose Garden of their estate at Hyde Park, now a national historic site.</p> <p><em>Biography courtesy of the Franklin D.

      "bodyText": "<p>Julia Dent Grant was born in St. Louis, Missouri on January 26, 1826. Although a typical woman of her era in some respects, she was extraordinary in many other ways. She had great strength of character, shared in the mixed fortunes of her husband Ulysses S. Grant, loved and cared for her family, and fulfilled her patriotic duty as First Lady. She captured many of her life experiences in writing <em>The Personal Memoirs of Julia Dent Grant (Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant)</em>, the first memoir to be written by a First Lady. <br /> <br /> <strong>Childhood</strong><br /> Julia Boggs Dent was the daughter of English-American parents Colonel Frederick Dent and Ellen Wrenshall Dent. She was the fifth of seven children who lived to adulthood and the first girl. Her energetic nature was matched by a firmness of will. Growing up at White Haven, an 850-acre property in St. Louis County owned by her father, Julia was a very active child who fished, rode horses, and played in the woods. White Haven was also a slave plantation, and many of Julia's playmates as a young girl were enslaved children who lived also lived on the property. The girls Julia played with as a child became her enslaved servants as they all transitioned to adulthood.</p>   <p><strong>Courtship and Marriage</strong><br /> As a schoolgirl, Julia declared that she would marry “a soldier, a gallant, brave, dashing soldier.” After returning home from boarding school, she met that soldier in Ulysses S. Grant. initiatlly invited to White Haven by Frederick T. Dent, Julia's brother and his former West Point roommate, Ulysses soon became a frequent visitor. He and Julia enjoyed walks and horseback rides. Grant proposed on the front porch of White Haven in the spring of 1844, but their marriage was delayed until August 22, 1848, due to his service in the war with Mexico. Their 37 years of marriage were marked by love, trust, and respect, and Julia fondly recalled her husband as “the nicest and handsomest man I ever saw.”<br />  </p> <p><strong>Motherhood</strong><br /> The Grants had four healthy children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. (called Buck), Ellen (called Nellie or Missy), and Jesse. Although Ulysses’ army duty took them to the far corners of the nation, Julia returned home to White Haven for the birth of their first child and after the birth of Ulysses Jr. in Ohio. Their last two children were born at the White Haven estate after Grant’s resignation from the army in 1854. Julia’s love for her children was constant, and she always made sure to broaden their horizons through education, the boys’ accompanying Ulysses at the front during the war, the children’s attendance at White House social functions, and their inclusion on the Grants’ around-the-world tour.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Farming and Life at White Haven</strong><br /> By 1855, the Grants farmed 80 acres of land given to Julia as a wedding gift by her father. Ulysses also managed the rest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/white-haven.htm\">White Haven</a> estate. Those days were financially trying for the Grants, but Julia remained supportive of her hard-working husband. She considered herself “a splendid farmer’s wife,” raising chickens and even churning butter. Except for making cake once a week, she left the cooking to the enslaved laborers. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/index.htm\">Civil War</a>, she served as the financial manager and agent for White Haven in her husband’s absence, leasing sections of the farm, collecting rent, and consolidating land titles. Even through the Presidency and her travels, she still called the farm “home.”<br /> <br /> <strong>Mrs. General Grant</strong><br /> As it did for most Americans, the Civil War dramatically altered the Grants’ lives. In 1861 Ulysses immediately left to serve in the Union army, and his responsibilities kept him away from home for most of the war. Letters helped to ease the pain of separation, and Julia frequently traveled to her husband’s encampments, both alone and with the children. It is ironic to note that Jule, an enslaved woman owned by Julia's father, assisted with the children’s care on such trips through early 1864 before running away to freedom. The family’s presence seemed to have a stabilizing influence upon Grant. With a strong desire to contribute to the war effort, Julia became a trusted confidant and often offered suggestions to her husband, such as inviting President and First Lady Lincoln to visit them at the front. She even asked her husband (unsuccessfully) to let her act as an emissary for proposed peace talks with the Confederates in 1864.</p> <p><strong>First Lady</strong><br /> During Grant’s two terms of office (1869-1877), Julia was an active participant in presidential matters. She attended Senate hearings, read through the president’s mail, and met with cabinet members, senators, justices, and diplomats. She reveled in her role as hostess to the nation, and all accounts reflect the warmth and home-like atmosphere she brought to the White House. Indicative of this were her afternoon teas and public receptions open to everyone, and the elaborate wedding held in the White House East Room for her daughter, Nellie, in 1874. Julia also became a grandmother for the first time while living there. She enjoyed her time so completely at the White House that she felt like a “waif” when they departed in 1877.</p>   <p><strong>Retirement</strong><br /> Following the conclusion of Grant's presidency, Ulysses and Julia embarked on a two-and-a-half year world tour that began in May 1877. They met dignitaries and common people of many countries, visiting many exotic points of interest along the way. It was a welcomed break from the political turmoil of the presidency, and they were treated as American celebrities. Nearly one-third of Julia’s memoirs are devoted to recollections of this trip, clearly a high point of her life. She noted that in foreign countries Ulysses finally got the recognition and respect he deserved. Unfortunately, the Grants fell victim to a Wall Street financial scam that left them nearly penniless several years after the world tour. Worse, Ulysses was diagnosed with inoperable throat cancer, and Julia’s future welfare was cast into grave doubt.<br /> <br /> <strong>Final Years</strong><br /> In a last effort to provide for his family, Ulysses S. Grant finished writing his memoirs in 1885, just before his death on July 23rd at Mt. McGregor, New York. The profits from Ulysses’ memoirs left Julia a wealthy woman, and she chose to live in homes in New York City and Washington, D.C. for the last seventeen years of her life. Julia worked to promote and sustain the memory of her beloved husband. In 1897, she attended the dedication of Grant’s Tomb in New York City with President William McKinley at her side. Her many friends and acquaintances included Jefferson Davis’ wife Varina, Jane Stanford, and Theodore Roosevelt. Julia also planned to leave her memoirs for the world. Once completed, she had difficulty finding an editor with whom she could agree, and it was not until 1975 that they were published. She died form heart and kidney complications at the age of 76, and is buried next to her husband in Grant’s Tomb. All four of her children outlived her, as did 12 of 13 grandchildren.</p>    <p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br /> Simon, John Y., ed. The Personal Memoirs of Julia Dent Grant (Mrs. Ulysses S.

      "bodyText": "<p>John Singleton Mosby was a lawyer turned partisan raider during the American Civil War. Enlisting as a private in the Washington Mounted Rifles, Mosby quickly rose through the ranks and was a lieutenant by the time he was attached to J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry regiment. Stuart was immediately taken with Mosby and assigned him increasingly responsible positions until finally Mosby was granted the autonomous command of a battalion-sized cavalry force charged with harassing Federal troops in Northern Virginia.</p> <p>Mosby's Rangers, as it came to be called, was famous for its daring and ability to evade pursuers by blending into the surrounding civilian population, then reforming once the danger had passed. Frustration with Mosby's attacks boiled over in 1864 when Union troops summarily executed seven of Mosby's men. Mosby then retaliated by executing three Federal prisoners. The killings stopped after an exchange of notes between Mosby and the local Federal commander, Philip Sheridan.</p> <p>Historians differ as to the military value of the Rangers' exploits but agree that they had a beneficial effect on Confederate morale. Mosby disbanded his command on April 21, 1865 and attempted to reach Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army in North Carolina to continue the fight but abandoned his plan upon hearing of Johnston's surrender. After the war, he became a friend and strong political supporter of Ulysses S. Grant who, as president, appointed him to a number of Federal positions including Assistant Attorney General and U.S. Consul to Hong Kong. This friendship cost Mosby his childhood home, which was attacked by arsonists, and exposed him to death threats and even an assassination attempt. He died in his bed in 1916.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>Michael W. Finnegan experienced many difficult times while serving in the US Army, as well as after his military career. Finnegan was in both the 10th Cavalry and 24th Infantry, and held the ranks of wagoner, private, and first sergeant.<br /> <br /> While he was in Arizona, Troop H of the 10th Cavalry was commanded by Captain Charles Cooper. Finnegan sometimes escorted Captain Cooper's daughter on excursions. On one trip, Forrestine Cooper Hooker recounted getting a starter of yeast for bread from her neighbor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/early-pioneers.htm\">Louis Prue</a>'s wife. Finnegan was carrying the yeast in a tin which exploded, and sounded like a gunshot. Forrestine was riding in front of Finnegan, and when she thought she heard a gunshot, she raced for home. She wondered why Finnegan wasn't shooting back at whoever was attacking them, and when she saw Finnegan's horse run past her, with Finnegan crouched over with grayish matter on his face, she feared the worst. Finally, Forrestine reached the cabin, where Finnegan was. \"Oh Finnegan, did they shoot you?\" she asked. \"He turned with a broad grin, remnants of gray brains still splotched his face, but he was wiping it off with his red cotton handkerchief.\" It was just the yeast. <br /> <br /> At <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">Camp Bonita</a>, Finnegan carved his initials “M.W.F” into a stone that was part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">Garfield Monument. </a> He added to his stone three linked ovals, which are a sign of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, a black fraternal organization.  <br /> <br /> Finnegan’s first major hardship came in 1891 while he was in Troop A of the 10th Cavalry. Finnegan was returning from carrying the post mail when he was attacked and beaten until he had a fractured skull. By 1895, Finnegan asked to be reduced to the rank of private, at Ft. Bayard, New Mexico, and was later given a disability discharge. He was not content to be a retired soldier, though, so Finnegan became an Able-bodied Seaman in the United Kingdom.<br /> <br /> He was an Engineer’s Steward starting in 1914, but because of the UK’s involvement in the early years of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwari/index.htm\">World War I</a>, Finnegan decided to move back to the United States. In 1917, Finnegan returned to the UK, and found work on a British Steamer, the <em>East Wales</em>.  The <em>East Wales </em>was attacked by surprise German gunfire, from a submarine U-57 on October 14, 1917, and sunk. Finnegan lost all of his possessions, including his pension papers, and three people drowned. Finnegan lived another year, and died at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/southern-branch-hampton-virginia.htm\">Southern Branch National Home</a>, in Virginia.<br /> <br /> Based on his enlistments, we know Finnegan was stationed throughout the United States:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://armyhistory.org/fort-apache-arizona/\">Ft. Apache, AZ</a> 1889 (10th Cavalry, Troop H)</p> </li> <li> <p>Ft Custer, MT 1892 (10th Cavalry, Troop A)</p> </li> <li> <p>Chicago, IL 1892 (24th Infantry, Troop G)</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.fortbayard.org/\">Ft. Bayard, NM</a> 1895</p> </li> </ul> <p>Almost nothing is known about Finnegan’s personal life, although his medical records indicate he suffered from syphilis and alcoholism. He wrote on one of his pension applications that he “never was married and never will be.” Much of this information was compiled first in <em>Warriors of Color</em> by Harold Ray Sayre. Forrestine Cooper Hooker wrote about Finnegan in her memoir, <em>Child of the Fighting Tenth</em>.

      "bodyText": "<p>On March 9, 1923, the headline on the first page of the <em>Portsmouth Herald</em> declared: “First Chinese Baby Is Born In This City.”<sup>1</sup> This headline marked the birth of Alice Yick, the first Chinese American woman to work at the Charlestown Navy Yard and an advocate for military veterans.</p> <p>The daughter of Chinese immigrants, Alice Yick spent her early years in New Hampshire. As the Yick family continued to grow, they eventually moved to Tyler Street in Boston’s Chinatown.<sup>2</sup> Henry Yick, Alice’s father, began working in a local restaurant while the children attended public school and the Kwong Kow Chinese School in the late afternoon.<sup>3</sup> In 1942 at the age of 19, Yick became the first Chinese American girl to enroll in the National Youth Administration’s mechanical training program.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Created by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, the National Youth Administration (NYA) provided training and jobs for unemployed students and young people. Engaged in multiple sectors, many of these individuals were trained in national defense, welding, and aviation mechanics. Though the program shut down before World War II ended, the NYA trained and employed over 2 million young Americans.<sup>5</sup> In this program, Alice Yick acquired crucial skills to help with wartime production, including the ability to use lathes, grinders, planers, and other machines.</p> <p>On December 7, 1942, Alice Yick applied the Boston Naval Shipyard (also known as Charlestown Navy Yard). She was soon hired, becoming the first Chinese American civilian woman worker at Boston's Navy Yard.<font size=\"1\"><sup>6</sup> </font>Originally placed in a machine shop, Yick soon ran into a problem that many women have - the machines with their standardized proportions did not accommodate her small stature. She recounted in her oral history in 1994 that:</p> <blockquote> <p>I was too short for the machine work so they put on another job and I was too cold so I worked there for a very short time and I left. After that I went to Gillette and there was a war program also and I was working for the government in the company. And so I operated a lathe.<sup>7</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Alice Yick was twice married, first to Frank Jong and later Adam Chin. She had three children in total. Alice Chin spent most of the next decades living in various locations in Boston's Chinatown. As her children grew up and started to attend public and Chinese school, Chin worked at various positions and expanded her hobby of photography into a side business.<sup>8</sup> Using her skills in photography and developing film, Chin volunteered at the Veteran's Administration, helping veterans express themselves through the lens:</p> <blockquote> <p>When I went to the V.A. Center, I saw all ages, even some men from World War II who were still there. I had a group of guys that was interested in photography. I volunteered, gee, I think about either five or six years. And out of the five or six years, from the day treatment center, these soldiers are ex-service men that had mental problems. Some of them are under control by medication. But some of them seem to, they want to do something, and they seem to get involved, and if they like it, they will finish up.<sup>9</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Alice (Yick) Chin passed away on November 2, 2021, at 98 years old.<sup>10</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"First Chinese Baby Is Born In This City,\" <em>The Portsmouth Herald</em>, March 9, 1923.</li> <li>Alice Yick eventually had five siblings, two brothers and three sisters.

      "bodyText": "<p>William Blakemore served in the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that provided essential services to freedom seekers coming to and through Boston on the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>In a broadside of its members published by the Boston Vigilance Committee, William Blakemore is listed as residing on 4 May Street. The 1849-1850 Boston City Directory lists him as a “japanner” living at this address.<sup>1</sup> A jappaner worked in the decorative arts, often finishing or ornamenting wood, leather, metal and other surfaces. One newspaper said the japanned furniture by Blakemore “attract[ed] much attention; they are very beautiful and are quite a novelty.”<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In a self-published family history, Blakemore’s granddaughter, Emma E. Butler, wrote that that William had been born in Birmingham, England where he met and married his wife Letitia. They soon moved to the Philadelphia for a few years before establishing themselves in Boston. According to Butler:</p> <blockquote>During the antislavery days in Boston, Grandmamma and Grandpapa were vitally interested. They left the Methodist Church during these years because of its stand on the slavery question. Their home was one of the stations of the “Underground Railway” and many a poor slave blessed them for shelter and protection on his way north...he [William] would lead us to talk of this glorious land - “The land of the free and the home of the brave,” to close with the remark, “Yes years ago I came to America to find freedom and one of the first things I saw when I reached Boston, was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a> marched between soldiers down State Street, his hands chained, being carried back into slavery. I would not boast too loudly of this free land.”<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Though we do not have further verification whether the Blakemore’s home served as a safe house, we do know from newspaper records that the couple engaged in antislavery work, in addition to William’s membership in the Vigilance Committee. For example, Letitia participated in the Liberty Fair as a member of the Massachusetts Female Emancipation Society in 1847. Later, she served as a Boston agent of the <em>Voice of the Fugitive</em>, published in Canada by freedom seeker Henry Bibb.<sup>4</sup> In 1847, William co-signed the public letter “Slaves Should Have The Bible” along with other Bostonians, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/timothy-gilbert.htm\">Timothy Gilbert</a>, later president of the Vigilance Committee, and John Gove, a future member of the Vigilance Committee as well. The letter called for distributing Bibles to the more than three million enslaved people of African descent in the country, and carried a strong abolitionist tone:</p> <blockquote>If Slavery cannot endure the circulation of the Scriptures, then Slavery ought to withdraw from the field...If the free circulation of the Scriptures should prove the means which God will bless for emancipating the Slaves, can we expect emancipation to be effected in any safer, easier or more salutary way, than through the instrumentality of the Bible?<sup>5</sup></blockquote> <p>William Blakemore died in West Roxbury in 1882 at age 76. His wife Letitia followed him in 1894.<sup>6</sup> His granddaughter remembered him as “gentle, brave, firm, true, just and noble.” She concluded “May his grandchildren ever prove worthy of the example he set.”<sup>7</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>\"Members of the Committee of Vigilance,\" broadside printed by John Wilson, 1850, Massachusetts Historical Society.

      "bodyText": "John Robert Fox was born on May 18, 1915, in Cincinnati, Ohio, the oldest of three children. He originally enrolled at Ohio State University but transferred to Wilberforce University. While at Wilberforce, he participated in the R.O.T.C. program, which Charles Young started in 1894. During Fox’s time at Wilberforce, the R.O.T.C. program was managed by Captain Aaron R. Fisher, a highly decorated World War I veteran. Fox graduated from Wilberforce and was commissioned a second lieutenant on June 13, 1940.<br /> <br /> On February 10, 1941, Fox was assigned to the all-Black 366th Infantry stationed at Fort Devens near Ayer, Massachusetts. At Fort Devens he began artillery training in an antitank unit. The 366th Infantry was unique in having all Black officers except for its commander. The Black officers mainly came from Wilberforce and Howard universities. In late spring 1941, Fox reported to Fort Benning, Georgia for training. After finishing training on August 15, 1941, he returned to Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> Throughout 1942 and early 1943, Fox and the 366th Infantry were sent to various locations in New England to guard against German sabotage. The military took this task seriously because  sabotage attacks had occurred during World War I. In the second half of 1943, the 366th Infantry were sent for training at A.P. Hill Reservation in Virginia and Camp Atterbury in Indiana.<br /> <br /> On March 27, 1944, Fox and the rest of the 366th Infantry left Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia for the European Theater, traveling on the USS General William Mitchell. They initially landed in Morocco and traveled by train to Oran, Algeria. On April 29, 1944, they boarded another ship from Oran heading toward Naples, Italy. Upon arriving, the 366th Infantry was broken up into small detachments and assigned support and guard duties.<br /> <br /> On November 4, 1944, Fox and the rest of the 366th were assigned to the 92nd Division in the Po Valley in northern Italy. In early December Fox and Cannon Company of the 366th Infantry were attached to the all-Black 598th Field Artillery Battalion (FAB). The 598th FAB was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert. C. Ross. Ross was pleased to have these new soldiers under his command. As he got to know Fox and the others, he appreciated their esprit de corps and expertise.<br /> <br /> On December 23, Fox moved to the front lines and took his place in an observation post in the town of Sommocolonia, Italy. He volunteered for the extended four-day Christmas posting. On Christmas Day, German troops snuck into town wearing civilian clothes. By the next morning, the Germans overran the town and began an attack on the U.S. positions. U.S. forces retreated under heavy artillery fire. Lieutenant Fox ordered his other team members to retreat but he stayed in the observation post to observe the German positions.<br /> <br /> From his second-floor position Fox called for defensive artillery strikes to try to prevent the German soldiers from advancing. As the German soldiers continued to advance Fox kept calling in artillery strikes closer and closer to his position. At approximately 11 a.m. on December 26, Fox again called for an artillery strike, but this time the coordinates were his own position. The officers with the 598th FAB were hesitant to land artillery on their comrade’s position. Lieutenant Colonel Ross called Fox to confirm the coordinates and acknowledge that Fox was asking for artillery on his position. Lieutenant Fox replied, “Fire It! There’s more of them than there are of us. Give them hell!” The ensuing artillery barrage killed Fox along with more than 100 German soldiers. His sacrifice stalled the German advance and allowed more American soldiers and Italian civilians to retreat to safety. A week later the American forces were able to retake Sommocolonia. Fox’s body was found, surrounded by 100 dead German soldiers. Fox’s remains were returned to his wife, and he was buried in Colebrook Cemetery in Whitman, Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> On May 15, 1982, Fox was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. In the early 1990s, the Department of Defense began to study the issue of why no African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor during World Wars II. The investigation looked at historical documents including Distinguished Service Cross paperwork. It was determined that Black soldiers had been denied consideration for the Medal of Honor in World War II because of their race. The report put forward a total of seven men who deserved the Medal of Honor for their actions. John R. Fox was one of them. President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to Fox on January 13, 1997. The award was presented to Fox’s widow, Mrs. Arlene E. Fox.<br /> <br /> Lieutenant John R. Fox’s Medal of Honor citation reads:<br /> “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: First Lieutenant John R. Fox distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism at the risk of his own life on 26 December 1944 in the Serchio River Valley Sector, in the vicinity of Sommocolonia, Italy. Lieutenant Fox was a member of Cannon Company, 366th Infantry, 92d Infantry Division, acting as a forward observer, while attached to the 598th Field Artillery Battalion. Christmas Day in the Serchio Valley was spent in positions which had been occupied for some weeks. During Christmas night, there was a gradual influx of enemy soldiers in civilian clothes and by early morning the town was largely in enemy hands. An organized attack by uniformed German formations was launched around 0400 hours, 26 December 1944. Reports were received that the area was being heavily shelled by everything the Germans had, and although most of the U.S. infantry forces withdrew from the town, Lieutenant Fox and members of his observer party remained behind on the second floor of a house, directing defensive fires. Lieutenant Fox reported at 0800 hours that the Germans were in the streets and attacking in strength. He called for artillery fire increasingly close to his own position. He told his battalion commander, “That was just where I wanted it. Bring it in 60 yards!” His commander protested that there was a heavy barrage in the area and the bombardment would be too close. Lieutenant Fox gave his adjustment, requesting that the barrage be fired. The distance was cut in half. The Germans continued to press forward in large numbers, surrounding the position. Lieutenant Fox again called for artillery fire with the commander protesting again, stating, “Fox, that will be on you!” The last communication from Lieutenant Fox was, “Fire It! There’s more of them than there are of us. Give them hell!” The bodies of Lieutenant Fox and his party were found in the vicinity of his position when his position was taken. This action, by Lieutenant Fox, at the cost of his own life, inflicted heavy casualties, causing the deaths of approximately 100 German soldiers, thereby delaying the advance of the enemy until infantry and artillery units could by reorganized to meet the attack. Lieutenant Fox’s extraordinarily valorous actions exemplify the highest traditions of the military service.”<br />  ",

      "bodyText": "<p>Mamie Eisenhower was born on November 14, 1896 in Boone, Iowa. Her father, John Sheldon Doud, owned and managed a meat packing plant. His business in Boone was so successful that he was able to retire at age thirty-six. He decided to relocate his family to Denver, Colorado. The affluent Doud family spent the winters in San Antonio, Texas.<br /> <br /> The Doud family was a household of four girls. Mamie’s mother was Elivera Carlson Doud.  The family lived in a large and comfortable house on Lafayette Street in Denver. The Doud daughters were raised with domestic help and had many opportunities in life. Mamie, like many young women of her social background, attended a finishing school. Her education prepared her for a desirable marriage and then as a social housewife who enhanced her husband’s chosen career.<br /> <br /> During the winter of 1915, Mamie, one of her sisters, and her mother were visiting the wife of an US Army major at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. During the visit, Mamie and her family met a handsome young second lieutenant who had recently graduated from West Point. The young man’s name was Dwight David Eisenhower from Abilene, Kansas. Lieutenant Eisenhower was the officer of the day, and he asked Mamie to accompany him on his rounds. Eisenhower was smitten from that moment. <br /> <br /> For the next seven months, Lieutenant Eisenhower courted Mamie with charm and persistence. After only seven months, the nineteen-year-old Mamie and Dwight were married on July 1, 1916 at the Doud home in Denver. Mamie’s father told her that she would have to live off army pay. After a brief trip to Abilene to visit Eisenhower’s family, the newlyweds moved into Eisenhower’s small quarters at Fort Sam Houston.<br /> <br /> As an army wife, Mamie had to adjust to periods of separation from her husband. In time, she became very adept at budgeting Eisenhower’s small paycheck. When Ike was home, she provided him with a relaxed and comfortable setting. The young couple had a reputation of being fun and entertaining.  With Mamie’s finishing school background, she knew how to throw a good party especially for senior officers and their wives. Their modest quarters were always known as “Club Eisenhower.” <br /> <br /> In addition to the hardship of a military wife, Mamie had to deal with personal tragedy. Their first child, Doud Dwight Eisenhower, also known as Icky, died of scarlet fever in 1920. Mamie and Ike were devastated over his death. <br /> <br /> Compared to most Americans, one advantage that Mamie had as a military wife was domestic and foreign travel.  The Eisenhowers spent time on the East and West Coasts plus in the South and Midwest. Internationally, the Eisenhower’s traveled together to the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Asia, and Europe. Eventually when Mamie became first lady, she was probably the best traveled of all first ladies. <br /> <br /> Like all Americans on the homefront during World War II, Mamie had her challenges and difficulties. Ike’s rapid rise in the ranks presented her with benefits and struggles. When Ike was promoted to the head of war planning in early 1942, the Eisenhower’s were eligible for a colonial house at Fort Meyers across the Potomac River. However, when Ike received a promotion within a few months to commanding general in the European Theater of Operation, Mamie had one week to pack up again. When Ike became a household name, it was Mamie who had to endure the intrusive press corps with praise, criticism, and rumors. <br /> <br /> After the war, Mamie finally got to spend more time with Ike when he was the Army Chief of Staff, President of Columbia University, and the Supreme Commander of NATO. In 1952, she supported Ike’s leap into politics and became an astute campaigner for him. <br /> <br /> With her experiences, Mamie made a smooth transition to first lady. She was an old fashion hostess of the White House. She was an effective manager of the White House budget, and she was loved by the White House staff. She was known for wearing pink and having her hair styled in bangs. She would state that “Ike was my career.”<br /> <br /> Like her husband, Mamie loved their home in Gettysburg, Pennslyvania. During the early days of the presidency, she took charge of the massive renovation to their Gettysburg farmhouse. The Eisenhowers spent many days during their presidential and thereafter retirement years enjoying the only home they ever owned. After Ike’s death in 1969, Mamie chose to remain living on their farm for the rest of her life until she passed away in 1979. </p>",

Our responsibility as life tenants is to make certain that there are wilderness values to honor after we have gone.” </em><br /> <br /> - Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas</h3> <p><br /> William Douglas was born in 1898 in Maine Township, Otter Tail County, Minnesota, the son of William Douglas, an itinerant Scottish Presbyterian minister from Pictou County, Nova Scotia, and his wife, Julia Bickford Fisk. His family moved to California, and then to Washington State. <br /> <br /> His father died in Portland, Oregon, in 1904, when Douglas was six years old. After moving the family from town to town in the West, his mother, with three young children, settled in Yakima, Washington. He was the valedictorian at Yakima High School and did well enough in school to earn a full academic scholarship to attend Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.<br /> <br /> In the summer of 1918, Douglas took part in a U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps training encampment at the Presidio of San Francisco. That fall, he joined the Student Army Training Corps at Whitman as a private. He was honorably discharged because the Armistice ended the war and the army's requirement for more soldiers and officers.<br /> <br /> He traveled to New York taking a job tending sheep on a Chicago-bound train, in return for free passage, with hopes to attend the Columbia Law School. Douglas graduated second in his class at Columbia in 1925.<br /> <br /> He later joined the faculty of Yale Law School, where he became an expert on commercial litigation and bankruptcy law.<br /> <br /> In 1934, Douglas left Yale after President Franklin Roosevelt nominated him to the Securities and Exchange Commission. <br /> <br /> In 1939, Justice Louis D. Brandeis retired from the United States Supreme Court, and Roosevelt nominated Douglas as his replacement on March 20. Douglas was Brandeis's personal choice as a successor. Douglas was sworn into office on April 17, 1939.<br /> <br /> Douglas became known for his interest in and advocacy for environmentalism. In his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case Sierra Club v. Morton (1972), Douglas argued that \"inanimate objects\" should have standing to sue in court:<br /> <br /> <i>Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes. The corporation sole—a creature of ecclesiastical law—is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases ... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes—fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.</i><br /> <br /> <i></i>Justice Douglas also played notable roles in conserving and promoting several locations that became units of the National Park System.<br /> <br /> <b><u>C& O Canal</u></b><br /> In the 1950s, proposals were made to create a parkway along the path of the C&O Canal, which ran on the Maryland bank parallel to the Potomac River. The Washington Post editorial page supported the action. However, Douglas, who frequently hiked on the Canal towpath, opposed the plan and challenged reporters to hike the 185-mile length of the Canal with him. After the hike, the Post changed its stance and advocated preservation of the Canal in its historic state. Douglas is widely credited with saving the Canal and with its eventual designation as a National Historical Park. <br /> <br /> <b><u>Buffalo National River</u></b><br /> Douglas was an outspoken defender of the Buffalo River in the Ozarks of norther Arkansas, and he fought to preserve it as a unit of the national park system.<br /> <br /> With plans underway to construct two hydroelectric dams on the Buffalo, the fate of the river and its surrounding communities was put on a national pedestal in the 1960s. Proponents of the dams argued for economic growth, flood control, power generation, and tourism to the local area. Many outdoor enthusiasts and conservationists fought to preserve the scenic, recreational, and scientific values of one of the few remaining free-flowing rivers in the lower 48 states through a proposal to add the Buffalo to the national park system.<br /> <br /> Justice William O. Douglas became invested in the preservation of the Buffalo River when, in 1962, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-neil-compton.htm\">Dr. Neil Compton</a> of The Ozark Society invited him on a multi-day canoe trip down the Buffalo. Nicknamed \"Wild Bill,\" Justice Douglas was an avid outdoorsman and an advocate for the environmental movement, so he had been identified by members of The Ozark Society as a key national leader to win over for their cause. <br /> <br /> On March 1, 1972, thanks to the efforts of Dr. Compton, The Ozark Society, and the many stakeholders they had reached in their campaign to \"Save the Buffalo River,\" President Richard Nixon and the United States Congress established Buffalo National River, the first unit of its kind within the national park system.<br /> <br /> <b><u>Guadalupe Mountains National Park</u> </b><br /> In far West Texas, the Guadalupe Mountains had first been discussed as a potential park as early as 1924. By the early 1960s the process was speeding up due to local landowner support, but the Guadalupes remained poorly known outside of the region. In December 1964 Justice Douglas visited the Guadalupe Mountains, traveling with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/gumo_noel_kincaid.htm\">Noel Kincaid</a> and other park boosters. His visit further confirmed that the mountains should be open to all Americans. Greatly helping to raise the profile of the proposed park, the Guadalupe Mountains were featured in two chapters of his 1967 book Farewell To Texas, writing that “Texas has no more important shrine than the towering Guadalupes.”<br /> <br /> <b><u>Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area</u></b><br /> In 1967, on a hike to save Sunfish Pond on the Appalachian Trail in New Jersey, Douglas was accompanied by more than a thousand people. He said: \"It's a vital element in the need to save some of our wilderness from the encroachment of civilization.\" The Delaware Water Gap's Douglas Trail is named in his honor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>Charles Faulkner had a lengthy military career which took him across the western United States to Cuba, and the Philippines. He retired as a Sergeant Major, at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/presidio-garrison.htm\">Presidio San Francisco,</a> but not much is known about his personal life. He may have been married twice—first to Julia, and then to Mollie Brown.<br /> <br /> Faulkner always held the rank of Sergeant, Quartermaster Sergeant, or Sergeant Major throughout his 30 years in the 10th Cavalry. He added his name to a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/garfield-monument.htm\">stone monument</a> made by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">Buffalo Soldiers stationed in Bonita Canyon</a>, Arizona, during the Indian Wars. Forrestine Cooper Hooker, daughter of Captain Charles Cooper, 10th Cavalry, Troop H, wrote a memoir, <em>Child of the Fighting Tenth</em>, which includes her time in Camp Bonita, with her father and mother. She included an anecdote about Faulkner. He was left at the camp to take care of an injured mule, while the rest of the troop was out on patrol. Forrestine, her mother, and their cook Jenny Miller, the wife of another soldier, were the only other ones at camp. In the morning, Faulkner discovered tracks of unshod ponies, likely belonging to Apaches, and he realized they had had a narrow escape. When the rest of Troop H returned, Captain Cooper made his family leave for safety. <br /> <br /> Based on his enlistment records, Faulkner served in Cuba during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/spanish-american-war-a-splendid-little-war.htm\">Spanish-American War</a>, and he re-enlisted at sea, on the <em>USA T</em>[transport] <em>Thomas</em>, near the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/the-philippine-insurrectiothe-philippine-war-a-conflict-of-consciencen-a-war-of-controversy.htm\">Philippines</a>.  He also spent time in the following places:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/foda/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Ft. Davis, TX</a> 1884</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/camp-bonita.htm\">Bonita Canyon, AZ</a> 1885</p> </li> <li> <p>Ft. Apache, AZ 1889</p> </li> <li> <p>Ft. Buford, ND 1894</p> </li> <li> <p>Manzanillo, Cuba 1899</p> </li> <li> <p><em>USA T. Thomas</em> (at sea, near the Philippines) 1902</p> </li> <li> <p>Ft. Mackenzie, WY 1905</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/buffalo-soldiers-wyoming-and-west\">Ft. D.A. Russell, WY </a>1907</p> </li> </ul> <p>For a man who served in the Army for 30 years, very little record of his life is left. Much of what we know was first compiled in <em>Warriors of Color</em>, by Harold Ray Sayre.

Later, records from the first U.S. Census in 1790 show him living with his wife Mary and seven children. Although he and his family are recorded in the next two U.S. Censuses in 1800 and 1810, as well as in town tax records, the Fraziers effectively disappear from the landscape by 1820. <br /> <br /> Frazer Point was probably named for the earliest recorded landowner - a London merchant named Thomas Frazer -- but one can only wonder where in history lies the connection between Thomas Frazier the free African American settler, and Thomas Frazer, the London merchant who seemingly never stepped foot on the land which now bears his name. ",

C., Johnston was introduced to the world of freelance journalism, wherein she could illustrate her own articles.  As magazine subscriptions spread, photography witnessed its own revolutions with the debut of the new Kodak No. 1, one of the first cameras to feature roll-film.  Gifted one by George Eastman in 1887, she began photography under the tutelage of Thomas Smillie at the Smithsonian.  Despite the training, she claimed that ignorance of the subject was the key to her success, i.e. she did not know what could not be done.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{a63d191f-20dd-4b78-b224-fa7f081d07d9}{63}\" paraid=\"1039185800\">Johnston’s first major article “Uncle Sam’s Money” appeared in <em>Demorest Family Magazine</em> in 1889 and documents a time when money was made more by hand and less by machine.  She was commissioned for many other projects including a series about the White House and the homes of members of President Harrison’s administration.  Johnston journeyed to the Kohinoor Mines, Pennsylvania in 1891 where she documented boys sifting slate from coal.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{a63d191f-20dd-4b78-b224-fa7f081d07d9}{125}\" paraid=\"467981503\">When Johnston and her mother came to Mammoth Cave for <em>Demorest Family Magazine</em>, she was no stranger to challenge.  Johnston spent about 3 weeks, making “many weary, and often fruitless, trips” into the cave with her mother, her cave guide <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/will-garvin.htm\">Will Garvin</a>, camera equipment, and volatile powder.  She developed a technique for conserving powder, using newspaper as a crucible.  She used only 12 ounces of powder for her entire battle to “vanquish the archenemy darkness.”  Her article “Mammoth Cave by Flashlight” became a huge success and featured 25 pictures that were highly praised.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{a63d191f-20dd-4b78-b224-fa7f081d07d9}{191}\" paraid=\"15380828\">Johnston admitted that she “wore out one camera after another” paying great attention to detail. Often details that would be omitted from history if not for her. In 1892, Johnston traveled to Chicago, Illinois for the World’s Columbian Exposition. Later, Johnston “enlisted” onboard the U. S. S. Olympia in 1899  in the trade of “snapshots” but “mustered out” after a couple of months when she had finished taking photos for her article. She brought focus to factories where women made shoes and cigar boxes. She captured students in classrooms at the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, U. S. Indian Industrial School, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tuin/index.htm\">Tuskegee Institute</a>, where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwca/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">George Washington Carver</a> called her the “pluckiest woman I ever saw.” She also made illustrative surveys of schools around Washington D. C.  She opened a studio out of her family home in  Washington D. C. and began portraiture. She took photos of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a>, Mark Twain, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bowa/index.htm\">Booker T. Washington</a>, Joel Chandler Harris, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/life-of-theodore-roosevelt.htm\">Teddy Roosevelt</a> and his family.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{afffb4c3-bb72-49ec-9ba8-44bd0ff107f1}{10}\" paraid=\"851754921\">After a European tour in 1905, Johnston reframed her career from photojournalism and portraiture to photo-documentation.  She became interested in gardens and opened a photographic studio with her partner, Mattie Edwards Hewitt, on Fifth Avenue, New York. She wrote and illustrated a series of lectures on gardens in the United States and Europe featuring the works of many landscape architects of the time.  This acted as a gateway into documenting colonial architecture in the southern United States.  She began working with the Historic American Buildings Survey and co-authored <em>The Early Architecture of North Carolina</em> with historian Thomas T. Waterman that featured over 240 photographs. Her preservation efforts and advocation for such projects pushed many cities, such as Charleston, SC and New Orleans, LA to instate zoning ordinances to protect historic districts. Verne Chatelain, former National Park Service Historian, credits the zoning ordinances passed in St. Augustine, FL to Johnston’s work.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{afffb4c3-bb72-49ec-9ba8-44bd0ff107f1}{99}\" paraid=\"508711890\">In 1945, Johnston bought a house on Bourbon Street in New Orleans. She would finally put roots down as a self-proclaimed “octo-geranium” and cultivate her own small garden and cats until her death in 1952.  </p>",

She visited Mammoth Cave while on a 1850-1852 North American Tour that was promoted by famed showman Phineas Taylor (PT) Barnum. On her arrival to the United States more than 30,000 admirers greeted her in New York as she disembarked from the steamship Atlantic.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{786bb6bf-4261-4b09-9ce5-2138a4bea51c}{8}\" paraid=\"1022226535\">It is likely that Lind made an impression on the cave guides during her time in the cave. A well-known natural cave feature found in Gothic Avenue was originally known as the “Devil's Armchair,” but was renamed “Jenny Lind’s Armchair” after Lind sat in the stone seat while on her cave tour. It is unknown if Lind sang while inside Mammoth Cave, but the cave’s acoustics are well suited for musicians and singers alike. Only the cave walls know what happened on that day over 170 years ago.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{786bb6bf-4261-4b09-9ce5-2138a4bea51c}{102}\" paraid=\"1664676612\">Lind would go on to perform for thousands of cheering fans in Boston, Philadelphia, Memphis, St. Louis and Nashville as well as other venues while on her tour. She gave her final U.S. performance at the Castle Garden in New York City on May 24, 1852 before returning to Europe. </p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>James Henry Gooding was born into slavery on August 28, 1838 in North Carolina. At a very young age his freedom was purchased by a James M. Gooding, who may have been his father, and he was sent to New York City. On September 11, 1846, Gooding was enrolled as a student in the New York Colored Orphan's Asylum, a prominent school and boarding house run primarily by Quaker women. There he received a classical education and became a proficient and prolific writer, a talent which would serve him for the rest of his life. From 1850-1852 he was indentured out of the Asylum to work for an Albert Westlake. As he approached adulthood he made the decision to hide his past as a slave, and began telling people he was born free in Troy, New York. In 1856, at the age of 18, he took a job on board a whaling ship out of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Whaling was one of the few industries at that time in which an African-American man could find employment on equal footing with whites. He often composed poetry describing life at sea on whaling ships. During his voyages he made as much as $20 per month, a salary equivalent to an officer on board ship. He gave up whaling in the fall of 1862, when he settled down in New Bedford and married Ellen Allen in the Seaman's Bethel, a prominent church in the city.</p> <p>He did not remain at home in New Bedford very long. Six days before Gooding's marriage, President Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect January 1, 1863 and opened the door for the enlistment of African Americans into the Union armies. James Gooding enlisted on February 14, 1863 into what would become the 54th Massachusetts Infantry. Throughout his service he sent letters to editors of the New Bedford Mercury, which published them weekly and tracked the progress of the 54th Massachusetts.</p> <p>The 54th Massachusetts was sent to the barrier islands of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Providing a description of the South to the Mercury, Gooding remarked in June 1863 that all he saw was \"…stink weed, sand, rattlesnakes, and alligators. To tell the honest truth, our boys out on picket look sharper for snakes than they do for rebels.\" This monotony would not last long. Less than a month later, Gooding participated in the storming of Fort Wagner near Charleston, SC, depicted in the 1989 film Glory. Describing the action at Fort Wagner to the Mercury, Gooding said, \"We met the foe on the parapet of Wagner with the bayonet…\"</p> <p><span>The magnitude of what the 54th Massachusetts was doing in terms of advancing civil rights for African Americans was not lost on Gooding. After the assault on Wagner he remembered that, \"…a regiment of white men gave us three cheers as we were passing them, it shows that we did our duty as men should.\" In September of 1863, tired of being paid only ten dollars a month compared to the thirteen dollars a month that white soldiers received, and far less than the twenty dollars he earned on his last voyage at sea, Corporal James Gooding wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln. In this letter he demanded equal pay for equal work, an argument that would reverberate across American history for more than a hundred years after his death. \"Are we Soldiers or are we Labourers?\" \"You caution the Rebel Chieftain, that the United States knows no distinction in her Soldiers. She insists on having all her Soldiers of whatever creed or Color, to be treated according to the usages of War. Now if the United States exacts uniformity of treatment of her Soldiers from the Insurgents, would it not be well and consistent to set the example herself by paying all her Soldiers alike?\"</span></p> <p><span><span>Gooding would soon find out the consequences of the United States' demand that all captured soldiers be treated equally. Prisoner exchanges, which had been prevalent throughout much of the war, were ceased in mid-1863 as a result of the Confederacy's refusal to treat captured African American soldiers equally as captured white soldiers. The halting of prisoner exchanges led to the creation of large prison camps such as Camp Sumter in Andersonville, GA. On February 20, 1864 Corporal Gooding fought at the Battle of Olustee in northern Florida. Gooding's comrades believed he was killed in battle. His commander sent notification to the editors of the Mercury that he was killed in battle and his wife applied for a pension in April. He was, however, not dead. Wounded in the thigh, Gooding was taken to Andersonville in early March 1864, where he died as a prisoner of war on July 19, 1864. He is buried in grave 3,585 in the Andersonville National Cemetery. Unknown to him at the time of his death, Congress had passed the law in June 1864 granting equal pay to African American soldiers.</span></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Much of the memory of James H. Gooding is preserved by the National Park Service. Andersonville National Historic Site serves his final resting place and tells his final story of sacrifice and suffering, where he paid the ultimate price for freedom. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nebe\">New Bedford Whaling National Historic Park</a> preserves, in part, the legacy of men like James Gooding, who found equality and opportunity in the 1840s and 1850s whaling industry. Both the Seaman's Bethel where Gooding was married and the Customs House where he enlisted into the 54th Massachusetts are preserved as part of the New Bedford Whaling National Historic Park<em>.</em></p> <p>Sources:</p> <p>Gooding, James H. <em>On the Altar of Freedom: A Black Soldier's Civil War Letters From the Front</em>.

Pierce extensively. Together Pierce and Welby are considered the founders of modern semiotics. Welby introduced a new approach to the study of signs and meaning, which she termed “significs.” There is even a prize named for her which is awarded to the best essayist on significs. She published many papers discussing the “meaning” of words versus the “sense” or “interpretation” of words. She published Links and Clues in 1881; <em>What is Meaning? Studies in the Development of Significance </em>in 1903; <em>Time as a Derivative</em> in 1907; <em>Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources</em> in 1911; and <em>The Meaning of Meaning </em>in 1923. She wrote many more manuscripts which were never published. She maintained correspondences between many philosophers, writers and scientists including J. M. Barrie, Lord Kelvin, Max Muller, Charles K. Ogden, Herbert Spencer, H. G. Wells and Nikola Tesla. She was also a member of the Aristotelian Society of London, the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and Sociological Society of Great Britain. Following a more traditional Victorian role, she donated to the Royal School of Needlework Society and founded the Decorative Needlework Society.<br /> <br /> Lady Victoria and her husband Sir Welby-Gregory had three children: Victor Albert William (1864-1876); Charles Glynne Earle (1865-1938); and Emmeline Mary Elizabeth (1867-1955) who is also known as Mrs. Henry Cust, a painter and sculptor. Lady Victoria died in 1912. </p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>Robert Gould Shaw served as colonel of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts</a>, one of the first Black regiments to fight in the Civil War.</p> <p>Born in Boston, Shaw grew up in the city’s elite social and political circles before the Civil War. His parents, Francis Shaw and Sarah Sturgis Shaw, committed themselves to societal improvement as reformers and abolitionists. Through their connections, Robert grew up surrounded by luminaries in the anti-slavery movement such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Llyod Garrison</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-beecher-stowe.htm\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>As a young adult, Shaw took little interest in his parents’ abolitionist and reform activities. Instead, he traveled abroad and later enrolled in Harvard but dropped out before graduation due to boredom and his own lack of direction.</p> <p>After the firing on Fort Sumter and the onset of the Civil War, however, Shaw found purpose in military service. He enlisted as private, first in the defense of Washington D.C. with the 7<sup>th</sup> New York regiment, and later as an officer with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Massachusetts regiment in Virginia and Maryland.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Lincoln</a>’s signing of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-emancipation-proclamation.htm\">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and subsequent call for Black regiments, Massachusetts governor John Andrew directed the formation of the 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts, one of the first Black fighting units from the North. He offered to colonelcy to Shaw. Though Shaw initially turned down the offer to command the regiment, his mother soon convinced him to change his mind, and he accepted his new commission in February 1863.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Shaw keenly understood the importance the regiment’s success. He organized the regiment at Camps Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts into an elite unit. The 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts, under Shaw’s stern discipline, became most one of the best drilled and trained regiments in the U.S. Army.<sup>4</sup> In the process, both soldiers and colonel developed a bond of respect and admiration for one another. Writing to his father with obvious pride, Shaw described a mustering officer from Virginia who stated that he had never mustered in so fine a set of men as the 54th. Concluding the letter, Shaw wrote, ”the skeptics need only come out here now to be converted.”<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Shaw pushed back against army leadership that sought to use the 54<sup>th</sup> for raiding or manual labor. He believed the regiment could prove itself in battle. When the opportunity arrived to lead an assault on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-54th-massachusetts-and-the-second-battle-of-fort-wagner.htm\">Fort Wagner, South Carolina</a>, Shaw quickly volunteered his regiment. Speaking to his men before the Fort Wagner attack, Shaw reminded them that “The eyes of thousands will look on what you do tonight.”<sup>6</sup> The soldier nearest Shaw responded, “Colonel I will stay with you until I die.”<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Facing unsurmountable odds, Shaw led approximately 650 of his men into the attack on Ft. Wagner on July 18, 1863. In the fierce battle, Shaw soon fell dead after being struck by enemy fire on the parapet of the fort.</p> <p>Confederates buried Colonel Shaw in a common burial pit, intending it as an insult to the leader of the Black regiment. After being offered to move Shaw’s body to an officers’ cemetery, his father directed he be left in the place of honor with his men.</p> <p>Shaw did not initially join the war effort to end slavery. However, his leadership of the 54<sup>th</sup> and their collective heroism at Fort Wagner encouraged the widespread enlistment of Black soldiers. This, in turn, ultimately helped turn the tide of the war and secure emancipation throughout the country.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li> Robert Gould Shaw, \"Letter to Annie Shaw, February 4, 1863,\" in <em>Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune: The Civil War Letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw</em>, ed. by Russell Duncan (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2011), 1. </li> <li>William Mcfeely, \"Introduction,\" in <em>Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune: The Civil War Letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw</em>, ed. by Russell Duncan (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2011), 6-7.</li> <li>Mcfeely, \"Introduction,\" 21-27.</li> <li>Mcfeely, 32-35.</li> <li>Robert Gould Shaw, \"Letter to Francis George Shaw, March 1863,\" in <em>Blue-Eyed Child of Fortunte</em>, 316.</li> <li>Stephen J.

      "bodyText": "<p>As a soldier, reformer, and politician, Stephen Swails showed commitment to equality, placing him at the forefront of radical change in American race relations.</p> <p>Born in Columbia, Pennsylvania in 1823, Swails grew up in south central Pennsylvania and western New York. In the years before his birth, Swails’ parents, freed persons from the slave state of Maryland, moved the family from the dangerous border state to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Following the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, abolitionists and slave catchers frequently fought over the area.<sup>1</sup> To avoid additional risks, Swails and his family relocated to the abolitionist center of Elmira, New York.</p> <p>Swails worked as a waiter in Cooperstown, New York in April 1861 when the Civil War began.<sup>2</sup> Swails shared the desire to serve in the war with other African American men who realized that it could radically change their status in the United States. However, the government prohibited their enlistment until the Lincoln administration issued the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-emancipation-proclamation.htm\">Emancipation Proclamation</a> in 1863, which paved the way for Black men to serve in the military. Massachusetts soon began recruitment for the 54<sup>th</sup> Regiment, one of the first Black regiments of the Civil War, and enlisted the help of abolitionist leaders including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a> to help fill its ranks. Douglass toured the Elmira area in the winter of 1863 as part of his recruitment tour. Likely inspired by Douglass‘s recruiting drives, Swails and hundreds of African Americans from New York and Pennsylvania enlisted in the new <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54<sup>th </sup>Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>. They trained at Camp Meigs in the Boston area before heading to the warfront.</p> <p>Recognizing Swail’s leadership ability, the regiment’s young colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, quickly promoted him to 1<sup>st</sup> Sergeant. During the 54<sup>th</sup>'s heroic assault on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-54th-massachusetts-and-the-second-battle-of-fort-wagner.htm\">Fort Wagner</a>, South Carolina, Swails cradled the body of K company commander as he died and rallied the retreating regiment.</p> <p>A defining moment for Swails came at Olustee, Florida on February 20, 1864. During the battle, he rallied the regiment and retreating Union forces, receiving a serious wound.<sup>3</sup> While the 54<sup>th</sup> commanding officer recommended Swails for a promotion to 1<sup>st</sup> Lieutenant, racism within the military slowed the promotion for nearly a year. Despite emancipation and the disintegration of slavery, the basic idea that a Black man could lead White troops in battle struck at the heart of American racist attitudes. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/luis-f-emilio.htm\">Captain Luis Emilio</a> wrote, “When the usual request was made, it was refused on account of Swails African descent, although to all appearances he was a white man.”<sup>4</sup> White officers in the regiment, such as Lt. Charles During, struggled to reconcile their own racism with the heroism of Black soldiers they witnessed on the battlefield and their belief that African Americans should not give orders to White soldiers.<sup>5</sup> White officers gradually came to view their Black comrades with respect as they witnessed their bravery in battle. In January 1865, Swails finally received official promotion to officer rank. Though likely the only Black officer to receive this promotion, Swails never officially commanded in combat as the war soon ended without another major military engagement for the 54<sup>th</sup>.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Reconstruction enabled Swails to rise to political prominence in post-war South Carolina. Elected to the state senate in 1868, he served continually for nearly 10 years. Swails became the most prominent member of the South Carolina senate, the president pro tempore, placing him in control of all bills that passed through the state legislature.<sup>7</sup> Committed to universal education, he played a critical part in transforming The South Carolina College from a school for planter elite into the integrated University of South Carolina.</p> <p>Support for the Reconstruction governments faltered despite Swails’s direct appeals to President Grant in 1872. Local militias violently overthrew the state’s Reconstruction government in 1876, and the final federal troops withdrew the next year. The restoration of the former Confederates to power ended Black political influence in the state. Some Black politicians, including Swails, continued to have local influence, however the leadership of the state targeted his reputation and his life. In 1878, he survived two assassination attempts, forcing him to limit time in the state.<sup>8</sup> Despite continued threats, Swails returned to South Carolina in 1884 to run for Congress. Unable to campaign due to the danger, he lost the election.</p> <p>Swails died in Kingstree, South Carolina on May 17, 1900. His gravesite in the segregated Humane and Friendly Society Cemetery in Charleston remained unmarked until the 1970s.</p> <p>Lt. Swails’s life spanned the dramatic change in American history from slavery to Black political power in the South. Although he died at the beginning of the long Jim Crow era, his life and accomplishments foreshadowed the continued fight for civil rights throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries that remains ongoing today.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Douglas R. Egerton, <em>Thunder at the Gates: The Black Civil War Regiments that redeemed America</em> (New York: Basic Books, 2016), 20.</li> <li>Egerton, 20.</li> <li>Egerton, 228.</li> <li>Luis Emillo, <em>A Brave Black Regiment: The History of the 54th Massachusetts, 1863-1865</em> (New York: De Capo Press, 1995) 194.</li> <li>Egerton, 229.</li> <li>Egerton, 267.</li> <li>Egerton, 326.</li> <li>Egerton, 327.</li> </ol>",

      "bodyText": "Fitz Lee was born in June 1866 in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. In December 1889, Lee enlisted in M Troop, Tenth Cavalry, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1898, as the Army was mobilizing for war with Spain, Lee was serving as a private. As the Tenth Cavalry was boarding its transport ships bound for Cuba, Lee, along with 50 other troopers, was chosen by Lieutenant Carter P. Johnson for a special assignment. Johnson and his men were headed behind enemy lines to reenforce and resupply Cuban fighters seeking liberation from Spanish rule.<br /> <br /> On June 30, 1898, Cuban freedom fighters and some American volunteers aboard the U.S.S. Florida attempted an amphibious landing at Tayabacoa, Cuba. The landing party immediately engaged with Spanish soldiers from a nearby blockhouse. The Cubans and Americans retreated, leaving behind a group of wounded comrades. A call for volunteers to rescue the wounded soldiers on the U.S.S. Florida began to make the rounds. After several unsuccessful rescue attempts Private Lee, Corporal George H. Wanton, Private Dennis Bell, Sergeant William H. Thompkins, and Lieutenant George P. Ahern stepped forward and offered to rescue their wounded comrades. <br /> <br /> The five soldiers went ashore and surprised the Spanish holding their comrades. The rescuers were able to free all the wounded soldiers, and everyone returned safely to the U.S.S. Florida. Lee, Wanton, Bell, and Thompkins were awarded the Medal of Honor in the summer of 1899 for their actions at Tayabacoa. Lee received his Medal of Honor while he was in the hospital at Fort Bliss, Texas. His health declined quickly after the rescue mission, with severely limited vision, swollen limbs, and abdominal pain that left him bedridden for three months. Lee was medically discharged from the Army on July 5, 1899, a few days after receiving the Medal of Honor.<br /> <br /> Lee moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, after discharge to live with fellow retired Buffalo Soldiers. His comrades took care of him while he awaited his disability benefits from the War Department. In constant pain and totally blind, Fitz Lee died at the home of a friend in Kansas on September 14, 1899. He was buried with full military honors at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery, Section G, Site 3183.",

In her words, “If there was an “ology” that told the story [of the past], and if there were “ologists” who knew anything about it, my course lay clear.”<br /> <br /> Ann received her bachelor's degree from Smith College in 1922. After graduating, she traveled to Paris for field training with the American School of Prehistoric Research in France. Ann entered professional life as an archeologist at a time when men largely did not include women in the discipline. In 1923, Ann married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/earl-morris.htm\">Earl Halstead Morris</a>.Though an archeologist in her own right, Ann referred to her “career of being an archeologist’s wife,” eluding to the tactic of women archeologists to navigate institutional sexism and find a place for themselves. Smith College awarded Ann an honorary master's degree in 1935. <br /> <br /> On their honeymoon, Ann and Earl excavated Mummy Cave, now inside Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona, where they hired Navajo to work on the dig. From 1923 to 1929, and again in 1932, the Morrises excavated Canyon del Muerto. Ann developed methods to document architecture, petroglyphs and pictographs, and landscapes. Ann's colorful drawings captured information that then-popular black-and-white photography would have lost. For example, while at Canyon del Muerto, she made watercolors of the cave and kiva wall paintings to “copy in full color and accurate detail as many of the hundreds of pictographs along the canyon’s gallery walls as possible.” In 1929, she illustrated the ancient art at Antelope House, Pictograph Cave, and Standing Cow Ruins. These paintings were exhibited at the American Museum. The couple worked on multiple sites during this time, including Mesa Verde in Colorado and Aztec Ruins in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> Starting in 1924, in cooperation with the Carnegie Institute of Washington, the Morrises spent five winters excavating the Mayan city Chichén Itzá in eastern Mexico. When Ann first arrived, archeologist Sylvanus Morley told her to babysit his six-year-old daughter and act as hostess to visiting guests. Ann, instead, convinced him to allow her to excavate a small, overlooked temple.  Ann also copied the Temple of the Warrior murals, which took four seasons. Her final illustrations were published in <em>Temple of the Warriors at Chichén Itzá, Yucatan, </em>coauthored with Earl and a French painter, Jean Charlot.<br /> <br /> Together, Ann and Earl wrote many studies on ancient lifeways within the American Southwest and Mexico, including one on Native American sandals that their archeologist daughter Elizabeth Ann expanded upon years later. Ann herself wrote two popular books, <em>Digging in the Southwest</em> (which upended conventional thinking about the Anasazi people) and <em>Digging in the Yucatan</em>. Ann intended the books to have a popular audience, in order to educate the public about the field. The publishers, however, marketed the books to older children because they did not recognize that women could write literature about archeology for adults.<br /> <br /> Ann and Earl Morris had two daughters, Elizabeth Ann and Sarah Lane. Elizabeth studied Anthropology at the University of Arizona, and following in her parents footsteps, became an Archaeologist and Professor at Colorado State University.<br /> <br /> Image credit: Gift of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1958. © President and Fellows of Harvard College, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, 58-34-00/2.1347<br /> <br /> Morris, Ann Axtell<br /> 1931 <em>Digging in Yucatan. </em>Junior Literary Guild.

She participated in a field school at Chaco Canyon as a student, then led expeditions of Girl Scouts on digs in the southwest. Her long career at the Museum of New Mexico resulted in an expansion of the exhibit halls and public education programs. Bertha also served on the National Park Service Advisory Board. A warm, fun-loving person, Bertha’s enthusiasm for archeology inspired her friends and students alike. <br /> <br /> Between 1929 and 1931, Bertha studied history and philosophy at the Lincoln (Nebraska) School of Commerce and the University of Nebraska. Although taking business courses, a professor suggested that, given her actual interests in history and philosophy, she study archeology at the University of New Mexico. She enrolled in 1932. Bertha joined Edgar J. Hewett’s field school at Chaco Canyon, where her work at Leyit Kin became the basis of her master’s thesis. Bertha earned her master’s degree from the University of New Mexico in 1937. She received a PhD in 1952 from Columbia University, where her dissertation focused on the Toltec city of Tula. Her original project became the book <i>Sun Father’s Way: The Kiva Murals of Kuana</i> (1963), a study of the murals at the Kuaua site in Coronado State Monument. In addition, New Mexico State University bestowed an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1973.<br /> <br /> Bertha was an administrative assistant at the Museum of New Mexico until 1939. She then became the curator of ethnology (1939-1959), instructor of television and adult education classes (1947-1957), curator of interpretive exhibits (1959-1962), and head of the Division of Research until she retired in 1965. She remained a research associate at the museum until the end of her life. In retirement, Bertha taught for a year at St. Michael’s College, then accepted the appointment as director of the Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art (1966-1975). From 1973 to 1975, she served as the only female member of the National Park Service Advisory Committee. Throughout her career, she maintained close relationships with local Native American tribes and conducted many ethnographical studies.<br /> <br /> Bertha’s greatest project was the Girl Scout Archeological Mobile Camp. From 1947 to 1957, in partnership with the Girl Scouts of America, Bertha led senior Scouts from across the country on a two-week camping tour of archeological sites in the Southwest. Their route covered hundreds of miles and changed slightly every year, including places like the Kuaua ruins at the Coronado State Monument, Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito at Chaco Canyon, Wupatki National Monument, a Navajo summer camp, among other sites. The girls also toured museums and attended lectures given by National Park Service staff, visiting scholars, and “Bert” herself on ancient lifestyles and artifacts. Though the girls did not excavate in the early years of the camp, they toured so many archeological sites and got so covered with desert road dust that they took to calling themselves “Dutton’s Dirty Diggers.” Bertha bowed to the girls’ pleading to let them excavate, first in 1951 at Pueblo Large in the Galisteo Basin then for five more years.<br /> <br /> Bertha received many honors for her archeological and ethnographic work. The Girl Scouts awarded her the “Thanks Badge” in 1957. The U.S. Department of the Interior presented her with a Certificate of Appreciation in 1967. In 1968, Lady Bird Johnson invited Bertha  for a luncheon at the White House for “Women Doers.” 1985, she received the Society for the American Archeology 50th Anniversary Award for Outstanding Contributions to American Archeology. She was featured in the Arizona State Museum exhibit “Daughters of the Desert: Women Anthropologists and the Native American Southwest, 1880-1980.” From her scholarly work, dedication to public education and mentorship to girls, Bertha is remembered as a enormous force in American archeology.<br /> <br /> Dutton, Bertha P.<br /> 1963  <i>Sun Father's Way: The Kiva Murals of Kuana.</i> University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, and Museum of New Mexico Press, Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> Dutton, Bertha P. and Edgar J.

      "bodyText": "Caleb Benson was a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/buffalosoldiers/index.htm\">Buffalo Solider</a> stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska who decided to homestead near the fort after an injury prevented him from reenlisting.<br /> <br /> Born at Jacksonville, Florida, on June 24, 1860, the Benson family moved to Charleston, South Carolina when he was six years old. After the death of his parents, Benson enlisted in the U.S. Army on February 25, 1875.<br /> <br /> The legal age for enlistment was twenty-one and he was only fourteen years old at the time. During his recruitment he stated he was 21 years and 7 months old though he was actually seven years younger.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Caleb Benson served with the 9th Cavalry in Company D (1875-1880) & the 10th Cavalry in Companies B and K (1885-1904, 1907-1908). He served as a cook for much of his service. In 1903 during his sixth enlistment, Benson was burnt by his field stove and lost much of his eyesight. He also suffered a head injury that caused memory loss from the accident.<br /> <br /> When his enlistment term ended in 1904, Benson wanted to reenlist to complete thirty years of service for full retirement pay instead of receiving a disability pension. He was already at twenty seven years since his overseas duty in Cuba counted as double for retirement. His reenlistment was denied due to his disabilities until a reevaluation in 1907 allowed him to go to the Phillippines for eighteen months in order to receive his thirty years of service.<br /> <br /> During his service, Benson participated in the Indian Wars, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/spanishamericanwar/index.htm\">Spanish-American War</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/philippine-war-conflict-of-conscience.htm\">Philippine American War</a>. He served for seven enlistments before retiring as First Sergeant Benson on September 29, 1908.<br /> <br /> In regards to the Indian Wars, Benson is quoted as saying, \"People may think it isn't true, but the Indians never shot a colored man unless it was necessary. They always wanted to win the friendship of the Negro race, and obtain their aid in campaigns againist the white man.\"<br /> <br /> Following the passage of the Kincaid Act in 1904, Captain Henry C. Whitehead and other officers at Fort Robinson filed homestead claims in Sioux County, Nebraska. The Kincaid Act allowed homesteaders to claim up to 640 acres in the sandhills of Nebraska.<br /> <br /> A year later, Captain Whitehead relinquished his claim to Benson on July 6, 1905. Benson’s was soon was called away from his homestead to service the Philippines. When he retired from military service following this tour of duty, he returned to his homestead.<br /> <br /> Benson settled down in Nebraska and soon married Percilla Smith on March 29, 1909. She was a graduate of the Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute in Virginia.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Because of the 1872 Soldiers and Sailors Act, Benson’s military service reduced his homestead residency requirement. This meant that he only had to live on the land for one year.<br /> <br /> On December 5, 1910, Benson and two witnesses went to the land office in Alliance, Nebraska to testify that he had fulfilled the requirements of the Homestead Act. Improvements made to the land included a frame house, a log barn, a cave-cellar, a well with a windmill and tank, chicken house, and an outbuilding. The Bensons had six acres in cultivation and grazing horses and cows in the pasture. There also was a significant amount of pine trees on his land. His homestead patent was issued on July 26, 1911.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> A neighboring homesteader, James T. Mason, raised his concern about a potential deal Caleb Benson had with Captain Henry C. Whitehead. Mason claimed that Whitehead had told him that relinquishing the land to Benson was “a cheap way for him to get a section of land.” A special agent was sent in November 1914 to investigate the claim. He found that Benson was leasing most his land to Major Carter P. Johnson at that time.<br /> <br /> Benson told the agent he had received around $600 from Whitehead to make improvements to the land and Whitehead wanted the first chance to buy the land if Benson decided to sell it. The agent believed this money was from the 1913 mortage in Benson's name for a thousand dollars that Benson appeared unaware of. The agent decided to close the case instead of pursuing further action as \"nothing of the deal appears previous to the granting of the patent.\" (See attached land case file for details)<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In 1923, Caleb Benson and his wife moved to Wisconsin to continue working for Lt. Col. Edwart Calvert. By 1925, they had moved to New York City and settled in Harlem, where they met thier foster son James \"Jimmie\" Benson, originally James Amos.<br /> <br /> The Bensons returned to Crawford, Nebraska by 1934. Benson was was an honored guest at the dedcation of the Lieutenant Levi Robinson and Cheif Crazy Horse monuments at Fort Robinson in September 1934.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"group of men in uniform outside a building\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|750|597|0|0|0\" height=\"597\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7029680|0|\" src=\"/home/images/RG2877-0803.jpg\" title=\"Veterans History Nebraska RG2877-0803\" width=\"750\" /> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">Group of veterans, 1934 (Caleb Benson in front row, middle)<br /> Source: History Nebraska, RG2877-0803</div> <br /> Caleb Benson died of coronary thrombosis on November 19, 1937.

Remembered as a pioneer in southwestern archeology, Morris is known for his excavation and restoration work as well as his photography skills.<br /> <br /> Earl's fascination with archeology started at a young age, encouraged by his father who was an avid pot hunter. In 1908, Earl entered the University of Colorado to study psychology. He joined an excavation with Edgar J. Hewett at Bandalier National Monument in 1911 and dropped out of school in 1912 to join him at an excavation at Quirigua, Guatemala. Earl conducted excavations through the University of Colorado Museum in the area east of Mesa Verde near the La Plata river in 1913 and at Quirigua in 1914. Morris earned his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology in 1914 and Master's degree in 1916. He spent 1917 as a graduate student at Columbia University.<br /> <br /> Between 1916 and 1923, Earl was the director of excavation at Aztec Ruin in northwestern New Mexico for the American Museum of Natural History. From 1924 to 1929, Earl worked as the director of excavations on behalf of the Carnegie Institution at Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. In between seasons in Mexico, he worked at Canyon de Chelly, sites near Shiprock, New Mexico, the Mimbres valley in Grant County, New Meixco, Kawaika-A on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, and at various basketmaker sites near Durango, Colorado. As a result of this work, he developed a body of evidence for distinct chronological periods in the history of the southwest, which were published in his book, <em>Archaeological Studies in the La Plata District</em>. In the early 1930s, Earl also supervised restoration projects, including the tower at Mummy Cave, Canyon del Muerto; the Great Kiva at Aztec Ruins National Monument; and several structures in Mesa Verde National Park. Earl worked at numerous other sites throughout the southwest.<br /> <br /> In 1923, Earl Morris married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ann-axtell-morris.htm\">Ann Axtell</a>, who herself became a famous archeologist, artist, and author. They had two daughters, Elizabeth Ann and Sarah Lane.  Elizabeth studied Anthropology at the University of Arizona, and following in her parents footsteps, became an Archaeologist and Professor at Colorado State University.<br /> <br /> Earl received numerous awards. The University of Colorado awarded him Norlin Medal in 1931 and an honorary Doctor of Science in 1942.

      "bodyText": "<p>According to his obituary, \"At a period when the State required its wisest and best man at the head of the Government, John A. Andrew was selected.\"<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Known as the \"great War Governor\"<sup>2</sup> of Massachusetts, John Albion Andrew's leadership during the Civil War and commitment to anti-slavery in his legal and political career earned him widespread admiration and respect. Andrew led the efforts to enlist African American men as soldiers and organized the famous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>. As a friend and champion of \"the poor, the wretched, the sick, even the vile,\"<sup>3</sup> Andrew's earnest and sympathetic character proved to be his strongest asset.</p> <p>Born and raised in Maine, John A. Andrew attended Bowdoin College. After graduating in 1837, Andrew went to Boston, studied law under Henry H. Fuller, and passed his bar exam in 1840.<sup>4</sup> As a man with strong religious views, Andrew attended the Church of the Disciples and befriended church leaders, including Reverend James Freeman Clarke and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/leonard-grimes.htm\">Reverend Leonard Grimes</a>.<sup>5</sup> Guided by a sense of religious and civic duty, Andrew's legal knowledge and beliefs worked hand-in-hand \"on behalf of the oppressed and the defenseless.\"<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Andrew advocated for social causes by joining reform groups including anti-slavery organizations. He served as a member of the 1846 and 1850 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committees</a>.<sup>7</sup> Bostonians founded the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">1850 Vigilance Committee</a> in response to the passage of the new Fugitive Slave Law, the controversial law that empowered enslavers and their agents to capture and return freedom seekers to bondage with the full backing of the federal government.</p> <p>Almost at once, Andrew began to provide legal defense to freedom seekers and those who aided them, including abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a>. Following the rescue of freedom seeker, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-rescued-from-the-fangs-of-the-slave-hunter-the-case-of-shadrach-minkins.htm\">Shadrach Minkins</a>, Hayden faced examination for his alleged involvement in the affair. Charges against Hayden stated that he had \"harbored and concealed him [Minkins] in his house in Southac street.\"<sup>8</sup> Acting as Hayden's counsel, Andrew successfully argued for his acquittal. Andrew also played an important role in the high-profile legal cases of freedom seekers Seth Botts and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>Andrew continued to fight against slavery by working within the legal system, and he remained \"always ready to defend any person arrested under the Fugitive Law.\"<sup>10</sup> In 1856, a Maine captain and his ship crew discovered a freedom seeker, William Johnson, on their boat. News of Johnson's capture and arrest reached Vigilance Committee members. After allies secured a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, Andrew represented Johnson in court and argued for his discharge as \"Johnson was the only person on board the vessel at the time of his arrest, except the mate, who is also a colored man.\"<sup>11</sup> After receiving no opposition to this motion, Johnson received a discharge.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>Financial records of the Boston Vigilance Committee include a reimbursement of $37.49 to Andrew for \"expenses in Hyannis case,\"<sup>13</sup> which took place in the fall of 1859. A ship's crew headed to Boston had discovered a hidden freedom seeker named Columbus Jones. Stopping in Hyannis, Captain Gorham Crowell arranged for Jones to be sent back to Florida. News of Jones' capture and return to slavery spread. After arriving in Boston, Crowell and a mate found themselves facing charges for imprisoning and kidnapping Jones. In this case, Andrew argued on behalf of the prosecution.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>In addition to providing legal assistance, Andrew's role as a member of the Finance Committee helped secure funding needed to help freedom seekers find food, shelter, and other survival necessities through the collection of donations and solicitation of subscriptions. According to <em>The Liberator</em>, in 1859 the Committee of Finance reported having raised $6028 which had aided \"more than four hundred fugitives.\"<sup>15</sup></p> <p>By the late 1850s, Andrew grew more involved in politics.<sup>16</sup> Originally a member of the Whig party, Andrew went on to help organize the anti-slavery Free-Soil Party.<sup>17</sup> In 1859, he served in the Massachusetts Legislature.<sup>18</sup> Despite his limited experience in politics, Andrew ran as the Republican nominee for the seat of Governor and won the 1860 election. Sensing a war on the horizon, Andrew made it a priority to prepare the state for war. As a result, Massachusetts became one of the first states to answer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Lincoln's</a> call for troops to defend Washington, DC at the outbreak of the Civil War.<sup>19</sup> He also organized one of the first African American regiments in the North, the 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts whose actions at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-54th-massachusetts-and-the-second-battle-of-fort-wagner.htm\">Fort Wagner</a> helped inspire the enlistment of roughly 180,000 African American men in the Union Army. His leadership proved popular with the people of Massachusetts as he won the following annual reelections for his position.</p> <p>After the Civil War, Andrew chose not to run for reelection and returned to his legal practice. He continued to advocate for social causes until his death in 1867. Buried in Hingham Cemetery, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robert-gould-shaw-and-massachusetts-54th-regiment-memorial.htm\">Robert Gould Shaw and 54<sup>th</sup> Memorial</a> located across the street from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-state-house.htm\">State House</a> in Boston stands as a testament to the long-lasting legacy of Andrew's achievements.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>James Freeman Clarke, <em>Memorial and Biographical Sketches</em> (Boston, MA: Houghton, Osgood, 1880), 50.</li> <li>Peleg W.

      "bodyText": "As a Harvard University student, Edward Lothrup Rand joined the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/champlain-society.htm\">Champlain Society</a> as its director of botanical studies and secretary. In later years, Rand used his botany notes to co-author a text with John Redfield entitled <em>Flora of Mount Desert Island, Maine (1894)</em> and was an active trail builder and map maker.  <h4>Botanist</h4> As a passionate botanist, as early as 1880 Rand noted with great concern the large number of wild orchids and ferns being collected by summer residents (known as 'cottagers' or '<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/rusticators-tourism.htm\">rusticators</a>'), as well as the destruction of forests on Mount Desert Island (MDI). He feared the land clearing and 'flower fiends' were a sign of increasing development.The efforts of Rand and his fellow Champlain Society members are the first documented calls for a strategy to preserve the island for the public, planting the seed for future efforts to create a park. It was recorded in the Harvard University Secretary's Report in 1919 that Rand became the Botanist of Lafayette (Acadia) National Park. This would make him the park's first botanist.  <h4>Map Maker</h4> Rand's 1894 map, prepared in conjunction with his <em>Flora of Mount Desert Island, Maine</em> text documented many place names on the island, illustrated many of the mountain paths and logging roads that would eventually become part of the island's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historic-trails.htm\">trail system</a>. Though not entirely comprehensive of all existing trails , the map is foundation for future trail maps.  <h4>Path Committee Chairman</h4> From 1900-1907 Rand served as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/village-improvement-associations.htm\">Seal Harbor Village Improvement Society</a> Path Committee Chairman. As chairman, Rand supervised two local men, Paul and Sanderson Cushman, and oversaw the cutting of a limited number of new paths including the new routes to the Jordan Pond House and the Tilting Rock on Day Mountain. In his annual reports, Rand cited many problems with maintaining the path system. Trails needed to be relocated, needed a large amount of construction work, cairns and signs were vandalized and needed replacement, and walkers complained about confusion caused by unmarked trails. To address these concerns, Rand advocated standardizing signs and an updated path map. By 1903, Rand felt that the path system was so extensive that no more trails were necessary \"Unless to meet some real need.\" Rand was one of the early pathmakers to call for the removal of paths and prioritizing the protection of the island's flora and fauna. <br /> <br /> Rand resigned from the chairman position in 1907 due to a disagreement over trail work that was completed in his absence. He rejoined the committee later as a member. <h4>Remembering Rand</h4> <br /> In the days following his death in 1925, many members of the Champlain Society fondly remembered him. Some were pall bearers at his funeral and a plaque was placed in Rand's memory on the Seaside Path, outside of Acadia National Park's boundary. <br /> <br /> \"He was an acute observer, an indefatigable collector, and critical in the acquisition of scientific literature, but his keenest interest was in the human side of science, that impulse which leads to cordial relations with one's fellow-workers....\" - \"From Harvard College, Class of 1881,\" page 333<br /> <br /> B. L Robinson, curator of the Gray Herbarium, in an address before the club says of Rand: \"arrayed in his leggings and all his botanizing paraphernalia, starting forth, with his slightly side-long stoop, to explore some remote sphagnum bog, in search of botanical treasures. The window and the rig alike testify to Rand's love of the out-doors, and to his lifelong devotion to his chosen avocation, botany. It was in the pursuit of this avocation that his heart chiefly lay. It was before his college days that his interest in botanical studies showed itself, but it was during his college vacations, in connection with the group of young men who camped on Somes Sound, Mt. Desert, and called themselves the Champlain Society, that his enthusiasm was roused to discover and record the flora of that region..\"<br /> <br /> Rand married Annie Matilda Crozier in Boston, MA on June 29, 1893.",

      "bodyText": "<p>George Bucknam Dorr, (December 29, 1853-August 5, 1944) known as the father of Acadia National Park, spent most of his adult life bringing the park into being, caring for the park, and expanding it.</p> <p><strong>History</strong><br /> Dorr was a private citizen whose life covered the last half of the 1800s and the first half of the 1900s. He came from privilege, the son of affluent Bostonians. He inherited fortunes from both his parents and traveled widely in Europe with his parents. He was a gentleman scholar and Harvard University graduate. Dorr was a lover of nature who first visited Mount Desert Island in 1868 on a vacation with his parents and made the decision to make the island his primary home. The remains of the family residence, Old Farm, at Compass Harbor in Bar Harbor, are part of Acadia National Park today. He never married; instead he focused his time, energy, and intellect on preserving the natural beauty of his beloved island.<br /> <br /> Over four decades he worked tirelessly to acquire tracts of land for protection, build trails, and lay plans as a member of both civic groups that <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/founding.htm\">founded Acadia National Park</a>.. He donated scores of parcels of his own land and persuaded others to donate land or gift funds. It was Dorr’s vision and passion that ensured lands would be set aside for preservation and protection for future generations.</p> <p><strong>Collecting Land</strong><br /> This project was never easy or straightforward. Challenges were frequent. In early 1913 while at home in Boston, hoping to enjoy a peaceful winter social season there, he received word that some in the Maine state legislature were determined to revoke the nonprofit status of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/hctpr.htm\">Hancock County Trustees for Public Reservations</a> (one of the civic groups who helped found Acadia). He immediately set out for Augusta, Maine, and spent days successfully fighting the measure. He realized at that time, however, that the lands he’d fought so hard to acquire needed the greater protection of the federal government, and he began a new drive to secure that protection. Soon he was on his way to Washington, meeting with powerful and influential friends there. He would make many trips armed with maps and deeds and titles; he would provide more and more information to the federal bureaucracy and deal with political stumbling blocks. Finally in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson created Sieur de Monts National Monument. This process had taken more than two years, but with great persistence, and the help of influential friends, Dorr made it happen. While the Trustees would have preferred national park status, Dorr chose to have Wilson sign off on the national monument rather than waiting for Congress to act on the national park. With the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916, Acadia was in line for designation as a national park. It was not until 1919 that Lafayette National Park came into being.<br /> <br /> George Dorr built the spring house at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/sieur-de-monts.htm\">Sieur de Monts</a> in 1909 and carved “The Sweet Waters of Acadia” on a nearby rock. Today, this location has come to symbolize the enthusiasm and contributions of Dorr and other early-20th-century citizens in the creation and preservation of these lands. Dorr was ever vigilant that anything done in the park would be of the highest quality and not mar the incredible beauty and uniqueness of the area. In 1913, John D. Rockefeller Jr. began construction of a carriage road system on private land that was developed and expanded as public land with Dorr’s support.</p> <p><strong>Later Life</strong><br /> His later years would certainly bring satisfaction but also trials and difficulties. He loved to hike and walked all over the island. He swam in Frenchman Bay almost daily, even having to break ice along the edges to do so. He had a heart attack in 1934 while enjoying his morning swim and was told he had six months to live (he lived ten more years). Chronic visual difficulties recurred throughout his life until he lost his sight in his final years.<br /> <br /> Dorr always believed his personal fortune could absorb purchasing land on behalf of the park forever, but this was not the case. At the onset, he declined any salary except for one dollar a month as the first custodian of the national monument, but by the time the park became Acadia in 1929, he gladly accepted a regular salary. Despite the income from his highly successful Mount Desert Nurseries, he depleted his inheritance in the decade prior to the inauguration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The federally funded social programs of the President enabled the park to rapidly develop in ways that eclipsed what had been accomplished in the first decade of the park.<br /> <br /> Dorr’s Old Farm estate was accepted a park property one month before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The park superintendent never retired and continued working with Mr. Rockefeller on land aquisition projects until August 5, 1944 when the heart that was supposed to have given out ten years earlier finaly stopped. The National Park Service and the executors of his estate renamed the mountain overshadowing Sieur de Monts Spring and a mounument at the base of Dorr Mountain honors his memory.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Saved to future generations as it has been to us, in the wild primeval beauty of the nature it exhibits, of ancient rocks and still more ancient sea, with infinite detail of life and landscape interest between, the spirit and mind of man will surely find in it in the years and centuries to come an inspiration and a means of growth as essential to them ever and anon as are fresh air and sunshine to the body.</em><br /> - George B.

During the summer and fall, her family spent time at their fish camps where her mother would split, dry, and smoke salmon and hunt ground squirrels while her father tended to the reindeer and hunted bear and moose. In winter, Mary’s father also trapped furbearers including otter, mink, and fox. He often hired additional help to look after the reindeer herd while he was trapping, but it wasn’t long before Mary was entrusted with that responsibility.<br /> <br /> At the age of 13, Mary became a full-time herder for her father along with Elia Eknaty, an orphan taken in by the Gregory family. Together, she and Elia took the reindeer herd out to graze in the evening, leaving home around four and not returning until ten or eleven at night. Mary would watch over the herd, preventing them from mixing with the wild caribou and protecting them from wolves. She recalled that when the “[wolves] start howling, we start shooting in the air with the .22. Build a big fire there, light a Christmas tree....” From an early age, Mary learned hard work and responsibility, but this time in her life wasn’t without its fond memories either. Mary spent time lassoing reindeer calves for fun, once accidently taking on an adult too big to handle. Another time, she recalled how the reindeer loved to eat mushrooms and she and her friend became sick after pretending to be reindeer and eating too many themselves.<br /> <br /> Together, Mary and her family managed one of the last reindeer herds in the region. They eventually stopped reindeer herding after 1947. However, the family’s strong connections to the land allowed for Mary’s father to file an allotment application for land adjacent to Kukaklek Lake near their Winter Camp in 1960, in accordance with the Alaska Native Allotment Act of 1906. Mary eventually inherited her father’s 160-acre allotment after a long legal battle.<br /> <br /> Mary married John Olympic at the age of 16 in 1947 and they had several children together. John spent most of his time commercial fishing while Mary was the primary caretaker of the family. Using the skills she had learned growing up, Mary managed her own trap line and fish camp like her parents. She also took a job at the school in Igiugig to help support her family.<br /> <br /> Later in life, Mary became a respected Aleut/Yup’ik elder, passing on her knowledge to her family and community. Mary is considered a matriarch of Igiugig. She was instrumental in land selection for the Igiugig Native Corporation and a leader in the Igiugig Village Council. She ensured that governance systems were operated based on Indigenous values. Her granddaughter, Christina Salmon, remembers her strong personality and how “she ruled with an iron fist... she listened really well… she knew right from wrong, and that was most important for her.” Though Mary was an integral part of the Igiugig community, she referred to Kukaklek Lake as nunaka, “my homeland.”<br /> <br /> In 1995 and 2002, Mary was interviewed for Project Jukebox, a community history endeavor conducted by University of Alaska-Fairbanks with the National Park Service. Her stories are a record of Alaska Native subsistence lifestyle, local place names and traditional knowledge integral to the families of Igiugig. Her words, preserved through the oral history tradition, continue to impart knowledge of the rich cultural history of Katmai Preserve lands. Mary is remembered as a leader and cultural bearer. Through both the enduring record of her life and in her roles in governance, Mary has helped to ensure the success of current and future generations.<br /> <br /> You can listen to Mary in her own words on <a href=\"https://jukebox.uaf.edu/site7/p/3116\">Project Jukebox</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sarah Louise \"Lulu\" Rittenhouse was the born on February 22, 1845 in Georgetown, DC. Her parents, Charles Edwin and Sarah Matilda Whitall Rittenhouse lived with their eldest daughter, Fannie, and Sarah Matilda's parents.<br /> <br /> The Whitall family leased an estate on the Georgetown Heights. It belonged to Charles Carroll who leased it to prominent members of society or government workers. In 1841, heirs of Charles Carroll sold it to the Whitall family. The estate was called Bellevue at the time. It was renamed and is now known as Dumbarton House, owned and operated by the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America.<br /> <br /> Charles Edwin Rittenhouse was a prominent banker in Georgetown. He had moved to the area when he was in his twenties and had begun working in the Bank of the Metropolis. He had a successful 18-year career there until he was made president of a new bank and exchange in Georgetown. He was president of the Bank of Commerce in Georgetown for the remainder of his life.<br /> <br /> The Rittenhouse family continued to grow after Lulu’s birth. Three girls and two boys were born between 1847 and 1859. One of the girls died in infancy and one of the boys died as a teenager.<br /> <br /> There is not much information to be found about Sarah Rittenhouse. She lived in Georgetown her entire life and never married. <br /> <br /> In 1902, the nearby Montrose estate had fallen into disrepair and had long been abandoned. Developers were planning to buy the land and build housing units on the acreage. The land had long been a place where locals went for picnics and to recreate. Lulu began petitioning congress to buy the land to keep it maintained as a public park.<br /> <br /> The first proposal in 1904 was not a success, but she did not give up. In 1911 her hard work paid off and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/montrose-park.htm\">Montrose Park</a> was established. Lulu next began pushing for a bridge over Rock Creek to help alleviate traffic on M Street NW. The Q Street Bridge went through several designs and several bid processes before being constructed in 1915. The Rittenhouse descendants had sold Bellevue to a cousin, John L. Newbold, in 1912. At the time, Q Street NW was forced around the Bellevue house. Added traffic from the new bridge would have been problematic. In order to save the house, Mr. Newbold had it moved 100 ft to the north to it’s present location on Q Street NW.<br /> <br /> Sarah Louise Rittenhouse died in 1942. In the 1950s, hostesses in Washington began holding fundraising luncheons and banquets to raise money to put up a monument or a memorial of some sort to “Miss Lulu.” A birdbath or a sundial were suggested. In 1956, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/sarah-rittenhouse-armillary-sphere.htm\">Sarah Louise Rittenhouse Armillary sphere</a> was installed in Montrose Park.",

      "bodyText": "George Henry Wanton was born on May 15, 1868, in Paterson, New Jersey, to William H. and Margaret Wanton. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1884 and served for four years. He was discharged from the Navy in 1888. In 1889, Wanton enlisted in M Troop, Tenth Cavalry, in Paterson. In 1898 as the Army was mobilizing for war with Spain, Wanton was serving as a corporal in M Troop. As the Tenth Cavalry was boarding its transport ships bound for Cuba, Wanton, along with 50 other troopers, was chosen by Lieutenant Carter P. Johnson for a special assignment. Johnson and his men were headed behind enemy lines to reenforce and resupply Cuban fighters seeking liberation from Spanish rule.<br /> <br /> On June 30, 1898, Cuban freedom fighters and some American volunteers aboard the U.S.S. Florida attempted an amphibious landing at Tayabacoa, Cuba. The landing party immediately engaged with Spanish soldiers from a nearby blockhouse. The Cubans and Americans retreated, leaving behind a group of wounded comrades. <br /> <br /> A call for volunteers on the U.S.S. Florida to rescue the wounded soldiers began to make the rounds. After several unsuccessful rescue attempts, Corporal Wanton, Private Fitz Lee, Private Dennis Bell, Sergeant William H. Thompkins, and Lieutenant George P. Ahern offered to rescue their wounded comrades. <br /> <br /> The five soldiers went ashore and surprised the Spanish holding their comrades. The rescuers were able to free all the wounded soldiers, and everyone returned safely to the U.S.S. Florida. Wanton, Lee, Bell, and Thompkins were awarded the Medal of Honor in the summer of 1899 for their actions at Tayabacoa. <br /> <br /> Wanton left the Army at the end of the Spanish American War once his enlistment was up. He returned to Paterson but had a hard time finding steady work despite his Medal of Honor and honorable military service. He reenlisted for a short time in 1902 and after this enlistment ended, he again returned to civilian life. <br /> <br /> Unable to find a place in the civilian world, Wanton reenlisted again in 1909, this time as a private with the Tenth Cavalry at Fort Ethan Allen in Vermont. He served in the Tenth Cavalry for 10 years and took part in the Mexican Punitive Expedition of 1916 and 1917. Wanton’s final retirement from the Army came in 1925, as a master sergeant in the Quartermaster Department at the age of 58. <br /> <br /> In retirement, Wanton represented the Buffalo Soldiers at several functions honoring Medal of Honor recipients. He was also chosen to be an honorary pall bearer at the burial of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in 1921. George Henry Wanton died on November 24, 1940. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Section 4, Lot 2749.<br />  ",

      "bodyText": "Brent Woods was born enslaved in Pulaski County, Kentucky, in 1855. He was freed at the age of eight. Woods enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 10, 1873, in Louisville, Kentucky. Although Woods was 18 at enlistment, he lied about his age, saying that he was 23. He was assigned to B Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry.<br /> <br /> By 1881, Woods and the other members of B Troop, Ninth Cavalry, were stationed at Fort Cummings, New Mexico. Fort Cummings, originally established in 1863, is located 20 miles northeast of modern-day Deming, New Mexico. The site was chosen because of the proximity to Cooke’s Spring, a large fresh water source for travelers heading west on the Butterfield-Overland Stage Route and the southern overland route to California.<br /> <br /> On August 17, 1881, Lieutenant George W. Smith with a detachment of 17 troopers from B Troop including Woods left Fort Cummings in pursuit of Nana, a warrior and chief of the Chiricahua Apaches. B Troop was joined by a group of approximately 20 local cowboys led by rancher George Daly, who said that Nana and his fighters had attacked their ranch. The troopers and cowboys followed Nana’s trail toward Gavilan Canyon.<br /> <br /> On August 19, 1881, as the troopers and cowboys approached the canyon, Lieutenant Smith halted the column, fearing an ambush. Daly and the cowboys ignored Smith’s advice and entered the canyon. Smith and the Buffalo Soldiers followed the cowboys into the canyon to protect them. Almost immediately, Apache warriors sprang from concealed positions, killing Lieutenant Smith and Daly. The cowboys fled the canyon, leaving the Buffalo Soldiers in the ambush. Buffalo Soldiers James Brown, Thomas Golding, and Monroe Overstreet were killed in action shortly after Lieutenant Smith. <br /> Sergeant Brent Woods, the highest-ranking Buffalo Soldier in Gavilan Canyon, took command. He ordered the troopers to charge up the canyon cliffs and attack the Apache positions. As the Buffalo Soldiers worked their way to higher positions, the Apaches gave ground and started retreating. However, it was not until another group of Buffalo Soldiers arrived that the battle tilted in their favor. Nana and his group retreated.<br /> <br /> Private Henry Trout, a B Troop member, said that Woods “at once assumed command of the detachment and through his energy and skill defeated the Indians and saved the detachment from an entire massacre.” Woods was awarded the Medal of Honor 13 years later, on July 12, 1894. His citation stated, “Saved the lives of his comrades and citizens of the detachment.”<br /> <br /> Woods retired from the Army in 1902 and returned to Kentucky. He died on March 31, 1906, and was buried in an unmarked grave at the First Baptist Church of Somerset. On June 20, 1984, the U.S. Army exhumed Woods’s remains and gave him a fully military funeral at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy, Kentucky. He was reinterred in Section A, Grave Number 930.<br /> <br /> Today, Woods is memorialized in bronze at the New Mexico Veterans’ Memorial in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",

      "bodyText": "Clinton Greaves was born enslaved on August 12, 1855, in Madison County, Virginia. Greaves moved to Prince Georges County outside Washington, D.C., before enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1872 in C Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry. He was eventually stationed at Fort Bayard, New Mexico.<br /> <br /> In late January 1877, the garrison at Fort Bayard learned of an armed engagement between members of the Sixth U.S. Cavalry and a group of Chiricahua Apaches in Arizona. The Chiricahua Apaches were headed east into New Mexico after the engagement. Lieutenant Henry H. Wright along with Corporal Greaves and five other men from C Troop, Ninth Cavalry, along with three Navajo scouts, left immediately to search for the Apaches. On January 24, , they tracked the Apaches to their camp in the Florida Mountains south of Fort Bayard.<br /> <br /> The Buffalo Soldiers, outnumbered two to one, tried negotiating with the Apaches. A half-hour of discussions did not yield the results Lieutenant Wright sought. The Apache men encircled Wright and the Buffalo Soldiers and began to close in on all sides. Wright ordered the Buffalo Soldiers to engage the Apaches and push through their circle. The fighting included close-range gunfire and wielding the guns as clubs.  Greaves, at the center of the fighting, made an opening in the Apaches’ line, using his carbine as a club, allowing his comrades to escape the ever-tightening Apache circle. <br /> <br /> As the Buffalo Soldiers retreated out of the mountains, the Apaches took up defensive positions. Wright and the men of C Troop withdrew to Fort Cummings, taking 11 captured horses with them.<br /> <br /> Lieutenant Wright and the detachment of Buffalo Soldiers that fought that day received immediate recognition for their bravery. Fort Bayard Post Order stated, “The conduct of Lieut. Wright and men under him is deserving of the highest praise and furnishes an example of gallantry and soldierly conduct worthy of emulation by all.” Wright submitted his recommendation for Greaves to receive the Medal of Honor. Wright’s chain of command agreed. <br /> <br /> Greaves was awarded the Medal of Honor on June 26, 1879. Greaves’ Medal of Honor citation reads, “While part of a small detachment to persuade a band of renegade Apache Indians to surrender, his group was surrounded. Cpl. Greaves in the center of the savage hand-to-hand fighting, managed to shoot and bash a gap through the swarming Apaches, permitting his companions to break free.”<br /> <br /> In 1877, Greaves reenlisted and was transferred to H Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry. He spent a total of 15 years with the Ninth Cavalry before he transferred to Columbus Barracks in Ohio. The barracks was one of the training centers for recruits before being assigned to their regiments. Greaves remained at Columbus Barracks for five years before retiring from the military in 1893 at the rank of sergeant. <br /> <br /> After retirement, Greaves stayed in Columbus and worked at the barracks as a civilian for the Quartermaster Department until his death in 1906. he is buried in Columbus, Ohio at Green Lawn Cemetery, Section 27, Lot 88.<br /> <br /> Camp Greaves, a U.S. Army installation in South Korea near the demilitarized zone, memorialized Clinton Graves, as does a life-size bronze statue at Fort Bayard, New Mexico.<br />  ",

      "bodyText": "Henry Johnson was born enslaved on June 11, 1850, in Boydton, Virginia. Johnson enlisted in 1867 in the newly formed F Troop, Tenth U.S. Cavalry. In June of 1877 Johnson reenlisted in the Army for the third time. He transferred to D Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry, stationed at Fort Wallace, Kansas. Soon after his transfer, D Troop relocated to Fort Union, New Mexico, where it engaged in scouting and patrolling. <br /> <br /> In the spring of 1879, D Troop was on the move again. This time they logged 589 miles north to Colorado as part of the Ute Expedition. In the autumn of 1879, D Troop escorted surveyors making the line between Colorado and Utah. <br /> <br /> On October 1, 1879, a courier arrived at D Troop’s camp with a message for Captain Francis S. Dodge. It said that Ute Indians had surrounded the Fifth Cavalry at the Milk River in Montana. The Fifth Cavalry was going to be overrun if help didn’t arrive. Dodge issued 225 rounds of ammunition to each of his 35 veteran Buffalo Soldiers. As night fell, the soldiers broke camp and hastily headed toward Milk River. They traveled 70 miles in 20 hours and arrived near daybreak on October 2, 1879. <br /> <br /> The beleaguered Fifth Cavalry soldiers cheered wildly at the sight of the Buffalo Soldiers. Once Dodge, Johnson, and the rest of D Troop entered the circled wagons of the Fifth Cavalry, the Utes began to fire again. Dodge later said, “We were scarcely in the trenches when they commenced a fusillade which kept up at intervals for the next three days.” Almost all the Buffalo Soldiers’ horses were killed during the attack.<br /> <br /> On October 3, some of the Buffalo Soldiers took up advance screening positions to try and protect the makeshift army barricade. As Sergeant of the guard, Johnson encountered enemy fire numerous times as he went from position to position talking to his troopers. This reassured the soldiers in the advanced positions to keep the Utes from advancing on their positions. <br /> <br /> As the days went on, water ran out. While it was available from the Milk River a short distance outside the barricades the army set up, the Indians were surveilling the river. On October 4, after nightfall, Johnson led a small group of soldiers to the river to collect drinking water. On the morning of October 5, 1879, five troops of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry under Colonel Wesley Merritt arrived. The Utes’ advantage evaporated, and they retreated. The Battle of Milk River was over. <br /> <br /> For the next two years, D Troop was stationed at Fort Union, New Mexico, participating in the campaigns against Apache chieftains Victorio and Nana. Johnson was discharged from D Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry, in January 1883 at Fort Riley, Kansas. Two months after discharge he reenlisted, this time in the Tenth Cavalry, and reported to Camp Grant in Arizona. He spent five years in the Tenth Cavalry before reenlisting in K Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry.<br /> <br /> On September 22, 1890, Johnson was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Milk River. His Medal of Honor citation states, “Voluntarily left fortified shelter and under heavy fire at close-range made the rounds of the pits to instruct the guards; fought his way to the creek and back to bring water to the wounded.”<br /> <br /> As a member of K Troop, Johnson served with fellow Medal of Honor recipients George Jordan and Thomas Shaw. Johnson helped patrol the Pine Ridge Reservation in the winter of 1891. K Troop was also assigned to Fort Myer just outside of Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1891, and returned to Fort Robinson, Nebraska, in 1893. Henry Johnson served the rest of his enlistment at Fort Robinson. He retired from the military in 1898 at 49 years old.<br /> <br /> Henry Johnson died in Washington, D.C., on January 31, 1904, at the age of 53. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Section 23, Lot 16547.",

      "bodyText": "<p>A ship's performance, and the performance of her crew, is in many ways a reflection of the individual commanding that ship. Assigned to be the second captain of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/usscassinyoung.htm\">USS <em>Cassin Young</em></a>, John Ailes assumed command of the ship in October 1944. Commander Ailes was a talented officer whose aggressiveness and determination helped secure victory for the Allied forces in the Pacific during World War II.</p> <p>Born on September 9, 1907, John William Ailes III grew up in Donora, Pennsylvania. Appointed to the US Naval Academy in 1926, Ailes graduated in 1930 and was commissioned an ensign. At age 22 \"Red\" or \"J.W.,\" as he was called by his classmates, possessed a small figure, red hair, a winning smile, and a deep love for Pittsburgh. It was said that Ailes was \"amply capable of much success,\" and that during his training at the academy, he \"comes into his own on the cruise.\"</p> <p>Ailes was stationed at Pearl Harbor with his wife, Edith, and their two young boys when Japanese forces attacked on December 7, 1941. This attack forced Ailes and his country into war. On October 18, 1944, at 37 years old, Ailes stepped aboard <em>Cassin Young</em> as relief for Commander Earl T. Schreiber. Navigator George T. Finnegan stepped aboard <em>Cassin Young</em> at about the same time as Ailes. Years later, Finnegan recalled that his former captain \"was an excessively efficient officer\" and that Ailes was \"…Very respected by the men.\" The skipper \"never gave any indication that he didn't know exactly what he was doing,\" Finnegan recollected, \"and I think the fact was that he did know what he was doing almost all the time…He was an ideal skipper for a destroyer.\"</p> <p>Possibly his greatest responsibility was the welfare of <em>Cassin Young's</em> crew. Ailes led a crew of 324 young men, and beginning in November 1944 those men faced a new threat –Kamikazes. Finnegan felt comfortable placing his life in Ailes's hands. Finnegan remembered that during Kamikaze attacks, Ailes was everywhere on the bridge, screaming orders, and that he \"was almost like a madman\" while fighting aerial threats. Ailes' \"maneuvering of the ship,\" in Finnegan's opinion, \"saved it on several occasions from being hit.\" Finnegan believed Ailes was \"great at anticipating just how the plane would come out of its dive at us, and would just put the ship in configuration that it would be fading away from the attack…\" The radical maneuvering \"did save us on [a] couple occasions,\" Finnegan believed.</p> <p>Ailes mastered maneuvering <em>Cassin Young</em> to avoid being hit by Kamikazes. Despite his best efforts, Kamikazes struck the ship in two separate attacks during the Okinawa Campaign. The first hit occurred on April 12, 1945, causing damage to the main mast, the port yardarm, and numerous radar and antennae, forcing <em>Cassin Young</em> to undergo repairs. FC3 Sumner Wheeler was assigned to the work detail to repair the ship. Wheeler remembered that he and the crew were not ready to return to Okinawa and the danger it represented. As sailors from a tender boarded <em>Cassin Young</em> with tools to repair the damaged ship, Wheeler and the work party took those same tools and dumped them overboard, \"figuring without tools, we couldn't get fixed up\" and they would have to return to the U.S. for repairs. Ailes discovered that tools had been thrown overboard, but would not let that deter his return to action. \"Well, I don't care what you people do,\" Wheeler heard Ailes say, \"but I'm going back up there if I go up there on one engine or not.\" Wheeler and the other sailors figured that if Ailes was that determined, they would \"rather have two engines than one engine.\" They completed the repairs and <em>Cassin Young </em>returned to Okinawa and the brutality of war.</p> <p>A Kamikaze struck the <em>Cassin</em> <em>Young</em> again on July 30, 1945, igniting a large fire along the starboard side, electrical fires in the main radio, and disrupting electrical circuits, the gyro compass, and the starboard shaft. Even more devastating were the 67 casualties of war suffered by the crew. Having survived this vortex of fire and death, Ailes managed to sail <em>Cassin Young</em> to a port under her own power to receive repairs. Under Ailes' leadership, USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, the equivalent to the Silver Star, \"For outstanding performance in combat against enemy Japanese forces in the vicinity of Okinawa…\" No matter the situation, Ailes pushed his ship and his crew in order to accomplish their missions and survive the war. For his actions, Ailes was awarded the Silver Star and Navy Cross. \"His courageous leadership, determination and devotion to duty,\" read his Silver Star citation, \"were in keeping with the highest traditions\" of the US Naval Service.</p> <p>Ailes was a skilled commander and leader. He survived the war, and continued in the service of the US Navy, advanced to the rank of rear admiral. Ailes passed away on July 30, 1974, twenty-nine years to the day after the fateful July Kamikaze strike near Okinawa. He conveyed to his men that he had full control over <em>Cassin Young</em>, and in turn received the respect of the men who served under him. Men such as Red Ailes were vital to achieving victory for the Allied forces. Ailes' memory, and the memory of those who fought under his command, will forever be preserved for those who discover <em>Cassin Young</em> and explore its history.</p> <p><strong><em>Contributed by: Casimer Rosiecki, Park Guide</em></strong></p> <hr /><em>Bibliography & Footnotes:</em> <ul> <li>Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

He attended the Seminario Conciliar de Guadalajara, Mexico, where he distinguished himself, receiving awards for his academic efforts, and completed his education in 1852.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{955558d6-6865-46ac-945d-b05fcb652df8}{243}\" paraid=\"367763058\">He returned home and began to help his father with the management of the family’s thriving commercial operations. Four years later, he took charge of the entire business. </p> <p paraeid=\"{955558d6-6865-46ac-945d-b05fcb652df8}{251}\" paraid=\"956371880\">Chávez was able to build on the fortune he inherited from his father because he adopted a sound, flexible commercial strategy. Diversification was crucial to his success. Chávez sold American and European manufactures, raised grains and sheep, shipped wool and precious metals, bought large amounts of merchandise, purchased real estate in New York City, and acted as a banker, commissioner, wholesaler, and retailer. He maintained economic relations with merchants in Liverpool and Manchester (England), New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, El Paso, Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, and Guadalajara. He established partnerships with other New Mexicans and was an intermediary between American and Mexican wholesalers. Although he was unable to organize Río Abajo freighters into an association to obtain government contracts, he did use funds from the United States quartermaster office to finance large purchases of merchandise. </p> <p paraeid=\"{1bd4ca0f-2f01-48ca-b934-381ee97cf549}{20}\" paraid=\"912226818\">Cautious, but not overly so, he regularly requested and received information on the prices of precious metals and commodities, among other investment opportunities. He often based his decisions on the advice he received from business associates in New York, St. Louis, and Mexico. His meticulous record-keeping ensured that losses due to carelessness and mistakes were kept to a minimum. He invested capital where he could receive the highest possible return, yet he appeared to have been generous with kin and friends to whom he often lent large sums of money. </p> <p paraeid=\"{1bd4ca0f-2f01-48ca-b934-381ee97cf549}{50}\" paraid=\"311393326\"> </p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{1bd4ca0f-2f01-48ca-b934-381ee97cf549}{54}\" paraid=\"1587755740\"><em>This story was adopted from the </em><a href=\"http://www.santafetrail.org/about-us/hall-of-fame/\">Santa Fe Trail Association’s Hall of Fame</a> <em>published in “SFTA Hall of Fame: Felipe Chávez.” (2015).</em><a href=\"https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/wagon_tracks/\">Wagon Tracks</a><em>, 30(1), p. 13. </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "<p paraeid=\"{cb1dfca3-ec08-4119-bbba-e80ea4f4a5cf}{161}\" paraid=\"255814884\">Many guides have left a lasting legacy over the last two centuries of exploration and tourism at Mammoth Cave. Ed Bishop began guiding tourists at Mammoth Cave in 1886, and within thirty years, had become one such guide.<br /> <br /> During Bishop’s career at Mammoth Cave both he and his employer likely purported Ed Bishop to be the great-nephew of deceased famous cave guide, Stephen Bishop. Decades later, there is no documentation to support this ancestry. While it seems more likely that this was a business tactic to capitalize on Stephen Bishop’s fame, the full story of this history remains unknown.</p> <p paraeid=\"{cb1dfca3-ec08-4119-bbba-e80ea4f4a5cf}{201}\" paraid=\"1060618067\">In 1893, Bishop married Josephine “Josie” Curd of Barren County, Kentucky. Their only child, Chancie, died in infancy. The short marriage ended with the death of Josie from tuberculosis. </p> <p paraeid=\"{cb1dfca3-ec08-4119-bbba-e80ea4f4a5cf}{231}\" paraid=\"682757877\">Bishop’s second marriage was to Miss Willie Lewis in March 1900. The marriage produced four children: Stephen, Maude, Tandy, and Anna. An accomplished explorer of Mammoth Cave, Bishop named four of his cave discoveries, Stephen’s Way, Maud’s Grotto, Tan’s Pit and Runt’s Dome after his children.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{cb1dfca3-ec08-4119-bbba-e80ea4f4a5cf}{249}\" paraid=\"1576564418\">After a sightseeing tour of Mammoth Cave in 1908, German cartographer Max Kaemper arranged to receive room and board in exchange for creating a detailed map of the cave. With Bishop serving as guide, the two explorers found many new discoveries and charted many previously unknown miles of the cave. Their exploits remain commemorated in the names of Kaemper Hall, Bishop’s Pit, and the Kaemper Map. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e910d05-f0a7-4db1-ad2e-b73c4bb8df5f}{26}\" paraid=\"1952889725\">Bishop resigned from his post as guide at Mammoth Cave and moved with his third wife, Dora English, to Illinois in 1917. That same year, Donna Bullock had been appointed in charge of business matters at the cave hotel. Subsequently, many of the employees’, some with decades of tenure, felt compelled to complain to trustee Albert. C. Janin about her unfair treatment of the guides. Although the map and many of the stories of exploration which Bishop had been a part of temporarily flickered into obscurity, his importance as a guide was not soon forgotten.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e910d05-f0a7-4db1-ad2e-b73c4bb8df5f}{84}\" paraid=\"1029665223\">In 1921, the Mammoth Cave business had a competitor. George Morrison began conducting tours of newly discovered passages via a new entrance which he had dug into an extension of Mammoth Cave. Morrison’s New Entrance Guidebook included a comment regarding Bishop: </p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{5e910d05-f0a7-4db1-ad2e-b73c4bb8df5f}{134}\" paraid=\"634328630\">\"The real guide was Ed Bishop. He instructed Hunt how to reach the New Discovery from the Cathedral Dome route and Hunt instructed Bob Lively, but during 1916 and 1917 it was necessary to wait for Bishop, to make the trip.” </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{5e910d05-f0a7-4db1-ad2e-b73c4bb8df5f}{146}\" paraid=\"524893543\">From Illinois, Bishop eventually moved to Indiana, his final home. After his death in 1931, his body was returned to Kentucky to be interred in an unmarked grave alongside his first wife Josie and their infant daughter Chancie.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e910d05-f0a7-4db1-ad2e-b73c4bb8df5f}{172}\" paraid=\"1572372974\">In due time, new discoveries were made at Mammoth Cave. These included the rediscovery of the Kaemper Map and its impressive representation of some thirty-five miles of the cave. Kaemper’s diary of the approximately eight-month-long Kaemper-Bishop saga of exploration was also located.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e910d05-f0a7-4db1-ad2e-b73c4bb8df5f}{212}\" paraid=\"217372568\">Bishop has been recognized as an integral part of the Mammoth Cave guide. In 2010, two headstones were purchased and set with money donated by Mammoth Cave guides and Cave Research Foundation members. One commemorates the short life of little Chancie. The other recognizes the lives of Ed and Josie Bishop and the thirty years that Bishop spent guiding and exploring in Mammoth Cave. </p>",

      "bodyText": "<h4>A former U.S. military officer stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, Gilbert Baker joined the San Francisco Gay Liberation Movement after his discharge. Baker went on to design and create the first Rainbow Pride Flag for San Francisco Gay Freedom Day. The activism and art of Gilbert Baker helped unify a community in the bay area and beyond.</h4> <hr /> <p><br /> Gilbert Baker was born on June 2nd, 1951 in Kansas. At an early age he found refuge in art but his parents discouraged him from pursuing this hobby. Baker wrote: <em>“But this, after all, was Kansas in 1956... Being an artist was bad in the same way that homosexuality was bad. When I first told my parents that I wanted to be an artist, they responded in extremely negative terms. It was as if I had told them I was also gay.” </em></p> <p paraeid=\"{0add5daf-50bc-41a5-b49c-f62314d9bea2}{82}\" paraid=\"2039532484\">His parents relented a bit when Baker won a school art contest with a scholarship to an art academy. Even with his love for art and music, Baker was not happy in Kansas. Baker saw a way out when he was drafted into the army on his 19th birthday in June 1970. A sergeant heavily questioned Baker during his induction process. He began the sexuality screening process by asking, “Are you a homosexual?” Baker responded by saying “no”-- a lie he was used to telling. The sergeant responded, “Are you sure? You sound like one.” Baker continued to deny it, as the sergeant threatened him with dis-honorable discharge and homophobic slurs. Baker maintained his composer and the sergeant finally signed off on the bottom of his form.</p> <p paraeid=\"{0add5daf-50bc-41a5-b49c-f62314d9bea2}{131}\" paraid=\"1930382969\">Gilbert Baker’s experience only got worse however. During basic training he was subject to more homophobic harassment from superior officers. One day after failing to hit the target on the firing range, the drill sergeant removed Baker from the group and put a watermelon in front of his target. He shot at the melon until it exploded and explained that this is what happens to gay people in the army: “they die”. After this experience, and more threats he was fed up. One morning he refused to carry a weapon, and demanded discharge as a conscientious objector. His colonel accused him of treason. The staff sergeant called Baker into his office and strongly suggested that he become a medic instead. Baker agreed and was sent to a medic training. He excelled in his courses and eventually became a nurse.</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{0add5daf-50bc-41a5-b49c-f62314d9bea2}{221}\" paraid=\"142028131\"><em><strong>“I was assigned to barracks built on the sandy shores of the bay. My cubicle had a window with an unobstructed view of the Golden Gate Bridge.” </strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{0add5daf-50bc-41a5-b49c-f62314d9bea2}{227}\" paraid=\"1300284787\">Gilbert Baker moved into the military barracks at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/index.htm\">Presidio in 1970</a>. He spent his week days working as a medic in Oakland: collecting urine and blood samples for testing from soldiers returning from Vietnam. In his off time, he was with another soldier, a friend. Jim, lived in the same barracks and also worked as a medic in the same facility as Baker. The pair become fast friends: <em>“walking across the Golden Gate Bridge or hiking to the top of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/marin-headlands.htm\">Marin Headlands</a> just to take in its breathtaking sights”</em> Together they explored the forest and beaches of the Presidio and different neighborhoods in the city. The pair soon fell in love but Jim was afraid of being caught. After completing their nursing programs they were sent to different hospitals: Jim went to Okinawa and Baker was stationed in San Francisco.</p> <p paraeid=\"{020140f6-a212-44c5-9c16-781bb0fa4d2b}{82}\" paraid=\"1810116358\"><em>“I dreamed about him every night. A while later, I heard from a friend that Jim had gotten married and gone back to Tennessee. I cried, but I wasn't going to go back into the closet and get married like him. I was not going to lie about being gay anymore. Falling in love with Jim had changed me. The power of love opened my closet door.” </em>Gilbert Baker came out to his family, and they disowned him.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c12db3ad-7fff-9f93-08bf-c072908456db\"><img height=\"397\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rmiB8_eHzwzX9WFmBW50E8oZBTHO7mOYX7oMxBBnWd-cqXYIoZ1IBG0h7SGNqV_bqur_h_DwA1pgsvvltueDeo3UUhkk9MmDIRfNZcHXE4dzOck8eX-nirk0lX7UaPfZQA\" width=\"259\" /></b></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em><sub><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c12db3ad-7fff-9f93-08bf-c072908456db\">Image Description: Gilbert Baker looks at the camera wearing glasses and a military uniform. </b><br /> <b>Image Credit: Photo courtesy of Patricia Baker</b></sub></em></p> <p>He was able to avoid detection for the remainder of his military service and was honorably discharged in February 1972. He stayed in San Francisco and joined the Gay Liberation Movement. He volunteered at the San Francisco Gay Community Center describing it as <em>“the nerve center of the gay revolution.”</em> He found his home in the graphics committee and with this team, created banners and signs for the center’s protests and marches. In 1975, Gilbert Baker met activist, <a href=\"https://ir.usembassy.gov/bringing-people-hope-harvey-milk-gay-rights-movement-america/\">Harvey Milk</a>. Milk had also served in the military but unlike Baker, was dishonorably discharge because of his sexuality. In 1977, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay person to be elected into public office. In celebration, the activists around Baker implored him to create a new symbol for the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{020140f6-a212-44c5-9c16-781bb0fa4d2b}{154}\" paraid=\"1175930393\"><em><strong>“We all felt that we needed something that was positive, that celebrated our love.” </strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{020140f6-a212-44c5-9c16-781bb0fa4d2b}{162}\" paraid=\"1047538549\">Baker became inspired by flags and the connections they had to identity, nationhood and revolution. He decided on a rainbow, to represent the magic and diversity of his community. With the $1,000 given to him by the Gay Freedom Day Parade Committee, Gilbert Baker and a team of his friends created two 60 x 30 feet Rainbow Flags, for The Gay Freedom Day Parade on June 25th 1978.</p> <blockquote> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{548bb1ea-4804-4866-aca0-605d956c08cf}{29}\" paraid=\"411724864\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><em><strong>“As we carried it down the street... A bizarre barrage of glittering coins flew all around us, some splashing onto the street. Drag queens approached and spread flowers in front of our footsteps. All of these people understood what we had worked so hard to create and what it was all about. We laughed until we cried.” </strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{020140f6-a212-44c5-9c16-781bb0fa4d2b}{209}\" paraid=\"1384701550\">On November 27, 1978 Harvey Milk was assassinated. Harvey Milk drafted a living will ten days after he was elected to office in 1977. He said, <em>“If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.“</em> Thousands gathered at city hall to grieve this tremendous loss. The tragedy continued when Milk’s murderer got the lightest possible sentencing. Hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people increased. Baker was attacked on the streets of San Francisco, when he reported it to the police, they laughed.</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{020140f6-a212-44c5-9c16-781bb0fa4d2b}{227}\" paraid=\"1821028453\"><strong><em>“I remember what Harvey had said about giving them hope. I planned to sew up hundreds of new Rainbow Flags to make the event colorful at a time when everybody was ready to paint it black. I wanted to show the world we would survive.” </em></strong></p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{020140f6-a212-44c5-9c16-781bb0fa4d2b}{233}\" paraid=\"1145268286\">In the wake of these tragedies, Baker wanted to make the 1979 Gay Freedom Day Parade bigger than ever with hundreds of Rainbow Flags. He could not achieve this feat on his own, so he commissioned a local flag company called <strong>Paramount Flags</strong> to help create four hundred Rainbow Flags to line the streets during the parade. After the 1979 parade the popularity of the Rainbow Flag only continued. The flag company was selling out and homes across <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/collectives-enclaves-and-gayborhoods-the-castro-ca.htm?utm_source=article&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=experience_more&utm_content=large\">The Castro</a> were decorated with rainbow. Baker wrote,</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{fc3cde14-63ec-4ae6-b003-42706bbd6dde}{5}\" paraid=\"1187622389\"><em><strong>“For many, this purchase was a coming-out, telling the world who they were… no patent or copyright could be issued, as all flag designs are in the public domain. It didn’t bother me.”</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{fc3cde14-63ec-4ae6-b003-42706bbd6dde}{5}\" paraid=\"1187622389\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-e26a0dff-7fff-d276-7799-64e0fa5e6589\"><img height=\"353\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R6rQY-HCXuSvkKHth44IU_4xz6ISjxPwqHYyvULx1l7vNuImcgLXNksUMcSQ0NWU8L7geI2_UbhXjvU-cyKQzqNu7jrrwlpBP-54ShazKlObUJqWBuxF0OzTGAe50cX6cA\" width=\"624\" /></b></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><sub><em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-e26a0dff-7fff-d276-7799-64e0fa5e6589\">Image Description: A hand dyed Rainbow Flag by Gilbert Baker that was presented to President Barack Obama.</b></em></sub><br /> <sub><em><b>Image Credit: The Barack Obama Presidential Library</b></em></sub></p> <p paraeid=\"{fc3cde14-63ec-4ae6-b003-42706bbd6dde}{5}\" paraid=\"1187622389\">Gilbert Baker continued to use drag and art as his tools for political activism. He joined local drag groups to call attention to discrimination and homophobia. He also got a job with Paramount Flags doing their window displays. He created flags and displays for the mayoral inauguration, state receptions and diplomatic visits, including the <strong>1984 Democratic National Convention</strong> in San Francisco.  While his career was thriving, he faced extreme hardship in his personal life. The HIV epidemic was inescapable for the LGBTQ+ community. Baker was losing many friends to the virus and the grief weighed heavy. Baker threw himself into his activism, but his extreme and often controversial efforts lost him work with the state. Baker slipped into a serious depression.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1f337923-66e7-4572-b34b-8b9bd46c1fcd}{209}\" paraid=\"106677947\">In 1994 he emerged again for the 25th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ston/index.htm\">Stonewall Riot.</a> Baker reconnected with former collaborator: Cleve Jones and joined The Stonewall 25 Planning Committee  to come up with something BIG. Together they created the longest rainbow flag in history at 1mile long. For over a year he navigated corporate partnerships, community infighting, and city permits. While living in New York Baker joined <strong>ACT UP</strong>: AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. He wrote, “ACT UP made art out of civil disobedience.” The goal was for the Parade to go down prominent 5th Avenue. However, the city of New York pushed the parade to 1st Avenue, a much quieter location. This was unacceptable to the community. So, at the end of the sanctioned Pride Parade on 1st Ave, Baker and his friends cut ten long pieces of the Rainbow Flag and brought them to 5th Avenue where ACT UP was hosting a counter pride march as protest. This display of civil disobedience was a true celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. The event made national news and brought the pride flag into the mainstream.  </p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{3c5e4fc3-d678-40b4-9d06-bf3f28e040eb}{61}\" paraid=\"393010894\"><em><strong>“A true flag is not something you can really design. A true flag is torn from the soul of the people... The Rainbow Flag is like other flags in that sense: it belongs to the people.“</strong></em> </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{3c5e4fc3-d678-40b4-9d06-bf3f28e040eb}{67}\" paraid=\"1499001627\">For the remainder of his life, Gilbert Baker pushed boundaries and gender norms. When Marriage Equality was legalized, historic places around the world were lit up in rainbow, including the White House. In 2016, Gilbert Baker was invited to the White House to personally present President Barack Obama with a small hand dyed Rainbow Flag.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c5e4fc3-d678-40b4-9d06-bf3f28e040eb}{89}\" paraid=\"1330147789\">On March 31, 2017 he passed away at 65 years old.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c5e4fc3-d678-40b4-9d06-bf3f28e040eb}{89}\" paraid=\"1330147789\"><strong>Citation:</strong> </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c5e4fc3-d678-40b4-9d06-bf3f28e040eb}{130}\" paraid=\"876048980\">Baker, Gilbert. Rainbow Warrior: My Life in Color.

His community only learned of his transition after his passing in 1936. Jack Bee Garland spent much of his life devoted to social work and taking care of others.</p> <h4 paraeid=\"{9185d5b4-4e00-42ed-a442-136007698233}{201}\" paraid=\"235825409\">Early Life </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9185d5b4-4e00-42ed-a442-136007698233}{207}\" paraid=\"1458027183\">Jack Bee Garland was born on December 9th, 1869 in San Francisco, California. His father, Jose Marcos Mugarrieta, served in the Mexican Army and became a teacher. His mother, Eliza Alice Denny Garland, was daughter of Rice Garland, a Congressman from Louisiana. As a child Garland gravitated towards toys designed for boys and befriended boys at school. At sixteen, Jose Mugarrieta passed away. Garland wrote, <em>“Shortly after this I commenced to grow rebellious[...] Oh, if I were but a boy! Just to be able to see all those beautiful things! What would I not have given?”</em> Soon Garland began to wear men’s clothing.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{2}\" paraid=\"1486961315\">Jack Bee Garland moved to Stockton California and was arrested in 1897 for impersonating a male. When questioned about his choice in clothing and who he was spending his time with, he said, <em>“I have always found it a good plan to attend strictly to my own business.”</em> There were no laws at the time in Stockton around articles of clothing, so Garland was free to go. Many newspapers wrote about the arrest, making him well known in the community. He lived on a houseboat and soon began working as a journalist for The Evening Mail in Stockton. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{20}\" paraid=\"1416509424\">In 1903, Police Ordinance No. 819 was approved, “Prohibiting the Wearing of Apparel of Opposite Sex: Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of any person to appear, upon any public highway, in the dress, clothing or apparel not belonging to or usually worn by persons of his or her sex.” </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{32}\" paraid=\"1567537537\">Spanish and Philippine War  </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{44}\" paraid=\"1159158141\">In April 1898 the United States declared war against Spain. This war was fought over the Spanish colonies of Cuba and the Philippines. Before the war the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/spanish-american-war-a-splendid-little-war.htm\"> Presidio of San Francisco</a> was a military outpost, but this conflict turned it into an army base. The war with the Spanish ended by December of the same year, and while the United States granted Cuba its freedom, it retained the Philippines as its own colony. The Philippines fought against the United States to become a free nation. The first unit to fight overseas left from the Presidio, and by the end of the war almost 80,000 military personnel would come through the Presidio on their way to the Philippines.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{63}\" paraid=\"1913135319\">Women were not able to fight in the war. Garland wanted to contribute, despite how he was born. In October of 1899 the 29th Infantry left for Manila on a ship called “City of Para”. The boat carried military personnel, rations, ammunition, medical supplies. Garland worked on the ship and was beloved by the other crew members. The crew was required to get vaccinations. In fear of becoming ill and getting discovered, Garland disclosed his identity to the ship captain. He was escorted off the boat when it arrived in Honolulu.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{95}\" paraid=\"719816313\">Garland was able to make friends with other newspaper journalists and maintain his friendships with other crew and soldiers on The Para. He wrote, <em>“I had been put ashore in Honolulu, but only after officers and men and members of the ship’s company had encouraged me, if no other way offered of getting to Manila, to stow away again on the Para – and that was just what I did.”  </em></p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{105}\" paraid=\"1827052731\">Garland had the help of his friends on the boat to provide him with uniforms to blend in, food as he stowed away from the captain, and safe exit from the ship when they arrived in Manila. Shortly after arriving in Manila, Garland was arrested by military police. He explained that the reason he wore men’s clothing was to better fulfill his duties as a newspaper correspondent for<em> The San Francisco Chronicle</em>. Since there was no law in California or Manila around what clothing someone wore, the military allowed Garland to go freely.  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{115}\" paraid=\"414136195\">Post War, San Francisco </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{125}\" paraid=\"1340190903\">Garland got an up-close perspective of the war. He served with the Red Cross to aide soldiers after of the most challenging battles. Garland was admired for his fearlessness and was referred to as “Lieutenant Jack”. The soldiers in his unit even pooled their money to give Jack Garland a gold medal. After 10 months in the Philippines, Garland boarded transport back to San Francisco in August 1900.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{145}\" paraid=\"698460827\">Twenty-two days later, Garland arrive in San Francisco. The war ended in March 1901 when the United States succeeded in squashing the revolution and colonizing the Philippines. The 29th Infantry arrived at the Presidio in San Francisco the following month and were welcomed home by their old friend Jack Bee Garland. On May 10th the men were mustered out of the service at the Presidio, getting their final payments. </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{171}\" paraid=\"1472746303\">1906 Earthquake </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{177}\" paraid=\"786476301\">Jack Bee Garland got an apartment in San Francisco and continued to work as a journalist. He was incredibly passionate about the issues of poverty and homelessness in the city. He often provided money, food, and lodging to people in need. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{183}\" paraid=\"105963437\">On April 18, 1906, an earthquake shook San Francisco and tremendous fires overtook the city. The army took over the task of rationing food, tents, blankets and more. Of the 400,000 people living in San Francisco at the time, 250,000 became homeless in three days. Seventy thousand people camped in the Presidio, while others found open space around the city. Garland, at age thirty-seven, worked again as a male nurse with the Red Cross. Many were injured and more were sick from lack of shelter and warmth. Jack Garland was acknowledged by <strong>General Funston</strong> for his contributions and tremendous support to the relief effort. </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{201}\" paraid=\"1739351760\">Legacy </h4> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{207}\" paraid=\"1053970119\">Jack Bee Garland continued his life as a journalist and philanthropist until he suddenly collapsed on the sidewalk in San Francisco in 1936 at the age of sixty-six. He was rushed to the hospital and treated for intrabdominal lesions. Friends visited him at the hospital, calling him “Uncle Jack”. He died the next day. It was only during his autopsy that many people learned of his transition. The press disclosed his identity, and his family and friends were bombarded with questions.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{223}\" paraid=\"1404616613\">The day after his death his friend Mary Haines asked the War Department to have Garland buried in the Presidio with military honors for his work as a solider. Since no records existed of his service, the request was denied. Garland was buried in an unmarked grave in a cemetery near family.   <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bc5d1e9-5ddf-4886-b672-0ff91f60834e}{231}\" paraid=\"1764785829\">Source: Sullivan, Louis. From Female to Male: The Life of Jack Bee Garland.

      "bodyText": "<p>John Gross Barnard was born in Sheffield, Massachusetts, on May 19, 1815. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1833. He was second in a class of forty-three members. As one of the top graduating cadets of his class, he was posted as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, embarking on a 48-year career in that branch.</p> <p>Throughout his career he served on many garrison and fortification details, most notably participating in the construction for defenses in New York City, New Orleans, and Pensacola. During the Mexican War, he led the construction of United States Defenses at Tampico.</p> <p>With the outbreak of the Civil War, General Barnard served as Chief Engineer to General Mcdowell in the Firt Bull Run Campaign. Next, with the rank of Brigadier-General, he acted as the Chief Engineer to the Army of the Potomac in the Virginia peninsular, serving Major General George B. McCellan. When the confederate army advanced into Virginia, he was appointed Chief Engineer of the Civil War Defenses of Washington, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of Engineers in March 1863.</p> <p>In Barnard's <em>A</em> <em>Report on the Defenses of Washington,</em> published after the Civil War<em>,</em> he commented on the complexity and everchanging nature of the project:</p> <blockquote>\"From a few isolated works covering bridges or commanding a few especially important points, was developed a connected system of fortification by which every prominent point, at intervals of 800 to 1,000 yards, was occupied by an inclosed field-fort every important approach or depression of ground, unseen from the forts, swept by a battery for field-guns, and the whole connected by rifle-trenches which were in fact lines of infantry parapet, furnishing emplacement for two ranks of men and affording covered communication along the line, while roads were opened wherever necessary, so that troops and artillery could be moved rapidly from one point of the immense periphery to another, or under cover, from point to point along the line.\"</blockquote> <p>In 1864, he was appointed Chief Engineer, and was on the staff of General Grant in the Richmond campaign. He was made Major General at the end of the Civil War for \"gallant and meritorious services in the field,\" and was promoted to Chief Engineer of the Corps of Engineers December 28, 1865. Although he was promoted to full rank Colonel of Engineers, upon General Totten's death, he asked that the nomination be withdrawn. He served out his career as Chief Regular Army Engineer until his retirement in 1881.</p> <p>Brevat Major General Barnard died in Detroit, Michigan on May 14, 1882.</p>",
