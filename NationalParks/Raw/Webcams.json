Locomotives awaiting light-duty maintenance and repairs were moved from yard tracks onto the turntable. The turntable operator would then use controls to operate the electric motors that powered the turntable to rotate, aligning the turntable tracks with those for an available maintenance bay in the roundhouse. When servicing and minor repairs were complete, the locomotive would back onto the aligned turntable, and be rotated to return to revenue service or await a new assignment.",
