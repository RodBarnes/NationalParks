            "bodyText": "<p>Ethel Carow Roosevelt Derby was the youngest daughter of Theodore and Edith Roosevelt. Ethel was instrumental in preserving both the legacy of her father as well as the family home, Sagamore Hill, for future generations.<br /> <br /> As a child, Ethel and her older brother Kermit would have fun getting into trouble but with her two younger brothers, Archie and Quentin, she acted as assistant mother. When her father became president in 1901, she often assisted her mother by placing meal orders and delegating tasks to the staff.<br /> <br /> Ethel kept a low profile and did not enjoy the attention as much as her half-sister, Alice Roosevelt did. While living in Washington D.C., Ethel attended school at the National Cathedral. Ethel had her debut and coming out party in the White House on December 28, 1908, shortly before her father left office. She was 17 at the time of her debut, one-year shy of the typical age that most women debuted. Since the family was preparing to leave Washington, D.C., this would be last opportunity for Ethel to debut while living at a very prestigious address.<br /> <br /> Upon returning to Oyster Bay, Ethel met and married Dr. Richard Derby, a surgeon. They had two children, Richard Jr. and Edith, by the time WWI broke out. She was the first of the Roosevelt children to go overseas during WWI. Ethel became a nurse and volunteered to serve in France during World War I. She worked in the American Ambulance Hospital, where her husband, Richard Derby, served as a surgeon.<br /> <br /> Also during the war, Ethel became involved with the Red Cross and continued volunteering for the organization for six decades. When Ethel was to have her family portrait painted, she chose to be painted wearing her Red Cross uniform instead of a more traditional evening gown and jewels.<br /> <br /> Upon returning to the United States with her husband after WWI, they had two more children, Sarah and Judith.  All the children were raised in Oyster Bay, where Ethel was regarded as a church and community leader earning her the nickname \"Queen of Oyster Bay\". Ethel also served as Nassau County Chairperson for the Red Cross and Chairperson of the Nassau County Nursing Service.<br /> <br /> Ethel was very close to her parents and remained at the center of the family even after her mother, Edith, died in 1948. She also donated considerable time and energy to organizations such as Christ Episcopal Church in downtown Oyster Bay and worked to secure low-income housing in the area because she was aware of the discrimination faced by African Americans in Oyster Bay.<br /> <br /> Ethel was a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which her grandfather, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., had helped to found in 1869. Conscious of her family’s role in history, Ethel worked assiduously to turn Sagamore Hill into a museum.<br /> <br /> Ethel also assisted the National Audubon Society with the creation of the Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center on Long Island to help carry on her father’s interest in the natural world.<br /> <br /> Ethel Roosevelt Derby died in 1977 at age 85. She is buried alongside her husband and her parents at Youngs Cemetery in Oyster Bay, N.Y.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>“…Corporal Robert Sutton was… in all respects the ablest… the wisest man in our ranks… His comprehension of the whole problem of slavery was more thorough and far-reaching than that of any abolitionist… it was his methods of thought which always impressed me chiefly: superficial brilliancy he left to others, and grasped at the solid truth.”<sup>1</sup><br /> -Thomas W. Higginson, Colonel, 1st South Carolina Infantry (African Descent)</em><br /> <br /> Robert Sutton was born into slavery on the Alberti Plantation along Florida’s northeastern boundary with Georgia. According to Sutton, many years of his life in bondage consisted of sailing the Saint Mary’s River for the purpose of “lumbering and piloting” for his enslavers, who established themselves in the small village of Woodstock Mills - a steam powered sawmill which was run by 52 enslaved people, including Robert Sutton and his family. Sutton’s escape to freedom in the latter half of 1862 rested solely in his resilience, intelligence, and knowledge of the terrain before him. In a crafted “dugout” canoe, the tall Floridian made his way to Federal lines, and ultimately to the confines of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/reer/planyourvisit/camp-saxton.htm\">Camp Saxton</a> where he enlisted in the 1st South Carolina Infantry - an all Black regiment which was raised along the Beaufort River by Colonel Thomas W. Higginson. It was here that Sutton, as well as approximately 1,000 other recruits, received the training that would allow them to become an effective fighting force in a war for the freedom of approximately four million people.<br /> <br /> On January 1, 1863, or Emancipation Day, the 1st South Carolina, along with approximately 3,000 other formerly enslaved people from the Sea Islands and Beaufort County region, assembled at Camp Saxton for a reading of President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. As Colonel Higginson presented the color-guard with the regimental colors, Sutton made a few points to the attentive crowd. According to Harriet Ware, a Bostonian missionary who was present, Sutton “…told them there was not one in that crowd but had sister, brother, or some relation among the rebels still; that all was not done because they were so happily off, that they should not be content till all their people were as well off…”<sup>2</sup> Sutton spoke from a place of familiarity, as he had a wife and child confined to the shackles of slavery. Sutton’s pre-enlistment experiences are what drove him to encourage an expedition to his former enslaver’s plantation - a site which could also, in turn, supply the Federal force with an abundance of lumber. Little more than three weeks after Emancipation Day, Sutton, as well as the rest of the 1st South Carolina, had an opportunity to put their training to the test. As Higginson later described, “The whole history of the Department of the South had been defined as ‘a military picnic,’ and now we were to take our share of the entertainment.”<sup>3</sup><br /> <br /> On January 23, 1863, the regiment set sail down the Beaufort River toward Saint Mary’s River - approximately 120 miles South. A week later, the regiment had orders to retrieve supplies from a brickyard, ultimately to strengthen the defenses of nearby Fort Clinch. The Colonel mentioned that the objective was “near Woodstock, the former home of Corporal Sutton; he was ready and eager to pilot us up the river…”<sup>4</sup> That evening, the regiment moved toward Sutton’s former site of enslavement and arrived on the morning of January 30. Colonel Higginson dispatched two companies of his regiment to the small village to secure the area while he prepared the remainder of the regiment to land. Higginson later recalled his observations when he reached the shoreline:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“The chief house, a pretty one with picturesque outbuildings, was that of Mrs. Alberti, who owned the mills and lumber-wharves adjoining… There was lumber enough to freight half a dozen steamers… I called on Mrs. Alberti, who received me in quite a stately way at her own door with ‘To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit, Sir?’ … I wished to present my credentials; so, calling up my companion, I said that I believed she had been previously acquainted with Corporal Robert Sutton? I never saw a finer bit of unutterable indignation than came over the face of my hostess, as she slowly recognized him. She drew herself up, and dropped out the monosyllables of her answer as if they were so many drops of nitric acid. ‘Ah,’ quoth my lady, ‘we called him Bob!’</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It was a group for a painter. The whole drama of the war seemed to reverse itself in an instant, and my tall, well-dressed, imposing, philosophic Corporal dropped down the immeasurable depth into a mere plantation ‘Bob’ again… he simply turned from the lady, touched his hat to me, and asked if I would wish to see the slave-jail, as he had the keys in his possession…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I must say that, when the door of that villainous edifice was thrown open before me, I felt glad that my main interview with its lady proprietor had passed before I saw it. It was a small building, like a Northern corn-barn, and seemed to have as prominent and as legitimate a place among the outbuildings of the establishment. In the middle of the door was a large staple with a rusty chain, like an ox-chain, for fastening a victim down…We found also three pairs of stocks of various construction, two of which had smaller as well as larger holes, evidently for the feet of women or children… I remember the unutterable loathing with which I leaned against the door of that prison-house; I had thought myself seasoned to any conceivable horrors of slavery, but it seemed as if the visible presence of that den of sin would choke me. Of course it would have been burned to the ground by us, but that this would have involved the sacrifice of every other building and all the piles of lumber, and for the moment it seemed as if the sacrifice would be righteous. But I forbore, and only took as trophies the instruments of torture and the keys of the jail.”<sup>5</sup></p> <p><br /> The regimental surgeon, Dr. Seth Rogers, mentioned later that Mrs. Alberti attempted to explain away the treatment of the enslaved people on her property, or in his words, she “…spent much time trying to convince me that she and her husband had been wonderfully devoted to the interests of their slaves, especially to the fruitless work of trying to educate them. The truth of these assertions was disproved by certain facts, such as a strong slave jail, containing implements of torture which we now have in our possession, (the lock I have), the fact that the slaves have ‘mostly gone to the Yankees,’ and yet other fact that Robert Sutton, a former slave there, said the statement was false. The statement of a Black man was lawful in Dixie yesterday.”<sup>6</sup> The 1st South Carolina returned to the shores of Port Royal on February 2, at which point Colonel Higginson and Dr. Rogers visited the commanding General’s quarters “and laid before him the keys and shackles of the slave-prison, with my report of the good conduct of the men…” This action resonated with the officers of the regiment, as their expedition proved to be a success in paving the way for future factions of African American troops.<br /> <br /> Higginson later reflected on this first campaign in his memoirs with a sense of fondness and optimism: “For a year after our raid the Upper St. Mary's remained unvisited, till in 1864 the large force with which we held Florida secured peace upon its banks; then Mrs. Alberti took the oath of allegiance, the Government bought her remaining lumber… By a strange turn of fortune, Corporal Sutton (now Sergeant) was at this time in jail at Hilton Head, under sentence of court-martial for an alleged act of mutiny, an affair in which the general voice of our officers sustained him and condemned his accusers, so that he soon received a full pardon, and was restored in honor to his place in the regiment, which he has ever since held.”<sup>7</sup><br /> <br /> The accusations against Sutton on the grounds of mutiny were ultimately rescinded. His reputation and war record had reflected an honorable profile which was mirrored in the words of Dr. Seth Rogers, written at the conclusion of the 1st South Carolina Infantry’s first active campaign in 1863: “I have rarely reverenced a man more than I do him… He ought to be a leader, a general, instead of a corporal. I fancy he is like Toussaint l’ Ouverture and it would not surprise me if some great occasion should make him a deliverer of his people from bondage.”<sup>8</sup><br /> <br /> <sup>1</sup> Higginson, Thomas W.

On April 19, 1775 Captain David Brown defended what was dear to him: land, home, family. Horrifyingly, it was all within sight of the deadly contest at Concord’s North Bridge. <h4><b>Early Life</b></h4> <p>David Brown was born in Concord in 1732 to Ephraim Brown and Hannah Wilson. The Brown family were among the earliest English residents of the town of Concord. David’s great grandfather, Thomas Brown, purchased the farm, where David grew up and lived, in 1644.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> David inherited the property in 1750 after the death of his father Ephraim. Sometime between 1750 and 1768 David demolished the old house that stood since the mid-1600s and built a new house “49 feet southwest of where the old house stood.”<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a> In all, the farm included a 20 acre house lot and 80 acres of various land parcels throughout Concord’s North Quarter.<a href=\"#_edn3\">[iii]</a><br /> <br /> In 1756 David married Abigail Munro of Lexington. By 1775 their family included nine children. The oldest, Purchase, was 18 years old and the youngest, Reuben, was 2. A tenth child, Joseph, was born in 1776. The household also included David’s brother Elias who was deemed “incapable of managing any business.”<a href=\"#_edn4\">[iv]</a><br /> <br /> Like most adult male property owners, David was active in town affairs. Among the many offices he held were surveyor of highways, tythingman and constable. He even served on Concord’s Board of Selectmen from 1767-1770. He was also, quite often, paid for work on the highways, the “Great North Bridge” and the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/places/the-groton-road.htm\">causeway</a> on the west side. These last two he helped to build and to maintain over the years.<a href=\"#_edn5\">[v]</a></p> <h4><b>American Revolution before April 1775</b></h4> The crisis that would lead to war with Great Britain in 1775 and independence in 1776 was slow in coming to Concord. In early 1774 the town first voted to ban the consumption of tea in their homes in protest of the Tea Act.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> Prior to this vote the town was fairly quiet, but as the year 1774 progressed the people of Concord would be pulled further into the crisis.<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a> As the crisis deepened David Brown emerged as a leader in the town’s efforts to resist the British Parliament and secure their rights as Englishmen.<br /> <br /> On November 21, 1774 the town of Concord voted to join the Continental Association, a total boycott of trade items from Great Britain recommended by the 1<sup>st</sup> Continental Congress. An essential part of implementing the association was for local towns and communities to establish committees of inspection “to see to the punctual observance” of the boycott. The town elected David Brown, along with James Barrett, Joseph Hosmer, Jonas Heywood and Abijah Bond, to serve on the committee.<a href=\"#_edn3\">[iii]</a>  The town also recommended that anyone discovered in violation of the boycott “should be treated with neglect and detestation.”<a href=\"#_edn4\">[iv]</a><br /> <br /> In January of 1775 David Brown was chosen to serve on a town Committee of Safety, the purpose of which was to “suppress all riots, tumults and disorders in said town, and to aid and assist all untainted magistrates who have not been aiding and assisting in bringing on a new mode of government on this Province, in the execution of the laws of this Province upon all offenders against the same.”<a href=\"#_edn5\">[v]</a><br /> <br /> That same month, the town began recruiting men to serve as minute men, volunteer soldiers who would be ready “at a minute’s warning.” David Brown, in his capacity as a lieutenant in the town’s militia, was appointed to a committee, to inspect the newly enlisted minute men in Concord. The committee found 15 recruits without guns and would need to be provided by the town.<a href=\"#_edn6\">[vi]</a> The town also agreed that the minute men should turn out to “learn the art military” (drill) “two half day[s] in a week, 3 hours in each half day.” They would be paid “one shilling and four pence” for each half day..<a href=\"#_edn7\">[vii]</a><br /> <br /> By early April, the town had two companies of minute mennumbering 50 men each., David Brown, now a captain, commanded one company and Captain Charles Miles the other. Among the minute men serving under Captain David Brown’s command were his son, Purchase, and nephew, Jonas.<a href=\"#_edn8\">[viii]</a>   <h4><b>April 19, 1775</b></h4> <p>On the early morning of April 19, 1775 the town of Concord was woken sometime between 1 and 2 a.m. ”by ye ringing of ye bells.”, according to the town’s minister, Reverend William Emerson, The dreaded moment had come. Dr. Samuel Prescott reported that a large number of British regular soldiers were out and likely headed for Concord. Concord was a target because it served as one of the Provincial Congress’ “principle magazines” and thus held a large quantity of military stores.<br /> <br /> One can easily imagine the thoughts going through David’s mind as he and his wife Abigail awoke to the sound of church bells and prepared for a day of potentially dangerous military duty. As an officer commanding a minute company Brown likely had his arms and equipment ready for immediate use. Thus he took his equipment, crossed over the North bridge and made his way into town.<br /> <br /> After several hours of nervous waiting, a mounted scout reported shots fired in Lexington. Soon after the column of British soldiers finally arrived between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> By that time, the minute men from Concord and Lincoln were deployed about a mile east of the town center at the end of a ridge overlooking Meriam’s Corner.<br /> <br /> When they caught sight of the British column they fell back in an orderly fashion through town and over the North Bridge. In their retreat they would have passed close by David Brown’s house and family as they made their way to Punkatasset Hill to await reinforcements expected from other towns. 230 British soldiers followed soon after. A party of them continued west to the farm of Colonel James Barrett to search for military stores while another group, about 96 men, stayed and guarded the bridge and road and kept watch on the growing number of rebels.<br /> <br /> Sometime before 9:00 am the assembled minute man and militia companies advanced from Punkatasset Hill to a lower elevation significantly closer to North Bridge. They formed in a pasture, known since as the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/places/the-muster-field.htm\">Muster Field</a>, owned by David Brown. He was within sight of his home. There is even some evidence that British soldiers entered the home and did some damage. A mirror that once belonged to David and Abigail, now in the collection of Concord Museum, still bears the scars of vandalism. The glass is smashed out except for a small sliver at one corner.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> It is unknown if Abigail or any of the younger children were at home when this happened. Her anxiety must have been great knowing that her own husband, son and nephew were in harms way that morning.<br /> <br /> About 9:00 a.m., with smoke rising ominously from Concord, the colonial officers in the Muster Field decided to advance to the North Bridge and save the town from being destroyed. As the colonial soldiers began their march to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/concord-s-north-bridge.htm\">North Bridge</a>, Captain Brown’s company marched in column behind a minute company from Acton commanded by Captain Isaac Davis<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a>. The British soldiers pulled back to the east side of the bridge and began pulling up the planks. This action caused the colonists to quicken their own pace. Three shots soon rang out from the British side, followed by a ragged volley which impacted the advancing colonial column. Captain Davis was killed along with a private from his company, Abner Hosmer. The colonists returned fire and 12 British soldiers were hit, 3 of them fatally. The British then broke and retreated to Concord.<br /> <br /> Among the colonial wounded was Jonas Brown, David’s nephew. It was a slight wound near his neck which he dismissed with light language as his mother attended him. She warned him that an inch closer and that ball would’ve killed him. To this he replied, “And an inch t’other way and t’wouldn’t have touched me!”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> Shortly after noon the British began their long, return march to Boston.<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a> Captain Brown’s company very likely joined in the pursuit.</p> <h4><b>Post April 1775 Military Service</b></h4> <p>The details of David Brown’s service later in the war are sparse. In May of 1775 he was paid 11 shillings by the town of Concord for “his son Purchase being a minute man…”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> He was also paid by the Province for 6 weeks service, December, 1775-January 1776. The record does not specify where he served, although the main theater of war at that time was the environs surrounding Boston. Brown was also credited for 8 months service but the year is not given. His son, Purchase, however, served as a private in Col. Nixon’s Regiment during the Siege of Boston. David was also paid in September 1777 for conveying stores from Boston to Concord then returning “with empty teams” to Roxbury.<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]<br /> <br /> <b style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem;\">Life After the War</b></a></p> <p>During and after the war, David Brown remained active in town government. He served as a member of the town’s Committee of Correspondence from 1776-1783. In 1781 he was elected to represent Concord at the Massachusetts Great and General Court. In 1789 he unsuccessfully ran for State Senate.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a><br /> <br /> In 1794 a group of Concord men formed the “Social Circle.” The purpose of this group was “To strengthen the Social affections and disseminate useful communications among its members.” A regular practice of this group was to publish biographies of its members after their death. David Brown, an active member, died in 1802. His biography appeared in Volume 1 of “Social Circle Memoirs” by John Shepard Keyes. The biography includes an interesting anecdote about David Brown that points to the importance of the events of April 19, 1775 in his life. “…the brave Captain never crossed alone to the causeway to the North Bridge after dark, on his way to and from the market, without singing at the top of his lusty voice some good old psalm tune, that would ring out in the night, and wake many a sleeper in the village. Perhaps to lay the ghosts of the British soldiers buried there, perhaps as a requiem to their souls…”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a></p> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[i]</a> Keyes, J.S. “Social Circle Memoirs, Vol. 1” 1853, pgs 74-78</p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[i]</a> Torres-Reyes, Ricardo, “Captain Brown’s House: Historic Data, Minute Man National Historical Park” 1969 Division of History, Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation, NPS.

For example, his colleague <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-cooper-nell.htm\">William Cooper Nell</a> reported that Adams served on the nominating committee of the first Vigilance Committee, a short lived association dedicated to providing assistance to freedom seekers in 1841.<sup>4</sup> In 1842, he participated in the 10<sup>th</sup> Annual meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.<sup>5</sup> He also signed a petition calling for the abolition of the death penalty in 1844.<sup>6</sup> In his <em>Reminiscences of the Fugitive Slave Law Days in Boston</em>, Austin Bearse lists Adams as a member of the third and final Vigilance Committee that formed in response to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law.</p> <p>The radical abolitionist editor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a> printed Adams' obituary in his newspaper, the <em>Liberator</em>, in October 1865, shortly following Adams' death.<sup>7</sup> The obituary referred to Adams as a \"marked character and striking instance of New England energy, intelligence, and public spirit.\"</p> <p>It continued:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>In times when the assertion of unpopular opinions cost everything, he was the outspoken supporter and close personal friend of Theodore Parker, and one of the earliest and most unflinching of Mr. Garrison’s adherents. The quiet energy of his business character became, in these moments, a calm, unostentatious fidelity to principle and to the immediate duty of the hour...we may point to him as one of those characters that do honor to our civilization and institutions – a self-made, high-toned, unselfish, useful and thoroughly honest man, earnestly striving to improve his age and to live for his fellow-men.</em><sup>8</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Historical documentation confirm Boston publisher George Adams served in the Boston Vigilance Committee: Austin Bearse, <em>Reminisces of the Fugitive Slave Law Days</em> (Warren Richardson, 1880), 3, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesfu00beargoog/page/n6/mode/2up\">Archive.org</a>; \"Members of the Committee of Vigilance,\" broadside printed by John Wilson, 1850, Massachusetts Historical Society.

Allyne, Joseph Allyne grew up in Barnstable County, Massachusetts with his five younger siblings. From an early age Allyne showed his anti-slavery leanings. At eleven years old, he donated 16 cents to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. The same year, his parents also donated to the society, which suggests his family's support of the abolition movement.<sup>1</sup> Allyne continued to donate to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society throughout his life.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>According to the <em>Boston Daily News</em>, Allyne later served as a secretary of the Boston Free Soil Club.<sup>3</sup> The Boston Free Soil Club supported the Free Soil Party, a political party founded in 1848 by anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats that opposed the expansion of slavery into the new territories won after the Mexican-American War (1846-1848).<sup>4</sup></p> <p>According to the membership roster in Austin Bearse's <em>Reminiscences of the Fugitive Slave Law Days in Boston</em>, Joseph W. Allyne also participated in the Boston Vigilance Committee of 1850.<sup>5</sup> Bostonians founded this iteration of the Vigilance Committee in response to the passage of the new Fugitive Slave Law. Joseph W. Allyne and others in the Vigilance Committee provided funds, shelter, transportation, medical attention, and other assistance to freedom seekers escaping enslavement on the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>The clearest picture of Allyne's anti-slavery sentiment comes from his obituary, written by friend, S.H. Lloyd.<sup>6</sup> Both <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a> published Allyne's obituary in their newspapers, the <em>Liberator</em><sup>7</sup> and <em>North Star</em><sup>8</sup> respectively. In the obituary, Lloyd described Allyne as being “a friend of the slave, and of man everywhere, seeking after justice, and truth, and harmony.”<sup>9</sup></p> <p>Even though only glimpses of Allyne's life could be found, what has been uncovered so far shows a man who acted upon his abolitionist sentiments through financial support and participation in several key organizations dedicated to the anti-slavery movement.</p> <p>If you are a researcher or a descendent of Joseph W. Allyne or can provide any further details of his life and anti-slavery work, please reach out to us at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/contacts.htm\">boaf@nps.gov</a>.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, Board of Managers, <em>Eighth annual report of the Board of Managers of the Mass.

He served in the 117th U.S. colored troops infantry, Company B for three years, mustering out as a Corporal on August 10, 1867.<br /> <br /> He lived in Chicago working as a Porter for the Pullman Palace Car Company before deciding to take a chance out west by filing for a homestead claim. <br /> <br /> On August 19, 1885, Abraham Hall completed homestead entry #21239 and submitted his application at the Kirwin, Kansas Land Office. His claim was for the east half of the NW quarter, the NE quarter of the SW quarter, and the NW quarter of the SE quarter, section 10 of township 8 south of range 22 west of the 6th Principal Meridian, Kansas. <br /> <br /> He built a sod house on the land in December of 1885 and moved in a month later. For the next two years, Hall went to great lengths to improve his land, building a sod house, sod stables, a chicken coop, a well, and by cultivating 14 acres of farmland. In April 1887 a prairie fire destroyed most of the hay, corn, and stables in the area including at Hall’s homestead.<br /> <br /> As a solider, he did not have to live on his land five years before proving up. An 1872 amendment to the Homestead Act allowed people who served during the Civil War for at least 90 days to apply their time served in the military (up to four years) to the residency requirement.<br /> <br /> Since he has served for three years, Hall only had to live on his homestead for two years before proving up. On October 1, 1887, his neighbors, Edward Jones and John Lane, testified as witnesses to Hall’s proof. His patent, #10534, was later issued on January 12, 1889. <br /> <br /> Hall decided to stake his claim in the business world too and bought a successful mercantile store in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nicodemus-kansas.htm\">Nicodemus</a>. The store was run for four years by Harvey Samuel (H.S.) Henrie, a former pastor and his future brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> The Nicodemus Cyclone discussed Hall’s store in their December 2, 1887 issue where they vouched for the popularity of the store, stating “…people flock to Hall’s store, but then, it isn’t much of a puzzle either, when you take into consideration, how cheap he sells those nice dress goods, underwear, notions, boots shoes, felts, sandals, groceries and provisions which he constantly has on hand and sells at bedrock prices, strictly for cash”  <br /> <br /> With his success he decided to give back to the community. Throughout 1888, Hall posted newspaper advertisements proclaiming that for every 50 dollars a customer would spend, he would donate one dollar to help pay for a public library in Nicodemus. He and other generous donors helped fund the Nicodemus Public Library, which opened in mid-January of 1893. <br /> <br /> Hall lived alone for most of his life, keeping his homestead and his business afloat by himself. That changed in February of 1888 when he married Jennie Henrie, older sister to H.S. Henrie. Jennie was also a homesteader; she had proved up on her homestead in Phillips County in 1881. Most of Jennie’s family had homesteaded in the area including her mother Miranda, sister Sarah, and five brothers: Sanford, William, John, Melvin, and Harvey.<br /> <br /> From 1887 to 1889, Abraham Hall was a part of a court case regarding his mercantile store. H.S. Henrie, Emma T. Henrie, Abraham Hall, Jennie Hall, George W. Howell, and A. L. McPherson were the defendants as all six had a claim to the property. J.M. Grubs representing the Saginaw Lumber Company filed a case against said defendants. He argued that they had not paid for the lumber and other supplies used to build and make improvements upon the store that Hall owned. The defendants owed $301.44 at a rate of 12% per year beginning on December 1, 1889. This action led to the court placing the property up for public sale on August 31, 1889, selling to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> Following the resolution of this case, the Halls moved out of Graham County to Kansas City where Abraham worked once again as a railroad porter. They had two children, Daisy Arminta Hall and Abraham McDonald Hall. Tragedy struck the family in 1895 when Abraham McDonald died at the age of 4 from diphtheria. By 1898, they had returned to Phillips County to live on Jennie’s homestead near Speed, Kansas.<br /> <br /> Abraham Hall’s only daughter, Daisy, moved to Manhattan, Kansas to attend college. There she met John Baker, a solider training at Fort Riley. The couple married in early October 1915. Baker soon moved out east while Daisy lived with her parents. In January 1916, John returned to convince Daisy to join him out east. This resulted in an argument which escalated until Baker shot Daisy in the lung and Jennie Hall in the shoulder. Baker gave himself up to the Sheriff and both Daisy and Jennie survived the attack. Daisy divorced Baker and returned to Manhattan later that year to continue her education.<br /> <br /> Abraham Hall’s health soon began to fail, so he and Jennie bought a house in Manhattan, Kansas to be close to their daughter Daisy. Abraham Hall died of a stroke in his Manhattan home on September 12, 1917. He was buried in Sunset Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Daisy remarried later that year and had a much happier second marriage to Guy Allen. Jennie Hall continued to live in Manhattan, Kansas until her death on October 12, 1932.</p> <hr /> <h3>Sources</h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=KS2020__.093&docClass=STA&sid=orttwxcm.2ot\">Patent Details - BLM GLO Records</a> Abraham's 160 acres</li> <li><a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=KS1890__.317&docClass=STA&sid=j4wlqyy5.msb\">Patent Details - BLM GLO Records</a> Jennie’s 159.89 acres in Phillips County</li> <li>Land Entry Case File (see below)</li> <li>1895 Kansas State Census.

Charles Howard had mortaged his land for $700 from Francis L. Robbins on October 1, 1886. Howard, who had not paid, was told he was required to pay $912.16 with an interest rate of 10% or it would be sold to the highest bidder. A notice about the property being for sale on February 6, 1893 was posted thirty days earlier.

            "bodyText": "<p>“Bitter Bierce” may have grown cynical from the horrors he experienced during the Civil War. Yet he was still capable of growing a sweet friendship with members of the Walsh family from England.<br /> <br /> Six years after he left the Civil War, Ambrose and his wife moved from San Francisco to England. He focused on growing his journalism career, wrote his first three books, and befriended the Walsh family. His son Day was born the same year as Elizabeth (Lily) Walsh.<br /> <br /> Ambrose and his family returned to San Francisco in 1875. The Walsh family also sent Lily to attend the Wilkinson School for the Deaf in nearby Berkeley, California. Lily became an inspiring poet and Ambrose, in turn, took her as his protégé.<br /> <br /> Lily was Deaf, but also suffered from serious health conditions. She asked to be buried next to Ambrose, before she died in 1895 at the age of 22 or 23. Unfortunately, he did not learn of this request until after her burial elsewhere. Ambrose instead paid his respects to young Lily in a different way. He tended to her gravesite regularly and sent flowers from her gravesite to her brother, Myles.<br /> <br /> Ambrose continued his relationship with the Walsh family. Beside the two letters to Lily before her death, 57 letters were written to Lily’s brother, Myles. Fifteen of the letters specifically mention Lily and his efforts to beautify her grave. The other letters support Myles in his promising (albeit short) writing career and “Lily’s sister” Claire’s passion for art. These letters and his visits to Lily’s grave continue 16 years after her death.<br /> <br /> Ambrose started writing his accounts of the Civil War in 1887. One of his short stories, <em>Chickamauga</em>, is about a young deaf-mute who is lost, confused, and bewildered by injured and dead soldiers and his own family after the gruesome battle. One wonders if Lily, a deaf-mute and close friend, was the model for this character. However, while Lily was fragile due to illness, not her deafness, her poetry no doubt allowed her to be independent and brave… unlike the deaf-mute boy in the story.<br /> <br /> Ambrose to Lily, October 1895 (via the Ambrose Bierce Letters Project): “You must not hesitate to let me know, dear child, when I can serve you in any way, no matter where I am. And please let me hear from you—how you are and all about you. Address me as usual—'Box 73.’ Be brave—'with a heart for any fate.’”<br /> <br /> Ambrose to Miles, December 1895 (via the Ambrose Bierce Letters Project): “After a few weeks of rainy weather I shall have the little plot sown with grass and later enclosed and marked. I wish I were permitted to put her wittily pathetic epitaph on her headstone. I would do it, sure.”</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>On March 24, 1878, a group of black Kentuckians from Lexington and Harrodsburg arrived in southwest Kansas. Among the leaders of this caravan was Frank Harris along with his family including ten-year-old son, Elliot Harris. Due to is age, Elliot Harris had avoided the clutches of enslavement that his parents and his older siblings experienced.<br /> <br /> Upon arriving in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hodgeman-county-colony-kansas.htm\">Hodgeman County</a>, the group of Exodusters made land claims under the Homestead Act of 1862. They hoped to establishing a black community called Morton City similar to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nicodemus-kansas.htm\">Nicodemus</a> in northern Kansas .<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Following in his father’s footsteps, Elliot, at the age of 23, filed his own homesteading claim for the NE ¼ of Sec. 13 in T 22 S of R 24 W in Hodgeman County, KS on November 9, 1891.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Around the same time, Elliot and his wife Vina adopted a daughter named Neva Jane. Together, the family of three would “prove up” their homestead. The requirements primarily consisted of two things: one, they had to cultivate a tract of their land; two, they had to make improvements to the land.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> On March 1, 1892 Elliot Harris began settled on his land claim and began the construction of a 12 x 16 wooden frame house. Additional land improvements included a sod barn, two wells, a sod hen house, a sod house, a sod addition to the frame house, and the erection of barbed wire. These improvements were valued at $300 in 1898.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> For the cultivation requirements, Elliot raised crops for seven years on 65 acres, producing a yield every year but one.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> To receive his land patent and take full ownership of his claim, Elliot Harris still needed to complete his final proof. This process included the Proof of Publication – a notice published in the <em>Western Herald</em> newspaper from June 23, 1898 until July 28, 1898 (six consecutive weeks) stating Harris’ intentions of making final proof. Then he needed two individuals to testify as witnesses that Elliot had made land improvements and cultivated his land. He chose Julius C. Hubbel and Noah Reed.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The testimonials were completed when all three men visited the Land Office at Dodge City, Kansas on July 30, 1898. That same day Elliot Harris acted as a witness for three other homesteaders: George Harris, Rachel Skearce, and Noah Reed.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In culmination of successfully homesteading, Elliot Harris received his land patent #5056 on May 31, 1899.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> For ten more years Elliot Harris farmed his 160-acre homestead – producing strong yields of mostly wheat, barley, and rye. But following the death of his mother (Elizabeth Harris) in 1908, Elliot would leave his farm for Hutchinson, Kansas. Although he no longer lived on a farm, Elliot still worked as a farmer in Reno County.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Around 1915, Elliot’s daughter – Neva – moved out of his house and into Alonzo Bradbridge’s household as a domestic servant. Neva would later marry C.T. Lewis around 1917. Unfortunately, their marriage would be cut short, as she would die from illness on February 21, 1918.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The death of Neva began a series of unfortunate years in Elliot’s life. On October 9, 1920, Frank Harris, Elliot’s father, passed away from cholera at the age of 99. Then his wife Vina died on Oct. 22, 1921 after a prolonged illness.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> His father, Frank Harris’ death also proved to be a catalyst of division among his children. Frank was one of the best known African American farmers in the area. Through the years he had accumulated a substantial amount of property and wealth. Four Harris children and a son-in-law managed to acquire the majority, if not all, of their father’s assets. On September 26, 1921, in response to their exclusion, five Harris siblings – led by Elliot – filed a petition for partition and fair distribution of their father’s land. It is unknown if Elliot’s bid for his father’s assets was fruitful.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Elliot Harris had a staunch religious devotion. This was first exemplified as being the superintendent of the First Missionary Baptist Church of Jetmore in 1894. Later in life he also served as a deacon for the Colored Baptist Church of Hutchinson in 1929.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> He remarried on October 10, 1924 to 43-year-old widow Theodosia Owens. Theodosia had two surviving children of whom Elliot now became the stepfather. Floyd Owens from her previous marriage and Sophronia Allen whom she had adopted from her sister.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> After a long-lived life, Elliot Harris passed away at the age of 79 on March 12, 1947. He was buried in Hutchinson Eastside Cemetery.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3>Sources</h3> <ul> <li>1880, 1900, 1910, 1930 U.S. Federal Census</li> <li>1885, 1895, 1915, 1925 Kansas Census</li> <li><a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=KS1030__.496&docClass=STA&sid=mv2vc2hr.p1h\">Patent Details - BLM GLO Records</a> 160 acre homestead</li> <li>Homestead Land Case File (see below)</li> <li>Benefit Dinner. <i>Western Herald</i>, 5 Apr. 1894, p. 4.</li> <li>“Timber Culture Final Proof--Notice for Publication.” <i>Western Herald</i>, 14 July 1898, p. 4.</li> <li>“Mrs. Neva Lewis Dies.” <i>The Jetmore Republican</i>, 15 Mar. 1918, p. 1.</li> <li><i></i>Death of Frank Harris. <i>The Jetmore Republican</i>, 8 Oct. 1920, p. 5.</li> <li>“Publication Notice.” <i>The Jetmore Republican</i>, 30 Sept. 1921, p. 7.</li> <li>“Death Claims Mrs. Vina Harris.” <i>The Hutchinson Blade</i>, 29 Oct. 1921, p. 1.</li> <li>“Hutchinson News.” <i>The Negro Star</i>, 31 Oct. 1924, p. 1.</li> <li>“Negro Baptist Church Elects New Officials.” <i>The Hutchinson News</i>, 12 Jan. 1929, p. 11.  </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40860831/elliott-harris\">Elliott Harris (1874-1947) - Find A Grave Memorial</a></li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Jimmy Carter was born in Plains, Georgia. Although he came to office after a brilliantly run political campaign, Carter distrusted politics. He relied on the strong moral convictions that he learned in Plains to help him find actions that would best benefit the whole country regardless of political party. He made considerable progress toward his goal of making government “competent and compassionate” during his single term but could not overcome energy crises, record inflation, and international conflict.<br /> <br /> Born in 1924 in Plains, James Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter, Jr., was the first of Earl and Lillian Carter’s four children. When he was four years old, the Carter family moved to a farm in the small community of Archery, two and one-half miles away. The day the family moved to the farm was memorable. Earl Carter had forgotten the key and Jimmy crawled through a window to unlock the front door. Although the house used fireplaces and wood stoves for heat and had no indoor plumbing or electricity, it was a typical middle class rural dwelling for the 1920s. Earl Carter raised cotton, corn, and sugar cane with the aid of tenant farmers and was one of the first in the area to experiment with growing peanuts. He also sold canned goods, coffee, kerosene, overalls, and a large variety of other useful items in the country store/commissary near the house. Jimmy and his African American playmates helped in the fields, and Jimmy sold bags of boiled peanuts on the streets of “metropolitan” Plains for a nickel. His parents raised their children to value education, community service, the Baptist Church, and each other. Jimmy Carter lived on the farm until he went away to college in 1941.<br /> <br /> Carter attended the Plains High School from first grade through his graduation in 1941. He quoted Miss Julia Coleman, one of his teachers and an intellectual and cultural inspiration to him, in his presidential inaugural address. After graduation, he attended Georgia Southwestern College and Georgia Tech University briefly before receiving an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. He came home to marry Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946 in the Plains United Methodist Church. He served in the Navy for seven years following his graduation from the Naval Academy, resigning his commission in 1953 to take over the family peanut business after his father died. His income of $200 that first year was so low that he qualified to move into a low-income housing project in Plains. He and Rosalynn lived there for a year but soon turned the Carter Peanut Warehouse into a successful production and processing business.<br /> <br /> Following his father’s example, Jimmy Carter became involved in civic, church, and fraternal affairs, but refused to join the local segregationist White Citizens' Council. A lifelong Democrat, Carter entered the political arena in 1962. After a strenuous contest, he won a seat in the State senate and held it for two terms. He showed special interest in education and election reform. Carter abandoned plans to run for the United States House of Representatives to seek the governorship in 1966. Although he failed on his first attempt, he succeeded four years later. During his term as governor, he reorganized the State government, worked for conservation, and attracted national attention as a moderate on civil rights.<br /> <br /> Carter’s decision to leap from governor to presidential candidate was a bold one. In a cross-country grassroots campaign, he gained support from a public looking for change after the scandals that had shaken the nation. His surprise success in the Iowa Democratic caucus began a phenomenal rise that confounded the political experts who thought his quest was hopeless. The downtown Plains train depot, which served the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad from 1888 to 1951, became Carter’s local campaign headquarters. Approximately 10,000 people a day came to Plains to find out about this unknown candidate, and Carter’s friends and neighbors gathered outside the depot to celebrate his many successes in State primaries. The Democratic National Convention made Carter their presidential nominee on the first ballot. The depot, now a museum, was again the site of a celebration on his election as president in November 1976.<br /> <br /> Carter defeated incumbent Gerald Ford by a relatively narrow but conclusive margin in both popular and electoral votes. He is the first president from Georgia and the first elected directly from the Deep South since Zachary Taylor in 1848. Dramatizing his break with tradition, Carter and his family walked hand in hand down Pennsylvania Avenue after his inauguration at the Capitol, to the cheers of the watching crowds.<br /> <br /> As President Carter took office, he stressed his plans to fight “stagflation” by both stimulating the economy and attacking inflation. He succeeded in adding millions of new jobs and reducing the budget deficit but could not control inflation, which reached record rates. He developed new policies to fight the energy shortage, expanded civil service reform, and sought to protect the environment. He appointed record numbers of women, African Americans, and Hispanics to government jobs and strengthened the Social Security system. In 1977, Carter pardoned young men who evaded the draft during the Vietnam War. This controversial decision, combined with his unwillingness to work within the traditional party system, brought him into conflict with Congress.<br /> <br /> President Jimmy Carter’s 1978 proclamation of 11 monuments in Alaska remains the most substantial use of the Antiquities Act to expand the National Park System. On December 2, 1980, Carter signed into law the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). ANILCA gave the National Park System more than 47 million acres, exceeding the nearly 45 million acres assigned it by the provisional national monument proclamations and surpassing by nearly 50 percent the 32.3 million acres proposed seven years before. The act converted most of the national monuments to national parks and national preserves, the latter permitting sport hunting and trapping. As the 1950 act settling the Jackson Hole National Monument controversy had done in Wyoming, it also curtailed further expansion of the National Park System in Alaska by Presidential proclamation. When President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 into law, he set aside over 104 million acres of land, creating 10 national parks and preserves, two national monuments, nine national wildlife refuges, two national conservation areas and 25 wild and scenic rivers ensuring that large portions of wilderness remain undeveloped. Before December 1978 Alaska had contained one national park, two national monuments, and two national historical parks. After December 1980 Alaska contained eight national parks, two national monuments, 10 national preserves, two national historical parks, and a wild river. Mount McKinley National Park was renamed Denali National Park after the Indian name for the mountain, which remained officially Mount McKinley, and was joined by a Denali National Preserve. The park and preserve together are more than four million acres larger than the old park. The old Glacier Bay and Katmai monuments became national parks, with adjoining national preserves. The Glacier Bay park and preserve gained some 478,000 acres over the old monument, while the two Katmai areas exceed the old Katmai monument by more than 1,300,000 acres.<br /> <br /> President Carter did transmit a message over the SAC alert system once in 1977. In the midst of a typical shift, the SAC controller unexpectedly warned the combat crews to “standby for a message from the president of the United States.” With their hearts pounding, waiting for the authentication code to launch Minuteman, the president said, “Hi, you all. I’m here at the SAC command post and I wanted to see how this thing worked.” Although crew members laughed about it later, the threat of a nuclear attack was very real to them at that moment in 1977.</p> <p>Carter hoped to continue the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, but his appointment of Zbigniew Brzezinski to the National Security Council gave him an adviser who was profoundly suspicious of Soviet motives, and led Carter into several major confrontations with the Russians. Carter ordered a massive five-year defense buildup that the Soviets found provocative. In turn, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to quash a Muslim-based rebellion outraged the United States. The guerrilla war that ensued put a crimp in arms control talks between Moscow and Washington. The two sides had signed SALT II, a treaty limiting the deployment of nuclear missiles, and the treaty had been sent to the Senate. After the invasion it was clear that the Senate would take no action. Carter withdrew the treaty, but Moscow and Washington agreed to abide by its terms, even though neither side ratified it. In retaliation for the USSR invading Afghanistan, Carter cut off grain sales to the Soviet Union and ordered a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympic Games by U.S. athletes. Because much of the public considered this to be more punitive towards American swimmers and runners than Soviet leaders, this response weakened Carter's image.<br /> <br /> During his inagural address, President Carter spoke of the need to work for \"the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth.\" Wooden models of American and Soviet nuclear models were kept on his desk as a a reminder of this goal. In his January 1981 Farewell Adress, Carter returned to this theme, delaring that \"the great majority of the world's people cannot remember a time when the nuclear shadow did not hang over the earth. Our minds have adjusted to it, as after a time our eyes adjust to the dark.Yet the risk of a nuclear conflagration has not lessened. It has not happened yet, thank God, but that can give us little comfort — for it only has to happen once.\"</p> <p><br /> Carter's support for human rights complicated his negotiations with the Soviet Union and other foreign states. His greatest success was the Camp David accords of 1978, which brought about a rapprochement between Israel and Egypt and a reduction of tensions in the Middle East. His greatest failure was his inability to free the American Embassy staff members taken hostage by the new Islamic regime in Iran. The 14-month long hostage crisis, plus the continuing ruinous inflation, led to his defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980. He continued to negotiate with Iran after his defeat, however, and obtained the release of the hostages hours before the end of his term. He and his wife flew to Germany to greet them.<br /> <br /> Retiring from public office, Jimmy Carter returned to Plains. He continues to work as a humanitarian with the Carter Center and Habitat for Humanity, participates in Middle East peace negotiations, and has written several books. In 2002, Jimmy Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"decades of untiring efforts to find peaceful solution to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"</p>",

In early 1775, he was emancipated from his role as a farm worker for a short interim so that he could enlist in his former enslaver’s Framingham Minute Men company. His role in the Battle of Bunker Hill became a legend, though it did not help him as a veteran.",

Although he resettled in the town of Preston, he did not receive any land on account of his age.<br /> <br /> When he turned twenty-one in 1824, he petitioned the President of Nova Scotia for land: twenty-five acres of land on which he already lived as it did not already belong to anyone. Although there is record of his petition being approved for survey, it is unknown whether he received the land.<br /> <br /> In Preston, he married a woman named Lucinda Hall around the same time and became a regular member of the African Baptist Church.

She was named after her paternal grandmother, Barbara Sim. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{143}\" paraid=\"285752446\">When Richard Smith died in 1787, his wife believed that he was deeply in debt. Following through with the wishes detailed in his will, she liquidated many of his assets to pay off the financial debts left behind. Though she sold off her husband’s plantation, she had a back-up plan in Georgetown. Her mother, Cassandra Chew, owned several lots in Georgetown, and Mary and her sister Harriet would inherit some of these upon Cassandra’s death. Original Georgetown Lot #3 (now located at 3051 M Street NW) would become Mary’s when Cassandra died.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{cfb095df-f8e7-42be-91d7-b3c1b4e0e0ba}{134}\" paraid=\"497672028\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In the late 1780s, Cassandra allowed Mary and her children to move to Georgetown and occupy what is now known as Old Stone House. In 1790, the fairly new United States of America conducted the first federal census. According to the records collected at this time, Mary Smith was listed as being a head of household and was living with six children. Six slaves are also listed as being in her possession, but their residence is unknown. It was a common practice at the time for slave holders to lease the labor of enslaved people to other residents within their communities. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{151}\" paraid=\"470215972\">1790 was also the year in which the Resident Act was passed. <br />  </p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{151}\" paraid=\"470215972\"><br /> What is the Resident Act? The Resident Act was legislation that laid out the size and location for the District of Columbia which would become the new federal capital of the United States. It established that the Federal Government would acquire land somewhere along the Potomac River that would cover a 10x10-mile-square. Georgetown became the seat of the planning of the new Federal City.   </p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{159}\" paraid=\"976371423\">With the establishment and planning of the Federal City going on, Georgetown was an exciting and evolving town to live in. Twelve-year-old Barbara would likely have seen engineers and surveyors like Pierre L’Enfant and Benjamin Banneker travelling to survey the new District of Columbia. Businesses boomed and Georgetown was a thriving port community. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{171}\" paraid=\"1292971831\">Popular taverns, like the Fountain Inn along what is now known as Water Street NW, would have drawn large crowds and been a hub of information. In 1794, the original proprietor—John Suter, Sr.—died. His son, John Suter, Jr., helped his mother run the establishment for a year before turning his attention to a bigger and more up-to-date property on Bridge Street (now M Street NW). More changes would come to Bridge Street as it became a main thoroughfare into the new Federal City. Over the next few years, Bridge Street would shift from being a quiet residential road leading to the outskirts of Georgetown to being a major commercial street. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{193}\" paraid=\"197644208\">In 1800, John Suter, Jr., rented the front, ground floor room of Old Stone House from Cassandra Chew and Mary Smith, who was still living upstairs. He used the space as a clock and watch-making shop. During this time, John and Barbara began courting and would eventually get married. Mary Smith remarried in 1801 to John Suter, Jr.’s, partner, a cabinet-maker named Joseph Brumley. By 1802, they lived elsewhere, and John and Barbara took up residence at Old Stone House after Mary moved in with her new husband. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{211}\" paraid=\"1966670968\">Between 1804 and 1806, John, Barbara, and their four children lived above the shop at Old Stone House. John Suter, Jr., was not a very successful businessman. In 1806, he was imprisoned by the government for being “an insolvent debtor” and was confined to the county jail.  <br />  <br /> John Suter, Jr., died on February 25, 1808, still very much in debt. Collectors came to Barbara, who did her best to pay off what her husband owed. She opened a series of boarding houses near the White House to make ends meet.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{217}\" paraid=\"1277829270\">We might have lost track of Barbara if not for events that began to unfold in 1812. War broke out between the United States and Britain. This war brought business to the capital and money to Barbara, who was still struggling to pay off her husband’s debts. By August of 1814, she was running a boarding house across from MacGregor’s tavern and hotel, which sat where the Willard Hotel sits today. A solitary soldier came to Mrs. Suter’s door, paid for a meal, and then left. Barbara didn’t think much of it and went about the business of keeping house.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{223}\" paraid=\"1071924733\">Unfortunately for Barbara, that soldier had been part of the British Army, and he’d been in town spying on the American capital. A few days later, on August 24, 1814, British troops marched overland to Bladensburg, Maryland, where they engaged with American troops who had left Washington.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eba8ff9f-9252-4d69-851d-5ce4a3ce0e18}{235}\" paraid=\"1010806186\">A break in the chain-of-command and poor communication on the battlefield caused the Americans to retreat to the city with the English soldiers and sailors in hot pursuit. <br />  <br /> Washingtonians could only watch as the capital burned. First Lady Dolly Madison had already orchestrated the evacuation of the Executive Mansion and had travelled to Dumbarton House in Georgetown to await her husband who had gone to Bladensburg to see the battle for himself. </p> <p paraeid=\"{218ca3d4-1b5b-40d0-bd32-2b992b630075}{11}\" paraid=\"2135070080\">Barbara Suter closed her shutters and took shelter like so many others as British troops marched down Pennsylvania Avenue, past her boarding house and onto the grounds of the Executive Mansion. </p> <p paraeid=\"{218ca3d4-1b5b-40d0-bd32-2b992b630075}{23}\" paraid=\"190005687\">As the soldiers passed the boarding house, one of the officers stopped and knocked on Barbara’s door. This man was General Robert Ross, commander of the British land forces that had attacked the capital. He told her that he and several other high ranking officers “Have come, madame, to sup with you.” Barbara tried to convince him that she didn’t have enough food to cook a meal for several officers and that the business across the street had better food and accommodations. General Ross would hear none of it and told her to kill her chickens and prepare a meal for British officers since her establishment had a better view. </p> <p paraeid=\"{218ca3d4-1b5b-40d0-bd32-2b992b630075}{49}\" paraid=\"1758305335\">Barbara did as she had been told and prepared a meal for the officers as quickly as she could. While she was busy cooking, the English burned the Presidential Mansion and the Treasury Building. Several hours later, a rowdy group of high-ranking British officials entered Barbara Suter’s tavern. Imagine Mrs. Suter’s surprise when a man rode into her boarding house on a mule! This was Admiral George Cockburn, the overall commander of the British forces, who had come to eat with the other officers.  Barbara moved around the common room where the soldiers were sitting down to their meal and began to light candles. Ross spoke up again “No need, madame,” he said, “for we shall dine by a different light.” Ross had his men throw open the shutters to the windows of the room. Outside, the Executive Mansion and treasury buildings were burning, and the light of the fires illuminated the room. Barbara Suter’s tavern provided the perfect vantage point for the English officers to watch the destruction of the Presidential Mansion.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{218ca3d4-1b5b-40d0-bd32-2b992b630075}{99}\" paraid=\"1386983979\">Barbara continued to operate taverns and boarding houses in Washington. Research is still being done on her life and what happened to her after her brush with history in August of 1814. Her mother, grandmother, and mother-in-law never bequeathed anything to her and instead bequeathed property to Barbara’s children. For example, when Mary Smith Brumley died in 1825, she bequeathed half of the property at Lot #3 (now Old Stone House and Garden) to one of her daughters, ¼ of the lot went to another daughter, and ¼ was shared by two of Barbara’s daughters, even though records indicate that Barbara was still alive. This may have been to prevent the property from being confiscated to repay John Suter, Jr.’s, debts.  <br />  <br /> According to records, Barbara never remarried and died in 1863.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Minerva Leah Rowles McClatchey was a wife, a mother of three sons, a writer, and a farmer. When the fighting came to her front door, she had no intention of leaving her plantation to be looted or burned by soldiers. So, she stayed in her Marietta home.<br /> <br /> Her husband (who was ineligible for military service due to a disability) left with their slaves, livestock, and silver. Her oldest son joined the Confederate Army and died from a battle wound. Her middle son (who was also ineligible for military service due to a disability) stayed with her at the plantation. He often ran requests to and from military officers for his mom. Her youngest son was taken into service from the Georgia Military Institute at just 15 years old. He fought in the Atlanta Campaign at Resaca, New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain, Atlanta, Peachtree Creek, and Jonesboro.<br /> <br /> As an avid writer, Minerva wrote many articles for journals and newspapers before the war. During the war, she wrote a diary, later published as “A Brief Journal of a Part of the Year in 1864.” From her diary, we learn that she was devoutly religious and truly conflicted by all the kindness shown her by many Union soldiers. She, her son, and her niece gather just enough food to survive by exchanging supplies with soldiers. Wounded soldiers walk to and from her house daily from the local make-shift hospital, and a Union doctor makes routine house calls, providing medicine when her son falls ill.<br /> <br /> In Minerva’s words, <br /> <br /> “July the 3rd … Firing ceased after a while – two were killed and buried near the house and several wounded and carried to the rear. Their limbs were amputated in Mr. Goodman’s yard. Genl. Hooker and his staff came up and by this time the whole face of the earth, as far as could be seen in the road, yard, garden, and lot – everywhere was crowded with soldiers. The officers, many of them came into the house and behaved gentlemanly towards us. They asked us thousands of questions about the army, the roads, and the way the army would go. Genl. Hooker came in and shook hands cordially as an old friend – saying he was glad to see a citizen at home, that all the houses he had passed were deserted and why was it that the inhabitants would run away from their friends. He supposed I did not believe all the tales I had heard about yankee cruelty, etc. I told him that this was my home – I had none other – and had stayed with the hope that all gentlemen and true soldiers would recognize a woman’s right to stay at home. 'You are right Madam – you have acted wisely and will be protected. We did not come to war with inoffensive citizens, but to preserve the Union and establish the authority of the Government. Let the rebels lay down their arms, and we give them the hand of friendship,' and much more in the same strain. Finally the Genl. left giving orders to some Captn. to place guards and have premises protected. I felt somewhat relieved supposing that General Hooker meant what he said.”<br /> <br /> “Nov. 15th. Now they are all gone, I can but think of the terrors of last night. The Institute was on fire, a sick lad was here to stay with Mary – the officers were upstairs, so I knew the house was safe. Mr. Underwood said he would watch the door so Devereaux and I and a couple of the officers concluded we would go up on the hill and see the wretches at their work – at least that was my motive. Every house was in flames, it was as light as day. The houses in town were burning, many of them. Kinesaw mountain was in flames and as far as the eye could see the railroad was burning too and looked like a fiery serpent stretched through the darkness. Not a man was to be seen for sometime. We went all round the buildings, and finally saw about a half dozen very young soldiers, mere lads, who were doing the terrible work. I asked them if they liked to burn houses, they said 'No matter whether we like it or not we have to obey orders…'\"<br /> <br /> References:<br /> T.

            "bodyText": "<p>Miss Lucinda Hardage, symbol of America, she saw it all – How war came to the land she knew for ninety-two years, saw boys in gray entrench upon her father’s farm in face of an advancing wave of blue. She lived to see those entrenchments become a part of a national park dedicated to perpetuate for America the memory of those stirring days of 1864, when soldiers and civilians, north and south, demonstrated that courageous hold characteristically American.<br /> <br /> To historians and other park officials, Miss Lucinda Hardage gave a wealth of first-hand information about the battle of Kennesaw Mountain, details and anecdotes available from no other source. She was a symbol of an era, the last direct link with a historic past. When she died July 14, 1940, seventy six years after the battle of Kennesaw, that personal link was broken.<br /> <br /> Miss Lucinda was born January 14, 1848, the daughter of George Washington and Mary Ann Cook Hardage. Her birthplace was a log cabin of one room, south of the Burnt Hickory Road, close to the base of Little Kennesaw Mountain. From Hall County, Georgia, her father had moved to Cobb County and built a cabin in Indian country. Miss Lucinda recalled that he cleared the land by day and improved the house after dark, with her mother’s assistance. Miss Lucinda was one of fourteen children. Two of her sisters who died in infancy are buried at the foot of the large cedar tree (now gone) near the trailside exhibit at Little Kennesaw.<br /> <br /> Soon after Miss Lucinda’s birth, the family moved into a house a little west of the original log cabin. When she was five she moved again, this time to a home on the north side of Burnt Hickory Road about a mile from the base of the Little Kennesaw home where they were living in 1864. In her recollections she stated “several of the family suffering from malaria and the doctor told my father that it would be necessary to move. He exchanged homes with his brother. I held an umbrella over my brother, sick with malaria.”<br /> <br /> The new home was a two-story, six-room house with a veranda. There was a low ceiling to the second story where the boys liked to sleep. When there was company or after the father retired, the children played in the kitchen. The house was originally a two-room log one; one room was added later on the front, three on the back. Those additional rooms were frame.<br /> <br /> In 1853, Mr. Hardage built a saw mill on Noyes Creek. He bought the land around it for $18.00 per acre, paying for it with lumber he sawed. Miss Lucinda remembered riding out over the water on the lumber carriage at the mill.<br /> <br /> When the war began, while Miss Lucinda was only thirteen, two brothers joined the Confederate forces. In September 1863, the Hardage family went to the Kennesaw Station on the Western and Atlantic railroad to see her brothers in the 7th Georgia who were on the train with Longstreet’s corps en route to Chattanooga. The family had little hope that it would be possible for the boys to go home, but wanted to see them and give them some provisions to supplement the army issue of food.<br /> <br /> When the troop train stopped, the brother who was a private was not on the train. Returning home from the station, they found him there. He had jumped from the train at Marietta despite guards posted because so many boys were close to home. As he jumped, he narrowly escaped hitting a pole. He told the family he knew he could stop over and still arrive in time for the battle. This was the younger brother, in Phillips Legion. The older brother was a captain in the 7th Georgia and had the younger transferred to his command. Next day, the youngest brother, laden with provisions, was on his way to Chickamauga.<br /> <br /> While Miss Lucinda was at the station, a splinter of wood in which there was a bit of paper fell at her feet. Her father saw her as she retrieved it. He read it and saw that it was an invitation to correspond with a Confederate soldier. He advised her not to do so, but she always believed that it would have proven most interesting.<br /> <br /> When Sherman’s army invaded Cobb County in June 1864, Miss Lucinda’s mother and two of the youngest members of the family refugeed, but the rest of the family remained at home and were soon in the midst of the grey and hosts to Confederate Generals.<br /> <br /> These were the days Miss Lucinda never forgot. Just sixteen, she met many Confederate officers, among whom were Joseph E. Johnston, Leonidas Polk, Hood, and of the handsome cavalry leader, Kelly, she formed impressions she never changed. Johnston, she said, was short and bald headed and the best leader of the Confederate Army. Hood, a bull-dog, a big talker, crippled, and was about average size. Polk was corpulent, very religious, and quiet.<br /> <br /> General Kelly was the first officer to have headquarters in the Hardage home. He commanded a cavalry division of over 2,000 and camped with his staff in a grove east of the house. General Leonidas Polk, whose corps formed the Confederate center until June 20, next availed himself of the Hardage hospitality. Although living on the battlefield, Miss Hardage heard but one oath uttered, even when whole divisions passed her home each day. At the time she heard that one General Polk was sitting on the front porch when he heard the oath. He arose and reprimanded the soldier, seated on a horse at the gate, “the soldier turned his horse and literally flew from the gate,” she said.<br /> <br /> The family was ordered to move, but stayed on despite Polk’s warning that heavy fighting would take place. One day, she and her sister were picking butterbeans in the garden with the bullets singing around them. An orderly shouted, “Ladies, for God’s sake, get out of there! I’ll pick your beans for you.” She shyly remarked that he did not pick them. Those of the family who were still at home refugeed east of Atlanta to Stone Mountain just after the death of General Polk on June 14. By that time the federal artillery was within range of the Hardage garden. As Miss Lucinda left, she could see Confederate ambulances just ahead on their way to the New Salem Church in use as a hospital. Her last memory of the Burnt Hickory Road that day in June was of those Confederate ambulances.<br /> <br /> When the Hardages returned after the battle, they found that the home of their neighbors to the east, the Yorks, had been burned. Confederates fired it within earshot to escape annoyance from Federal sharpshooters who occupied it. Near the York house, two Federal brigades formed for the Federal attack on Little Kennesaw, June 27. The house stood on the north side of the Burnt Hickory Road about 600 yards from the base of Little Kennesaw. Miss Lucinda had a clear recollection of playing there and swinging in the York swing until she grew so giddy she never wanted to swing again.<br /> <br /> After the battle, a Federal told her that a Yankee officer had stopped to read a newspaper on the hilltop, near the York house. After he dismounted, a sharpshooter on the mountain shot his horse. When the officer ran to examine his horse, he in turn was shot.<br /> <br /> South and east of the Hardage home on the ridge which crosses the Burnt Hickory Road was the New Salem Church. It is no longer there, however the cemetery of many unmarked, sunken graves remain. Speaking of it, Miss Lucinda said, among other things, “I have an uncle John Hardage, buried on the side of the road leading to our mill. Three Yankees shot his dog at his feet, and he told them, if I had the power of thunder, I wouldn’t lightning until I sent you to the bottomless pit of hell.” The New Salem preacher was a boxcar refugee at Stone Mountain and a neighbor there of the Hardages, whose temporary quarters were also in a boxcar. While a rich man from Van Wert (Rockmart) was grading a railroad toward Marietta, typhoid got into his camp and killed a number of slaves. Those were buried in the rear of the New Salem cemetery. Miss Lucinda had an interesting neighbor, the widow Cass, a mysterious, evidently wealthy woman who lived north from New Salem Church across the Burnt Hickory Road. Instead, she and her daughter listened to the sermons there while sitting outside on the horseblock.</p> <p>Until her death Miss Lucinda possessed an alert mind and body, and interest in current day affairs. She enjoyed recalling the chivalry of Southern leaders and their troops during the war. She attended all major patriotic gatherings, and especially enjoyed the anniversary program on the battle of Kennesaw Mountain, on that occasion she usually was an honored guest. She died quietly within a few hundred yards of her birthplace near the mountain, leaving only Big Kennesaw as lone and silent witness of the stirring scenes she remembered so well for three quarters of a century.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<h3><em>Powhatan was the paramount chief of Tsenacomoco, or tidewater Virginia, in the late 1500s and early 1600s. During his lifetime, he was responsible for uniting dozens of tribes into a single, powerful alliance. He was the highest authority in the land when English colonists arrived and built Jamestown fort in 1607. With a shrewd political mind, Powhatan led his people through the early years of colonial invasion.</em><i> </i></h3> <p> </p> <h4>Early Life</h4> <p>Powhatan’s given name was Wahunsenacawh, also spelled Wahunsunacock. Little of his early life is known apart from what we can assume. We know that he came to power in the town of Powhatan, which was located near present-day Richmond.<br /> <br /> As a boy he would have aided his mother in tasks like farming and gathering useful plants. As a teenager, he would undergo a coming-of-age ritual called a <i>huskanaw. </i>Now considered an adult, he would have joined the other men in hunting, and might have also served as a member of the chief’s council due to his high rank.  <br /> <br /> At an unknown age, he became the <em>weroance</em>, or chief, of Powhatan. In order to become a weroance in a matrilineal, or female-based system of inheritance, he must have been the son of the previous weroance’s sister.</p> <h4>Becoming <i>Mamanatowick</i></h4> <p>The new weroance of the Powhatan people would expand his political influence using several methods. One such method was force. Warfare was an expected and frequent reality of life in Powhatan’s time, and all men would have been trained as warriors.<br /> <br /> Another way to expand one’s power was through marriage. This was true of many cultures around the world, but particularly in matrilineal societies like that of Tsenacomoco. If Powhatan married and had children with the sister of another tribe’s weroance, his children would be next in line. In this way, Powhatan ensured that the chiefs he was dealing with throughout his alliance were loyal, because they were in fact his own children.<br /> <br /> Using these and other strategies, Powhatan created a network of tribes that spanned multiple rivers in tidal Virginia. His title was <i>mamanatowick</i>, a word indicating that he had spiritual as well as political power. His was not the only such alliance. A similar structure existed, for example, with the Piscataway in what is now Maryland’s southwestern shore, whose paramount leaders were known as <i>tayac</i>.<br /> <br /> The structure of Powhatan’s alliance did not have analogs in the European world of the colonists. Today, their political structure is referred to by many names, such as a chiefdom, empire, or confederacy, but the most accurate term is “tributary nations.”<br /> <br /> While Powhatan was the paramount chief, and tribes followed his orders, most governance was up to the individual tribes themselves. Instead, the more than 150 towns under his jurisdiction were expected to deliver regular tribute payments to Powhatan. He was offered a large percentage of whatever his people produced, which included food, clothing, and other products.<br /> <br /> What became of these tribute payments? At the height of his power, Powhatan lived primarily at Werowocomoco, his center of leadership located on the north bank of the York River. The town of Werowocomoco had a large population and, it is believed, a long history of significance as a spiritual place. He had houses too in towns throughout his network, where he would make visits. Numerous wives, children, and bodyguards lived with him at Werowocomoco. He was surrounded, too, by a group of military and spiritual advisors, many of whom would have been his relatives.<br /> <br /> This was the state of Powhatan’s world in 1607, when one spring day, an English ship arrived on his shores.</p> <h4>Colonization</h4> <p>The Jamestown colonists were certainly not the first Europeans, or even the first English to visit the area. Powhatan may have heard, for example, of the failed Roanoke colony and possibly of the Spanish missionaries before them, all of whom had been killed. So, when he encountered the new arrivals, he responded in a manner that suggested he did not view them as much of a threat.<br /> <br /> The first colonist Powhatan met personally was Captain John Smith. In the winter of 1607-8, Smith was captured and brought to Werowocomoco by Powhatan’s brother and weroance of the Pamunkey, Opechancanough. The <i>mamanatowick</i> and his advisors likely discussed what to do with their prisoner and decided that they would make him their ally.<br /> <br /> According to Smith’s narrative of his capture, Powhatan allegedly told him that, “now they were friends, and presently he should [go] to [Jamestowne], to send him two great [guns], and a [grindstone], for which he would [give] him the Country of <i>Capahowosick</i>, and [forever esteem] him as his [son] <i>Nantaquoud.</i>”<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)<br /> <br /> In other words, Powhatan offered to “adopt” Smith as his son and give the colonists a better parcel of land in exchange for a trade of guns and a grindstone. This “adoption” was yet another method that Powhatan was familiar with as a way to expand one’s alliances. In essence, Powhatan was extending peace and land to the Jamestown colonists, as long as they respected his leadership.<br /> <br /> This meant that they would be expected to pay Powhatan the tribute he asked for. Some of the tribute that Powhatan demanded from Smith, he gave. But noticeably, Smith did not send any guns back to Werowocomoco. He managed to postpone such a trade until transportation for a set of heavy cannons could be arranged. In return, Powhatan began to send food and other provisions to the struggling colonists. In those early years, the settlers were entirely dependent on Powhatan’s support for survival.<br /> <br /> In February 1608, Smith visited Werowocomoco again, this time with Captain Christopher Newport, the current leader of the colony. They brought Powhatan clothing, a hat, and a greyhound, which made for a successful meeting.<br /> <br /> But soon after, relations became strained. The English continued to withhold metal tools and guns. That summer, in order to remedy this situation, Newport decided to present Powhatan with several luxurious gifts including a crown from England’s King James I. The first mistake came when Newport asked Powhatan to come to Jamestown to receive the gifts – Powhatan demanded they come to him. The second mistake came when Newport asked Powhatan to kneel to receive the crown. This Powhatan also refused, correctly interpreting the gesture as one of subservience.<br /> <br /> Soon after, perhaps realizing that the English did not intend to respect his terms, Powhatan ordered local tribes to cease all trading with Jamestown. That winter, Powhatan asked for numerous items, including guns and men to build him an English-style house, in exchange for corn. Smith sent three German men to build the house, yet a meeting between the two leaders quickly soured. Powhatan became set on killing Smith, and even after Smith’s departure from the colony, continued to set ambushes for the English leadership.<br /> <br /> Smith departed for England in 1609 after sustaining an injury. Starving without the food that Powhatan once supplied them with, the colonists began lead more and more violent raids on surrounding towns. Powhatan responded by encouraging retaliation, and if additional reinforcements had not arrived from England, he may have been successful in driving the English from his lands.<br /> <br /> In 1613, a new leader named Captain Samuell Argall kidnapped Powhatan’s daughter Pocahontas. In exchange for her release, Powhatan sent back seven English prisoners with a bushel of corn, an offer that Argall refused. In an unexpected turn of events, Pocahontas and an Englishmen John Rolfe asked for permission to wed. Both parties agreed to this arrangement, and a brief peace was reached.</p> <h4>Death</h4> <p>In 1617, Pocahontas died during her return voyage from England, where she had been invited to visit with Rolfe and her young son. That same year, Powhatan turned over his power to his brothers Itoyatan and Opechancanough. At this point, Powhatan becomes absent from written records, though he likely passed away shortly after. After his death, if his people’s customs were followed, his body would have been mummified and placed in a <em>quiocosin</em>, or temple.</p>",

It is unknown whether or not William Davis was born enslaved or free because of the unknown status of his mother. <br /> <br /> Davis is said to have married Mildred Ann Brand, but an official marriage license has not been found. Mildred Ann Brand was born about 1825 in Richmond, Virginia. One record indicated that her father was from Scotland and thus she is considered a mulatto. She was moved to Chambersburg, Franklin County, Pennsylvania and had her first child in 1838 (Joseph Brand). She, her son and future children are given a life estate on 11 acres by Peter Mowen and his wife of Franklin County. The Mowen’s were a known Mennonite family. Mildred connects with another free mulatto named William Davis and they have their first son Alexander Wilson Davis in 1841. Joseph Brand takes on the Davis surname.<br /> <br /> William and Mildred had additional children in Franklin County; James Buchanan, 1849, Susan Ann,1855, and William Otterbein. in 1857. They sold their 11 acres in 1858 to Reverend William Coursey for $1,000, and the Davis family left Franklin County arriving in Wayne County, Ohio in 1858. William and Mildred then purchased 25 acres ($900) in 1859 in the neighboring county of Medina County, Ohio. They had two additional children; Alma Porter and Henry Allen while living in Medina County, and their son Joseph continued to work in Wayne county, Ohio. The Davis’ sold their 25 acres to the Hyatt family from Cass County, Michigan on the 13th May of 1859.</p> <p paraeid=\"{d746e7f2-bd76-4b85-9c35-f479a9934989}{242}\" paraid=\"710774162\">Davis, Brand, and five of their children - James, 13, Susan Ann, 8, William, 6, Alma, 3, and Henry, 6 weeks old, moved to Michigan in the spring of 1863. They arrive in Joyfield Township, Benzie County. Here, they applied for a 160 acre homestead (Homestead Application #450) in July of 1863. It is believed that the Davis family was the first family of color to homestead in Benzie County. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0a565955-4632-4942-ac8f-fbbea13d91e6}{15}\" paraid=\"190905584\">During the five-year requirement for improving the homestead property, they added a house with a shingle roof, board floors, one door and two windows. They resided in that house the first of March 1864 and also built one barn, a stable, a corn-house and an outbuilding. The Michigan Homestead Certificate # 455 was issued 1 October 1870.</p> <p paraeid=\"{0a565955-4632-4942-ac8f-fbbea13d91e6}{29}\" paraid=\"1272336514\">In 1870, one of their daughters, Susan Ann, passed away. However, there was no cemetery in the township. The Davis family took it upon themselves to change this. They sold 5 acres of land for $35 to the township for the purpose of creating the Joyfield Cemetery.  For family deaths prior to the cemetery, five family members were buried around a tree on their son Joseph’s homestead land next to William and Mildred’s. Joseph’s first-born son, Horace Burr Davis was the first child born in Joyfield Township. Henry Allen Davis, son of William and Mildred, married Sarah Marsh and had one child (Rudolph Davis), Sarah died, and Henry married Sarah's sister, Clara Marsh, from Manistee County, Michigan.</p> <p paraeid=\"{0a565955-4632-4942-ac8f-fbbea13d91e6}{45}\" paraid=\"1136913492\">William Davis passed away in 1881 and Mildred Brand in 1895.

Murphy was born in 1952. Her and her four brothers spent many summers on the Davis family’s homestead. There, they stayed in a mushroom shaped house, the third house to be erected on the property. When the house was being rebuilt after a house fire, the M31 highway was also being paved. Some of the roadworkers assisted the family in the building of their house. Murphy reflected upon her time at the homestead, stating that “I don’t recall any conversations when I was growing up about the significance of homesteading property. It was just where we as a family went for the summers. Over the years when I began researching the family’s history I realized the value and importance of this land.” The land remained in the family up until 1974, and Murphy has a jar of dirt from the farm as a means of saving and appreciating this important family story. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{cb73e470-1329-49c5-bf50-5cc44aa087c9}{131}\" paraid=\"684737994\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">An avid genealogist for over 30 years, Dr. Shelley Viola Murphy, aka \"familytreegirl,\" was born and raised in Michigan, now living in central Virginia.

But war, anything, is preferable to a surrender of our rights.\"</em><br /> <br /> <em>Thomas Stone, April 24, 1776</em><br />   <p>Could you willingly make a decision that could cost you, your property, your possessions, or even your life? That was the decision men like Thomas Stone had to make once the decision was made to create the Declaration of Independence. It was not an easy decision to make.<br /> <br /> Thomas Stone was like many Americans in 1776. The transition from loyal British subject to American revolutionary was slow and deliberate. Thomas Stone was a man who believed in peace, but when all signs pointed to revolution, he supported the cause of freedom. Like the other 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence, he had much to lose. Pledging their \"lives, fortunes, and sacred honor\" was not an idle boast to these founding fathers. Stone had a large house, thousands of acres of land, and a young family, along with as many as 30 enslaved African Americans who performed the labor that supplied Stone's wealth. Frequent travel, financial worries, and concerns for his wife's health took a toll on Stone. He died at age 44 and barely lived to see an independent America.<br /> <br /> Stone was born in 1743, at Poynton Manor, in Charles County, Maryland. Not a great deal is known of his youth, including the month and day he was born. Like many affluent young men of the day, his education emphasized Greek, Latin, and philosophy. By 1765, Stone finished his legal education and began his practice by circuit riding between Port Tobacco, Frederick, and Annapolis, Maryland. Stone gained a reputation as a cautious, deliberate man.<br /> <br /> At the age of 31, Thomas Stone got his start in politics. Stone was chosen to become a member of the Charles County Committee of Correspondence to maintain regular communication with the other colonies. The next year he was chosen to represent Maryland at the Second Continental Congress. For Stone, it was a rapid rise from small-town lawyer to a member of a congress comprised of all the colonies. By the time Congress met in May 1775, fighting at Lexington and Concord, in Massachusetts, had taken place three weeks earlier. The war had begun.<br /> <br /> Stone was a lover of peace. Even after the incidents at Lexington and Concord, and later at Bunker Hill, Stone believed that peace could still be reestablished and he was one of the Congressmen who pushed for a letter to be sent to King George III. The letter, which would come to be known as the Olive Branch Petition, informed the king of the continued support of the colonists, but the king refused to read it and declared the colonies to be in rebellion.<br /> <br /> By the time Congress reconvened in May 1776, the tone of the war had changed. An attempt to make Canada the 14th colony had failed, and with no sign that the war would end anytime soon, the majority in Congress now favored independence. When Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee stood and announced on June 7 that, \"...these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be, free and independent states, absolved of any and all allegiance with Great Britain.\" A five-person committee which included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and a young Virginian named Thomas Jefferson was appointed to draft a document to cover Lee's proposal.<br /> <br /> The draft of the document was completed by June 28 but with a number of Congressmen absent, a meeting to vote on the proposal was set for July 2. On that day, the Declaration of Independence was approved by 12 of the 13 colonies. New York abstained from the vote that date, but would approve by July 15. After two days of editing, the Declaration was approved in its final form on July 4. Stone and most of the other 55 men who would end up signing the document signed on August 2, 1776. The last signature was placed on the document by January 1777.<br /> <br /> Stone would serve out the remainder of the 1776 Congressional session, but in 1777 he declined reappointment and instead accepted an appointment to serve in the Maryland Senate in Annapolis.He would stay there for the remainder of his life. Part of the reason for the change was the health of his wife, Margaret. Margaret was bedridden for many of the last years of her life and Stone wanted to be closer to her. His family moved out of their Haberdeventure property in 1783 and went to Annapolis, buying the house known as the Peggy Stewart House.<br /> <br /> In June 1787, Margaret died at the age of 36. Thomas was grief-stricken at her loss, even declining to represent Maryland at what would be the Constitutional Convention. Stone did not long survive his wife, dying on October 5, 1787, aged 44, just four months after his wife. They are both buried in the family cemetery located on the property.<br /> <br />  </p>",

            "bodyText": "It would not be a stretch to say that the Brandywine Valley, the biggest of First State National Historical Park’s six sites, would not be the natural wonder it is today without William Poole Bancroft. It was Bancroft’s vision of preserved green space, accessible to all people, regardless of class or wealth, that allowed for the preservation of the Brandywine Valley that we know today.<br /> <br /> Bancroft was born in in Wilmington, Delaware in 1835 to Joseph Bancroft and Sarah Poole. The Bancroft family were prominent in the Quaker community of Delaware and Pennsylvania, and Joseph Bancroft himself was an immigrant from England. The elder Bancroft had established Bancroft Mills, a textile milling business which eventually grew into the largest mill complex on the Brandywine Creek, just a few months before William Poole Bancroft was born.William Poole Bancroft would grow up steeped in the religious beliefs of his family, and the work ethic that Quakers are known for. He began working in his father’s mills at age seven, and by the age of 30, after his father had repaid all of the debts he incurred in founding the business, the mills were reorganized as a partnership between Joseph, William, and William’s brother. Seeing further success as a result, the family became quite wealthy.<br /> <br /> By the late 1800s, Philadelphia and Wilmington were rapidly expanding outwards from their original boundaries, and to people like Bancroft, it became apparent that soon the two cities would merge into one continuous urban sprawl. The late 1800s were the era of progressive community planning in which green open spaces were intentionally incorporated into new residential subdivisions. These new planned neighborhoods were almost always designed with the upper and middle class in mind. Steeped in Quaker values which encouraged the betterment of all society, regardless of class, Bancroft believed that the working class, to which he might not belong but was in close contact with since his childhood in the mills, ought to have affordable housing with easy access to natural spaces as well. Starting in the 1880s, Bancroft began to use his wealth to buy up large parcels of land between Wilmington and Philadelphia. Further, he used his influence to drive forward the establishment of a city park system in Wilmington, donating over 200 acres of his own land to the city for the creation of public parks, and consulting with the famous architect Frederick Law Olmstead on landscape design.<br /> <br /> Taking inspiration from movements in Great Britain to design communities that rejected the maligned “company town” model and embraced affordable working class housing with easy access to open green space, Bancroft founded Woodlawn Trustees in 1901. With an eye towards the future, Bancroft intended for Woodlawn to continue buying up land, preserving it from over development, and providing housing to working class families long after he had passed. Combined with his funding of public libraries in Wilmington, Bancroft left behind a strong tradition in northern Delaware of conservation and progressive philanthropy aimed at providing benefits to all inhabitants, regardless of class.<br /> <br /> Bancroft passed away in 1928 at the age of 93, but his legacy is still felt today. His connections to the DuPont family allowed him to convince them to match his own land donations to create Brandywine Creek State Park, and the Woodlawn Trustees would eventually donate over 1,300 acres to the National Park Service, which established the Brandywine Valley unit of First State National Historical Park. Honored in the proclamation issued by President Barrack Obama in 2013 which established First State National Monument (it became a National Historical Park the following year), Bancroft’s vision and ideals were recognized as being essential to the preservation and conservation of natural spaces in northern Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania.<br />   <hr /> <h4><b>Reflection Questions</b></h4> <ol> <li>Do you agree with Bancroft’s strategy of acquiring land through private sale and then donating it for public use?</li> <li>What steps can you take to support the preservation and conservation of public lands like the Brandywine Valley for future generations?</li> </ol> <hr /> <h4><b>Sources</b></h4> <ul> <li>“Presidential Proclamation -- First State National Monument.” Presidential Proclamations, The White House, 25 Mar. 2013, obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/25/presidential-proclamation-first-state-national-monument.</li> <li>Reed, Paula, and Edith Wallace. 2019.

            "bodyText": "<p>According to the membership roster in Austin Bearse's <em>Reminiscences of the Fugitive Slave Law Days in Boston</em>, Charles B. Adams participated as a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Bostonians founded this iteration of the Vigilance Committee in 1850 in response to the passage of the new Fugitive Slave Law. This controversial law empowered enslavers and their agents to capture and return freedom seekers to bondage with the full backing of the federal government. It also mandated the assistance of local and state officials and the public at large. Adams and others in the Vigilance Committee provided funds, shelter, transportation, medical attention, and other assistance to freedom seekers escaping enslavement on the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>Little is known about the Charles B. Adams mentioned in Bearse's list. He may have been a \"stair builder,\" as the 1850 Boston City Directory and subsequent year directories document a Charles B. Adams with this occupation living at 13 Bridge Street.<sup>2</sup> According to historian Gary Collison, the Vigilance Committee included many skilled tradesmen such as carpenters and housewrights.<sup>3</sup> Though he fits this profile, local newspapers in the 1850s do not appear to mention <em>this</em> Charles B. Adams again. Therefore, we cannot identify any other activity this Adams may have been involved in that indicate his beliefs towards slavery, abolition, or the Fugitive Slave Law.</p> <p>Even though no newspapers seem to document the Charles B. Adams who lived on Bridge Street, they do reveal a different man with the same name living on Washington Street in 1851. According to a November 17, 1851 <em>Boston Daily Mail</em> article, Charlotte M. Adams, a dressmaker, reported that her husband \"Mr. Charles B. Adams of No 379 1-2 Washington street, left home last evening, about quarter past 6 o'clock for the purpose of attending a meeting of the Free Soil party, and has not been heard of since.\"<sup>4</sup></p> <p>The Free Soil Party focused its attention on stopping the expansion of slavery into the western territories of the United States. It is conceivable that an anti-slavery leaning participant in a Free Soil Party meeting may have also been an active member of the Boston Vigilance Committee. The Vigilance Committee represented a diverse cross section of radical abolitionists and more moderate antislavery activists such as members of the Free Soil movement.</p> <p>This Charles B. Adams eventually made his way home following the Freedom Soil Party meeting. City Directory Records from 1853 show him and Charlotte living at 300 Washington Street.<sup>5</sup> He lived until 1875 and left his estate to Charlotte, his wife of nearly thirty years. His obituary referred to him as \"one of the old merchants of Boston,\" but mentioned nothing of his political affiliations and possible work in the Vigilance Committee.<sup>6</sup> According to Collison, however, \"By far, the largest and most varied group,\" of Vigilance Committee members, \"consisted of merchants and store keepers.\"<sup>7</sup></p> <p>While these are two promising candidates for the Charles B.

            "bodyText": "<p>Nicholas (Nick) Bransford was brought to Mammoth Cave in the same manner and time as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mat-bransford.htm\">Mat Bransford</a>: as an enslaved man leased to the owner of the cave in 1838. Although they share the same last name, Nick and Mat have no blood relation. It was common during slavery for enslaved people to be given the last name of their enslaver.  <br /> <br /> Descriptions of Nick as a guide do not exist until after <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/stephen-bishop.htm\">Stephen Bishop</a>'s death. Perhaps he was not a regular guide until this time, or he had been assigned to other duties such as maintaining the grounds of the Mammoth Cave Estate. Nonetheless, Nick quickly became an adept Mammoth Cave tour guide. <br /> <br /> On the wall of the Snowball Room within Mammoth Cave is an inscription that reads, “To Nick The Guide” from August 17, 1857. This inscription is the only known dedication to an enslaved guide written by a visitor to the cave.  <br /> <br /> A visitor named F.J. Stevenson visited Mammoth Cave in 1863 and wrote the following regarding Nick:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[He] proved to be an interesting black man, considerably past middle age...a short, broad strong man...quiet but steady eyes, grave in his demeanor, and concise in his conversation.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite being a man of few words, Nick nonetheless embodied the connection guides have to the cave as well as to the visitors as Stevenson writes, </p> <blockquote> <p>\"...seemed thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the place in which he had spent the greater portion of his time for 17 years. He was as grave and taciturn as some cave-keeping anchorite. During our inward progress, he had carefully pointed out every place and object of interest...If I paused or made a misstep, he instantly looked around.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike Stephen Bishop, Nick did not have any indications that he would receive help in gaining his freedom. After Mat Bransford’s children were sold away by his wife’s enslaver, Nick instigated a plan to buy his freedom. The guides routinely received tips from visitors, but Nick also began to sell eyeless cave fish to curious visitors to supplement his meager income. In 1863 he raised enough money and successfully bought his freedom. He decided to stay at Mammoth Cave, however, as a paid employee for a total of 50 years.  <br /> <br /> Beyond his role as a guide, Nick was also a father to two daughters, Hannah and Annie. Hannah later married Will Garvin, another black cave guide. Records show that Nick married Stephen Bishop's widow, Charlotte, sometime after Stephen died in 1857.  <br /> <br /> Nick was an upstanding community man who in the 1870’s donated land for the Mammoth Cave School where many Bransford children and other black community members learned to read and write. This quiet soul was a spiritual man and was one of the first deacons of the Pleasant Union Baptist Church that stood on Flint Ridge, near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/maca-baptist-church.htm\">Mammoth Cave Baptist Church</a> and Cemetery until the formation of the national park in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Nick continued to work at Mammoth Cave until he died in 1895 – giving over a half-century of his life to the cave guide profession. His exact gravesite is unknown, but is likely located near the Pleasant Union Baptist Church. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>As a trailblazing attorney, abolitionist, and civil rights advocate, Robert Morris dedicated himself to the principle of equal rights before the law and broke down barriers to African American equality in Massachusetts and across the nation.</p> <p>Morris grew up in the activist circles of Salem and Boston before the Civil War. As a young man, Morris worked as a domestic servant in the home of Boston abolitionist Ellis Gray Loring. Loring, one of Boston’s early White abolitionists, recognized great potential in Morris and encouraged his interest in studying the law. In 1847, Morris became the second African American to practice law in Massachusetts and likely first in the United States to argue a case before a jury.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>While enduring discrimination in Boston courtrooms, Morris steadfastly advocated for the Black community by using his legal prowess to defend and expand African American civil rights. A defining moment of Morris’ legal career came on behalf of Sarah Roberts in the 1849 case of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-sarah-roberts-case.htm\"><em>Roberts v. City of Boston</em></a>. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-roberts.htm\">Benjamin Roberts</a>, a Boston printer and publisher of a short-lived abolitionist newspaper, sued the city on behalf of his daughter, Sarah. Not allowed to attend the school closest to her home, Sarah had to walk past five White schools to the segregated school for Black children. Roberts turned to Morris to prosecute the case. Morris and his co-council, abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-sumner.htm\">Charles Sumner</a>, argued that school segregation violated Sarah’s right to equality guaranteed under the Massachusetts Constitution. Although the court ruled against Sarah Roberts, later petitions and continued activism successfully pressured the state legislature to abolish school segregation in 1855. Further, lawyers in the 1954 landmark civil rights case <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/brown-v-board-of-education.htm\"><em>Brown v. Board of Education</em></a> at Topeka used many of the same arguments developed by Sumner and Morris. Though these arguments did not work in the Roberts case, they did in <em>Brown v. Board</em>, which resulted in the Supreme Court deeming public school segregation unconstitutional.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 radicalized Morris. In defiance of federal law, Robert Morris helped establish <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston’s Vigilance Committee</a> to shelter and protect freedom seekers that came to the city. In 1851, he played a pivotal role in the courthouse raid that liberated freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-rescued-from-the-fangs-of-the-slave-hunter-the-case-of-shadrach-minkins.htm\">Shadrach Minkins</a>. He also organized and led the Massasoit Guards, an unsanctioned Black militia group dedicated to the protection of the community and precursor of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Infantry Regiment</a>.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In his later years, Robert Morris continued to champion civil rights causes in Massachusetts. Morris fought against housing discrimination while attempting to move into a segregated neighborhood in Chelsea, Massachusetts. In 1866, Morris ran an historic but unsuccessful campaign for mayor of Chelsea. Access to equal housing and political participation, which later dominated the 20<sup>th</sup> century civil rights movement, remained important until his death in 1882.<sup>4</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Stephen Kantrowitz, <em>More Than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic, 1829-1889</em> (New York: Penguin Press, 2013), 138.</li> <li>Stephen Kendrick and Paul Kendrick, <em>Sarah’s Long Walk: The Free Blacks of Boston and How their Struggle Changed America</em> (Boston: Beacon Press Books, 2004), 162-171.</li> <li>Kendrick and Kendrick, <em>Sarah's Long Walk</em>, 187-190, 214.</li> <li>Kendrick and Kendrick, <em>Sarah's Long Walk</em>, 246.</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "Oliver Evans was a central figure to the industrial development which took place in the Brandywine Valley in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Evans was born in Newport, Delaware in 1755, one of 12 siblings. His father, a cordwainer (shoemaker) by trade moved the family to a farm in northern Delaware when Evans was an infant. His childhood is not well documented beyond his love of reading and learning. Apprenticed to a wheelwright at the age of 17, Evans would continue his informal education, reading every book he could get his hands on. When the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Evans enlisted into a Delaware militia company, though he did not see any combat for the duration of the war.<br /> <br /> In his early 20s, Evans began inventing machines to improve the efficiency of wool production. He also began to experiment with designing steam engines, and at the age of 27 applied for a patent on a steam-powered wagon. Though this was denied, his inventiveness and mechanical aptitude were becoming apparent to all. That same year he married Sarah Tomlinson, in Old Swede’s Church in Wilmington, Delaware.<br /> <br /> Evans’ association with the Brandywine Valley and the mills there had been growing from an early age, but it was his designs for a new kind of flour mill that really established his reputation. Beginning in 1783, when he took over the construction of a flour mill established by two of his brothers, Evans formed a revolutionary vision of the flour milling process. Rather than seeing each step of the process of milling wheat into flour as distinct and separate, he saw it as a seamless integrated whole. Through improvements to existing machinery, and the wholesale invention of new technologies, Evans created a novel kind of flour mill which essentially automated the entire process, greatly reducing the amount of labor needed to produce flour, as well as remarkably improving the quality of the final product. His successful prototypes took some time to be embraced by other flour producers in the Brandywine Valley and northern Delaware, but by 1790, he was being personally awarded patents for his breakthrough technologies by then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.<br /> <br /> Evans did not restrict his inventiveness to one field. Over the course of his life he developed a slew of new machines, improved numerous existing technologies, and drafted designs for many more fantastical ideas. These include several types of high-pressure steam engines, an amphibious vehicle, new designs for steamboats, a machine gun, municipal lighting systems, perpetually baking bread ovens, and heating systems. However, his personal life was not always a happy one.<br /> <br /> Evans had a prickly disposition, and did not appreciate criticism, even when well-intentioned and constructive. Additionally, many of his ideas were adopted without permission, or even stolen, by individuals and businesses around the United States. Much of his later life was spent in numerous legal disputes over patents and infringement, and he was quick to bring rivals to court. Subjects to bouts of depression, he withdrew from managing his many industrial operations in the 1810s. His wife Sarah died in 1816, and though he soon remarried, Evans himself passed in 1819, still feeling bitter over lack of appreciation of his inventions.<br /> <br /> Though his personal life was often rocky and full of sadness, Evans still left an indelible mark on the history of the Brandywine Valley, Delaware, and the nation. Without his mechanical genius and visionary drive, the Brandywine Valley may not have grown to become one of the early centers of the Industrial Revolution, and the foundations for the commercial and industrial giant that the United States eventually became may never have been laid. <hr /> <h4>Reflection Exercise & Question</h4> <ol> <li>Look around your home, school, or community and see if you can identify a problem or issue that you could invent a machine to help solve.</li> <li>What is a technology or machine that was invented in the 1800's that we still use today?

            "bodyText": "<p>Samuel de Champlain was born in La Rochelle, France to a family of mariners. He gained experience as a navigator through voyages with his uncle, notable fur trader François Gravé Du Pont, who traveled and traded in the New World as early as 1599. The knowledge of the New World gained on these journeys proved valuable for Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons — the man given the fur trading patent for the Acadia territory by King Henry IV of France. This vast territory ranged from modern day Newfoundland, southward to around present-day Philadelphia. This lucrative monopoly over trade and land in the New World required Dugua to organize an expedition, but he was no sailor. He enlisted the help of royal cartographer and navigator, Samuel de Champlain.</p> <h4>Legacy</h4> <p>Champlain led the group of 79 men to the New World, and in 1604 they settled on Saint Croix Islands. After they settled, in September of 1604 Champlain continued his exploration south where he first sighted the “deserted mountains.\" In his journal he wrote, “The same day we passed also near an island about four or five leagues long…it was very high, notched in places, so as to appear from the sea like a range of seven or eight mountains close together. The summits of most of them are bare of trees for they are nothing but rock…I named it the island of the Desert Mountains.”<br /> <br /> In Champlain's native French, it was called \"Île de Monts Déserts.\" Since they settled here thousands of years before, the Wabanaki called this island \"Pesamkuk.\" Later, Sir Robert Mansel called it Mount Mansel. Yet the name that stuck on most maps of that time until today, was the one coined by “Soldier, Sailor, Explorer” Samuel de Champlain, Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> The mountain formerly known as Newport Mountain now bears his name. A memorial plaque just outside the park to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Champlain’s arrival reads:</p> <p>“…Samuel de Champlain<br />  Born in France 1567<br /> Died at Quebec 1635<br />  A soldier sailor explorer<br /> And administrator<br /> Who gave this island its name.”<br /> <br /> <strong>References</strong><br /> Naming the Pesamkuk: Mansel Place Names on Mount Desert Island, February 2015, Abbe Museum<br /> <br /> Champlain Monument May Be Moved, February 10, 2003, Bangor Daily News</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Little is known about Pierre Dugua’s earlier years. The French Huguenot (c.1560–1628) distinguished himself fighting in the cause of King Henri IV during the religious wars in France. With that reputation, he developed good connections at court and was able to secure a monopoly to the fur trade in the Acadia territory, a huge area from the 40th to the 46th parallels. The fur trade was lucrative because fur, especially beaver for beaver felt hats in Europe, was in great demand. In 1604, Dugua formed a company of merchants and led a group of French settlers, including Samuel Champlain, to North America. They settled on Saint Croix Island with the intention of claiming the area for France, locating the illusive trade route to China, searching for mineral wealth like copper, and profiting from trade in the area. They were also charged with converting the First Peoples to Christianity.</p> <p>Saint Croix Island, in the Saint Croix River on the present boundary between the United States and Canada, seemed like the perfect location to set up a trading settlement. Its location near the confluence of two rivers and a bay made for easy trade with the First Peoples and also made it easy to defend against attacks from competing European powers. The possibilities were great. However, the isolated island proved to be an unfortunate choice. Since Saint Croix Island and France are on about the same latitude, they assumed the weather would be comparable. The winter of 1604–1605, however, was one of the coldest on record, and the settlers were unprepared for its brutality. Dangerous ice floes prevented the men from reaching the mainland where fresh water and game were available. Thirty-five of the 79 settlers died, many from scurvy as well as malnutrition and exposure. In the summer of 1605 the colony was moved across the Bay of Fundy to Port Royal (now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia).</p> <p>There were high hopes for the new colony as a trading post and center of settlement along the coast, but the desire of individual Europeans to trade for furs was great. Thus, support in France for Dugua’s monopoly was dwindling. In addition, the rugged, forested inlets of the Nova Scotia peninsula, the heavy forests of the St. John River, and the many bays and beaches of Cape Breton and Prince Edward islands made it impossible to enforce the monopoly on the fur trade already entrenched in these locations.</p> <p>As soon as work was underway on the new settlement at Port Royal, Dugua—not giving up on his desire for colonization and exploration in New France—sailed back to France to seek ways to defend his monopoly and report his successes to the king. Samuel Champlain remained at Port Royal to do further exploration. For a short period (1607–1608), Dugua’s monopoly was restored, allowing further development of the trading post in Tadoussac and the settlement of Quebec, which would serve as Champlain’s trading post and base for further exploration toward the west. Pierre Dugua’s commitment and willingness to sacrifice personal gain allowed continued exploration and settlement in New France. His energetic direction, support, and encouragement of exploration subsequently reported in the writings of Champlain and Marc Lescarbot represent large contributions on his part.</p> <p>Saint Croix Island International Historic Site in Calais, Maine, commemorates the original 1604 French settlement. Although short-lived, the Saint Croix settlement predated the British colony of Jamestown by three years. Both the U.S. National Park Service and Parks Canada each administer a site of that same name along the Saint Croix River and work together to interpret the first French settlement in northern North America—and the first in the French region known then as <em>Acadie</em>.</p>",

Kono set world records in four different weight classes:[1] lightweight (149 pounds or 67.5 kilograms), middleweight (165 lb or 75 kg), light-heavyweight (182 lb or 82.5 kg) and middle-heavyweight (198 lb or 90 kg).[2]</p> <h2>Early life</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono was born in Sacramento, California, on June 27, 1930. His family was of Japanese descent and were interned at Tule Lake internment camp in 1942 during World War II.[3] Sickly as a child, the desert air helped Kono's asthma.[4] It was during the relocation that Kono was introduced to weightlifting by neighbors including Noboru \"Dave\" Shimoda, a member of the Tule Lake weightlifting and bodybuilding club and brother of actor Yuki Shimoda and his friends, Gotoh, Toda and Bob Nakanishi. After 3½ years they were released and Kono finished Sacramento High School. He later worked for the California Department of Motor Vehicles and attended Sacramento Junior College.[5]</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1950 but was kept home from the Korean War after officials learned of his Olympic potential.[6]</p> <h2>Career</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono was a gold medalist at both the 1952 Summer Olympics and 1956 Summer Olympics, and a silver medalist at the 1960 Summer Olympics under coach Bob Hoffman. Kono won the World Weightlifting Championships six consecutive times from 1953 to 1959 and was a three-time Pan American Games champion; in 1955, 1959, and 1963.[7] A knee injury prevented him from qualifying for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the following year he retired from the sport.[3] He set a total of 26 world records and seven Olympic records, making him the most accomplished U.S. male weightlifter to date.[8][9]</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono was also a successful bodybuilder, winning the Fédération Internationale Haltérophile et Culturiste Mr. Universe titles in 1954, 1955, 1957 and 1961.[10] After his retirement he turned to coaching, taking on the Mexican 1968 Summer Olympics and West German 1972 Summer Olympics weightlifting teams before becoming head coach of the United States' Olympic weightlifting team at the 1976 Summer Olympics.[3][8]</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">During his weightlifting career in the 1960s, he developed a pair of bands to support knees during training. These eventually extended to the elbows and became standard weightlifting equipment.[8] While he was coaching in West Germany during the 1970s, his correspondence with Adidas led to the firm's development of low cut weightlifting shoes.[11][12]</p> <h2>Awards</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Along with his weightlifting and bodybuilding titles, Kono was an eight-time Amateur Athletic Union James E. Sullivan Award finalist, an award given annually to the top American amateur athlete.[13] He was also one of the first members of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1978.[14] In 1990, Kono received the Association of Oldetime Barbell and Strongmen Highest Achievement Award and was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.[15][16] He was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1993.[17] In 2005, the International Weightlifting Federation named Kono the \"Lifter of the Century.\"[18]</p> <h2>Portrayals</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono appeared in Universal Newsreel volume 32, number 63, August 6, 1959.[19] He is depicted as part of a mural located at 37 West Philadelphia Street in York, Pennsylvania. This mural was finished in 2000.[20]</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono's life was featured in the documentary: \"Arnold Knows Me: The Tommy Kono Story\" that was released in the summer of 2016. The film first aired on KVIE (PBS) Sacramento and went on to air in more than 50 (PBS-affiliate) markets across the country.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono was depicted in a Google Doodle marking the anniversary of his birth in 2021.[21]</p> <h2>Death</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Kono died on April 24, 2016 in Honolulu, Hawaii from complications of liver disease, aged 85.[2] Survivors included his wife of 53 years, the former Florence Rodrigues of Honolulu, three children, and three grandchildren.[22]</p> <h2>Medal record</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Men's weightlifting<br /> Representing the  United States<br /> <strong>Olympic Games</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Gold medal – first place  1952 Helsinki  -67.5 kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1956 Melbourne  -82.5 kg<br /> Silver medal – second place  1960 Rome  -75 kg</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>World Weightlifting Championships</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Gold medal – first place  1953 Stockholm  -75kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1954 Vienna  -82.5 kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1955 Munich  -82.5 kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1957 Teheran  -75kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1958 Stockholm  -75kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1959 Warsaw  -75kg<br /> Bronze medal – third place  1961 Vienna  -82.5 kg<br /> Silver medal – second place  1962 Budapest  -82.5 kg</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Pan American Games</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Gold medal – first place  1955 Mexico City  -82.5 kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1959 Chicago  -75kg<br /> Gold medal – first place  1963 São Paulo  -82.5 kg</p> <h2>References</h2> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">[1] \"Sports Biographies: Kono, \"Tommy\" (Tami T.)\".

            "bodyText": "In the summer of 1776, the Declaration of Independence was written, signed, and distributed throughout the world. For the first time the concept of universal rights for mankind was clearly identified in the phrase, “all men are created equal.” We know that the Founders did not mean this literally. At the time, only white male property owners were considered as “created equal.” However, when the document was published, people who were not covered under the phrase of “all men are created equal,” were still trying to define their own personal freedom.<br /> <br /> Who was Bet? Originally from Charles County, Maryland, Bet was a young enslaved woman who was owned by Thomas Stone and his wife, Margaret. In the summer of 1776, Thomas Stone was representing Maryland at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. His wife, Margaret, was ill, probably due to the after effects of a smallpox inoculation. While we don't conclusively know if Bet was a enslaved worker in the house or the fields, it is probable that she worked in the main house, and it is possible that one of Bet’s duties was to care for her mistress.<br /> <br /> Even as Thomas Stone cast his vote for independence in July of 1776, over 30,000 British troops and German mercenaries were arriving near New York City. The American forces under General George Washington in the area of New York City were not well arranged to defend the city. Starting with the Battle of Brooklyn in late August, the British defeated Washington’s forces in a series of battles. It left many American soldiers killed, wounded, demoralized, or imprisoned. Many of those who had created the Declaration doubted that all of their work in creating the document would matter, some believing that a British victory was inevitable.<br /> <br /> It was during this cloud of confusion that Bet decided to act. On Friday, October 3, 1776, Bet ran away from the Stones and her enslavement.<br /> <br /> According to an advertisement for a runaway slave in the Philadelphia Packet newspaper, when she was last seen, Bet was wearing several layers of clothes and carrying a “…new purple and yellow check fluff jacket and petticoat, white linen ditto, blue and white stamped linen ditto, cambric apron, red and white calico short gown, and black bombazeen quilted petticoat.” Bet may have taken the extra clothes in preparation for the upcoming winter or to sell for money. Since some of the clothes were new, it is also possible that Bet took some of Margaret’s own attire. If she was able to obtain new clothes, it is more than likely that Bet was an enslaved house worker.<br /> <br /> Another clue to Bet's position is that Thomas Stone offered the substantial reward of $20 for Bet’s return, a sum worth almost one-third an average worker's salary for a year. In the advertisement Stone noted “…that a Negro woman answering to her description, was seen at Brunswick, in Jersey.” It is a plausible assumption that Bet was heading northward, because free and runaway African Americans were moderately more accepted in New York and New England and there were more areas for her to hide in a large city. Stone advised anyone who caught Bet to turn her over to one of the numerous Maryland officers in the military encampments dispersed near New York City.<br /> <br /> Bet's fate is unclear. Did she successfully escape? After Thomas and his wife both died in 1787, a slave named “Bett” was willed to their eldest daughter. Are “Bet” and “Bett” the same person?",

A bill-of-sale, dated 6 July 1756, records the transfer of Fitch’s ownership to Joseph Hartwell, also of Bedford:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Know all men by these presents that I, Joseph Fitch of Bedford in the County of Middlesex, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England, gentleman for and in consideration of the sum of £24 lawful money of New England, done, in hand paid at and before the sealing and delivery of these presents, by Joseph Hartwell of Bedford, above said yeoman, the receipt I do hereby acknowledge, have bargained and sold and by these presents do bargain and sell unto the said Joseph Hartwell a negro boy about 5 years old, called <strong>Jeffru</strong>, now living at the said Joseph Hartwells, to have and to hold the said negro boy by these presents bargained and sold unto the said Joseph Hartwell, his executors, administrators and assigns forever, and I the said Joseph Fitch for myself etc do warrant the above said Negro boy unto the said Joseph Hartwell, his heirs etc against me the said Joseph Fitch my heirs etc, all and every other person and persons whatsoever, shall and will warrant and defend by these presents of which negro boy I, the said Joseph Fitch have put the said Joseph Hartwell in full possession by delivering said negro at the sealing hereof unto the said Joseph Hartwell.<sup>I</sup></p> <p>There is no record of 1775 service for Jeffrey Hartwell, as he came to be known, but the obituary of his daughter Frances gives us insight into that service:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">...Her father, <strong>Jeffrey Hartwell</strong>, was in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">battle of Bunker Hill</a>, having gone on a three-months term as a substitute for his master, as he called him. Returning home, his master instead of allowing him his pay, took the money away and put it in his own pocket, upon which Jeffrey went off and enlisted until the close of the war...<sup>II</sup></p> <p>He did indeed enlist on 29 September 1777 in Capt. Edward Framer’s company, in Col. Jonathan Reed’s regiment. This unit marched to reinforce the Northern Army and is believed to have been at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/1777-campaign.htm\">Saratoga</a>. His discharge was dated 8 November 1777.</p> <p>On 16 June 1778 he reenlisted, joining Lieut. John Flint’s company, in Col Thomas Poor’s regiment. This unit marched to White Plains to fortify the passes of the Hudson (then called North) River at the time that <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">Gen. Washington</a> was attacking the British at Monmouth (NJ). From June to August 1778, he was in Capt. Asa Lawrence’s company at Fort Clinton (NY). From September to December 1778, he was in the same company and regiment stationed at West Point (NY).<sup>III</sup> By 1779, he was free and residing in Dracut as is evidenced by this journal entry:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">4 March 1779 One Stephen Hartwell here to advise relating to a Neagro named <strong>Jeffrey Hartwell</strong>, Spent considerable time with him at his request relating to said Neagro’s freedom. He would have given me a fee. I refused to take one (in a Neagro cause).<sup>IV</sup></p> <p>More information is obtained from a Dracut town record:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">John Varnum notified the town that he had received a laborer, a negro, who calls himself <strong>Jeffrey Freeman </strong>about twenty eight years old from Joseph Hartwell in Bedford s<sup>d</sup> Jeffery appears to be an able bodied laboring man and says he expects to earn his living at husbandry work.<sup>V</sup></p> <p>The only artifacts known to exist, of any one of the soldiers in this study, are three pewter plates once owned by Jeffrey Hartwell and now in the collection of The Bostonian Society.<sup>VI</sup></p> <p>Jeffrey Hartwell died in Dracut on 22 July 1816, at the age of 75.<sup>VII</sup> He is buried in Hamblett (formerly called Garrison House) Cemetery on Jordan Avenue in Lowell.

            "bodyText": "<p>“Some boast of being friends to government; I am a friend to righteous government, to a government founded upon the principles of reason and justice; but I glory in publicly avowing my eternal enmity to tyranny.”<sup>1</sup></p> <p>John Hancock spoke these words during the 1774 Boston Massacre commemoration at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/fh.htm\">Faneuil Hall</a>. Hancock was considered an odd choice for speaker. Despite being one of the wealthiest and most popular men in Boston, Hancock was not renowned for his oratory or writing skills. His popularity meant the people of Boston liked John Hancock and wanted to hear him speak regardless of his skill.<sup>2</sup> Hancock leveraged his wealth into being a central part of the growing Revolutionary movement, and one of the most popular figures in Massachusetts.</p> <p>Rising to such prominence, however, required no small amount of privilege. John Hancock inherited his wealth from his uncle, Thomas Hancock, in 1764. John Hancock’s father had passed away when Hancock was seven, making his uncle Thomas his caretaker. After his uncle’s passing, and John Hancock’s inheritance of his uncle’s lucrative business, the young John Hancock won an election to become one of the town’s selectmen.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>As a merchant and politician, Hancock developed a personal interest in the new taxes Britain had developed. He participated in the boycotts that came with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/sugar-and-stamp-acts.htm\">Stamp Act</a> and the Townsend Acts. His business became a political flashpoint in 1768, when British customs officials seized one of his sloops, <em>the Liberty</em>. The customs agents accused Hancock of smuggling and, after a highly publicized trial, the charges were dropped without explanation, likely due to lack of evidence. While no legal repercussions came of the case, its publicity helped Hancock cement his position amongst the revolutionaries.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>When a Town Meeting met in Faneuil Hall to discuss the Tea Act in 1773, Hancock served as the moderator. The declared sentiment, that any who purchased tea was ‘An Enemy of America,’ led to the Boston Tea Party.<sup>5</sup> In retaliation to the destruction of the tea, Governor Thomas Gage dissolved the Provincial Assembly. The members of the assembly instead met in Concord, creating the Provincial Congress to act as the government of Massachusetts in place of Gage. Almost immediately, Hancock was elected president of this new institution.</p> <p>With his new leadership position in a now autonomous government, Hancock moved to Lexington alongside his long-time associate Samuel Adams. In April 1775, the British marched on Concord. Hancock and Adams fled, fearing arrest. Hancock’s escape culminated in his arrival in Philadelphia, where he joined the Continental Congress.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Hancock’s reputation preceded him. The Continental Congress swiftly and unanimously elected him President in 1775. He retained the position for the signing of the Declaration of Independence a year later.<sup>7</sup> As President, Hancock signed the document first to ratify it. Early public versions of the document only bore his name. Hancock’s name and the Declaration became inextricably linked, with Hancock’s signature becoming his most famous trait, despite his lengthy political and business career.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Hancock only served as President for two and a half years. He returned to Massachusetts in 1777, though he rejoined the Continental Congress temporarily in 1778. He went on to win the governorship of Massachusetts from 1780 until 1785, when he announced his retirement. His retirement only lasted a year before he reclaimed the office in 1786. Hancock served as governor of Massachusetts until his death in 1793.<sup>9</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>John Hancock, <em>An Oration Delivered March Fifth, 1774</em> (Boston: Edes and Gill, 1774) 6.

            "bodyText": "Prince Estabrook was an enslaved man who stood with his white neighbors against the British Army on April 19, 1775. It is likely that Prince was the son of a man named Tony, who was enslaved by the Estabrook family. When Prince was born, around 1740, he became the property of Benjamin Estabrook. Benjamin’s family lived just east of Lexington center, owning land on both sides of the road running between Cambridge and Concord. Little is known about Prince<span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SA\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt\">’</span>s activities and responsibilities while enslaved to the Estabrook family.<br /> <br /> Though Provincial law prohibited “Indians and Negroes” from training as soldiers in the militia, they were still required to “turn out” armed during an emergency. During wartime the enlistment of black men was more common though still controversial.  In 1775 Prince was a member of the Lexington militia, and mustered with that militia under the command of Colonel John Parker during the early morning hours of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/april-19-1775.htm\">April 19th</a>. When the advance column of British troops decided to confront the militia gathered on Lexington Green, Prince was among the militiamen who had reassembled there. During the ensuing shooting, before the British officers regained control of their troops, Prince Estabrook was struck by a musket ball in his left shoulder. A document entitled ‘Appendix - Soldiers of Color on April 19, 1775’ states that a 35 year old black slave from Lexington named Prince Estabrook serving in Colonel Parker’s militia was actively engaged in fighting and was wounded that day. A separate document titled ‘LIST of the Names of the PROVINCIALS who were Killed and Wounded in the late Engagement with His Majesty’s Troops at Concord, &c.’, under a heading listed as ‘Wounded Of Lexington’, the name ‘Prince Easterbrooks (a Negro Man)’ appears.<br /> <br /> Prince recovered from that wound and, over the course of the next eight years, he served several tours with the militia and with the Continental Army: <ul> <li> <p>With Captain Parker’s company in Cambridge (1775)</p> </li> <li> <p>With Colonel Jonathan Reed’s regiment at Fort Ticonderoga (1775 - 1776)</p> </li> <li> <p>With Colonel Eleazer Brook’s regiment at Cambridge (1776 - 1777)</p> </li> <li> <p>Part of a group of men raised to reinforce the Continental Army (1780 - 1781)</p> </li> <li> <p>With Colonel John Greaton’s regiment (1782)</p> </li> <li> <p>With Colonel Michael Jackson’s regiment (1783)</p> </li> </ul> Following the dissolution of the Continental Army, Prince returned to Lexington. At that point he had earned his freedom. His exact status at that time is not known for certain. Benjamin Estabrook’s tax records from 1790 included ‘a non-white freeman’. The 1790 tax rolls include Prince Estabrook’s name, although he was not taxed as a property owner. The current assumption is that he had become an employee of Benjamin Estabrook. Following Benjamin’s death, Prince moved to Ashby, Massachusetts and became part of the household of Benjamin’s son Nathan.<br /> <br /> Did Prince ever marry? Did he have children of his own? Historians have found no reliable evidence concerning this personal side of his life. Family records state that Prince Estabrook died in 1830 at around the age of 90. A 1930 edition of the Fitchburg Sentinel claimed that Prince Estabrook had been buried in the same cemetery as had Nathan and Sally Estabrook - the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Ashby burial ground. A grave marker was erected there in 1930 by the U.S. War Department to honor Prince Estabrook’s service during the Revolutionary War.<br /> <br /> Park Volunteer Pete Seymour, May 2020<br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> ‘Prince Estabrook - A Brief Biography’ by Bill Poole and Charles Price<br /> ‘Appendix - Soldiers of Color on April 19, 1775’ - <a href=\"http://nps.gov\">nps.gov</a><br /> (List of men known to have been enrolled in the various militias)<br /> Photo ‘A List of the Names of Provincials ....’<br /> (<a href=\"http://PBS.org\">PBS.org</a>)<br /> ‘A Negro Man”: Prince Estabrook of Lexington’<br /> (Emerging civil <a href=\"http://war.com\">war.com</a>)<br /> Photo of grave marker in Ashby First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church burial ground<br /> (<a href=\"http://findagrave.com\">findagrave.com</a>)<br /> <br />   <hr /> <div class=\"panel panel-default\" id=\"quintalCollapsibleContent\"> <div class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"quintalCollapsibleHead\" role=\"tab\"> <h2 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#quintalCollapsibleBody\">The following is from the 2004 National Park Service study <em>Patriots of Color</em> researched and prepared by George Quintal:</a></h2> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"quintalCollapsibleHead\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"quintalCollapsibleBody\" role=\"tabpanel\" style=\"height: 0px;\"> <div class=\"panel-body quintal\"> <p>Prince Estabrook was born circa 1740.<sup>I</sup> He lived ‘in the family of Benjamin Estabrook’ of Lexington<sup>II</sup> on the Estabrook farm which stood just south of the town center on land bounded by Vine Brook on the northwest, what is now Massachusetts Avenue on the south and what is now Woburn Street on the southeast.<sup>III</sup></p> <p>With upwards of 87 other men of Capt. John Parker’s Lexington militia, he stood on Lexington Green in the early dawn of 19 April 1775. There he was wounded<sup>IV</sup> and, as such, became the first African American to be wounded in the Revolutionary War. Joseph Estabrook, Benjamin’s oldest son who had also stood on the Green, helped some of the wounded including Prince to the Estabrook home where they were treated by Dr. Joseph Fiske.<sup>V</sup> Having sufficiently recovered, he was called to service on 17 June 1775 from Concord (MA) for two days at Cambridge ‘by order of the Committee of Safety.’<sup>VI</sup> There is no known record that he joined the eight months’ service.</p> <p>As the American attack on Canada crumbled in early 1776, the call went out for reinforcement for the Northern Department. He responded by enlisting in Capt. Charles Miles’ company, in Col. Jonathan Reed’s regiment. This unit served at Ticonderoga during the time of the defeat of the American fleet on Lake Champlain under <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benedict-arnold.htm\">Gen. Benedict Arnold</a>. In a 16 February 1777 pay abstract he was allowed mileage home from Ticonderoga.<sup>VII</sup> Two days later his name appeared on a ‘company receipt for mileage and travel allowance from Ticonderoga home, dated Lexington.’<sup>VIII</sup></p> <p>On 6 November 1777 he enlisted in Capt. Simon Hunt’s company in Col. Eleazer Brooks’ regiment of militia. He was discharged on 3 April 1778 after serving nearly five months, his company having been ‘detached from militia and stationed at Cambridge.’<sup>IX</sup></p> <p>He entered the six months’ service on 28 July 1780<sup>X</sup> in Col. John Greaton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Massachusetts regiment, arriving at Springfield (MA) under the command of Ensign Boardman on 2 August 1780.

Gen. John Paterson at Camp Totoway (NJ).<sup>XIII</sup> On 9 November 1780 he was ‘on duty.’<sup>XIV</sup> He was discharged from this service on 7 April 1781, after 8 months and 21 days of service.<sup>XV</sup></p> <p>On 11 June 1781 he received a bounty from Lexington for agreeing to serve in the Continental Army for a three-year term.<sup>XVI</sup> The next day he was officially engaged and was listed on a descriptive roll as a ‘negro’ and as:<sup>XVII</sup></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">age: 40<br /> stature 5 ft. 6 in.<br /> complexion: black<br /> hair: black<br /> eyes: black<br /> occupation: farmer<br /> engaged for: Lexington</p> <p>He was listed on a 20 May 1782 as being in Capt.

After eleven years in the field, she was now flying only two trips per month, allowing her time at home with her two toddlers, her teenage stepdaughter, and her husband, a pilot for US Airways. When faced with the hijack situation on September 11, Bradshaw called United Airlines to report the emergency and describe the terrorists. Then she called her husband in their Greensboro, North Carolina home. He recalls Sandy saying that she and others on the plane were boiling water to throw on the hijackers. As the call ended, she reported that everyone was running up to first class.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Engineer and career U.S. Army officer, Horatio Gouverneur Wright graduated second in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1841 with a commission in the engineer corps. Following his graduation, Wright remained at West Point, teaching French and engineering to the cadets. Beginning in 1846, he spent the next ten years in Florida, working on improvements to coastal infrastructure and fortifications. After his promotion to captain in 1855, Wright served as assistant to the Chief of Engineers, Colonel Joseph G. Totten, in Washington D.C.<br /> <br /> At the outbreak of the Civil War, Wright participated in the unsuccessful attempt to destroy the remaining ships and guns of the Gosport (later Norfolk) Navy Yard before its occupation by Confederate forces. He then assisted in the initial construction of the defenses of Washington, D.C., before his assignment as chief engineer of the 3rd Division at the First Battle of Bull Run on April 20, 1861. Wright advanced rapidly in rank until receiving appointment as major general of volunteers in August 1862, followed by brief command of both the Department of the Ohio and Army of the Ohio. He was transferred to divisional command within VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, when Congress failed to confirm his promotion to major general.<br /> <br /> Wright assumed command of VI Corps after the death of its commander, General John Sedgwick, at Spotsylvania Court House on May 9, 1864. Three days later he was again promoted to major general of volunteers. Wright led VI Corps at Cold Harbor before his troops were rushed to Washington in the wake of Confederate General Jubal Early's attack on the capital in July 1864. On October 19th, Wright commanded the initial attack at Cedar Creek until Union General Philip Sheridan's arrival. During the Siege of Petersburg, Wright's VI Corps smashed through Confederate defenses on April 2, 1865. His troops then dealt Lee's Army of Northern Virginia a crippling blow at Sailor's Creek, capturing hundreds of Confederate soldiers, most notably Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell on April 6.<br /> <br /> After the war, Wright commanded the Department of Texas from 1865 to 1866. Returning to engineering, he served on various engineering and planning boards, and participated in the completion of the Washington Monument and construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. In 1879, Wright became Chief of Engineers with the rank of brigadier general, a position he held until his retirement in 1884.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Anthony Swart presents us with an intriguing story, and a frustrating one. He was the first enslaved person we know of by name in what eventually became Delaware, and yet beyond his name and a few other pieces of patchy information, he is largely absent from the historical record. Nevertheless, his story, as shrouded in mystery as it might be, is still foundational to the history of Delaware and the United States.<br /> <br /> The first successful European colony in what eventually became Delaware was New Sweden, centered on Fort Christina, in present day Wilmington, was established in 1638. There had been an earlier attempt to establish a Dutch colony, called Zwaanendael, in the area of Lewes, Delaware, in 1631, but this failed after only a year. New Sweden’s settlers were not exclusively Swedish, but included a mix of Dutch, Finnish, and other European colonists as well. Notably absent in that first year were any enslaved people. Swedish culture had some ingrained resistance to the concept of slavery since the abolition of thralldom in the 1300s. However, this would soon change.<br /> <br /> The following year, 1639, one of the two ships which had brought over the initial wave of colonists to New Sweden, the <i>Vogel Grip, </i>set sail to the south, headed towards the already well-established English colony of Virginia. Its mission was to trade for the lucrative commodity of tobacco, Virginia’s main export at the time. This was a failure however, and so the captain of the <i>Vogel Grip </i>appears to have made the decision to sail further south into the Caribbean, perhaps with the intention of making some easy profit by raiding Spanish shipping in the area. Sometime during this Caribbean voyage, Swart found himself aboard the <i>Vogel Grip</i>; how is unclear, though given his subsequent enslaved status it was almost certainly not by choice. How he was taken may not be clear, but <i>why </i>is easier to discern. Swart was thrust into a situation in which a number of factors came together and led to the institution of slavery in New Sweden.<br /> <br /> New Sweden, like many European colonies in the Americas, suffered from a labor shortage. This was for several reasons, chief amongst them being the difficulty in convincing sufficient numbers of Europeans to make the dangerous trans-Atlantic voyage of their own free will. Combined with a high mortality rate among those Europeans who did make the voyage, this led to scarcity of labor, both skilled and unskilled. Swart was a capable sailor and navigator, and these skills had a high premium, especially in a colony like New Sweden which was laid out along waterways. As such, the captain of the <i>Vogel Grip </i>took Anthony into bondage, bringing him back to the colony.<br /> <br /> From this point forward, Swart only appears in the historical record a few more times. He is known to have been enslaved to Johan Printz, who was the governor of New Sweden from 1643-1653. In serving Printz, Swart appears to have had extensive contact with the Lenape people, the original inhabitants of the area. It is also known that while he was the first enslaved person we know of by name in New Sweden, he was far from the last. The much larger Dutch colony of New Netherland, centered on the settlement of New Amsterdam, which would eventually be renamed to New York, was to the north. Subject to the same shortages in willing labor, the Dutch had been importing enslaved Africans for some time and were more than willing to ship more enslaved people down to New Sweden, for a price. The Dutch also sentenced Dutch colonists who had committed serious crimes to periods of forced labor, and many of those people also found themselves traded down into New Sweden. By the early 1650s, there was a significant population, probably numbering in the hundreds, of enslaved Africans in New Sweden.<br /> <br /> The colony of New Sweden was conquered by Dutch forces in 1655, and Anthony Swart drops completely off the historical record just before then. Sometime in 1654, Swart is recorded as making a purchase of supplies from a colony store, and then that is it. What happened to him can only be guessed at now. He may have gone to live with the Lenape people, as this was a relatively common choice for many escaped and freed enslaved people. He may have returned to the Caribbean. He may have simply been forced to stay in New Sweden after the Dutch invasion in 1655.<br /> <br /> We may never know for certain what his fate was, but what Swart can tell us about the history of the <i>First State </i>is important. Through him, we know that slavery was present from almost the beginning of European colonization of Delaware, despite pre-existing Swedish cultural resistance to it. The impact that slavery would have, and the legacy of its impact on Delaware and the United States as a whole, cannot be understated. Most importantly though, Swart gives a human face, however fragmentary his story may be, to the stories of the hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans who were brought to North America during the 1600s-1800s.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h4>Reflection Questions</h4> <ol> <li>What is something you wish you knew about Anthony Swart’s life? How might you try and find out the answer to your question?</li> <li>Why do you think enslaved people who escaped, or freed Black people, might choose to live with indigenous people like the Lenape rather than Europeans?</li> <li>What differences do you think there might have been when you compare Anthony’s life as an enslaved man in the mid-1600s, with that of an enslaved person in the mid-1800s?</li> </ol> <hr /> <h4>Sources</h4> <ul> <li>Muhammad, Abdullah R.

            "bodyText": "<p>Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1710, Richard Gridley became best known as the 1<sup>st</sup> American Chief of Engineers, an engineer and artillerist during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> and Siege of Boston, and as a British officer prior to 1775.</p> <p>The youngest of twelve children, Gridley worked as an apprentice for a Boston merchant at an early age. He eventually ended up in the tutelage of John Henry Bastide, a British engineer charged with improving colonial defenses.<sup>1</sup> Thus began Gridley's long and storied career in engineering.</p> <p>At thirty-five, Gridley became Lieutenant Colonel Richard Gridley, Engineer-Artillerist with the Imperial Forces of England.<sup>2</sup> He served as a military engineer during the French and Indian Wars. During the siege of Louisburg he became chief bombardier, supervised the building of batteries, and was Captain [sic] of the artillery train.<sup>3</sup> Serving in more engineering and artillery roles for the Crown in subsequent years, Gridley received a pension of land and half-pay as a British officer.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>As things heated up in the colonies, Gridley spent time trying to understand why the British concentrated their available military strength in Boston. He concluded that England did not have a military move in mind but a political move backed by military force.<sup>5</sup> However, he could not convince other provincial leaders of this nor of something that he knew well: the custom of the British Army to lie quiet and strengthen in winter and to move in the spring.<sup>6</sup> Gridley may have entered into a secret agreement with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-joseph-warren.htm\">Dr. Joseph Warren</a> (who later died at the Battle of Bunker Hill) as early as 1774 pledging they would join the rebels in the case of a break with England.<sup>7</sup> When asked by his agent in England which side he intended to fight on, Gridley replied in a letter, \"I never drew my sword but in the cause of justice and such I consider my country's to be.\"<sup>8</sup></p> <p>On April 26, 1775 – shortly after the events at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/index.htm\">Lexington and Concord</a> - the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts appointed Richard Gridley as Chief Engineer. In May he was commissioned as Colonel of Artillery with the rank of Major-General in the Grand Army.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>From the beginning of his command Gridley advocated for the fortifying of Prospect, Bunker, and Breed's Hills<sup>10</sup> located to the north of Boston, in current day Somerville and Charlestown. However, this did not happen. Not until intelligence reports brought information that the British planned to seize Charles Town Heights<sup>11</sup> did the Commander in Chief of the Massachusetts forces, General Artemus Ward, take action. He put Colonel William Prescott in command and instructed him that defenses were to be located and constructed as Engineer Gridley directed.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>The Committee of Safety sent orders to Ward to raise a strong redoubt on Bunker Hill.<sup>13</sup> There are varying reports among historians as to what took place next, but all agree that colonial officers disagreed about which hill to fortify. For generations many have argued over who ultimately chose where to fortify a position on the lower, more centrally located hill known today as \"Breed's Hill,\" rather than the higher prominence known today as \"Bunker Hill.\"<sup>14</sup> On the evening of June 16, 1775, Gridley laid out the lines of a redoubt and breastworks on Breed's Hill and supervised the hurried construction of them.<sup>15</sup> Further, according to author Raleigh Buzzaird, Gridley, \"when not busied with others, worked with spade in hand throwing up the fortifications.\"<sup>16</sup></p> <p>During the battle, Gridley fought alongside Prescott in the redoubt. They had decided that Gridley would judge when the British were within range and Prescott would give the firing commands.<sup>17</sup> Near the end of the battle, Gridley witnessed Dr. Joseph Warren's death when a musket ball hit him in the face.<sup>18</sup> Gridley himself was wounded and carried from the field. Although advanced in age, he soon recovered from his wound.<sup>19</sup> While no one questioned Gridley's personal courage during the battle, the majority of his artillery officers performed poorly, some were even court-martialed, tarnishing his reputation.<sup>20</sup> He also lost his half pay pension from the British on July 28, 1775.<sup>21</sup></p> <p>Even after the colonists' defeat at Bunker Hill, Gridley's skills as an engineer proved valuable.<sup>22</sup> Congress appointed him as colonel and chief of artillery on September 20, 1775.<sup>23</sup> However, two months later he was replaced in that role by Henry Knox.<sup>24</sup> Gridley remained as chief engineer of the army and designed the fortifications on Dorchester Heights. The rebel fortifications there and on Nook’s Hill by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General Washington</a> forced the British to evacuate the city of Boston on March 17, 1776.<sup>25</sup></p> <p>After the Continental Army left Boston in the summer of 1776, Congress, at Washington's behest, replaced Gridley as Chief Engineer.<sup>26</sup> Gridley remained in Boston as Chief Engineer of the Eastern Department.<sup>27</sup> He served in that role until his retirement from the Continental Army February 26, 1781.<sup>28</sup> He was 71 years old.</p> <p>At the forge he owned Gridley may have played a role in developing and manufacturing the first cannon for the Continental Army.<sup>29</sup></p> <p>Richard Gridley died on June 21, 1796 at the age of 86. He is buried at Canton Corner Cemetery where there is a monument to him made of Quincy Granite.<sup>30</sup> The monument carries several inscriptions including this quote by General Washington: \"I know of no man better fitted to be Chief Engineer than General Gridley.\"<sup>31</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Steven M.

Thomas Farrington’s company in the French and Indian War.<sup>IV</sup> ‘After the death of his stepmother in 1763, Barzillai Lew of Groton chose Francis Blood of Concord, Massachusetts, as his guardian. According to the town records of Chelmsford, Barzillai lived there from 1772 to 1776. He was on the Chelmsford tax list in 1775.’<sup>V</sup> Just before the Revolutionary War started, he ‘was living in that part of Lowell now known as Pawtucketville … and ‘was a free man … always called “Zeal.”’ He ‘lived on what is now called Totman Street … for nearly a century known as “the Old Zeal Road” … where he owned a farm.’<sup>VI</sup></p> <p>He enlisted in the eight months’ service from Chelmsford on 6 May 1775, in Capt.

John Ford’s company from 5 February 1776 to 1 April 1776. As the American attack on Canada crumbled, the call went out for reinforcements for the Northern Department. He responded by reenlisting in Capt. Ford’s company, which marched from Chelmsford on 25 July 1776. His name appears on a 28 August 1776 receipt for mileage and a 1 October 1776 receipt for wages, both ‘dated Ticonderoga.’ His unit served at Ticonderoga during the time of the defeat of the American fleet on Lake Champlain under <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benedict-arnold.htm\">Gen. Benedict Arnold</a>. With the British threat over for the season, most of the Americans were discharged. His discharge was at Albany on 1 January 1777.<sup>X</sup></p> <p>He engaged on 3 November 1777 as a Fifer with Capt. Joseph Bradley Varnum’s Dracut company of volunteers. They marched from home the next day but were discharged on 7 November 1777 after having traveled 40 miles.</p> <p>The 1790 census of Dracut lists him as head in a household of fourteen free people of color.<sup>XI</sup></p> <p>He died 18 January 1822 in Dracut,<sup>XII</sup> at the age of 78. He is buried in the Clay Pit Cemetery in Lowell.<sup>XIII</sup></p> <p>He married Dinah Bowman.<sup>XIV</sup> He had purchased her, circa 1767 for $400,<sup>XV</sup> from Maj. Abraham Blood. She ‘was a mulatto and almost white.’<sup>XVI</sup> Their children ‘all possessed a natural talent for music, and most of them could play any kind of wind or stringed instrument – the girls as well as the boys. They formed a complete band, and furnished music on all first-class occasions in this vicinity, and were called frequently to Boston and even as far away as Portland [ME].’<sup>XVII</sup> The thirteen children of Barzillai and Dinah were:</p> <ul> <li>Zadock <ul> <li>b. 29 April 1768 in Dracut<sup>XVII</sup></li> <li>mint.

George Sheldon relates that John Williams charged Cesar on November 10, 1771 with stealing one gallon of West Indian rum belonging to John Williams. John Williams requested that a warrant be issued for Cesar “that he may be apprehended and dealt with according to law & as in duty bound.” The warrant was issued on December 2, and Cesar was arrested the following day. At his trial, “Titus negro” served as one of two witnesses in the case. The identity of Titus is unknown … it is unclear as to whether the slave or the master paid the fine and court costs.<sup>II</sup></p> <p>Caesar remained the slave of Nathaniel Dickinson, a Tory, until ‘Caesar passed into the possession of Nathaniel’s brother, Samuel, when Nathaniel’s property was confiscated due to his Tory activities.’<sup>III</sup></p> <p>He served at the Lexington Alarm from Deerfield in Capt. Jonas Locke’s company of Minute Men in Col. Williams’ regiment.<sup>IV</sup> With thousands of others who appeared at Cambridge on the Alarm, he joined the eight month’s service in the company of Capt. Oliver Parker, in Col. William Prescott’s regiment.<sup>V</sup> This company served in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> in the redoubt.</p> <p>There is no record of any service from 1776 to 1780. On 3 April 1781 he enlisted and is shown on a descriptive roll<sup>VI </sup>as follows.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">age: 32<br /> stature: 5 ft. 7 in.<br /> complexion: black<br /> hair: black<br /> occupation: farmer<br /> residence: Deerfield<br /> enlisted: April 3, 1781<br /> term: 3 years</p> <p>For this term of service he is listed as ‘Baley, Caesar,’ the change of name indicating the distinct possibility that he had become free sometime between 1778 and 1781. The company and regiment are not listed. This is perhaps because he died in the service soon after this enlistment.<sup>VII</sup></p> <p>Caesar married Hagar ____ in Deerfield MA on 16 January 1778. They are both listed as ‘servants to Samuel Dickinson.’<sup>VIII</sup> There is no record of any children.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Based on descriptive roll – see Footnote 6.</li> <li>Moon, Jennifer. “Master and Servant: Slavery in 18<sup>th</sup> Century Deerfield” (1987), 33.

His name appears on the Bedford treasurer’s lists for the years of the war for receipt of grain and money as “bounty,” or extra pay allowed by the Town of Bedford for enlistment.</em><sup>II</sup></p> <p>No known military records list him from 1775 to 1781. On 1 May 1782, he did indeed enlist ‘to serve in the Continental Army for the term of three years,’ as a Private in Col. Benjamin Tupper’s 10<sup>th</sup> regiment. Probably due to the disbandment of the armed forces after the War, he only served a term of eight months. He received a bounty from Bedford on 11 May 1782 for his enlistment.<sup>III</sup> Town records show this bounty to be sixty pounds.<sup>IV</sup> He signed by an “X” mark with the note ‘A free negro’ appended.<sup>V</sup></p> <p>He is buried in the northeast corner of the Old Burial Grounds on Springs Road in Bedford.

            "bodyText": "<p>The following is from the 2004 National Park Service study <em>Patriots of Color</em> researched and prepared by George Quintal:</p> <div class=\"quintal\"> <p>Caesar Prutt was born on June 1727 in Hadley (MA), the son of Arthur and Jane (________) Prutt, and lived with Josiah Chauncey, Esq.<sup>I</sup></p> <p>His first tour of service was in 1758 ‘for the invasion of Canada,’ in the French and Indian Wars, under Capt. Elisha Pomeroy, in Col. Israel Williams regiment.<sup>II</sup></p> <p>He was still a slave in 1770 when he was ‘valued at £25.’<sup>III</sup> Historian James Avery Smith, who discovered a legal case in which Caesar was the defendant, drew some fascinating conclusions:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>In December of 1770, Caesar, who had been hunting, shot a deer with his musket. He was discovered dressing the carcass by Solomon Boltwood, a leading citizen of Amherst. Solomon reported the incident to the sheriff, and Caesar was brought before the Court of Sessions at Northampton on a charge of poaching. Solomon later received a small informer’s fee for his report of the incident.</em></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>At his trial in July 1771, Caesar Prutt admitted his guilt and was fined £6. This event provides several insights into the rights of slaves in Amherst. First, it shows that slaves could carry arms within the Amherst community. Second, it is obvious that there were times when a slave was “on his own,” moving about in the fields and woods without any supervision from his owner. The record of this event is also interesting as it shows that slaves were subject to the action and protection of the courts. When Prutt was found poaching, it was he, not his owner, who came before the court. In the poaching case, Prutt was given a severe sentence, as £6 was a significant fine for anyone, and he was expected to pay it with his own funds. Therefore, some slave must have earned money that they were allowed to keep as their own.</em><sup>IV</sup></p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/april-19-1775.htm\">Lexington Alarm</a> he enlisted from Amherst (MA) on 8 May 1775 into the eight months’ service, in the company of Capt. Reuben Dickinson in Col. Benjamin Ruggles Woodbridge’s regiment. His name appears on a 27 July 1775 receipt for advance pay, on the 1 August 1775 muster roll, on a 28 September 1775 company return ‘dated Prospect Hill’ and on a 26 October 1775 ‘order for bounty coat or its equivalent in money dated Prospect Hill.’<sup>V</sup></p> <p>On 1 December 1775, he enlisted in Capt. James Perry’s company in Col. Paul Dudley Sargent’s regiment. A 6 April 1776 roll lists him as ‘reported in hospital.’<sup>VI</sup></p> <p>In 1777, he enlisted from Amherst into the Continental Army under Col. Sargent for three years.<sup>VII</sup></p> <p>In his old age he became a town pauper in Amherst. Town records from 1801 to 1807 state the case:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">1801: <em>‘<strong>Caesar Prat</strong> a Town Pauper be Set up at vendue, to the Lowest bidder for Victualling and Beding and was Struck of[f] to Ins Asa Smith for one year for one Doller Per week.’</em><sup>VIII</sup></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">1802: <em>‘Voted to allow Samuel Hastings, Fortey four Dollars For Victualing and Clothing <strong>Caesar Prut</strong>, for one year, and Said Samuel is to Leave <strong>Cesar Prut</strong> as well clothed at the End of the year as he now finds him.’</em><sup>IX</sup></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">1803: <em>‘Voted that Lt.

Twelve days before the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> he, with others in his company, signed a petition to Gen. Artemus Ward ‘stating that they had enlisted to serve in Col. Nixon’s regiment, but had been shifted to Col. [Thomas] Gardner’s regiment, and requesting that they might be permitted to continue in Col. Nixon’s regiment.’ Their protest was evidently heard since we find him listed on the 1 August 1775 roll as still being in Drury’s company, in Nixon’s regiment.<sup>II</sup> Temple in his respected history of Framingham stated that Blaney ‘was in the Battle of Bunker Hill.’ Since Temple was privy to personal records that seem to no longer exist, his authority for Blaney’s involvement in the battle is accepted.<sup>III</sup></p> <p>He is listed on a company return dated Winter Hill (one of a series of Patriot fortifications surrounding Boston in the area now called Somerville) on 30 September 1775.

He is the longest service of any man of color in this study.</p> <p>He enlisted on 4 May 1775 from Framingham in the company of Capt. Thomas Drury, in Col. John Nixon’s regiment. He was stationed at Prospect Hill in July and Winter Hill in September.<sup>II</sup></p> <p>In 1776, he was engaged in the New York campaign in Capt. Micajah Gleason’s company, in Col. Thomas Nixon’s 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment, at North Castle (now Mt. Kisko NY) and was probably involved in the Battle of White Plains.<sup>III</sup></p> <p>In 1777, he enlisted in the Continental Army in Capt. Robert Allen’s company, in Col. Ichabod Alden’s regiment.<sup>IV</sup> This unit served in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/1777-campaign.htm\">Saratoga Campaign</a>.</p> <p>In 1778, the regiment was ordered to protect the New York frontiers. Upon continued assaults on border families by the Iroquois in the Cherry Valley area of New York, the regiment was ordered there to protect the inhabitants. The fort at Cherry Valley was attacked on 10 November 1778 and his Colonel was killed. Major John Brooks took command. In February 1779 he was stationed at Fort Herkimer. He was still in service in 1780 but his exact whereabouts is unknown.<sup>V</sup></p> <p>From February 1781 to June 1781, he was at West Point in Capt. Benjamin Warren’s company, in Col. John Brooks’ regiment.<sup>VI</sup> In July 1781, he was transferred to Capt. William Mills’ company at York Hutts and remained there through the end of the year. He was reported ‘sick in quarters’ in October and November 1781. By December 1781, he was ‘sick and absent,’ an indication that his sickness had gotten worse.<sup>VII</sup> During this time <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benedict-arnold.htm\">Gen.

He received a deed dated Aug. 6, 1805, of 200 acres of land, being lot No. 12, in Mars Hill near the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, “for patriotic services rendered in the Revolutionary War.” He assigned the deed to Jona. Maynard Esq. The grant was included in the tract which was surrendered to Great Britain by the Ashburton Treaty of Aug. 20, 1842. This lot, and the other granted lots and townships included within the said surrendered territory, were recently surveyed and located, and the titles obtained <em>in some way</em>, by a sharp claimant, who received from the United States Government large sums of money in payment for the same.<sup>XI</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Secretary of the Commonwealth. <em>Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War </em>(1896-1908) 7:373 per age on descriptive roll, listed as ‘Hart’ and ‘reported a negro.’ Also 2-CD Family Tree Maker<sup>TM</sup> set “<em>Military Records: Revolutionary War.</em>”</li> <li>Ibid 7:676, listed as ‘Hearts.’</li> <li>Ibid 7:373.</li> <li>Ibid 7:384, listed as ‘Harts.’</li> <li>Ibid.</li> <li>Ibid 7:674, listed as ‘Heart’; also 7:384-5 and 7:373.</li> <li>Ibid 7:676; 7:674; 7:385; 7:373.</li> <li>Ibid 7:674.</li> <li>Ibid 7:373.</li> <li>Secretary of the Commonwealth. <em>Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War </em>(1896-1908) 7:674.

            "bodyText": "<p>The following is from the 2004 National Park Service study <em>Patriots of Color</em> researched and prepared by George Quintal:</p> <div class=\"quintal\"> <p>Cuff, of African descent, was born to parents named Chambers. The date of his birth is unknown but is placed at circa 1738.<sup>I</sup> The place of his birth is also unknown but was undoubtedly Massachusetts. While Cuff died before the general pension act of 1818 and while his widow never claimed his pension during her lifetime, much of what we know about him is due to statements in the pension application<sup>II</sup> of his only-surviving daughter made after the death of her mother.</p> <p>Nothing is known of Cuff’s early life. The first record we have is of his marriage in Andover, Essex County, Massachusetts on 16 September 1762 to Bette ____, wherein both are listed as ‘Negro Servants.’<sup>III</sup> Before the war, Cuff was owned by Samuel Blanchard of Andover and took on his last name. He was known as Cuff Blanchard until the end of the war, when obtaining the freedom promised to him by Blanchard if he served, he changed his last name to Chambers in honor of his mother.<sup>IV</sup></p> <p>Six weeks after the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord, Cuff enlisted into the Andover company of Capt. Charles Furbush in the 27<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts regiment of Col. Ebenezer Bridge.<sup>V</sup> This unit of what was called ‘eight month’s men’ (due to the term of their enlistment) marched to Cambridge and became part of the army encircling Boston. Cuff was one of at least five men of color who served in Bridge’s regiment.</p> <p>No primary record exists to detail his battle service. It is certain though that elements of Bridge’s regiment went on to Breed’s Hill on the night of 16 June 1775 in order to build the redoubt that became the tomb of so many Americans the next day. It is also certain that a large portion of Furbush’s company was on the hill during the battle of 17 June 1775. Capt. Furbush himself was severely wounded early in the action and had to be carried off the field.<sup>VI</sup> Based on this knowledge and on the statement by Cuff’s daughter in 1849 that her father ‘was in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Battle at Bunker Hill</a>,’<sup>VII</sup> the presence of Cuff Blanchard at the battle is accepted as proven.</p> <p>True to his promise, Samuel Blanchard set Cuff free, though no instrument of manumission has yet been found. The progression of events is best described by Cuff’s daughter Elizabeth in 1849:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She also states that she has heard her late said Father say that his name was originally Chambers, but enlisted intro the service by the name of Cuff Blanchard because he went by that name because his master was Blanchard, & that all other colored servants went by the sir name of their <u>Masters</u>, and also that after he obtained his freedom he again went by his original name Cuff Chambers.<sup>VIII</sup></p> <p>At some point the family moved from Andover to Amherst, New Hampshire and then to Leeds, Maine.<sup>IX</sup> They were in Leeds by at least 1808 as evidenced from this extract from the records of the Leeds Baptist Church:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Lords day August 7<sup>th</sup> 1808 … Sister Elizabeth Chambers a black woman made a public declaration of her faith in our dear Saviour & love to his precious cause: to the satisfaction of the church, & was baptized<sup>X</sup></p> <p>In 1814, one of the Overseers of the Poor in Leeds contacted his counterparts in Andover to ask for support for Cuff, ‘a pauper … claiming settlement in the town of Andover.’ An overseer from Andover made the trek to Maine to prove that that the Cuff Chambers requesting support was indeed the same Cuff Blanchard who had lived in Andover. Proof made, and choosing not to require the family to remove the almshouse in Andover, the overseers of Andover granted over $100 in assistance during the three years between 1814 and 1816.<sup>XI</sup></p> <p>Cuff Chambers died in Leeds on 8 June 1818, at the probable age of 80, and his wife also died there nearly twenty-one years later at the age of 94:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Cuff Chambers a black man died June 8<sup>th</sup> 1818<br /> Betty wife of Cuff Chambers died Jan<sup>y</sup> 26<sup>th</sup> 1839<sup>XII</sup></p> <p>He is buried in the Dead River Cemetery in Leeds on a bluff overlooking the river. His grave, marked by a government stone, is honored by the Sons of the American Revolution.<sup>XIII</sup> The inscription reads:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>PVT. FORBUSH’S MASS.

Tufts Jr.’ The next year he was warned-out. By 1769 he was in Reading and described as a ‘young man.’<sup>III</sup> At some time after that he moved to Menotomy (also called West Cambridge and later Arlington), where he was on 19 April 1775:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Lord Percy’s reinforcement had been delayed for a little time at Brighton bridge, the planks of which had been taken up by the direction of the Committee of safety. But, unfortunately, they were simply piled up on the Cambridge side, and it was the work of but a few moments to replace them sufficiently to allow the troops to pass. When, however, a convoy of provisions and supplies in charge of a sergeant’s guard, following in the rear of the main body, came to the bridge, they could not cross so easily; and, in the delay incident to making it passable by the heavy wagons, and misled by false direction as to the road, they became so far separated from the troops that they could receive no protection from them. Meantime an express was sent post-haste from Old Cambridge to Menotomy, bearing the information that these supplies were on the way. Several of our men met at once in Cooper’s tavern … to form some plan for capturing them. They were of the exempts, or alarm list as it was called, all old men … in all about twelve. They chose for their leader David Lamson, a mulatto, who had served in the war, a man of undoubted bravery and determination. They took their position … behind a bank wall of earth and stones … The convoy soon made its appearance. As it came between them and the meeting-house of the First Parish, Lamson ordered his men to rise and aim directly at the horses, and called out to them to surrender. No reply was made, but the drivers whipped up their team. Lamson’s men then fired, killing several of the horses, and, according to some accounts, killing two of the men and wounding others. One of the bullets passed through the front door of the church. The frightened drivers leaped from their places, and with the guards, ran directly to the short of Spy Pond, into which they threw their guns …</em><sup>IV</sup></p> <p>On 7 May 1775 Simon Tufts, a Loyalist, listed the names of thirty men who ‘made Solemn Oath that they were personally present with their Guns within about Ten Rods of the Carts yt. were filled wth, Stores for the King’s Troops, when they were first Fired upon near Menotomy Meeting on the 19<sup>th</sup> day of April last …’ On this list of names is ‘David Lampson.’<sup>V</sup></p> <p>It was undoubtedly the same man who joined Capt. William Adam’s company in Col. Thatcher’s regiment for five days, marching ‘at request of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">Gen. Washington</a> at the time of taking <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/dohe.htm\">Dorchester Heights</a> March 4, 1776.’<sup>VI</sup> Later that year he had enlisted from Lexington in Capt. Simon Hunt’s company in Col. John Brooks’ regiment, serving at Rye [NY] where he was ‘reported sick.’<sup>VII</sup> Once again, it is undoubtedly the same man who enlisted from Cambridge in Capt. Stephen Dana’s company in Col. Josiah Whitney’s regiment, serving at South Kingston (RI) for two months and five days from his arrival on 17 May 1777.<sup>VIII</sup> With Gen. Burgoyne preparing to advance on northern New York, the call once again went out for soldiers to meet this serious threat. He joined the Massachusetts militia on 20 August 1777, in the company of Capt. Joseph Fuller in Col. Samuel Bullard’s regiment. This regiment served at the second <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/1777-campaign.htm\">Battle of Saratoga</a> on 7 October 1777. He was discharged on 29 November 1777 and was allowed 240 miles home.<sup>IX</sup></p> <p>In 1787 he moved from Cambridge to Charlestown.<sup>X</sup> The 1790 census of Charlestown lists him alone as a free man as head of his household.<sup>XI</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>He would have had to be 16 or older in order to serve in the French and Indian Wars (1756-1763). However, to be called a ‘young man’ in 1769 (see Wyman, Thomas Bellows. <em>The Genealogies and Estates of Charlestown, Massachusetts 1629-1818</em> (1879). 2 vols. 539), he would probably not have been older than 29.

            "bodyText": "<p>The following is from the 2004 National Park Service study <em>Patriots of Color</em> researched and prepared by George Quintal:</p> <div class=\"quintal\"> <p>Ryal, as he was called, ‘was purchased in Boston as an infant and brought to Dracut’ where he became a servant in the household of Joseph Bradley Varnum<sup>I</sup> but was ‘early manumitted.’ ‘He was a man who possessed dignity of manner and was respected and trusted by the family with whom he lived.’<sup>II</sup></p> <p>He enlisted on 29 April 1775 into the company of Capt. Jonas Richardson, in Col. James Frye’s regiment. He was listed on the October roll of the company.<sup>III</sup> On 22 December 1775, he is recorded on an ‘order for bounty coat or its equivalent in money dated Camp at Cambridge.’<sup>IV</sup></p> <p>On 1 January 1776, he enlisted in the company of Capt. Joshua Reed, in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/vafo/learn/historyculture/generalvarnum.htm\">Col. James Mitchell Varnum’s</a> 9<sup>th</sup> Continental Infantry.<sup>V</sup> By the time Col. James Mitchell Varnum was promoted to Brigadier-General in 1777, Silas Royal had become his body servant and ‘accompanied him in his military expeditions.’ At some point during the war, he served as a privateersman ‘on board the brig <em>Franklin</em>, … at Salem, and drew £30 as his share of prize money.’<sup>VI</sup></p> <p>While home in 1778, he was seized and imprisoned in a conspiracy to sell him as a slave in the South. Nearly the entire Varnum family set out to rescue him. The story is best told by citing the Varnum diary verbatim:<sup>VII</sup></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Jan 19 1778 – This morning while at breakfast heard that Joshua Wyman had sold Ryal Varnum, that ye News was brought from Westford by Jos. Varnum Jr. & that said Ryal was carried off in a covered waggon. Handcuffed – on hearing of which I immediately called for my horse, Galloped to Jos. Varnum’s to Know ye Certainty. He confirmed it, Sent him to Capt. Jo’s to come Immediately. Sent Jonas with my horse. Gave Jonas $20 to bare his expenses, with orders to pursue with all possible speed, overtake, Bring back and not suffer arbitrary voyalance to Escape with Impunity. They pursued, came to Woburn, found the News confirmed. That it was the Infamous Joner White, the Scurrilous Tinker of Haverhill, that Bought him (at ye same time knowing sd Ryal was a free man) sd White had Imprisoned him, Woburn people had liberated him. Sd White laid a false charge against him. Said he was an Inlisted soldier in ye Continental service: that he had received $20 Continental money & had Deserted, that he had stole from Sundry persons & was a thief & that if ye prison Could not hold him ye Guard should & profanely swore that he had brought him & would have him some way on that Complaint. Altho he knew it to be false he put him under guard. There is ye Infamous White that hath worked himself by some means as some way to be a quartermaster for ye Army at or near Boston, a fine post to get money when Truth Nor Honor is not regarded.</em></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Jan 20. Capt. Joseph & Jonas Varnum went to Boston, Complained to General Heath against said White, had sd Ryal Liberated, and a promise from the Genl. that he would take Notice of said White. They gave sd White Just Character to ye General, he promised he would take Notice of it. They went to White, Informed him what they had done. He was extremely angry. Curst & swore very profanely. They delt with him very sharply for his Conduct to Ryal. He said he did not know that Ryal was free. They told him that he Did know that his Crime aledged against Ryal, for which he was put under gaol was true, but that he knew ye contrary. He said that all such Neagrows ought to be slaves. They told him that Ryal was as Good a man & of as much Honor as he, at which he was extremely angry & profain. Laid his hand on his Hanger by his side. They told him they had seen Hangers & men before they had seen him or his, that they were Ready to answer him any way he pleased, that they on sd Ryal Behalf, should Bring an action of Damage for false Imprisonment, that such men stealers should not go unpunished. They came to Wymans same Day. Gave him ye like Trimming.</em></p> <p>The Varnum’s kept their promise to institute court proceedings. Silas Royal received a judgement in his favor of one hundred pounds, from the Middlesex County (MA) Court of Common Pleas, in September 1777.<sup>VIII</sup> Gen. James Mitchell Varnum<sup>IX</sup> of Rhode Island, the brother of Capt. Joseph Bradley Varnum, filed an action against Joshua Wyman before the October term of the Superior Court of Bristol County (RI) in 1779. John White, who had purchased Ryal from Wyman, published a deposition:<sup>X</sup></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>I, John White solemnly declare that I purchased a Negro named Royal of one Joshua Wyman of Woburn in the County of Middlesex, State of Massachusetts Bay, sometime the last of spring or beginning of summer 1778, for which I paid nine fifty six pounds lawful money, sd Wyman declaring to me on his word of honor that if I would sell the sd Royal to some other Southern Officer, so that he might never again return to New England, he would give me some consideration therefor (as he said on account of his infamous character as a thief &c) and that the said Wyman still retains the money from me that I gave him for said Negro, alledging that he is my slave for life and that it is my fault that I do not make him so. This I solemnly protest to be the truth.</em></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 440px;\"><em>John White</em></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Newburyport Sept 28, 1779.</em></p> <p>Silas Royal remained with the Varnum family after the war. This anecdote tells of his dignity in the manner:<sup>XI</sup></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>He was extremely punctilious as to respect he felt due him as Gen. Varnum’s servant. If any young men failed to take off their hats to him when they met him on the road, he would cry out, “Boys, where’s your manners?” and failing recognition, would send his cane after them in double quick time.</em></p> <p>Gen. James Mitchell Varnum thought so highly of Silas Royal’s long and faithful service that he remembered him in his will:<sup>XII</sup></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>My will is that Silas Royal, a Black man, who had been for a long time supported by me, free from expense to himself or the Town, be comfortably supported through life, and honorable buried after death, at the expense of my Estate, provided, the small property which he has been indulged in the possession of shall not be transferred to any person but my residuary legatees.</em></p> <p>He ‘was tenderly cared for and had a room in the family mansion. He died several years after Gen. Varnum on May 3 1826 and, at his own request, was buried beside an Indian in one corner of the Varnum burial ground at the Varnum homestead.’<sup>XIII</sup> There is no record of marriage or children.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Coburn, Silas R. <em>History of Dracut Massachusetts … </em>(1922), 334.</li> <li>Ibid, 335.</li> <li>Secretary of Commonwealth. <em>Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War</em> (1896-1908), 13:639, listed as ‘Royal.’ Also 2-CD Family Tree Maker<sup>TM</sup> set <em>“Military Records: Revolutionary War.”</em></li> <li>Ibid 13:638, listed as ‘Royall.’</li> <li>Ibid 13:637, listed as ‘Royal.’</li> <li>Coburn, Silas R. <em>History of Dracut Massachusetts … </em>(1922), 335.</li> <li>Ibid, 335-6.</li> <li>Coburn, Silas R. <em>History of Dracut Massachusetts … </em>(1922), 338.</li> <li>This is the same man who ‘proposed raising a battalion of African Americans in Rhode Island’ per Moebs, Thomas Truxton. <em>Black Soldiers – Black Sailors – Black Ink: Research Guide on African-Americans in U.S. Military History, 1526-1900:…</em> (1994), 1126.

The Varnum Burial round is on Parker Road in Dracut. This cemetery was visited in September 2000 but no gravestone could be found for Silas Royal. There is a section in the right rear that has no stones and it would seem logical that he is buried there. NOTE: Dracut VR’s list his name as ‘Riol’ and his death on 2 May 1826.</li> </ol> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/quintal-patriotsofcolor.htm\">Learn more about Quintal's study.</a></p> </div> <script>document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\",\"<style type='text/css'>.quintal{background: #e3e3e3;padding:1rem;border-left: 3px solid black;font-weight: bold;} .quintal blockquote {font-style:italic;} .quintal ol {list-style:upper-roman;}</style>\");</script>",

Ephraim Chenery, in Col. John Smith’s regiment. With thousands of others who appeared at Cambridge after the Alarm, he joined the eight month’s service in the company of Capt. Benjamin Bullard, in Col. Jonathan Brewer’s regiment.<sup>II</sup> This company served in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> on the diagonal.</p> <p>There is no record of 1776 service.</p> <p>On 3 May 1777 he enlisted into the company of Capt.

Sabin Mann’s company from which he was transferred to and enlisted into the Continental Army for three years on 8 September 1777, in the company of Capt. Moses Knapp and the regiment of Col. William Shepard.<sup>IV</sup> This unit served at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/1777-campaign.htm\">Saratoga</a><sup>V</sup> and Rhode Island.<sup>VI </sup></p> <p>He next served at the Hudson Highlands in the same regiment (Shepard’s 4<sup>th</sup>) but in Capt. David Holbrook’s company, where he is listed on a descriptive roll<sup>VII</sup> as follows:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">age: 23<br /> stature: 6 ft.<br /> complexion: black<br /> hair: black<br /> residence: Medfield<br /> enlisted Jan. 1, 1780</p> <p>In May through September 1781 he served at West Point. From October 1781 through February 1782 he served at ‘York Hutts.’<sup>VIII</sup> He was discharged in 1783.<sup>IX</sup></p> <p>It is undoubtedly the same James ‘Archelus’ who is listed in the Dedham records of 23 February 1784:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">the Selectmen issued a warrant … to warn out James Archelus, Hannah his wife, and their child, James Petine, they not being inhabitants…<sup>X</sup></p> <p>He applied for bounty land on 10 August 1789, which land was assigned to Richard Platt.<sup>XI</sup> He applied for a U.S. pension on 25 April 1818,<sup>XII</sup> which was granted for $96.00 a year.<sup>XIII</sup> An affidavit by one of his officers in 1818 confirms his 1777 service and further describes him as ‘a man of Colour.’<sup>XIV</sup> He reapplied on 17 July 1820 in order to prove his need. An inventory of his estate included: <sup>XV</sup></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">1 Scythe & Staff<br /> 1 Axe<br /> 1 Iron pot<br /> 1 [Iron] kettle<br /> 1 Tea Kettle<br /> 1 ____<br /> 1 pair shovel & tongs<br /> 1 old wooden Clock<br /> 1 Rake<br /> 1 old ___ feet table<br /> 3 old chairs<br /> 2 knives & forks<br /> 2 Bowls & spoons<br /> 2 little old chests<br /> 1 pair dogs<br /> 2 ___ & ____</p> <p>Nowhere in his pension does he mention his 1775 service though it is nearly certain that he served.<sup>XVI</sup></p> <p>He married Hannah _____.<sup>XVII</sup> They had at least one son:<sup>XVIII</sup></p> <ul> <li>James Petine<sup> </sup></li> </ul> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Birth date backwardly-computed, based on age in pension application.</li> <li>Ibid 1:289.</li> <li>Ibid.</li> <li>Ibid 1:288, 289.</li> <li>Research notes of compiler.</li> <li>Secretary of the Commonwealth. <em>Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War </em>(1896-1908) 1:288.

            "bodyText": "<p>While many people know of Paul Revere as an ardent supporter of the American Revolution and an accomplished master silversmith, there is more to his story. After the Revolution, he established a successful foundry and copper mill. A public-spirited citizen, Revere was also ambitious and often brash, traits which he embraced during both his Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary life.</p> <p>Born in Boston's North End on December 21, 1734, Revere was the third of nine children and oldest surviving son.<sup>1</sup> His father, Apollos Rivoire, was a French Huguenot (Protestant) who emigrated to Boston at thirteen. Apollos anglicized his name to Paul Revere, passing his name and goldsmith trade to his son. His mother, Deborah Hichborn, descended from seventeenth-century English Puritan emigrants to Massachusetts.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Paul Revere likely finished school at thirteen and became his father's apprentice. When his father died on July 22, 1754, nineteen-year-old Revere could not legally operate a shop for two more years. In February 1756, he instead found a patriotic way to earn money.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>From February to November 1756, Second Lieutenant Paul Revere was an artillery officer in New York, joining thousands of Massachusetts men who served in New York and Canada during the Seven Years' War. He saw no military action, returning home unharmed, with money to quickly resume civilian life.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>He married Sarah Orne on August 4, 1757. They had eight children between 1758-1773.<sup>5</sup> Revere made shoe and knee buckles for fellow artisans and elegant tea pots and sugar bowls for merchants. When he joined St. Andrew's Lodge of Freemasons on September 9, 1760, he gained a steady stream of customers. By 1763, when Great Britain defeated France, Revere owned a thriving business.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>In 1764, Revere's income was £102. In 1765, after Great Britain passed the Sugar and Stamp Acts to pay for the Seven Years' War, his income dropped to £64. This decrease in pay due to new taxes possibly motivated Revere to become a Son of Liberty.<sup>7</sup> As he later explained, Great Britain \"wanted to make us hewers of wood and drawers of water [enslaved people].\"<sup>8</sup></p> <p>In February 1770, Revere bought a home in <a href=\"https://www.paulreverehouse.org/\">North Square in the North End</a>. As a Son of Liberty and member of the North End Caucus, Revere engraved political cartoons and helped plan and implement resistance to British policies.<sup>9</sup> His career as a \"Messenger of the American Revolution\" began on December 17, 1773, carrying news of the Boston Tea Party to New York. Thereafter, he regularly relayed information between the Boston Committee of Correspondence and the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>On October 10, 1773, five months after the death of his first wife, Revere married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/rachel-revere.htm\">Rachel Walker</a>. While her husband was away delivering political information, Rachel Revere cared for six surviving stepchildren and gave birth to eight of her own.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>Revere's April 18-19, 1775, ride to Lexington was an intelligence mission directed by Boston’s Revolutionary leader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-joseph-warren.htm\">Dr. Joseph Warren</a> and executed by Paul Revere, William Dawes, and a network of individuals. Based on spying by Revere and others, the likely object of a British expedition seemed to be either the arrest of John Hancock and Samuel Adams in Lexington or the seizure of munitions in nearby Concord. Although British soldiers captured Revere before he got to Concord, he had provided earlier warnings.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>Revere's Revolutionary service as Lieutenant Colonel of the Massachusetts Artillery ended in charges of insubordination, neglect of duty, and cowardice for his role in a massive amphibious assault to take Fort George in Penobscot Bay, Maine. After nearly taking the British fort on July 28, 1779, militia and naval officers spent over two weeks heatedly debating whether to continue the siege. In Councils of War on August 7 and 13, Revere voted with the minority to end the siege. British naval reinforcements arrived on August 13, resulting in a chaotic retreat, with high casualties and enormous cost.<sup>13</sup></p> <p>After the failed assault, a military court charged Revere with two charges of insubordination for ordering his men to retreat without orders from his commanding officer, General Solomon Lovell, and for not immediately turning over a boat to Brigadier General Peleg Wadsworth to evacuate the crew of a schooner drifting towards the enemy. Since he considered the siege over, Revere believed he was no longer under Lovell's command. He admitted not immediately obeying Wadsworth's order, saying \"he had all his private baggage\" on the boat \"but afterwards ordered her to go.\" During his court-martial, Revere aggressively and successfully cross-examined witnesses who testified to his general military ineptitude. His best defense was the panicked retreat of the expedition. He was fully exonerated on February 19, 1782.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>The post-Revolutionary Revere became a prosperous entrepreneur and respected citizen, owning a silver shop, hardware shop, foundry, and copper mill. He took pride in making useful manufactures for his country.<sup>15</sup> Revere held several civic offices, including Grand Master of the Massachusetts Grand Lodge, Suffolk County Coroner, and President of the Boston Board of Health.<sup>16</sup></p> <p>Paul Revere died in Boston on May 10, 1818, at the age of eighty-three. The <em>Boston Intelligencer and Evening Gazette</em> called him \"cool in thought, ardent in action\" and noted both his benevolent character and service \"in the early days of our Revolutionary drama…as well as at a later period of its progress.\"<sup>17</sup></p> <p>It would take another forty-three years for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to make Paul Revere a legend.<sup>18</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.paulreverehouse.org/biography/\">The Paul Revere House - Paul Revere Biography</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.paulreverehouse.org/the-real-story/\">The Paul Revere House - The Real Story of Revere's Ride</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/paul-reveres-ride.htm\">Longfellow House Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site - Paul Revere's Ride</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Longfellow House Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>When Great Britain began using the \"New Style\" or Gregorian Calendar, Revere’s date of birth became January 1, 1735.

Revere rode to Concord on April 8 and Lexington on April 16. On April 18, Warren ordered Revere and Dawes to ride to Lexington. They continued to Concord on their own, aided by Dr. Samuel Prescott of Concord. Revere wrote three accounts of his ride: a deposition for the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, written within a month of the event, a slightly revised deposition, and a more detailed 1798 letter to Jeremy Belknap of the Massachusetts Historical Society, in Paul Revere's <em>Three Accounts of his Famous Ride: A Massachusetts Historical Society Picture Book</em> (Boston: MHS, 1976). The most complete analysis of his ride is in Fischer, <em>Paul Revere's Ride</em>.

He believed he was the victim of a \"deep laid\" plan by two accusers, disgruntled former members of his regiment. Revere's brash personality may have caused tension in the regiment and during the Penobscot Expedition. Disobeying the order from General Wadsworth was a perfect example of insubordination. Ironically, Wadsworth was the maternal grandfather of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who made Revere famous.

He opened a copper mill in 1801, after several years of experimentation and a $10,000 loan from the United States government, which he repaid in copper sheeting. In his letters, he often bragged about the quality of his works, claiming they were equal to British manufactures. His trade card, c. 1796-1803, lists his work, including \"Cast Bells and Brass Cannon…Manufacture Sheets (copper sheeting)…Bolts, Spikes, Nails, etc….\" The most complete account of Revere’s post-Revolutionary industrial career is Robert Martello, <em>Midnight Ride, Industrial Dawn: Paul Revere and the Growth of American Enterprise</em> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2010.)

Her childhood summers and time as a waitress at the Ranch cemented her connection to the park. In her adult years, Susan supported the park as the first Vice Chairperson of the <a href=\"https://lassenparkfoundation.org/\">Lassen Park Foundation</a>. She remained dedicated to the conservation of the park well into her later years, even celebrating her eightieth birthday on Lassen Peak summit.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{ad2e7549-f0ad-4b3e-8ccd-45f608ea97ac}{192}\" paraid=\"713627040\">Childhood Memories  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{ad2e7549-f0ad-4b3e-8ccd-45f608ea97ac}{208}\" paraid=\"1650898546\">Susan Watson first came to Drakesbad Guest Ranch in Warner Valley with her family in 1931, when she was just three years old. The Watson family then revisited the Drakesbad Guest Ranch every year until 1941, excluding 1935. At the time Susan and her sister Connie were the youngest guests. Susan was quoted as saying, “Drakesbad was the highlight of the summer. We really looked forward to it. We loved it there. Somehow, we were never bored, even though in the thirties, we didn’t have companions up there. There were so many things to do.” As two of the only children at Drakesbad, Susan and Connie turned to exploring Warner Valley’s lakes, hydrothermal features, and meadows.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{ad2e7549-f0ad-4b3e-8ccd-45f608ea97ac}{208}\" paraid=\"1650898546\">A Wartime Dude Ranch</h2> <p paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{3}\" paraid=\"1654984267\">The Sifford family—Alexander, Ida, Pearl, and Roy—ran the ranch during the Great Depression and World War II years, when they also began raising cattle to support the war effort. The small guest ranch turned into a dude ranch, while attempting to maintain the cultural and scenic standards that caretakers had maintained since 1900. As Susan described it, <em>“</em>but one foot, as it were, were in Victorian manners and mores, and the other foot was in the twentieth century, which was exuberant and technologically going for it. So there was that kind of contrast in that way. But it was held together by how we were living our lives. It was not noticeable, certainly, to very young children. We just accepted what we were born into and how it operated.”<em> </em>Visitation was low during those years so often only very dedicated returnees came to the ranch.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{3}\" paraid=\"1654984267\">At Work at the Ranch</h2> <p paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{41}\" paraid=\"131382332\">At age 17, Susan worked as a waitress at Drakesbad in 1945. This was her first look behind-the-scenes at Drakesbad. She describes watching the chef cook on a huge solid iron range in the back to prepare the meals for all of the guests. Watson noticed that the fresh milk they served every day varied greatly based on the temperature outside, and would try and save young guests from drinking the sour milk. She recalls one of the most difficult parts being memorizing the food orders. “We’d have to take it, remember who ordered what and all of these separate things, take it to the kitchen, break it down again for the cook and for side support, reassemble everything, and get it back, and serve it to the right people. And I made very few errors.” Working at Drakesbad gave Susan an insight into how her childhood vacation spot operated and the immense effort it took to have it run smoothly.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{41}\" paraid=\"131382332\">The Sifford Family</h2> <p paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{85}\" paraid=\"2050220637\">The Sifford family ran the ranch from 1900 to 1952. Susan Watson became close friends with the Siffords as a result of all the time she spent there. She describes their vision for Drakesbad as, “Decorum, with a capital D, really. And that was both a mirror of the age and a requirement for Roy’s vision of having a civilization in the middle of the wilderness, the charm of that distinction.” Susan worked hard to support Roy’s vision, even after the Sifford family gave the Ranch over to the park. Roy Sifford sold Drakesbad Guest Ranch to the National Park Service in 1956.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{85}\" paraid=\"2050220637\">Lassen Park Foundation</h2> <p paraeid=\"{5d2a4962-8d26-47ed-9c0e-8c9ca8fb78fb}{129}\" paraid=\"2071353253\">Susan Watson became the Vice Chairperson of Lassen Park Foundation upon its organization in 1985. She had remained connected to the park through adulthood, bringing her husband and children to Drakesbad. Susan used her position as Vice Chairperson to fundraise for park projects. She celebrated her eightieth birthday on the top of Lassen Peak.<br /> <br /> Susan also advocated for other natural areas as well. She advocated for Save Mount Diablo and the East Bay Regional Park District in the San Francisco Bay area, and many other organizations. Susan won many conservation awards such as the 2005 William Penn Mott Jr. Environmental Award of the Orinda Association, which led to additional recognition from the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors, California Legislature and the US Congress; a 2001 Mountain Star Leadership Award by Save Mount Diablo, a Legacy Award for Lifetime Achievement, First Annual Women of Achievement Award; the Environmentalist of the Year Award from Mt. Diablo Silverado Council of BSA in 1997; and the 1992 John Muir Conservation Award (with her husband, Robert) as long-time President of Save Mount Diablo and coordinator of the Technical Advisory Committee for Lassen Volcanic Park and Forest. She was also instrumental in the development of the Lassen Crossroads Regional Interpretative Center from 1985-2001.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, born to a prominent family of South Carolina's Lowcountry, had a long career as a politician and served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. He was also a signer of the US Constitution and twice put forward as the Federalist candidate for the presidency, losing to Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in 1804 and 1808. <br /> <br /> Pinckney was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1746 to Charles Pinckney, a lawyer and member of the provincial council, and Elizabeth (Eliza) Lucas, who helped introduce indigo cultivation in South Carolina. In 1753, Pinckney accompanied his family to London, where his father served as the colony's agent until 1758. Pinckney received an excellent education in England, first attending Westminster School, and then Christ Church College, Oxford, and the Middle Temple. His legal training at the Middle Temple prepared him for a thriving legal practice when he returned to South Carolina in 1769. He also entered public service when he returned home, representing St. John's Colleton Parish during the remainder of royal rule. Pinckney also served in the militia, attaining the rank of colonel. <br /> <br /> On September 28, 1773 Pinckney married Sarah Middleton, daughter of the wealthy and well connected Henry Middleton. The marriage produced four children. Through this marriage, Pinckney joined a circle of revolutionaries in the South Carolina Lowcountry, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/arthur-middleton.htm\">Arthur Middleton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/edward-rutledge.htm\">Edward Rutledge</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-henry-drayton.htm\">William Henry Drayton</a>. By early 1775, Pinckney was a member of all the important revolutionary committes. He advocated for the preparation of Charleston harbor defenses against potential British attack and supported training a rebel army.<br /> <br /> Once hostilities erupted with Great Britain, Pinckney turned his attention entirely to military matters. He commanded the First South Carolina Regiment during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan's Island</a> in June 1776 but did not participate directly in the battle. Pinckney later joined the northern army under General George Washington and saw combat in the battles around Philadephia at Brandywine and Germantown. When the British refocused their strategy on the south, Pinckney returned to the Southern Department and commanded a regiment at the siege of Savannah. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">siege of Charleston</a> in 1780, Pinckney commanded the garrison at Fort Moultrie, which fell to the British without a fight on May 7. With the surrender of Charleston and the army defending it, the British placed Pinckney under house arrest at Snee Farm with General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-moultrie.htm\">William Moultrie</a> and attempted to lure him away from the patriot cause. Pinckney was exchanged in Philadelphia in 1782. He rejoined the southern army but saw no further action. After his first wife, Sarah Middleton, died in 1784, Pinckney married Mary Stead in 1786. <br /> <br /> Following the war, Pinckney turned his attention to rebuilding his law practice and his rice plantations. In 1787, he served as one of four South Carolinian delegates to the Constitutional Convention, where he defended the interests of southern slaveholding planters and argued for the retention of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Pinckney argued that \"while there remained one acre of swampland uncleared of South Carolina, I would raise my voice against restricting the importation of negroes....the nature of our climate and the flat, swampy situation of our country, obliges us to cultivate our lands with negroes, and that without them South Carolina would soon be a desert waste...” Pinckney also commented on the irony and duality of American freedom and American slavery when he said, \"Bills of rights generally begin with declaring that all men are by nature born free. Now, we should make that declaration with a very bad grace, when a large part of our property consists in men who are actually born slaves.\"</p> <p><br /> A Federalist, Pinckney was a leading figure in South Carolina's ratification of the new federal Constitution in 1788. He later drafted his state's 1790 constitution. Offered positions in President George Washington's cabinet, Pinckney refused all the offices. Pinckney accepted the post of Minister to France in 1796. He assumed the position during a difficult time in Franco-American relations as the Jay Treaty with Great Britain angered France. Additionally, the French First Republic directed its navy to seize American merchant ships engaged in trade with Great Britain. When Pinckney arrived to present his credentials to the French government, the French informed him that no American minister would be recognized during the current crisis. Pinckney was outraged. The next year, President John Adams appointed him as one of three commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the French government. When French diplomats demanded a bribe from their American counterparts to faciliate negotiations, Pinckney is credited as exclaiming, \"No, no, not a sixpence!\" and urged his government to raise \"millions for defense but not one cent for tribute.\" This episode of American and French hostility, known as the XYZ Affair, led to the Quasi-War with France and strained Adams' presidency. <br /> <br /> In 1798, President Adams, anticipating war with France, appointed Pinckney as commander of the southern department of the US Army. Pinckney was discharged from service in 1800. Pinckney returned to politics in 1800 as the Federalist Party's vice-presidential candidate. In 1804 and 1808, he was the Federalist candidate for president, but he never actively campaigned. Pinckney devoted the remainder of his life to his plantations and agricultural science, civic service, and helped establish the South Carolina College in 1801. Pinckney died on August 16, 1825 in Charleston. </p> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Francis Marion, the “Swamp Fox,” was born at his family’s plantation in Berkeley County, South Carolina in 1732. A planter, Marion built his home, Pond Bluff, in 1773 in the area of Eutaw Springs, a site now beneath the waters of Lake Marion. His first military service, like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-sumter.htm\">Thomas Sumter</a>’s, came in the Cherokee War (1759-1761), part of the larger French and Indian War. His experience in frontier warfare against the Cherokees likely influenced his partisan warfare tactics against the British and loyalists from 1780-82 in South Carolina.<br /> <br /> In 1775, Marion was a member of the South Carolina Provincial Congress. On June 21, he was commissioned a captain in the 2nd South Carolina Regiment under Colonel <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-moultrie.htm\">William Moultrie</a>. He was present at the famous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan’s Island</a> on June 28, 1776 when approximately 400 South Carolinians successfully repulsed a Royal Navy fleet attacking Charleston Harbor.<br /> <br /> After the victory, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army. Marion commanded the Second South Carolina Regiment at the disastrous Franco-American siege of Savannah in autumn 1779. Fortunately for the patriot cause, Marion was recovering at his estate from an injury, incurred from jumping out of a second-story window to leave a party in which the series of toasts had led to distasteful drunkenness, when C<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">harleston fell to the British in May 1780</a>. Escaping to North Carolina, he and a small party joined General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/horatio-gates.htm\">Horatio Gates</a>’s army but was not present with the force at the defeat at Camden in August.<br /> <br /> Marion challenged British rule in the South Carolina lowcountry after these two military disasters and targeted British lines of communication and supply. His tactics frustrated British efforts to mobilize loyalists in the Georgetown District. Between August and December 1780, Marion gained national recognition for his actions at Great Savannah, Black Mingo, Tearcoat Swamp, and Georgetown. British Lieutenant Colonel <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/banastre-tarleton.htm\">Banastre Tarleton</a>, sent to find and neutralize Marion and his men, despaired given the difficulty of the mission, stating “as for this old Fox, the Devil himself could not catch him!”<br /> <br /> Marion, unlike Thomas Sumter, coordinated effectively in the field with the Continental Army, led by Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanael-greene.htm\">Nathanael Greene</a>. Together with “Light Horse” Harry Lee’s Legion, Marion captured Fort Watson on the Santee River in April 1781 and then Fort Motte in May, forcing the British to evacuate Camden. Marion commanded South Carolina militia in advance lines along with Brig. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/andrew-pickens.htm\">Andrew Pickens</a> at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September 1781, the last major battle in the Carolinas, in which the British suffered so many casualties they ceased further inland campaigning.<br /> <br /> Following victory over the British, Marion returned to his plantation and pursued a career in politics. He served several terms in the South Carolina State Senate and also received the honorary position of commander of Fort Johnson in 1784, for which he received a stipend of $500 annually. He died on his estate in 1795 and was buried at Belle Isle Plantation Cemetery in Berkeley County, South Carolina.",

            "bodyText": "Isaac Huger, an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, first acquired combat experience in 1761 in the Cherokee War, part of the larger French and Indian War. Born at Limerick Plantation on the Cooper River, he was the second son of Daniel Huger, a wealthy Huguenot merchant and planter, and Mary Cordes. As the son of a wealthy planter, Isaac Huger followed the colonial trend of pursuing a formal education in Europe. On March 23, 1762, Huger married Elizabeth Chalmers; they had eight children together.<br /> <br /> A veteran of the Cherokee War, in which he served as an officer in Colonel Thomas Middleton's Provincial Regiment, the Provincial Congress of South Carolina in 1775 selected Huger as lieutenant colonel of the First South Carolina Regiment. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan's Island</a>, Huger's 1st SC Regiment garrisoned Fort Johnson on James Island and took no part in defeating the British attack on Charleston. During the years of peace that followed in the south, Huger was promoted to colonel. On January 9, 1779, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Continental army. <br /> <br /> Huger fought and was wounded at the Battle of Stono Ferry on June 20, 1779, and commanded the South Carolina and Georgia militia during the siege of Savannah in October 1779. During the siege of Charleston in the spring of 1780, he was placed in command of the light horse and militia outside the city. Lt. Col. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/banastre-tarleton.htm\">Banastre Tarleton</a>'s British Legion, a unit of loyalist dragoons, surprised and routed Huger's force at Moncks Corner on April 14, 1780. Illness kept Huger from capture with the surrender of Charleston, and he later rejoined the southern army under Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/horatio-gates.htm\">Horatio Gates</a> in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Huger was present when Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanael-greene.htm\">Nathanael Greene</a> took command of the Southern Department in Charlotte later in December. Serving under Greene, Huger commanded a brigade of Virginia Continentals at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, suffering a wound. Commanding the same regiment at the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill on April 25, Huger tried to stem the damage from the withdrawal of the Maryland Continentals. With the retreat of the British from the interior to Charleston, Huger was reunited with his family and returned to his home, ending his military service. <br /> <br /> Huger represented St. George's Dorchester parish in the Jacksonborough Assembly in January 1782 and served in the legislature until his election as sheriff in 1785. His appointment as the first federal marshal for South Carolina occurred in 1789, a position he held for five years. He died in Charleston on October 6, 1797. ",

            "bodyText": "The eldest son of Dr. John Rutledge and Sarah Hext, John Rutledge studied law with his uncle Andrew Rutledge and with James Parsons in Charleston before attending the Middle Temple in London. Admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1761, he quickly became one of the most successful attorneys in the colony. On May 1, 1763 he married Elizabeth Grimké. They had ten children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. <br /> <br /> Rutledge served in the Commons House of Assembly from 1761 to 11775 and became one of its leaders. He upheld the political rights of fellow colonists as British subjects in a series of disputes with royal governors and firmly opposed the Stamp, Townshend, and Tea Acts, representing South Carolina at the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. As a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he advocated defending the rights of colonists while personally hoping for reconciliation with Great Britain. When events made reconciliation impossible, he reluctantly accepted independence as the path forward. Later in the debate over independence at the Continental Congress, his brother, Edward Rutledge, swayed his fellow South Carolinians to vote unanimously in favor of independence. <br /> <br /> As royal authority dissolved in his own and other colonies, Rutledge supported a congressional resolution for the creation of new governments based on constitutions created by the people, not royal charters, until the crisis was resolved. He left Congress in November 1775 to carry that resolution to South Carolina. Rutledge was one of the drafters of the state constitution of 1776 and was elected president (governor) of South Carolina in March 1776. Under his leadership, the new state repulsed a British attack on Charleston in June 1776 and suppressed a Cherokee uprising later that summer.<br /> <br /> Rutledge resigned as governor in March 1778 to protest adoption of a new state constitution of which he disapproved, but he was elected governor under that constitution in February 1779. When the British captured Charleston and established posts throughout South Carolina in 1780, Rutledge escaped and functioned as a one-man government in exile. He twice visited Philadephia to seek additional aid for the South but spent most of his time with the Continental Army in the South to organize and supply his state's militia for continued resistance. Eventual military sucesses in the South allowed him to restore state government and turn over the governorship to his successor, John Mathewes, In January 1782. <br /> <br /> After serving again in Congress from 1782 to 1783, Rutledge accepted appointment to the South Carolina Court of Chancery, and he remained a leader in the state legislature in the 1780s. His experience in Congress convinced him that the United States needed a stronger central government. He was chosen as one of South Carolina's delegates to the constitutional convention in 1787. <blockquote> <p>The people of South Carolina and Georgia “would never be such fools as to give up so important an interest.” John Rutledge, South Carolina delegate, 1787 referring to slavery</p> </blockquote> Rutledge played a role in writing the federal Constitution. He advocated a national government of increased but limited powers and envisioned an executive and a Congress composed of gentlemen made relatively independent of public opinion. As chairman of the committee of detail, he had a major role in the enumeration of congressional powers, the provision forbidding taxation of exports, and the ban on national prohibition of slave imports until 1808. Rutledge promoted the adoption of the constitution at South Carolina's ratification convention. <br /> <br /> In 1789, Rutledge accepted appointment as one of the first justices of the US Supreme Court. He resigned from the position in 1791 to become chief justice of South Carolina, an office he held until 1795. In the early 1790s, Rutledge faced multiple serious personal problems. Large debts threatened the loss of all of his property. His health was severely damaged. His wife's sudden death in 1792 plunged him into depression.<br /> <br /> Unaware of Rutledge's problems, President George Washington appointed him chief justice of the US Supreme Court in 1795. However, before learning of his nomination, Rutledge made a speech denouncing the recently negotiated Jay Treaty with Great Britain. This speech infuriated Federalists, and combined with reports of his depression and financial problems, the Federalist-dominated Senate rejected his nomination. Likely before hearing of the rejection, a depressed Rutledge attempted suicide and then resigned from the South Carolina Supreme Court for health reasons. Except for one term in the South Carolina House of Representatives, Rutledge remained in retirement until his death on July 18, 1800.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Nathanael Greene was born in Rhode Island in 1742 to Quaker parents. His education, though not formal, revealed that he was a good student. He possessed a keen mind, excelled in mathematics and spent many hours reading in Greek and Roman classics. His family business—iron forging for ships—became his trade. After the Gaspee Affair in 1772, in which his family was accused of involvement in burning a British revenue ship, Greene began to take an interest in the growing discontent in the colonies. It was this interest that led him to the military, a choice that was in conflict with his religious upbringing.<br /> <br /> At the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Greene helped raise a company of militia called the “Kentish Guards.” Greene joined as a private armed with a musket bought from a British deserter. A childhood affliction forced him to limp, a disqualification for a soldier in the ranks, but his abilities as a leader were quickly recognized. In May 1775, Greene was commissioned as a brigadier general of militia commanding the three regiments raised in Rhode Island for service with Washington’s army at Boston. The following June Greene received his Continental commission and two months later was promoted to major general. His innate military skill soon made him Washington’s most trusted subordinate.<br /> <br /> After the difficult and deadly winter at Valley Forge, there were calls for a change in the quartermaster department, which had failed in its ability to feed and clothe the army. Greene was asked to take charge and remedy the situation. Greene reluctantly accepted the offer by Washington and performed remarkably well reforming and reorganizing the department. Greene’s new methods did not please all members of the Congress. When they refused him a vote of confidence, Greene resigned in July 1780. His next assignment was to command the defenses of the upper Hudson River, to replace the former commander and traitor, Benedict Arnold.<br /> <br /> Following the disastrous Battle of Camden, South Carolina, in August 1780, Congress asked Washington to recommend a new commander for the Southern Department. Greene was immediately recommended and was appointed to command in October. Taking charge of the remnants of the Southern Army in December, Greene’s conduct of the war in the South for the next three years was to be so successful that it broke the back of the British war effort in America.<br /> <br /> During the Southern Campaign, Greene used the same successful system of supply he had used under Washington. To guarantee payment to his contractors he gave his personal guarantee of payment. At war’s end in 1783, Greene was forced to sell most of his personal property to retire these debts to his name. While attempting to rebuild his finances he settled at “Mulberry Grove”, a plantation given to him and his wife, Catherine Littlefield Greene, and their five children, by the people of Georgia. Here, in June 1786, Greene died from what may have been the complications of sunstroke, never seeing the beginning of the new country he had fought to create.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Thomas Jeremiah, or \"Jerry,\" was a free person of color, who worked as a harbor pilot in Charleston, South Carolina. Little is known about his life or how he obtained his freedom. In addition to his work as a harbor pilot, Jeremiah worked as a firefighter and ran a fish market. Eventually, Jeremiah became a slaveholder himself and a man of wealth with an estimated worth of £700 to £1,000, possibly the richest person of African descent in British North America. His connections to rich white South Carolinians proved helpful during an incident in 1771. <br /> <br /> On July 17, 1771 Jeremiah was convicted of assaulting a white ship captain and was sentenced to an hour in the pillory and ten lashes with a whip. In view of his status, however, Lieutenant Governor William Bull pardoned Jeremiah. In 1775, Jeremiah again caught the attention of the white power structure of South Carolina in the midst of the conflict between Great Britain and the colonies.<br /> <br /> In June 1775, Jeremiah became suspected of involvement in an alleged plot by the British to use enslaved people against white colonists, who opposed British rule. Given Jeremiah's position in the black community and his work as a harbor pilot, white colonists feared Jeremiah to be a leader of the alleged insurrection. Chief among the accusers was Henry Laurens, a leading patriot and former slave trader, who later became the president of the Continental Congress. On the other side was Lord <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-campbell.htm\">William Campbell</a>, royal governor of the colony, who believed that the accusation was unjust and tried to save Jeremiah’s life but failed. Jeremiah was tried in a slave court and sentenced to death under the Negro Act of 1740. On August 18, 1775, he was hanged and his body burned. <br /> <br /> Before the noose was tightened around his neck, Jeremiah told his accusers that \"God's judgment would one day overtake them for shedding his innocent blood.\" It is unknown if Jeremiah was involved in plotting an insurrection, but his hanging represents white South Carolinians' fears of British support for enslaved insurrection during the American Revolution. Thomas Jeremiah should arguably be considered the first South Carolinian killed during the American Revolution, months before the first armed clash between loyalists and patriots in South Carolina at the First Siege of Ninety Six in November 1775. </p>",

            "bodyText": "Thomas Pinckney was born into a wealthy, influential family in Charleston, South Carolina on October 23, 1750. His father, Charles Pinckney, and mother, Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Lucas, sailed with their two sons, Thomas and his older brother, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, to England in 1753 in pursuit of educational opportunities. His parents sailed back to South Carolina in 1758 while Thomas and his brother stayed behind in England. Thomas Pinckney received a liberal education at Westminster School and Christ College, Oxford, and later studied law at the Middle Temple in the Inns of Court. He also briefly studied military science at the Royal Military Academy in Caen, France. His return to Charleston in December 1774 coincided with rising tensions between the colonists and the mother country. Despite his long stay in England, Pinckney and his family members supported the Patriot cause. <br /> <br /> At the outbreak of war in 1775, Pinckney became a captain in the First South Carolina Regiment and was later promoted to major. He traveled to North Carolina and Virginia on recruiting missions and to supervise the construction of fortifications. The bulk of his early military service featured garrison duty in Charleston harbor. Pinckney even wrote his sister Harriott that she need not worry \"for you may depend upon their being no fighting wherever I am.\" This prediction would prove incorrect when the British turned their attention to the American South, beginning in 1778. When the British invaded South Carolina in May 1779, from their base in Savannah, Georgia, they burned Pinckney's plantation on the Ashepoo River. During a lull in the fighting, he married Elizabeth Motte on July 22, 1779. Their marriage produced six children. In the fall of 1779, Pinckney served as a liason between Franco-American forces at the failed siege of Savannah. <br /> <br /> When the British laid siege to Charleston in 1780, Pinckney urged the defense of the city, a strategy that proved disastrous for the Southern Department of the Continental Army when Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-lincoln.htm\">Benjamin Lincoln</a> surrendered the city to the British on May 12, 1780. Fortunately for Thomas Pinckney, he was not among the over 5,000 prisoners of war as Lincoln had sent him into the interior to search for expected reinforcements. He linked up with the remaining Continental Army soldiers in the Carolinas and became Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/horatio-gates.htm\">Horatio Gates</a>'s aide-de-camp. The hero of Saratoga, Gates had been sent south to revive the Patriot cause after the fall of Charleston. At the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780, Pinckney's leg was shattered by a musket ball, and he was captured, ending his active service during the American Revolution. The British defeated the Continental Army and southern militia at Camden, leading to the downfall of Gates as a military commander. In the years following the battle and even the end of the Revolution, Pinckney publicly defended Gates's strategic and tacticial decisions, blaming the poorly disciplined militia for the defeat at Camden. <br /> <br /> After the war, Pinckney turned away from the law and focused on managing his plantations and his political career. He represented the city parishes of St. Philip's and St. Michael's in the state House of Representatives from 1776 until 1791. He was elected governor of South Carolina in 1787 and served one two-year term. He submitted the new federal Constitution to the state legislature and presided over the ratification convention in Charleston in 1788. In 1792, Pinckney accepted his most prestigious and challenging assignment yet: US minister to Great Britain. <br /> <br /> As minister to Great Britain, Pinckney tackled difficult and unresolved issues from the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution and guaranteed American independence. Despite his efforts, Pinckney was unable to secure compensation for enslaved people who left the country during British evacuations. Similarly, he was unable to resolved disputes over British fortifications in the old Northwest and American fishing rights off Newfoundland. When Britain and France went to war in 1793, President George Washington feared for American neutrality. Washington sent John Jay in 1794 on a special mission to Britain. Temporarily superseded by Jay, Pinckney supported the mission and approved the controversial new treaty that Jay negotiated. <br /> <br /> In November 1794, Pinckney was appointed envoy extraordinary to Spain. In Spain, Pinckney found great success as a diplomat and arguably achieved his highest point in a long public career. From June to October 1795, Pinckney worked to settle territorial and commerical disputes between the United States and Spain. The chief American goal at the time was to secure navigation rights along and at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The Treaty of San Lorenzo, signed on October 27, 1795, granted Americans the privilege to use the port of New Orleans and established a clear boundary between the United States and West Florida. This treaty helped pave the way for American settlement of the Southeast and for future territorial acquisitions in the region. <br /> <br /> In 1796, Pinckney resigned his post and returned to South Carolina. Before his arrival, Federalists nominated him as their candidate for vice president. Because of political maneuvering, Pinckney finished behind Thomas Jefferson in the voting. In November 1797, Pinckney was elected to the US House of Representatives to complete William Smith's unexpired term. In Congress, he generally supported the administration of President Adams. He did, however, oppose the Sedition Act. He left Congress in 1801, and, except for another term in the South Carolina legislature from 1802 to 1804, withdrew from public life. <br /> <br /> His retirement ended during the War of 1812 when he was commissioned a major general and given command of the Southern Division of the US Army. He worked to strengthen coastal fortifications and held overall command during the war with the Creeks, but he saw no action. After the war, Pinckney retired to his plantation on the Santee River, which he named El Dorado. In his retirement, he remained committed to agricultural innovations, which included using dikes to reclaim saltwater marshes for rice cultivation. In 1825, he became president general of the national Society of the Cincinnati. On November 2, 1828, Pinckney died in Charleston. ",

            "bodyText": "Thomas Sumter, the namesake of Fort Sumter, was a patriot general during the American Revolution. Born in Virginia in 1734, his first military experience came with the Virginia militia during the Cherokee War, 1759-1761. In 1762, he accompanied the Cherokee leader Ostenaco to London where the chief had an audience with King George III. After returning to Virginia via Charleston, he was imprisoned for indebtedness but escaped and fled to South Carolina.<br /> <br /> Sumter then settled in Orangeburg County near the Santee River and opened a country store. The venture prospered, and Sumter quickly accumulated wealth. In 1767, he married Mary Cantey Jameson, a wealthy, crippled widow eleven years his senior. Sumter and his wife moved to her plantation, Great Savannah, across the Santee in St. Mark’s Parish. The couple had two children.<br /> <br /> The American Revolution again called Thomas Sumter to serve. After being elected a delegate to the First and Second Provincial Congresses, Sumter participated in the Snow Campaign (December 1775), the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan’s Island</a>, the Cherokee campaign (July-October 1776), and actions in Georgia (1777 - 78). On September 19, 1778 Sumter left the army and returned to private life. He was in retirement when <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">Charleston fell to the British in May 1780</a>. It was at this stage of the war, when patriot fortunes in South Carolina were at their lowest, that Sumter made his greatest contribution.<br /> <br /> Thomas Sumter rallied the cause after the fall of Charleston and the defeat at Camden in 1780. He also had a personal desire to pay back the British for the burning of his plantation in the High Hills of the Santee River. He took the field, leading South Carolina militia against the British, before Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanael-greene.htm\">Nathanael Greene</a> arrived to coordinate American resistance and to rebuild the Continental Army. <br /> <br /> Sumter commanded South Carolina militia in many battles, including the Battles of Hanging Rock, Fishing Creek, Fishdam Ford, and Blackstock’s Plantation, where he was severely wounded. At the Battle of Blackstock’s Plantation in November 1780, Sumter dealt Lt. Col. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/banastre-tarleton.htm\">Banastre Tarleton</a>’s British Legion their first defeat. British military occupation of South Carolina was never firmly established given the efforts of partisans like Brig. Gen. Thomas Sumter.<br /> <br /> Injured for several months, Sumter returned to action in February 1781 and led his men in additional encounters at Fort Granby and Orangeburg. Sumter’s pride made him ill-suited to accept command from others. Sumter never proved very cooperative with Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene’s Continental Army. Sumter finally resigned in February 1782 as victory seemed more assured and frustrations over militia reorganization plagued him. <br /> <br /> The remainder of Sumter’s public life was spent in politics. He served eight terms in the General Assembly between 1776 and 1790. Elected by Camden District to the US House of Representatives, he served five terms in Congress between 1789 and 1801. Sumter then served in the US Senate until 1810. Sumter was a dedicated Jeffersonian, who remained devoted to his backcountry republican values.<br /> <br /> He was the last surviving American general of the Revolution, dying in 1832 at the age of ninety-seven. The year of 1832 also featured a sharp rise in states’ rights rhetoric, which centered around South Carolina’s opposition to the tariff and boiled into the Nullification Crisis. The Nullifiers of 1832 were among the most prominent Fire Eaters in 1860 - 1861, advocating for and realizing their dream of secession and a southern confederacy, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-fort-sumter-april-1861.htm\">outbreak of the Civil War at Fort Sumter</a>.",

            "bodyText": "William Moultrie, South Carolina’s famous Revolutionary War hero, successfully defended Charleston during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan’s Island</a> on June 28, 1776, in which he dealt the Royal Navy a crushing defeat. After the war, he returned to politics, serving two terms as governor.<br /> <br /> Born in Charleston in 1730, William Moultrie was the son of Dr. John Moultrie and Lucretia Cooper Moultrie. At age 19, Moultrie married Elizabeth Damarius de St. Julien, and the couple had three children, one dying in infancy. In 1752, he was elected to the Commons House of Assembly, beginning a political career that lasted until 1794. By 1761, he owned a rice plantation and about 200 enslaved people. The same year, during the Cherokee War, Moultrie was commissioned a captain in the South Carolina militia. By 1774, he held the rank of colonel. Moultrie’s military experience and social status resulted in his prominent role in South Carolina during the Revolutionary War.<br /> <br /> As relations with Great Britain worsened in the 1770s, the American colonies prepared for war and increasingly debated on the merits of independence. As South Carolina’s capital, Charleston became a center for revolutionary activity. In 1775, a Provincial Congress was formed and elected Moultrie as a member.<br /> <br /> In June he was made colonel of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment. At the time, there was no official American or South Carolina flag, so Moultrie designed one for his command. The dark blue flag resembled the color of his men’s regimental coats and also featured a white crescent in the top left corner. Moultrie proudly wrote in his memoirs that his flag became a symbol of defiance of the British and the “first American flag...displayed in South Carolina.”<br /> <br /> Sullivan’s Island commanded the approach to Charleston Harbor. From the island, patriots could deny British warships entrance. In December 1775, a company of Moultrie’s regiment was ordered to secure the island and prevent British troops, on two ships blockading the harbor, from landing. Addtionally, Moultrie commanded troops who raided camps on Sullivan's Island where runaway enslaved people had fled to seek freedom and join the British war effort. Many were killed in the fighting, and the others were returned to slavery. When the colonel assumed command of the island in March 1776, he found a “great number of mechanics and negro laborers” at work using thousands of palmetto logs and sand to build a fort sufficient for 1,000 men.<br /> <br /> On the morning of June 28, 1776 nine British warships, commanded by Commodore Sir <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-parker.htm\">Peter Parker</a>, attacked the incomplete fort on Sullivan’s Island. Armed with only 31 cannons, Moultrie’s command faced over 270 British cannons. The fort’s palmetto log and sand walls absorbed much of the British fire and suffered little damage. After over nine hours of combat, the British fleet was defeated. The Battle of Sullivan’s Island ended in a decisive patriot victory.<br /> <br /> Several days later, South Carolina’s legislature honored Col. Moultrie’s defense of Charleston by officially renaming the fortification Fort Moultrie. In September 1776, Moultrie was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army. Moultrie enjoyed further success later in the war. In February 1779, at the Battle of Beaufort, Moultrie commanded a largely militia force and defeated the British, boosting patriot morale after the British capture of Savannah, Georgia. In the spring of 1779, Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-lincoln.htm\">Benjamin Lincoln</a>, the commander of the Continental Army's Southern Department, took the bulk of the southern army to threaten Augusta, Georgia. Seizing the initiative, the British advanced on Charleston from Savannah. Moultrie led a skillful tactical withdrawal from Black Swamp where Lincoln had left him with a small force. This small force garrisoned Charleston and held off a brief British siege before Lincoln's force returned. <br /> <br /> Another successful defense of Charleston proved impossible when he served under Lincoln in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">siege of Charleston</a> the following year. After Charleston surrendered in May 1780, Moultrie was imprisoned at Haddrell’s Point and at Snee Farm. He did admirable service in representing his fellow Continental Army POWs and advocating against their harsh treatment to the British commandant of Charleston, Lt. Col. Nisbet Balfour. Moultrie was later sent to Philadelphia, where he was exchanged in early 1782. <br /> <br /> After independence was secured, Moultrie returned to the General Assembly in 1783. Two years later, he was elected governor. He served until 1787, during which time his legislative and military experience proved valuable in dealing with various topics: reorganization of the state militia, management of the loyalist diaspora, creation of a county court system, and relocation of the capital from Charleston to Columbia.<br /> <br /> Moultrie served a second term as governor, starting in 1792. Because of the increasing political tension between Federalists and Antifederalists, it proved to be a difficult term. Moultrie drew harsh criticism for his public support of the French Revolution and its representative in Charleston, Citizen Genet, who had attempted to license privateers and recruit volunteers to retake Louisiana from Spain for France. Criticism from President Washington’s administration ended Genet’s work and forced Moultrie to issue a proclamation forbidding South Carolinians from enlisting in any French military expeditions.<br /> <br /> Leaving office in 1794, Moultrie retired from politics but stayed active with various organizations: the South Carolina Society, St. Andrew’s Society, South Carolina Jockey Club, and president of the state Society of the Cincinnati from its creation in 1783 until his death. In 1802, Moultrie published his Memoirs of the American Revolution, an incredibly valuable resource for students of the war. He died in Charleston on September 27, 1805.",

She grew up alongside other enslaved people who picked cotton on William Love’s plantation. Love gifted Lizzy (age five) to his daughter, Agnes, and her husband, James Madison Flake; Lizzy took their last name at that time. Not long after, the Flakes joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moved to Mississippi where they joined a congregation of about two hundred former plantation owners and their households. The Mississippi Saints, as this assemblage became known, moved to <a href=\"https://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/historians-craft/mormon-conflict-and-controversy-at-nauvoo-1839-1846/\">Nauvoo, Illinois</a>, in 1844.

When the pioneers arrived at their destination, Lizzy helped the two youngest sons, William and Charles, build an adobe home for the family. Three years later, Agnes’s tuberculosis drove her to bed, and Lizzy took charge of the household.<br /> <br /> After Agnes’s death in 1854, Lizzy continued to care for the Flake children. Soon after, William made plans to move the family back to Utah. Even though Lizzy was free under California law, she intended to accompany them; William however, suggested she stay in California and start a family. Lizzy stayed put and moved in with another Black woman who had also come west as the property of Mormon pioneers. William sent her the paperwork granting her freedom to stay in San Bernardino once he returned to Utah.<br /> <br /> At some point, Lizzy began caring for a young child named James W. Flake. The parentage of little James W., who also appears as Walter James in later census records, is somewhat of a mystery given that his last name is recorded as “Flake” in the 1860 census; the census taker recorded Elizabeth’s race as “colored” while the child’s is listed as “mulatto.” That same year, Lizzy met and married a formerly enslaved man named Charles H. Rowan. Charles had worked as a teamster out of Utah before moving to the San Bernardino Valley; he was also a skilled barber. Together they bought a piece of land at 361 D Street near downtown San Bernardino and built a home where Lizzy kept house and took in laundry.<br /> <br /> By 1880, Lizzy had given birth to another son, Charles, and her husband operated a successful barbershop near their residence. Lizzy and Charles insisted that all their children receive an education. Walter James, by then twenty-years old, worked as a laborer but remained in the family household. Alice Rowan, their youngest daughter, later became a schoolteacher; she taught white children, which—if not a “first” in California—was certainly unusual. Their youngest son, Byron, operated a successful garage north of town, a feed store on “I” street, and eventually found work as a teamster like his father. Lizzy and Charles, a rather successful pair, became pillars of the Black community in San Bernardino and were at the forefront of the early civil rights movement in California.  Charles Rowan died in San Bernardino in 1906, while Lizzy died there two years later, on 29 March 1908.<br /> <br /> <i>(Special thanks to UNM PhD candidate Angela Reiniche for compiling this information) </i></p> <h3><i><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/elizabeth-lizzy-flake-the-mormon-pioneer-trail.htm\">Read the FULL Article Here</a></i></h3>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Before the Civil War, most African Americans traveled west as enslaved persons. Slavery could be found in every state and territory, and intense debates took place about its suitability in places such as Oregon Country, where Robin and Polly Holmes (along with their three-year-old daughter Mary Jane) arrived after a long journey on the emigrant trail from Missouri in 1844. Brought there by their owner, Nathaniel Ford, the Holmes family had landed on “free soil”—meaning slavery was not legal there. Yet this law was not enforced, and the Holmes’ long journey was only the beginning of their ordeal. <br /> <br /> The Holmes family left Howard County, Missouri, on 14 May 1844, traveling with Ford, his wife, and their six children. Taking what became known as the “usual route” of the Oregon Trail, they reached the Willamette Valley on 6 October 1844. Once Ford staked his claim in the nearby Rickreall Valley in early 1845, he retrieved Robin, Polly, and Mary Jane from Oregon City to start the work of establishing a farm. The Holmes family lived in a small cabin on Ford’s farm, from which he allowed them to sell the produce that they raised. Ford refused, however, to honor his promise of emancipation. Robin Holmes traveled to the California gold mines to earn enough money to buy his family’s freedom. Once in California, Holmes found work as a cook in a mining camp; in his off-time, he prospected for gold. When he returned to the Rickreall farm in 1850, he brought a considerable amount of money with him. <br /> <br /> By that time, Robin and Polly had five children. Not long after Holmes’ return from the gold mines, Ford agreed to free Robin, Polly, and their newborn baby, but kept their other three children, Mary Jane, Roxanna, and James. (A fifth child, Harriet, died in 1851.) Although illiterate, Robin had learned from Oregon’s Black abolitionist community and their allies that Oregon Territory had disallowed slavery. In 1852, Holmes sued Ford for the custody of his children. Frustrated with the local legal system in Polk County, he took his fight to the Oregon Supreme Court in the summer of 1853. On 13 July 1853, Judge George H. Williams ruled in favor of Robin Holmes, ruling that Mary Jane, James, and Roxanna were “hereby awarded to the custody of their parents …and remain with them as their children as fully in all respects.” Williams also ordered Ford to pay all costs associated with the proceedings.<br /> <br /> Ford had a difficult time letting go of the children, including Mary Jane—who stayed on as his paid servant. At age twenty-two she married Reuben Shipley, also formerly enslaved, but not before Ford required her husband to pay $750 for her “ransom.” The Holmes family was not wealthy; at one point, a Polk County survey valued Robin Holmes’s personal property at roughly half of the county-wide average. In his will, dated 1 February 1862, he ordered that—after the payment of his debts and burial cost—each of his four children receive a five dollar “legacy” payment, and that whatever remained be “given to my wife Polly Holmes, for her life, to be used and enjoyed by her.” <br /> <br /> Robin Holmes died and was buried in the Salem Pioneer Cemetery the next year. In 1870, at the age of sixty-eight, Polly Holmes was living at the Oregon Hospital for the Insane, an asylum in East Portland. She was still there in 1872, and she lived on into the 1880s. The only child of Robin and Polly Holmes who lived to see the turn of the century was Mary Jane Holmes Shipley Drake, their eldest daughter, who lived until 1925. <br /> <br /> The Holmes’ victory, alongside similar cases tried throughout the Pacific Northwest, was part of a larger effort by African Americans and their allies to challenge unjust laws in the nineteenth-century American West. <br /> <br /> <i>(Special thanks to UNM PhD candidate Angela Reiniche for compiling this information)</i></p> <h3><i><i><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/robin-and-polly-holmes-the-oregon-trail.htm\">Read the FULL Article Here</a></i></i></h3>",

Known as Madame La Tules or Doña Tules, meaning <i>The Reeds</i> in Spanish, Barceló was recognized for her charm and sharp business skills, which helped establish her as an influential member of high society during the heyday of the Santa Fe Trail.<br /> <br /> Barceló is believed to have been born in the Bavispe Valley of Sonora, Mexico, in the early 1800s and moved in 1821 with her family to Tomé, a village south of Albuquerque, after Mexico gained independence from Spain. It is believed that the family traveled north to Tomé by way of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</a>. An educated and independent woman, Barceló married Manuel Sisneros at 23 years old, and thereafter kept her maiden name and retained sole rights to property.<br /> <br /> In 1835, Barceló opened a hotel and casino with whitewashed adobe walls in the city center of Santa Fe. The establishment encompassed an entire city block on Burro Alley and featured lavish decorations including chandeliers, drapes, mirrors, and imported furnishings that arrived via wagon along the Santa Fe Trail. The casino became a destination for local socialites and trail travelers alike in search of entertainment and opulence. Barceló oversaw the casino operation and regaled patrons as one of the card dealers, widely known as the best dealer of the game Monte across the southwest.<br /> <br /> Seeking trade deals and investments that increased her wealth and social status, Barceló was a smart businesswoman. She exercised economic and political sway, making her fortune from real estate and gold ventures, in addition to her casino. When the American civilian government established itself in Santa Fe during the Mexican-American War in 1846, Barceló allied herself with the Americans and assisted them by providing information and, at times, money.<br /> <br /> Throughout her life and beyond, Barceló inspired both admirers and critics, with her tales commemorated in books, newspapers, television shows, a musical, and general lore. Accounts and representation of Barceló were often embellished by those who labeled her the “queen of sin.” While she ran the saloon, she also made frequent philanthropic contributions to families in need, the Catholic Church, charitable organizations, and the government.<br /> <br /> Barceló continued to operate her casino through the 1840s and died in January of 1852. Upon her death, she left several residences, property, and $10,000 to her family, including two adopted daughters, in addition to substantial contributions to the Catholic Church and the city of Santa Fe to be used for charitable endeavors. In addition to the wealth, Barceló left behind countless stories and a reputation to live on for generations.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Learn more about the Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">Learn more about El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</a></h3> <h4>Sources</h4> <p>Weiser, Kathy. “Doña Gertrudis Barceló – Gambling Queen of Santa Fe.” Legends of America.December 2020. <a href=\"https://www.legendsofamerica.com/nm-gertrudisbarcelo/\">https://www.legendsofamerica.com/nm-gertrudisbarcelo/</a>.<br /> <br /> Dominguez, Orae. “María Gertrudis Barceló: Doña Tules.” New Mexico History State Records Center and Archives.

As she described her job:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We made all the carpets, and all the silk, satin, plush, and velvet drapings for the dining cars, made all the linen for the sleepers, berth curtains and vestibule curtains, and we sewed the tapestry for the covering of the seats; we bound the blankets, made the mattresses for the bunks, and all such work as that”.</p> </blockquote> <p>Also, as part of her testimony about the Strike of 1894, she detailed the hardship brought on by reduced wages especially for female workers:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Whenever the men were cut in their wages the girls also received a cut. We were cut twice inside of a week in November 1893, and in January our wages were cut again….The most experienced of us could only make 80 cents per day, and a great many of the girls could only average 40 to 50 cents per day.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Compared to $1.50 - $2.25 per day in pre-recession years. Beyond pay discrepancies, Curtis wrote a letter complaining of the abuses she and her fellow workers endured:</p> <blockquote> <p>“When [our forewoman] was put over us by the superintendent as our forewoman, she seemed to delight in showing her power in hurting the girls in every possible way. At times her conduct was almost unbearable. She was so abusive to certain girls that she disliked, that they could not stand it, and would take their time and leave, who would otherwise have been working there to- day...She was getting $2.25 a day and she did not care how much we girls made, whether we made enough to live on or not, just so long as she could figure to save a few dollars for the Company. When a girl was sick and asked to go home during the day, she would tell them to their face they were not sick, the cars had to be got out, and they could not go home.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Curtis is significant not just because of the testimony she gave to the Strike Commission but because she was the president of The Girls Local Union 269, which had 125 members in 1894. Curtis famously gave a speech at the American Rail Union (ARU) convention of June 1894 that convinced the union members to support a boycott of Pullman trains to support the strike effort. Curtis is an excellent example of the strong-willed Pullmen women who lived and worked in the community. Her mark on Pullman’s complex history in indelible.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>When Sarah Josepha Hale looked back on her long life, she saw successful female leadership and profound energy. Through her role as an editor of <em>The Ladies’ Magazine</em> and <em>Godey’s Lady’s Book</em>, she exerted influence over women’s education and political consciousness throughout the U.S.<sup>1</sup><strong><sup> </sup></strong>Audiences today may perceive her ideology as culturally or socially conservative. Nonetheless, in her time, her authority and her ideas broke down barriers for middle class women.</p> <p>Sarah Josepha was born in Newport, New Hampshire, a small, productive riverside town. Her father, Captain Gordon Buell, served as an officer in the American Revolution before marrying Martha Whitilesey and becoming a tavern keeper. Gordon and Martha Buell believed in gender equality in education. Therefore, Sarah Josepha received home schooling not only from her brother Horatio, a graduate of Dartmouth College, but also from her mother. She then became a teacher. At 25 years old, Sarah Josepha married David Hale, a Newport attorney whose family helped found New Hampshire’s Dartmouth College. The couple continued Sarah Josepha’s parents’ tradition, discussing academic questions between themselves and encouraging the curiosity of their five children.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>By 1822, the year David Hale died, Sarah Josepha had become a skillful writer. In 1823, her first collection of poems, <em>The Genius of Oblivion</em>, was published, thanks to financial support from David’s Masonic Lodge. In 1827, her abolitionist novel,<em> Northwood: Life North and South,</em> so entranced the Rev. John Lauris Blake of Boston that he asked her to become editor for his new<em> Ladies’ Magazine.</em> Her most famous book, <em>Poems for Our Children, </em>first published in 1829<em>, </em>included “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” still a popular nursey rhyme today.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Hale used the <em>Ladies’ Magazine</em> as a platform for socio-cultural editorials and advice columns, design and fashion critiques, and recipes and housekeeping advice. As the first female editor – or “editress,” as she preferred – of an American magazine,<sup>4</sup> she became a national arbiter of good taste, manners, family life, and “domestic science.”<sup>5</sup> This job kept her in Boston from 1828 to 1841. There, she published two further works, <em>Traits of American Life</em> (1835) and <em>Sketches of American Character</em> (1838),<sup>6</sup> both of which featured the “New Republic’s” ideals of American men and women’s equality.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Hale also engaged in local civic work. In 1833, she helped establish the Seaman’s Aid Society in Boston’s North End. This auxiliary to the Boston Port Society developed job training, financial opportunities, and social support for impoverished wives and children of sailors. It gave women the opportunity to keep their families fed, clothed, and housed.<sup>8</sup> In the summer of 1840, a Boston women’s sewing circle of Seaman’s Aid Society members, led by Sarah Josepha Hale, conceived of using a women’s fair to generate the $30,000 necessary to complete the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/building-the-bunker-hill-monument.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument</a>. Through newspaper articles and letters, they contacted women’s networks throughout New England and down the Atlantic coast.<sup>9</sup> Six weeks later, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/bunker-hill-monument-fair.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument Fair</a> successfully raised more than its $30,000 goal.</p> <p>At mid-century, Sarah Josepha’s stance shifted to “Victorian” gendered territory. She had never been an advocate of women’s involvement in political processes.<sup>10</sup> While she belonged to a generation that could not stomach the progressive suffrage movement, she continued to support female education.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>In 1841, Hale’s position as editor of <em>Godey’s Lady’s Book</em> (merged with the <em>Ladies’ Magazine </em>in 1837)<sup>12</sup> brought her to Philadelphia. As editor for the next 30 years, she influenced women across the U.S. and empowered them as agents distributing American national identity and culture. Hale encouraged women to write for <em>Godey’s</em> and paid them well.<sup>13</sup> Her extraordinary 900-page <em>Women’s Record: Sketches of Distinguished Women</em> <em>from the Creation to A.D. 1850</em> first appeared in 1853. This ‘tour de force’ demonstrated that women were intellectually equal to men. All they needed was education and a female sphere of independence.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>Hale crusaded for many years to make Thanksgiving, a symbol of national unity, a federal holiday. Started in 1846, this long-term trek finally reached its goal in October 1863, when President Lincoln released a proclamation. He declared the last Thursday in November Thanksgiving, as “in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, the American people should take some time for gratitude.”<sup>15</sup></p> <p>Sarah Josepha Hale retired from <em>Godey’s Lady’s Book</em> in December 1877 at the age of 89. She died in 1879, having made a huge impact on American middle-class culture and gender identity.</p>   <p><strong>Contributed by: Polly Kienle, Park Guide</strong></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Nicole Tonkovitch Hoffman, “Legacy Profile Sarah Josepha Hale (1788-1874),” <em>Legacy</em>, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Fall 1990), 47-48; Patricia Okker, <em>Sarah J.

            "bodyText": "<p>Born in 1833 and raised in the farming country of Franklin County, Massachusetts, Adeline Warfield was 17 years old when the first National Woman's Rights Convention was held nearby in Worcester.<br /> <br /> The convention speakers told the young women of the nation “to be individuals and be all that they are capable of”. Possibly inspired by this social movement that challenged the view of the traditional roles of women, she along with her brother and his wife, left Massachusetts and traveled westward in the early 1850’s dreaming of a new life in the frontier.<br /> <br /> When the American Civil War started in April, 1861, Adeline was living her dream and was happily married to Simon Harker, her brother's business partner. In addition, she was raising their two young children and helping operate at least two trading posts in the Creek Nation, Indian Territory of Oklahoma. Unfortunately, the Civil War split the Indian Nation apart, and terrible violence ensued between the different tribes. Seeking safety, Adeline and Simon with their two children left the Indian Territory and resettled in the rapidly growing territory of Colorado.<br /> <br /> Laboring alongside her husband, she helped start a new life for her family near the mining settlement of Denver. Rather than engaging in mining, she and Simon establish a cattle ranch near the stage road that led to Denver. They sold cattle and produce to the miners and new immigrants. In 1863, Adeline gave birth to her third child.<br /> <br /> In the spring of 1864, a historic flash flood ravaged Denver and the area of Adeline’s ranch. Many lives were lost, livestock drowned, and ranches were devastated. Already suffering from tubuculosis and then exposed to the flood, Simon became seriously ill and died weeks later. Adeline was left alone – a widow with three small children to raise, a destroyed ranch, and an uncertain future.<br /> <br /> Adeline was only 31 years old but was a seasoned pioneer lady when her husband died. She would have been able to harness and ride horses, and manage a cattle ranch. Demonstrating great courage, she decided to stay on her ranch and rebuild. Probably with assistance from other pioneers, she slowly recovered.<br /> <br /> However, needing full time help, she hired a former gold miner named Elliot Hornbek to work on the ranch. In 1866, she married Elliot and her fourth child was born in 1870. Unfortunately, the marriage didn't last and he abandoned Adeline and the family a fews years later.<br /> <br /> In 1876, as Colorado celebrated its statehood, she relocated for the last time to an area known as the Florissant Valley. At an elevation of 8500 feet, this alpine valley was covered with large meadows of wild buffalo grass and acres of aspens and pine trees; and was ideal for a free-grazing cattle ranch. With the help of her neighbors and her teenage children, she built a two story log house with 5 rooms and a parlor that would be the center of her new ranch. Historically, Adeline would be one of the first women to file a homesteading claim in the Florissant Valley and the state of Colorado.<br /> <br /> Over the next few years, Adeline ‘s ranch grew and eventually doubled in size. She owned as many as 100 cattle with her own registered cattle brand and employed several ranch hands. As the community also grew,, she devoted more of herself to helping the homesteaders of Florissant valley prosper. Needing a new school and a teacher, she helped establish the Florissant school board, hire a new teacher, and build the first school in the area. She also opened her large home to social events that helped establish Florissant as a successful homesteading community.<br />  <br /> In 1893, Mrs. Hornbek and other women voted legally for the first time in Colorado. Historians argue that women of the frontier, like Mrs. Hornbek, proved they had earned the right to vote. It was not a coincidence that states like Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming were the first to recognize the equality of men and women. Twenty seven years later, the 19th Amendment gave every woman in the United States the right to vote.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Hornbek died in 1905 and was quietly laid to rest about four miles from her home. In 1969, her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hornbek-homestead.htm\">ranch</a> became a part of the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument and is visited by thousands of visitors every year.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Theodore Jesse Hoover, called “Tad” as a child, was born January 28, 1871 in West Branch, Iowa. Shortly after his birth, his parents Jesse and Hulda moved into the two room cottage where his younger brother Herbert was born in 1874.</p> <h2>Iowa</h2> <p>Theodore had one clear memory of Herbert in their small­­­ West Branch cottage. It was a day of grief followed by jubilant happiness. The little boys both suffered attacks of croup and on this occasion, Herbert’s was nearly fatal. After failed attempts at household remedies by his parents, aunts, and cousins, Herbert laid on a high table gradually choking. Just as everyone thought his brother had died, his uncle Doctor Henry John Minthorn showed up having just returned to town, and revived him.</p> <p>After their parents’ deaths, young Theodore lived with his aunt and uncle Davis and Maria Hoover in Hardin County, Iowa. His uncle offered Theodore a home and to teach him all he knew about farming plus a team of horses and a wagon when he came of age.</p> <h2>Oregon</h2> <p>Theodore did not see a very brilliant future as a farmer. He wrote, “The west was still the land of romance in those days and the ‘wander-lust’ had a good grip. My brother had gone to Oregon and I had a great longing to see him.” After four years of a farmer’s life he left for Oregon in 1887. He began school at Friends Pacific Academy in Newberg, Oregon where his uncle Henry John Minthorn was superintendent. At first Theodore received his meals at the Academy boarding house and shared a room with Herbert on the lower story of the academy’s main building. Tad later stayed with his Uncle Benjamin Miles and worked for his board.</p> <p>Theodore often ran afoul of his strict Quaker relatives, who believed he needed to be “rescued from the burning and that a campaign was inaugurated to lead him into a better method of life.” When they disapproved of him attending a dance at a nearby school, Theodore left the Pacific Academy rather than be expelled.</p> <h2>California</h2> <p>For the next few years Theodore worked for printers and newspapers, alternated with college studies at Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa. In 1897, at the age of 26, he had again saved enough to return to college and attended his brother’s school, Stanford University. In 1899 in San Francisco, California, Theodore married Mildred Crew Brooks of West Liberty, Iowa. In 1901 he graduated from Stanford University at the age of 30. Together Theodore and Mildred had three daughters.</p> <p>Over the next few years, Theodore worked as a mining engineer. In 1919, he accepted an appointment as a professor of mining and metallurgy at Stanford University. Later he became the dean of the engineering school. Theodore retired from Stanford University in 1936 at the age of 65.</p> <h2>The President's Brother</h2> <p>Being the brother of a president was not what most would have expected. Theodore wrote, “I suppose there has been no relative of any president of the United States who has received less benefit from the distinction of this relative than in my case. So far from having any benefit out of the situation it has only brought me expenses and knocks on the head; rotten press, publicity and other decided handicaps.”</p> <h2>Restoration of the President's Birthplace</h2> <p>During the restoration of Herbert Hoover's birthplace cottage, Lou Hoover sought the recollections of relatives and friends, including Theodore. Theodore’s memory of the little house differed from others'; he remembered the cottage having four rooms instead of two, with the back porch being enclosed for the additional two rooms.</p> <p>Theodore Hoover died in 1955 at the age of 84.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<b>A Farmer’s Daughter</b> <div><br /> Lucretia Rudolph was born on her father’s farm in Garrettsville, Ohio on April 19, 1832 – the oldest of four children to Zeb and Arabella Mason Rudolph. This land in Portage County had belonged to her paternal grandfather, John Rudolph, and a portion was divided amongst his sons, John and Zeb. Her father was a carpenter, in addition to farming his land. Lucretia was named after her maternal grandmother, Lucretia Greene, and was called “Crete” by her family and closest friends. She grew up surrounded by relatives, from both sides of the family, who lived nearby. </div> <div><br /> As the oldest, Lucretia learned the responsibilities and chores of farm life and of running a household. Her mother stressed the virtue of “self-government” – rising up to do what was expected, what was the right thing to do. Crete was described as a petite young lady with high cheekbones and forehead, dark hair and eyes, and very intelligent. She was also very shy, reserved, and serious (some said “cold”) due to growing up in a household that was not very affectionate. Somehow, she and her two brothers and sister knew they were loved, but she later recalled that her mother only kissed her infrequently; she never remembered being kissed by her father. Even though they were not openly emotional, Crete’s parents were kind, interested parents. And, religion and education were of utmost importance in the Rudolph household. Her parents felt that education was equally important for all their children: the girls as well as the boys.</div> <div><br /> <b>Student</b></div> <div><br /> Lucretia <i>loved</i> to read and felt that, “It would be of about as much use to stop breathing as to let books alone if they are anywhere in the region about me. I have to read. . .as I have to live.”</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>The Rudolphs sent their children to the local district school in Garrettsville. When Lucretia was 15 years old, they decided that she must continue her education in a school of higher standards. They packed up some of her belongings and drove her about 20 miles northeast to the Geauga Seminary, an academy for boys and girls at the crossroads of Chester Township, Ohio. It was her first time away from home. Lucretia boarded with other girls on the third floor of the main building. The education offered there was a typical, classical one with studies of Greek, Latin, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, geography, and music.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>It was at the Seminary that Crete first crossed paths with James A. Garfield of Orange Township, Ohio – an “overgrown, uncombed, unwashed boy” who she thought was some sort of “strange genius,” for he was the smartest in their class. They remained classmates there until June 1850.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>In the Fall of 1850, Lucretia was enrolled in the very first term of a new, co-educational college: the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute in Hiram, Ohio. It was a non-denominational preparatory school established by the Disciples of Christ, the Rudolph family’s religion. Her father was on the board of trustees and a great supporter of the school. He even helped construct the first brick building and also built a new farmhouse on Hiram Hill for his family to be closer to the school. Eclectic students and faculty boarded and studied there. The Rudolphs were known to an entire generation of Hiram students as “Uncle Zeb” and “Aunt Arabella.” They opened their home and it was often the center of campus life.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>The classical coursework was more difficult than that of the Geauga Seminary. In addition, Lucretia began studying French, sang in the Glee Club, and helped start a literary society that put on “lyceums” which involved debates and skits. She also edited a school magazine called <i>The Eclectic Star</i>, writing essays and drawing sketches for it. In the fall term of 1851, Crete was reunited with a former classmate: James A. Garfield. The two of them were infatuated with others: Lucretia had her dapper Albert Hall, and James, the pretty, flirtatious Mary Hubbell.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>In the spring of 1853, the teacher of their Greek Class became ill. James Garfield, far ahead of the other students, was asked to take over the class. Both he and Lucretia had recently broken off their romances. Now, they began to take notice of one another. When it was time for the class picture, James took the photographer aside and asked that Miss Rudolph be seated next to him.</div> <div><br /> In November 1853, James wrote the first of what would become 1,200 letters that he and Lucretia would exchange during their relationship. He was traveling east with his mother to meet relatives when he encountered “a sight so magnificent that I have to share it with someone.” He described Niagara Falls in the very flowery, poetic manner of 19<sup>th </sup>Century writing. He also wrote about studying Greek and Latin classics and invited Lucretia to write back and share her opinions. This began their romantic relationship. In February 1854, they shared a private talk in the college’s Lower Chapel - and exchanged their first kiss. This was the beginning of a lengthy courtship, fraught with many ups and downs due to their different upbringings and temperaments.</div> <div><br /> <b>Teacher</b></div> <div><br /> After commencing from the Eclectic in June 1854, Lucretia was a teacher there, as well as teaching in the Ohio cities of Ravenna, Bryan, Chagrin Falls, and Cleveland - while James attended Williams College in Massachusetts to complete his degree. Her favorite experience was teaching reading to youngsters at the Brownell School in Cleveland. She enjoyed earning her own money, took painting, drawing, and piano classes, and attended the theater.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div><b>Wife & Mother</b></div> <div><br /> The Garfields’ somewhat rocky courtship lasted until 1858 when, during a buggy ride that spring, the couple decided to “try a life in union.” They were 26 years old. James felt it was the right thing to do, even though he was not really prepared to be a husband and father. A simple wedding was planned for November 11,<sup> </sup>1858 at Lucretia’s father’s home in Hiram. It was suggested to the bride-to-be by her brother Joe that she send one of her handwritten invitations to the groom, just to be sure that he showed up! Lucretia wore a modest white gown with lace around the neck. Several girls from the Eclectic were bridesmaids and served refreshments at the wedding supper following the ceremony. A guest stated that “the bride and her maids were a galaxy of beauty.\"</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>There was no honeymoon. The newlyweds moved into Mrs. Northrop’s boarding house on the Hiram Hill to begin their life together. It seems that the forces drawing these two together proved to be stronger than the differences pulling them apart. </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>Their first child, named Eliza Arabella after her grandmothers and nicknamed “Little Trot,” was born there on July 3, 1860. She resembled Lucretia, with chestnut-colored hair and dark eyes.</div> <div><br /> However, even the birth of their first child did not keep James at home. He had many responsibilities and obligations: teaching at the Eclectic and becoming its principal (president); meeting in Columbus with the legislature as an Ohio State Senator; preaching in the Disciples of Christ churches in northeastern Ohio; studying to be a lawyer. And then the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. James volunteered to serve in the Union Army, while Lucretia and Trot had to move back in with her parents. He was absent for many reasons and their marriage suffered. Crete was “trying to be the best little wife and mother possible,” but had to admit that she could not be as warmly responsive as her husband wished. Later, they both referred to this time as “the dark years.” They discovered that during the first five years of marriage, they had only been together 20 weeks.</div> <div><br /> The Garfields purchased their first home during the Civil War. Lucretia went to work enlarging the Hiram house with her father’s assistance and making it comfortable for James’ return from the Army. Their second child, a son, was born here on October 11, 1863. He was named Harry Augustus after two close family friends. Unfortunately, Trot died from diphtheria just several weeks later on December 1<sup>st</sup>. The loss of their precious girl profoundly affected both parents. The war had also opened James’ eyes and heart and made him appreciate home and family. Crete found a new closeness with her husband.</div> <div><br /> Several children followed: James Rudolph (“Jimmie”), born October 17, 1865 in Hiram; Mary (“Mollie”), born January 16, 1867 in Washington, DC; Irvin McDowell (“Old Dutch Brig”), born August 3, 1870 in Hiram; Abram (“Nabor”), born November 21, 1872 in Washington; and Edward (“Neddie”), born December 26, 1874 in Washington – the first time Lucretia was assisted in labor by taking chloroform. The next morning, the other children were delighted and surprised at the arrival of the new boy, but “Mollie burst into tears because he was not a girl.” The large Garfield family endured another loss in November 1876 when little Neddie died of whooping cough before his second birthday. His lighter eyes and hair had made him resemble his father.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>Lucretia, busier than ever with childcare and chores, had to manage two households – in Hiram during the summer and fall, and in Washington, DC during sessions of Congress the remainder of the year. James had been elected to Congress during the war and took his seat in December 1863. The family joined him in Washington, first in rented places and then at their own home at 13<sup>th</sup> and I Streets beginning in 1869, becoming a very close-knit unit. Both parents assisted in their children’s education, encouraging reading and a love of literature, providing piano lessons and nurturing their talent in art, exposing them to Greek, Latin, and French, and supplementing classroom studies with trips to the Smithsonian, carriage rides to the Soldiers’ Home, and games of croquet and bagatelle. </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>Lucretia dedicated herself to creating a pleasant home and to raising their children. However, there were times when she struggled with her inner self about being educated, “yet obliged to spend the largest time the victim of young barbarians.” Those four sons could be a handful! “They do torment the life out of me sometimes,” Lucretia shared in letters to her husband.</div> <div><br /> She had a keen intellect, an interest in science and current events, and a natural ability in art, languages, and interior decoration. Lucretia was pragmatic and adept at handling construction projects, personally overseeing many of the additions, renovations, and redecorating projects in the Garfield homes throughout the years. She was particularly inspired by the Aethestic Movement, seeing it on full display at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, which Lucretia attended over several weeks – gathering ideas for furniture, china dishes, wallpapers, fireplace tiles, and accessories that she incorporated into her home.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/lucretia-r-garfield-a-remarkable-life-part-2.htm\">Read more about Lucretia </a>as first lady, mother and grandmother, and how she changed her family farm into what visitors to James A.

Isenmann began his service aboard the ship on December 31, 1943, the day of her commissioning.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Isenmann Signature\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|1207|476|0|4|4\" height=\"476\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6597929|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Isenmann-Signature.jpg\" style=\"margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:4px;margin-left:4px;margin-right:4px;\" title=\"Isenmann Signature\" width=\"1207\" /><em>Milton Grant Isenmann's signature (National Archives Personnel File)</em></p> <p>Along with his fellow crew members, Isenmann underwent several weeks of at sea training in Hawaiian waters. On April 3, 1944, just prior to the ship’s departure from Pearl Harbor as part of a naval task force, Isenmann was transferred to the Pacific Fleet Radio Striker's School at Camp Catlin, Oahu, for a twelve-week course. After qualifying as a radioman, he was ordered back to the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> on August 9.</p> <p>Isenmann crossed the equator aboard the USS <em>Snyder</em> (DE-745) as he was being delivered to a meeting point with his ship. He rejoined his fellow shipmates on the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> on November 17, 1944, shortly after the Allied invasion of the Philippines, and was appointed a Radioman 3rd class. His new title came just before one of the most memorable events in the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>’s history: participation in diversionary operations to support the Iwo Jima campaign from February through March 1945.</p> <p>After Iwo Jima’s capture, American and Allied Naval Forces next moved on to Okinawa for what turned out to be the bloodiest and final campaign of the Pacific War. The invasion began in April 1945, and the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was assigned to serve as part of the radar picket and provide anti-aircraft protection for capital ships of the fleet. She was also responsible for providing fire support for the landing forces. The Japanese military command responded with several mass kamikaze attacks on the US and Allied fleet. During one of the heaviest attacks, on April 12, 1945, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>’s gunners shot down several Japanese planes. A single aircraft exploded just fifty feet above the main deck after hitting the ship’s mast and knocking out its radar. One sailor was killed in this attack and another 59 were wounded.</p> <p>Before dawn on July 30, 1945, over a month after Okinawa had been secured, Isenmann was manning his post in the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>’s main radio room when a Japanese kamikaze plane crashed into the ship’s starboard side. The hundred-pound bomb the plane was carrying exploded, sending a shower of shrapnel into the radio room and surrounding compartments. Isenmann suffered wounds around his face, arms, legs, and back. Most seriously, a neck injury severed his spine and led to his emergency transfer to the destroyer tender USS <em>Hamul</em> (AD-20). Despite the best efforts of Navy doctors, Isenmann succumbed to his injuries later that day.</p> <p>Isenmann was posthumously awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Medal and Purple Heart. He was buried at the Olinger-Crown Cemetery, in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Narcissa was born March 14, 1808 to Stephen and Clarissa Prentiss in Prattsburg, New York. She was the third of nine children and helped with the upbringing of her younger brothers and sisters in a devout Presbyterian home. At a young age, Narcissa was inspired by the writings of other missionaries that appeared in newspapers. Early in life, Narcissa had a religious conversion experience and became a member of the Congregational Church. Five years later, at the age of 16, she decided she would become a missionary. In her application letter to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) she wrote:</p> <p>“I frequently desire to go to the heathen but only half-heartedly and it was not till the first Monday of Jan. 1824 that I felt to consecrate myself without reserve to the Missionary work waiting the leadings of Providence concerning me.”</p> <p>Narcissa’s first application for missionary service was not accepted because she was a single woman. While awaiting the opportunity for missionary service, she remained active in church and pursued an education at Prattsburg’s Franklin Academy, later becoming a teacher. After her school, Narcissa taught kindergarten in Bath, NY. In 1834, Narcissa attended an ABCFM meeting where a call for missionaries was extended. She responded to the call and asked if single women were needed. A few months later, she was engaged to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/marcus-whitman.htm\">Marcus Whitman</a> who had also offered himself for missionary service. The couple then formally applied to the ABCFM for a missionary appointment.</p> <p>In March 1835, Narcissa and Marcus received their missionary appointment to the foreign land in the western part of North America that was not yet part of the United States. The couple had to wait to be married until February 1836 because Marcus had gone on an exploratory trip to their mission area. The Whitman’s life as missionaries began the day after they were married.</p> <p>The journey west was long and hard. Narcissa became pregnant along their way west and gave birth to her only child, Alice Clarissa, on her birthday March 14 in 1837 at the mission in Weyíiletpe. Alice brought much joy to her mother and was the first child born of American parents in Oregon Country. Tragically, Alice drowned in 1839 in a nearby branch of the Walla Walla River.<br /> <br /> Narcissa became deeply depressed and introverted after her daughter’s death and spent a lot of time in her room writing to family members in New York. Her letters, along with her journal of the journey west, have become valuable resources for understanding missionary life at weyíiletpe. Through her writings, it is clear that life at the mission did not align with what Narcissa had expected. Despite her loneliness, she remained reluctant to build relationships with any of the Cayuse people she worked with.</p> <p>When the seven Sager orphans entered the Whitman’s lives in 1844, Narcissa was a mother again. Though she still struggled with life at the mission, the Sager children helped her find renewed purpose. The oldest Sager was a teenager and the youngest just an infant. In addition to caring for the Sagers and other children at the mission, Narcissa was also busy helping with religious services and teaching in the mission school.</p> <p>Narcissa died on November 29, 1847, killed in the same series of events that ended the lives of her husband and other men at the mission. Narcissa is remembered as one of the first two white women, the other being <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-spalding.htm\">Eliza Spalding,</a> to cross the continent overland. Their journey proved that it was possible for women to cross the country on foot, opening the way for the next several generations of emigrants who journeyed down the Oregon Trail. Narcissa is also remembered by some as a controversial figure who brought unwanted changes to the region.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Narcissa Whitman, the ABCFM missions in Oregon, and the longlasting legacies of the mission period, you can visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whmi/index.htm\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> in Walla Walla, Washington.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>William Henry Gray was born on September 8, 1810, in Fairfield, New York. He started as a cabinet maker’s apprentice in Springfield, New York. William began his religious pursuits in 1831 when he joined the Presbyterian Church, at which his brother was a minister. After William decided to apply for a missionary position with the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions (ABCFM), letters of recommendation were sent to the board. One of these letters described Mr. Gray as having “a confidence in his own abilities to a fault” but also as “a skillful mechanic.”<sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> William was selected to accompany <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/marcus-whitman.htm\">Marcus </a>and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/narcissa-whitman.htm\">Narcissa Whitman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-spalding.htm\">Henry </a>and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-spalding.htm\">Eliza Spalding</a> as a laborer at the ABCFM mission station to be established in Oregon Country in 1836. Mr. Gray began his journey to Liberty, Missouri, to rendezvous with the missionary party in early March of 1836.<br /> <br /> The ABCFM party arrived at Fort Walla Walla on October 2, 1836. After Whitman had selected his mission location at weyíiletpe, William was tasked with transporting supplies to begin construction on the mission house. He  moved between weyíiletpe, Lapwai, and Fort Walla Walla for the winter, helping with construction tasks as it suited him. Afterward, he announced plans to travel back east to petition the ABCFM for reinforcements for the Oregon mission. This was a surprise and disappointment to both Rev. Spalding and Dr. Whitman.<br /> <br /> Mr. Gray returned to the mission in the fall of 1838 accompanied by his new bride, Mary Augusta Dix, and reinforcements: the Walkers, the Eells, the Smiths, and Cornelius Rodgers. On the journey west, members of the reinforcement party became tired of William. By the time they arrived at weyíiletpe, they refused to live at the same station as him. Mr. Gray wanted to establish a new mission among the Spokane People, but all five other men agreed that he lacked the qualifications necessary to do independent missionary work. Instead, Mr. Gray was assigned to live and work with the Spaldings in Lapwai.<br /> <br /> Over the next few years, tensions between Mr. Gray and Rev. Spalding increased, and Mr. Gray continued to petition to manage his own mission. He attempted to leave the ABCFM and gain employment with the Hudson’s Bay Company at Fort Walla Walla twice and was refused. Eventually, because of the infighting amongst the missionaries, the ABCFM made the decision to recall the Grays and Spaldings back to the United States and end both the weyíiletpe and Lapwai mission stations in 1842. William, however, was still not satisfied with his position in the mission. He resigned and secured employment as Secular Agent and General Superintendent of the Oregon Institute, a Methodist school which later became Willamette University.<br /> <br /> William Gray continued to be involved in the political processes of white settlement in Oregon Territory. He was a founder of the Oregon Pioneer Association in 1867. He spent his last years fundraising for a monument at weyíiletpe to honor the Whitmans but died February 16, 1893, before the project was completed. In 1897, Walla Walla residents secured the funds, and the monument was dedicated and placed on top of the hill where it remains today. In 1916, William and Mary Gray’s remains were moved from their original resting place in Astoria, Oregon, and reinterred next to the Great Grave at present-day <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whmi/index.htm\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>.  <br /> <br /> [1] Testimonial from Reverend Ira Pettibone to the ABCFM, 1836.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on December 29, 1808 to Jacob and Mary (\"Polly\") Johnson. In 1811 his father saved some acquaintances from drowning, but the effort weakened him irrevocably. He died in January 1812 when Andrew was only three years old. Jacob Johnson had been a respected man, but one of meager means. With his death, his wife and two sons were left destitute. Polly Johnson apprenticed her sons, William and Andrew, to a local tailor, though they ran away in 1824.<br /> <br /> Andrew came to Greeneville, Tennessee in 1826 with his mother and stepfather and found an opportunity to begin his own tailoring business. In 1827 he married Eliza McCardle. At that time he had only a scant education, but studied diligently under his wife's tutelage, and he paid people to read to him while he worked. He soon proved to be a capable tailor, and his flourishing shop became a gathering place for political discussion and debate. By 1829 Johnson was elected alderman of the town of Greeneville, embarking on a political career that would ultimately see him hold nearly every elected office between alderman and president, including Military Governor of the state of Tennessee during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> On April 15, 1865, at the death of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson became the 17th President of the United States. One of the primary elements of Johnson's presidency dealt with the reconstruction of the nation following the Civil War.<br /> After many policy disagreements between Johnson and the Radical Republicans in Congress regarding Reconstruction (including his violation of the Tenure of Office Act), Andrew Johnson became the first president to be impeached. During the subsequent trial in the Senate, he was acquitted by a single vote and completed the remainder of his term.<br /> <br /> Johnson did not run for reelection, and was followed as president by the popular Civil War general Ulysses S. Grant. Johnson was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1875, four months before his death, becoming the only former president to serve in the Senate. He was buried in Greeneville with a copy of the Constitution and with his body wrapped in the American flag.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>The Early Years</strong></p> <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt was born in Hyde Park, New York on January 30, 1882. He was the son of James Roosevelt and Sara Delano Roosevelt. His parents and private tutors provided him with almost all his formative education. He attended Groton (1896-1900), a prestigious preparatory school in Massachusetts, and received a BA degree in history from Harvard in only three years (1900-03). Roosevelt next studied law at New York's Columbia University. When he passed the bar examination in 1907, he left school without taking a degree. For the next three years he practiced law with a prominent New York City law firm. He entered politics in 1910 and was elected to the New York State Senate as a Democrat from his traditionally Republican home district.</p> <p>In the meantime, in 1905, he had married a distant cousin, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, who was the niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. The couple had six children, five of whom survived infancy: Anna (1906), James (1907), Elliott (1910), Franklin, Jr. (1914) and John (1916).</p> <p>Roosevelt was reelected to the State Senate in 1912, and supported Woodrow Wilson's candidacy at the Democratic National Convention. As a reward for his support, Wilson appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1913, a position he held until 1920. He was an energetic and efficient administrator, specializing in the business side of naval administration. This experience prepared him for his future role as Commander-in-Chief during World War II. Roosevelt's popularity and success in naval affairs resulted in his being nominated for vice-president by the Democratic Party in 1920 on a ticket headed by James M. Cox of Ohio. However, popular sentiment against Wilson's plan for US participation in the League of Nations propelled Republican Warren Harding into the presidency, and Roosevelt returned to private life.</p> <p>While vacationing at Campobello Island, New Brunswick in the summer of 1921, Roosevelt contracted poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis). Despite courageous efforts to overcome his crippling illness, he never regained the use of his legs. In time, he established a foundation at Warm Springs, Georgia to help other polio victims, and inspired, as well as directed, the March of Dimes program that eventually funded an effective vaccine.</p> <p>With the encouragement and help of his wife, Eleanor, and political confidant, Louis Howe, Roosevelt resumed his political career. In 1924 he nominated Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York for president at the Democratic National Convention, but Smith lost the nomination to John W. Davis. In 1928 Smith became the Democratic candidate for president and arranged for Roosevelt's nomination to succeed him as governor of New York. Smith lost the election to Herbert Hoover;but Roosevelt was elected governor.</p> <p>Following his reelection as governor in 1930, Roosevelt began to campaign for the presidency. While the economic depression damaged Hoover and the Republicans, Roosevelt's bold efforts to combat it in New York enhanced his reputation. In Chicago in 1932, Roosevelt won the nomination as the Democratic Party candidate for president. He broke with tradition and flew to Chicago to accept the nomination in person. He then campaigned energetically calling for government intervention in the economy to provide relief, recovery, and reform. His activist approach and personal charm helped to defeat Hoover in November 1932 by seven million votes.</p> <p><strong>The Great Depression</strong></p> <p>The Depression worsened in the months preceding Roosevelt's inauguration, March 4, 1933. Factory closings, farm foreclosures, and bank failures increased, while unemployment soared. Roosevelt faced the greatest crisis in American history since the Civil War. He undertook immediate actions to initiate his New Deal programs. To halt depositor panics, he closed the banks temporarily. Then he worked with a special session of Congress during the first \"100 days\" to pass recovery legislation which set up alphabet agencies such as the AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Administration) to support farm prices and the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) to employ young men. Other agencies assisted business and labor, insured bank deposits, regulated the stock market, subsidized home and farm mortgage payments, and aided the unemployed. These measures revived confidence in the economy. Banks reopened and direct relief saved millions from starvation. But the New Deal measures also involved government directly in areas of social and economic life as never before and resulted in greatly increased spending and unbalanced budgets which led to criticisms of Roosevelt's programs. However, the nation-at-large supported Roosevelt, and elected additional Democrats to state legislatures and governorships in the mid-term elections.</p> <p>Another flurry of New Deal legislation followed in 1935 including the establishment of the Works Projects Administration (WPA) which provided jobs not only for laborers but also artists, writers, musicians, and authors, and the Social Security act which provided unemployment compensation and a program of old-age and survivors' benefits.</p> <p>Roosevelt easily defeated Alfred M. Landon in 1936 and went on to defeat by lesser margins, Wendell Willkie in 1940 and Thomas E. Dewey in 1944. He thus became the only American president to serve more than two terms.</p> <p>After his overwhelming victory in 1936, Roosevelt took on the critics of the New Deal, namely, the Supreme Court, which had declared various legislation unconstitutional, and members of his own party. In 1937 he proposed to add new justices to the Supreme Court, but critics said he was \"packing\" the Court and undermining the separation of powers. His proposal was defeated, but the Court began to decide in favor of New Deal legislation. During the 1938 election he campaigned against many Democratic opponents, but this backfired when most were reelected to Congress. These setbacks, coupled with the recession that occurred midway through his second term, represented the low-point in Roosevelt's presidential career.</p> <p><strong>World War II</strong></p> <p>By 1939, with the outbreak of war in Europe, Roosevelt was concentrating increasingly on foreign affairs. New Deal reform legislation diminished, and the ills of the Depression would not fully abate until the nation mobilized for war.</p> <p>When Hitler attacked Poland in September 1939, Roosevelt stated that, although the nation was neutral, he did not expect America to remain inactive in the face of Nazi aggression. Accordingly, he tried to make American aid available to Britain, France, and China and to obtain an amendment of the Neutrality Acts which rendered such assistance difficult. He also took measures to build up the armed forces in the face of isolationist opposition.</p> <p>With the fall of France in 1940, the American mood and Roosevelt's policy changed dramatically. Congress enacted a draft for military service and Roosevelt signed a \"lend-lease\" bill in March 1941 to enable the nation to furnish aid to nations at war with Germany and Italy. America, though a neutral in the war and still at peace, was becoming the \"arsenal of democracy\", as its factories began producing as they had in the years before the Depression.</p> <p>The Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, followed four days later by Germany's and Italy's declarations of war against the United States, brought the nation irrevocably into the war. Roosevelt exercised his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, a role he actively carried out. He worked with and through his military advisers, overriding them when necessary, and took an active role in choosing the principal field commanders and in making decisions regarding wartime strategy.</p> <p>He moved to create a \"grand alliance\" against the Axis powers through \"The Declaration of the United Nations,\" January 1, 1942, in which all nations fighting the Axis agreed not to make a separate peace and pledged themselves to a peacekeeping organization (now the United Nations) upon victory.</p> <p>He gave priority to the western European front and had General George Marshall, Chief of Staff, plan a holding operation in the Pacific and organize an expeditionary force for an invasion of Europe. The United States and its allies invaded North Africa in November 1942 and Sicily and Italy in 1943. The D-Day landings on the Normandy beaches in France, June 6, 1944, were followed by the allied invasion of Germany six months later. By April 1945 victory in Europe was certain.</p> <p>The unending stress and strain of the war literally wore Roosevelt out. By early 1944 a full medical examination disclosed serious heart and circulatory problems;and although his physicians placed him on a strict regime of diet and medication, the pressures of war and domestic politics weighed heavily on him. During a vacation at Warm Springs, Georgia, on April 12, 1945, he suffered a massive stroke and died two and one-half hours later without regaining consciousness. He was 63 years old. His death came on the eve of complete military victory in Europe and within months of victory over Japan in the Pacific. President Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of his estate at Hyde Park, New York.</p> <p><em>Biography courtesy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.</em></p>",

She was equally active in the suffrage movement. Like other Black suffragists, she pursued women’s voting rights as part of a broad vision of justice and equality for Black people. Black suffragists saw the ballot as one piece of a fight for civil rights, education, economic power, and an end to segregation and racist violence. <br /> <br /> Garnet was born Sarah Jane Smith in Brooklyn in 1831. Her parents Sylvanus and Annie Springstead were prosperous farmers who made sure their eleven children got good educations. By age fourteen, Sarah Smith was a successful student and classroom monitor. She taught in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and then became principal of an integrated school in Manhattan. Garnet was the first Black woman principal in the city’s public school system.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{81}\" paraid=\"1821359581\">Garnet was also a prominent leader in the Black women’s club movement. She founded the Equal Suffrage League, a suffrage club for Black women, in Brooklyn in 1902. The League met in Garnet's home or in a nearby YMCA in on Carlton Avenue in Fort Greene, at the time a middle-class Black neighborhood. Black men as well as women attended many of the meetings. In 1907, the Equal Suffrage League invited Anne Cobden-Sanderson to speak. Cobden-Sanderson was the first British suffrage leader to visit the United States. The British movement would become more and more influential in the United States over the next few years. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{91}\" paraid=\"766379703\">Garnet also worked to support <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/idabwells.htm\">Ida B. Wells</a>'s anti-lynching campaign and to end discrimination against Black teachers. She was an early member of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), going on to head its Suffrage Department. Alongside leaders like Wells, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin.htm\">Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin</a>, Victoria Earle Matthews, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-church-terrell.htm\">Mary Church Terrell</a>, Garnet connected the women’s ballot to a broader agenda of racial uplift and equal rights.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{107}\" paraid=\"1145465328\">The Equal Suffrage League and New York's white-dominated suffrage organizations did work together. But white suffragists' racism limited the extent of interracial cooperation. In 1910, for example, Garnet met with wealthy suffragist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alva-belmont.htm\">Alva Belmont</a>. Belmont wanted to set up a \"colored\" branch of her Political Equality Association. The leaders set up a public meeting, but Black women's interest wasn't strong. A newspaper report of the meeting noted that white women's suffrage speeches \"did not evoke much applause.\" Black women were already organized for suffrage--they did not need white women to do it for them. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{121}\" paraid=\"651440328\">Garnet’s activism extended beyond American borders as well. In 1911, she and her sister Dr. Susan McKinney went to London for the inaugural Universal Races Congress, an early global effort to promote interracial harmony. McKinney, a fellow activist and the first Black woman doctor to be licensed in New York, presented a paper at the meeting. Garnet brought back word of the exciting progress of the suffrage movement in England. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{139}\" paraid=\"1133031807\">Sarah J. Garnet married twice. In the 1850s she married James Thompson, who died in the late 1860s. (Several sources mistakenly give Thompson’s name as “Tompkins.”) The couple’s two children both died before reaching adulthood. In 1879, she wed the famous abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/black-abolitionists-and-the-fifteenth-amendment.htm\">Henry Highland Garnet</a>. The Garnets apparently separated after a year, and Henry Highland Garnet died in 1882 in Liberia. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{166}\" paraid=\"847073117\">Garnet died in her Brooklyn home on September 17, 1911, shortly after returning from London. At her memorial service, speakers included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/w-e-b-dubois.htm\">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> and anti-lynching activist Addie Waites Hunton. They remembered Garnet as a teacher, a champion of equal rights, a club woman, a suffragist, and a leader of the “womanhood of her race.” She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery[1]. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{184}\" paraid=\"207251059\">In 2019, a Brooklyn elementary school was renamed \"PS9 Sarah Smith Garnet\" in her honor. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{194}\" paraid=\"86398800\"> </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{198}\" paraid=\"720393640\">Notes </h4> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{204}\" paraid=\"1628622168\">[1] Green-Wood Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 8, 1997 and designated a National Historic Landmark on September 20, 2006. <br />  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{221}\" paraid=\"33035054\">Bibliography </h4> <p paraeid=\"{f170fe25-897e-4413-b86a-b57b7ac9bcc4}{227}\" paraid=\"621052962\">Aponte, Claudia Irizarry. \"Bye-Bye Bergen: Brooklyn School Sheds Slaveowner Family Name,\" https://www.thecity.nyc/brooklyn/2019/4/8/21211178/bye-bye-bergen-brooklyn-school-sheds-slave-owner-family-name.<br /> DuBois, Ellen Carol. <em>Suffrage: Women's Long Battle for the Vote. </em>New York: Simon & Schuster, 2020.<br /> Goodier, Susan. “Biography of Sarah Jane Smith Thompson Garnett, 1831-1911,” in Biographical Database of Black Women Suffragists.

Sparrow joined Black women’s organizations to protest racial discrimination and support women’s suffrage.</p> <p>Beyond census records documenting her birth in Virginia, little is known about Arianna C. Sparrow’s early life.<sup>1</sup> According to John Daniels’ 1914 <em>In Freedom’s Birthplace: A Study of the Boston Negroes</em>, Arianna traveled with her mother to Boston in 1852. Daniels, as well as later newspapers, noted that Harriet Beecher Stowe modeled her character Eliza in <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> after Sparrow’s mother.<sup>2</sup> Articles document Arianna Sparrow’s talent as a soprano singer, and she often sung at various public events throughout her life in Boston.</p> <p>Arianna Sparrow’s earliest known public activities centered on the issue of women’s suffrage. In 1885, she participated in Ward 9 suffrage meetings held in the Beacon Hill/West End neighborhoods. Hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mwsa.htm\">Massachusetts Woman’s Suffrage Association (MWSA)</a>, these meetings featured local leaders <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-stone.htm\">Lucy Stone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin.htm\">Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin</a>, and others. In speeches, this group encouraged Black women to register to vote in school committee elections and Black men to vote for local politicians who supported women’s suffrage. During one of these meetings, held at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/twelfth-baptist-church.htm\">Twelfth Baptist Church</a>, Arianna Sparrow “led the audience in the woman suffrage songs.”<sup>3</sup> Two years later, Sparrow helped organize the West End Woman’s Suffrage League, a chapter of the MWSA composed of mostly leaders in the Black community. She became elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the League, and she offered to hold a subscription of the suffrage paper <em>The Woman’s Journal</em> at her home at 62 Phillips Street, in the heart of the Black community on Beacon Hill.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1893, Arianna Sparrow joined the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/womans-era-club.htm\">Woman’s Era Club</a> as a founding member. She served as a leading member of the Club, partaking in many meetings and affiliated events. Through the Club, Sparrow became more involved in local activism and issues that affected African Americans. She joined <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-ann-gardner.htm\">Eliza Gardner</a>, Josephine Ruffin, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florida-ruffin-ridley.htm\">Florida Ridley</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/agnes-adams.htm\">Agnes Adams</a> in a series of 1894 meetings with local Black leaders, including Emory Morris, Butler Wilson, and Clement Morgan, to discuss the anti-lynching crisis. At the end of these gatherings, they established several committees to bring attention to the lynching crisis and to take further action. Sparrow served on the Committee on Petition, the Press Committee, and the Committee on Newspaper Comments and Accounts and on Statistics.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Through her work with the Woman’s Era Club, Arianna Sparrow helped organize the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/1895-convention.htm\">1895 First National Conference of Colored Women of America</a> in Boston, serving on the Committee of Arrangements.<sup>6</sup> During the convention, Sparrow gave a solo performance and helped Florida Ridley as assistant corresponding secretary.<sup>7</sup> This convention created the framework for the National Association of Colored Women, later the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs, which Sparrow also joined.</p> <p>Arianna Sparrow expanded her dedication to social justice beyond the Woman’s Era Club. She continued her involvement in the anti-lynching movement by attending speeches and events throughout Boston, including a mass meeting of women in May 1899 “to Protest Against Lynching of Negroes who Outrage Southern Women.”<sup>8</sup> As someone who remembered the anti-slavery movement, Sparrow attended, and often sang during, many commemorative events in the 1890s and early 1900s. These events recognized the contributions of Harriet Beecher Stowe, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, and other abolitionists.<sup>9</sup> Organizers of these events often linked the battle for freedom during abolition to the ongoing struggle for civil rights for African Americans. For Arianna Sparrow, as well as many other Black activists, this connection between the past and present drove her work for full equality.</p> <p>After decades of service to the issues of women’s rights and civil rights, Arianna Sparrow died in Boston in 1927.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>The 1900 Boston Census states her birth year as 1855, while the 1920 Boston Census gives 1842.

            "bodyText": "<p>When a person dies suddenly, tragically, especially in the “prime of life”, we tend to frame his /her life in those final moments. We can all name such people: John F. Kennedy, Amelia Earhart, the victims of September 11th. These are our heroes. Such a man was Joseph Warren.</p> <p>Joseph Warren was, undoubtedly, the hero of the Battle of  <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Bunker Hill</a> and by dying on that hill that June day in 1775; he became the embodiment of the young nation’s sacrifice. The question remains; how do we separate the hero from the man? How did Joseph Warren, physician, find himself on that fated hill just six days after his 34th birthday?</p> <p>Joseph Warren was born in Roxbury, MA on June 11, 1741, the eldest of four sons of Joseph Warren, a farmer, who died after falling out of an apple tree. Joseph, Jr. would attend Harvard, teach briefly at the Latin School and then study to be a physician (as his mother’s father had been). He married Elizabeth Hooten on 6 September, 1764. Elizabeth brought as her dowry a considerable fortune she had inherited.</p> <p>Dr. Warren began his participation in the radical cause in 1767, with the passage of the Townsend Acts. Warren’s response was a series of articles in the Boston Gazette under the pseudonym “A True Patriot”. These articles so angered the royal governor that he attempted to charge Warren and the publishers of the newspaper with libel, but the grand jury refused to bring forth a true bill.</p> <p>After the publishing of the articles, Warren’s star began to rise in the radical circles. His friendship with Samuel Adams as well as family ties with James Otis (his brother-in-law) and Masonic connection with Paul Revere and other rebel luminaries would put him in the thick of the separatist movement. Warren would become chairman of the Committee of Safety after the “Boston Massacre” of 1770 and would deliver two of the famous orations on the anniversaries of that event.</p> <p>While Samuel Adams was away in Philadelphia in 1774, attending to the business of the Continental Congress, Joseph Warren assumed Adam’s leadership role in Boston and became involved with the raising of militias and procurement of arms and powder. A few months later Adams and John Hancock would return to Massachusetts to find the Crown had placed a price on their heads. It was Joseph Warren, who would direct Paul Revere and William Dawes to warn the two leaders that British soldiers were heading toward their sanctuary in Lexington, MA to arrest them on 18 April, 1775.</p> <p>The news of the skirmishes at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/views-of-the-revolution-360-monument-webcams.htm\">Lexington and Concord</a> would cause Warren to leave his patients in the care of his assistant, William Eustis and ride toward the scene of battle. He would spend the next six weeks readying the militia for the inevitable battles to come. For his efforts, he was elected second general in command of the Massachusetts forces by the Provincial congress on 14 June, 1775.</p> <p>After meeting with the committee of safety at General Artemas Ward’s headquarters on Cambridge common on the morning of 17 June, Warren learned that British forces had landed at Charlestown. About noon, he rode over to the American fortifications on Breed’s Hill. The rest is the stuff of legends: Warren refused to take command, instead going into the line as a regular volunteer. On the third and final British assault near the redoubt, while attempting to rally the militia, Warren was instantly killed by a ball between the eyes. The men that Warren had rallied in those last moments were a spectrum of Massachusetts society: merchants, farmers, mechanics, laborers; white men, black men, both slave and free and indigenous people; all fighting for their freedom. How ironic that the leader was a slave owner.</p> <p>The British forces, upon taking the field, placed Warren’s body in a common mass grave. His remains were later identified by Paul Revere, who identified him by the set of false teeth he had fashioned for him.</p> <p>Joseph Warren became an instant hero. His death was immortalized in John Trumbull’s painting; “The Death of General Warren” King Solomon’s Lodge honored their Grand Master with the first Bunker Hill Monument, which now resides in the base of the present monument. In New England, every state has a town named in his honor. In death he was a hero, his life cut tragically short, and his potential unknown.</p> <p>He left four small children orphaned (their mother had died in April, 1773), whose welfare remained in dire straits until 1778, when General Benedict Arnold (who had befriended Warren at Cambridge) gave $500 for their education and petitioned Congress for the amount of a major –general’s half pay for their welfare until the youngest reached majority.</p> <p>In the course of just a decade, Dr. Joseph Warren married, fathered four children, furthered the revolutionary movement in Boston and died a hero’s death. Perhaps, Edna St. Vincent Millay could have been speaking of Joseph Warren when she wrote, “My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night; But ah, my foes and oh, my friends, it gives a lovely light!”</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Remembered as a remarkable public speaker, Agnes J. Adams actively participated in the Black clubwomen's movement and other Boston organizations dedicated to racial justice.</p> <p>Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Agnes Adams grew up within the Methodist church community and worked as a teacher.<sup>1</sup> Married briefly, Adams moved to Boston with her young son after her husband's death.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Agnes Adams quickly became involved in local Black women's organizations, joining the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/womans-era-club.htm\">Woman's Era Club</a> of Boston. A leader of this club, she often spoke at meetings and other events as a representative of the club. Adams worked alongside other club members to organize the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/1895-convention.htm\">1895 First National Conference of Colored Women of America</a>. During this event she gave a powerful speech on \"Social Purity.\" Historian Hallie Quinn Brown noted that her address had been so moving that \"from that time on Mrs. Adams was regarded by circles, clubs and federations as invaluable in all altruistic movements.\"<sup>3</sup></p> <p>With her work in the Woman's Era Club, Agnes Adams supported Black women using their voices to make positive change. She took interest in a variety of movements, including the women's suffrage and anti-lynching movements. In an 1899 suffrage meeting in the West End neighborhood, Adams encouraged Black women to register to vote and to \"[take] an interest in school suffrage.\"<sup>4</sup> Agnes Adams also joined other club members and local Black leaders in meetings that discussed how to address the lynching crisis in the United States. Together, they formed committees to take action on the crisis and bring it to the attention of the people of Boston.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>In the early 1900s, Agnes Adams continued to partake in many civil rights and political events in Boston's Black community. She attended and spoke at several events that remembered early abolitionists and reformers including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/wendell-phillips.htm\">Wendell Phillips</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a>. While commemorative, these events allowed speakers to draw parallels between abolition and the current civil rights struggles—discrimination and lynching—of African Americans. At Garrison's centenary events, Agnes Adams reflected this sentiment:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>I cannot help feeling that if William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips and those other men could come here today they would be dreadfully pained and shocked to find what a revolution on the race question has taken place in the short time of forty years. But, my friends, though oppression and injustice stalk about the land, I sometimes think that retribution may be coming apace with a strong, avenging hand.</em><sup>6</sup></p> <p>During this era, Adams also joined the Boston Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Northeastern Federation of Women's Clubs, and, later, the League of Women for Community Service.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>In 1922, Adams moved back to Baltimore after the death of her brother. She died a year later.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>In memorializing her life, Hallie Quinn Brown wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>She had something definite to do in the strenuous endeavor to uplift while she essayed to climb. This made her vigilant, patriotic and steadfast toward those with whom she was allied by sex and race extraction. Good women like Agnes Adams have a value not to be estimated. And of such women among us countless numbers are in daily evidence. Uusually [sic] they are ordinary, everyday women...saved from obscurity by that spirit of service which transfigures and glorifies.</em><sup>9</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>The 1920 Census confirms her residence in Boston, as well as her place and date of birth. 1920 Census Record, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, Boston City Ward 7, District 0206, sheet 3B.</li> <li>Hallie Quinn Brown, <em>Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction</em> (Xenia, Ohio: Aldine Publishing Company, 1926), 200-204.</li> <li>Brown, <em>Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction</em>, 202.</li> <li>Massachusetts women had won the right to vote in school committee elections in 1879. \"Colored Women Appealed To,\" <em>Boston Herald</em>, November 17, 1899.</li> <li>Those involved included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin.htm\">Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florida-ruffin-ridley.htm\">Florida Ridley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-ann-gardner.htm\">Eliza Gardner</a>, Arianna Sparrow, Butler Wilson, Clement Morgan, Emory Morris, and others.

His father, Arthur, worked as a harvest-machine repairman until his death in 1929. Arthur’s widow, Ella, was left with young Jack and four other children.</p> <p>After his marriage in February 1942, Fuller and his wife, Betty, lived in Moline, Illinois, where he worked as a “shake-out man” separating solidified castings from molds at the Frank Foundry. The young couple would not be together for long. On August 8, 1943, Fuller enlisted in Moline and reported to the Naval Recruiting Station in Chicago ten days later.</p> <img alt=\"John Jack Edward Fuller Signature\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|816|141|0|4|4\" height=\"141\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6554411|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Fuller-Signature.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:4px;margin-left:4px;margin-right:4px;\" title=\"John Jack Edward Fuller Signature\" width=\"816\" /> <p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>John Edward Fuller Personnel File, National Archives</em></p> <p>The months that followed his enlistment were busy and packed with moves. That fall, Fuller attended the Naval Training School in Farragut, Idaho. In November 1943, he reported to Treasure Island Naval Station, San Francisco, where he entered a short program that involved firefighter, deck petty officer, and gunnery training. Fuller then reported to naval receiving ship, San Francisco before returning to Treasure Island. On December 31, Fuller boarded the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) on the day of her commissioning.</p> <p>Following several weeks of at sea training in Hawaii, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> departed with a naval task force for raids on Japanese targets in Micronesia before moving on to assist in the capture of Saipan, Guam, Tinian, and Peleliu, as well as assist in the campaign to liberate the Philippines. Between February and March 1945, the Navy's attention turned to supporting the Marines in the capture of Iwo Jima as US forces moved steadily closer towards the Japanese Home Islands; the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> assisted in operations that were part of this critical campaign.</p> <p>On April 1, 1945, the naval and air bombardment of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa</a> began. The USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was one of several smaller warships acting as radar picket for the invasion fleet. A mass kamikaze raid on the US fleet and ships of America's Allies occurred on Thursday, April 12, when several Japanese aircraft attempted suicide runs against USS <em>Cassin Young</em>. Most of the aircraft were shot down by the ship’s gunners and others managed to strafe the ship with bullets before crashing into the sea. One plane exploded after striking the ship’s radar mast, killing one sailor and wounding 59. Among the wounded was Fuller, who suffered a bullet wound to the right leg, for which he would later receive the Purple Heart.</p> <p>Okinawa was declared secure on June 22, but Japan continued to launch kamikaze attacks against Allied ships. On July 30, 1945, a single aircraft managed to elude the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>’s gunners and crashed into the ship’s starboard side and exploded, killing Fuller and 21 other sailors and, wounding another 45. This was the second tragedy to befall his family: Fuller’s brother, William, had been killed in an accidental fall at the Isle Grande Naval Air Station in Puerto Rico in January 1943.</p> <p>In a hand-written letter to Fuller's mother, Commander John Ailes recalled: “… his keen wit and good humor made him one of the most popular and well liked members of our crew. We will all miss him terribly. He has served his country with distinction.”</p> <p>Fuller was posthumously awarded a second Purple Heart and Unit Commendation Medal. He is buried at Dayton Cemetery in Colona, Illinois.<br />  </p> <hr />",

            "bodyText": "<p>Eliza Hart Spalding was born on August 11, 1807, in Connecticut and grew up in New York. She aspired from a young age to be a missionary, joining the Presbyterian Church of Holland Patent at age nineteen. In 1830, Eliza and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-spalding.htm\">Henry Spalding</a> began corresponding, and in October of 1833 the pair were married in Hudson, Ohio, where Henry was attending Western Reserve College.</p> <p>Eliza was passionate about language and learning. She was the most educated woman in the missionary party of 1836. She attended a women’s seminary in New York, followed by a year at a school in Hudson, Ohio. While not allowed to enroll because she was a woman, Eliza also attended classes with Henry during his two years at Lane Theological Seminary where she studied Greek and Hebrew. Eliza would also be one of the first missionaries to learn a Native tongue, learning to speak and translate the Nez Perce language.</p> <p>The Spalding’s were initially appointed to the Osage tribe, located in present day Kansas. However, their departure was delayed when Eliza gave birth to a stillborn child and fell ill. In the winter of 1835, the Spaldings were asked to join the Oregon missionary party in lieu of their original destination with the Osage. The Spaldings agreed.</p> <p>Once the missionary party arrived in Oregon Country, the Spaldings settled on the Clearwater River in Lapwai, Idaho, amongst the nimiipuu, the Nez Perce People. Eliza was the first of the missionary party to learn the Nez Perce language which may be why she was also the first to build close relationships with Nez Perce individuals. Eliza was willing to accept help and learn from the women around her before she asked them to change. One instance where Eliza accepted help from nimiipuu women was when she gave birth to a daughter, also named Eliza, in November 1837. She would have three more children in the years following: Henry, Martha, and Amelia.</p> <p>Eliza’s positive relationships with nimiipuu people may have been her family’s saving grace after the attack on the weyíiletpuu mission station in late November 1847. After news of the attack reached Lapwai, Eliza turned to trusted Nez Perce friends to help her family. These individuals, including leaders Timothy and Thunder Eyes, helped protect the Spalding family as well as other American immigrants at the Lapwai mission from potential threats.</p> <p>In the years after the events at Weyíiletpe, the Spaldings moved their family from Lapwai to the Willamette Valley, in the present-day state of Oregon. Eliza Spalding died on January 7, 1851. After her death, Eliza’s husband moved back to Lapwai, and was eventually buried there. Eliza’s remains were moved to Lapwai in 1913 to rest next to her husband.</p> <p>To learn more about Eliza Spalding and her husband, you can visit <a href=\"nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historical Site</a> in Walla Walla, Washington, or the Spalding site of <a href=\"nps.gov/nepe\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a>, in Lapwai, Idaho.</p>",

Today, visitors to Harry S. Truman National Historic Site can experience the surroundings Truman knew as a young man of modest ambition through his political career and final years as a former president.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Born in Lamar, Missouri on May 8, 1884, his family moved to a farm near Grandview in 1887, then, in 1890, to Independence. Harry attended public schools in Independence, graduating from high school in 1901. In 1906 he returned to Grandview to help his father run the farm. He continued working as a farmer for more than ten years.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">From 1905 to 1911, Truman served in the Missouri National Guard. When the United States entered World War I, he helped organize the 2nd Regiment of Missouri Field Artillery, which was quickly called into Federal service as the 129th Field Artillery and sent to France. Truman was promoted to Captain and given command of the regiment's Battery D. </span></p> <p>On June 28, 1919, Truman married Bess Wallace, whom he had known since childhood. Their only child, Mary Margaret, was born on February 17, 1924. From 1919 to 1922 he ran a men's clothing store in Kansas City with his wartime friend, Eddie Jacobson. The store failed in the postwar recession.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Turning to local politics, Truman was elected in 1922, to be one of three judges of the Jackson County Court. Judge Truman whose duties were in fact administrative rather than judicial, built a reputation for honesty and efficiency in the management of county affairs. He was defeated for reelection in 1924, but won election as presiding judge in the Jackson County Court in 1926. He won reelection in 1930.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1934, Truman was elected to the United States Senate. Truman gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program. This committee, which came to be called the Truman Committee, sought with considerable success to ensure that defense contractors delivered to the nation quality goods at fair prices.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In July 1944, Truman was nominated to for Vice President with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. On January 20, 1945, he took the vice-presidential oath, and after President Roosevelt's unexpected death only eighty-two days later on April 12, 1945, he was sworn in as the nations' thirty-third President.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">As President, Truman oversaw the ending of the war in Europe. He participated in a conference at Potsdam, Germany and worked to lay groundwork for the final stage of the war against Japan. Truman approved the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan on August 6 and 9, 1945. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Truman's presidency was marked by important foreign policy initiatives. The Truman Doctrine was an enunciation of American willingness to provide military aid to countries resisting communist insurgencies; the Marshall Plan sought to revive the economies of the nations of Europe in the hope that communism would not thrive in the midst of prosperity; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization built a military barrier confronting the Soviet-dominated part of Europe. Truman's recognition of Israel in May 1948 demonstrated his support for democracy and his commitment to a homeland for the Jewish people. The one time during his presidency when a communist nation invaded a non-communist one -- when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950 -- Truman responded by waging undeclared war.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The Truman administration went beyond the New Deal in the area of civil rights. Truman was able to use his powers as President to achieve some important changes. He issued executive orders desegregating the armed forces and forbidding racial discrimination in Federal employment. He also established a Committee on Civil Rights and encouraged the Justice Department to argue before the Supreme Court on behalf of plaintiffs fighting against segregation.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1948, Truman won reelection. His defeat had been widely expected and often predicted, but Truman's energy in undertaking his campaign and his willingness to confront issues won a plurality of the electorate for him. His famous \"Whistlestop\" campaign tour through the country has passed into political folklore, as has the photograph of the beaming Truman holding up the newspaper whose headline proclaimed, \"Dewey Defeats Truman.\"</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Truman left the presidency and retired to Independence in January 1953. He spent his days reading, writing, lecturing and taking long brisk walks. He took particular satisfaction in founding and supporting his Presidential Library, which made his papers available to scholars, and which opened its doors to everyone who wished to have a glimpse of his remarkable life and career.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Harry S. Truman died on December 26, 1972 at age 88. Bess Truman died on October 18, 1982 at age 97. They are buried side by side in his Presidential Library's courtyard just down the road from his \"Summer White House.\"</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Henry Harmon Spalding was born in 1803, educated at Lane Theological Seminary, and ordained in 1853 into the Presbyterian ministry. In 1836, Henry and his wife <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-spalding.htm\">Eliza</a> traveled alongside <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/marcus-whitman.htm\">Marcus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/narcissa-whitman.htm\">Narcissa Whitman</a> across the continent and over the Rocky Mountains to open missions in the Pacific Northwest on behalf of the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions (ABCFM). The Spalding’s were initially appointed to the Osage tribe, located in present day Kansas, however they were delayed. When the Whitmans needed another missionary couple to accompany them to Oregon Country, the Spaldings agreed to change their destination.<br /> <br /> The Spaldings settled among the nimiipuu, or Nez Perce People, in present-day Idaho while the Whitmans established a mission with the weyíiletpuu, or Cayuse People. The Spaldings’ initial mission site was approximately two miles up Lapwai Creek from the Clearwater River. There, they built a rough log structure in November 1836.<br /> <br /> There are letters that suggest that Henry Spalding may have proposed marriage to Narcissa earlier in their lives and that Narcissa refused his offer. Whether this was the cause or not, there was personal conflict between the two missionaries for years. Henry had publicly made a statement that he “would not go into the same mission with her [Narcissa], questioning her judgment.”<sup> 1</sup> A few years after the mission stations were established, Narcissa wrote to her family that Spalding “never ought to have come.”<sup>2</sup> The hurt feelings sowed discord throughout the eleven years of the Oregon missions.<br /> <br /> During his time as a missionary to the Nez Perce, Rev. Spalding faced more serious challenges and issues than his rocky personal history with the Whitmans. He struggled to learn the Nez Perce language, and he often directed his fiery temper and the end of a lash at the Nez Perce people to whom he was ministering.<br /> <br /> Two years after establishing a mission, the Spaldings moved to the mouth of Lapwai Creek, where it joins the Clearwater River, to continue working with the nimiipuu. Henry, being an ordained minister, was more willing to nominate Nez Perce individuals to be members of the church. In contrast, the other ABCFM missionaries in Oregon Country were much stricter in how they upheld church membership requirements. As a result, Rev. Spalding admitted new converts to the church while the Whitmans admitted none.<br /> <br /> After the November 1847 attack on the weyíiletpe mission, Henry and his family were quickly taken to the home of William Craig by some trusted Nez Perce individuals. There was fear that the alienated and frustrated Cayuse and Nez Perce peoples might look to harm the Spalding family after the death of the Whitmans. About a month after the attack, the Spaldings traveled from Nez Perce Country to Fort Walla Walla to be taken by the Hudson’s Bay Company to the Willamette Valley with the hostages from the weyíiletpe mission.<br /> <br /> Henry Spalding lived and worked in the Willamette Valley until 1862 when he returned to Lapwai to continue his religious work among the Nez Perce People. He died there in 1874 and is buried near present-day Nez Perce National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Henry and Eliza Spalding, you can visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whmi/index.htm\">Whitman Mission National Historical Site</a> in Walla Walla, Washington, or the Spalding site of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nepe/index.htm\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a>, in Lapwai, Idaho.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> [1] Henry Spalding, diary, July 9th, 1840.<br /> [2] Letter from Narcissa Whitman to her parents, October 14th, 1840.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Marcus Whitman was born in 1802 in what is now Rushville, New York. When his father died in 1810, Marcus was sent to live with an uncle in Massachusetts. His uncle and grandfather provided him with an education and “constant religious instruction and care.”<sup>1</sup> <br /> <br /> His teenage years were spent in Plainfield, Massachusetts. By age 17, Marcus was greatly influenced by religious revivals happening throughout New England, now known as the Second Great Awakening. By the time he returned to Rushville in 1820, he knew that he wanted to be a minister and told his family of his desire. They were not very supportive of his goal, perhaps because it took seven years to become a minister- four years of college, followed by three years in a theological seminary- or perhaps because one of the family businesses was a tavern and the Second Great Awakening strengthened support for temperance.<br /> <br /> At the time, becoming a doctor required less schooling than becoming a minister, so Marcus instead began studying medicine. He was an apprentice to Rushville's doctor for possibly up to two years and may have spent some of that time teaching. In 1825, he enrolled in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District of New York, Fairfield; after sixteen weeks, he was qualified for a license to practice medicine. He went to Canada to put his license to use, spending about two and a half years in the Niagara District before returning to Rushville. <br /> <br /> When he returned, Marcus was still interested in becoming a minister. He began pursuing the ministry, but his studies were cut short by illness and never completed. However, in October 1831, he returned to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Fairfield, and earned his Medical Doctor (M.D.) degree. <br /> <br /> After receiving his M.D., Marcus settled in Wheeler, New York, where he lived until 1835. In 1834, Marcus Whitman was brought to the attention of the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions (ABCFM) in Boston, Massachusetts. Due to the ill health that had prevented Marcus from completing his ministerial studies, the ABCFM was hesitant to accept him as a missionary and did not appoint him as such at that time.<br /> <br /> After later receiving more letters recommending Dr. Whitman to the Board, the Board met in 1835 and appointed Dr. Whitman as a missionary doctor. His appointment began with orders to accompany Samuel Parker to the Rocky Mountains that summer and scout out a location for a mission. The ABCFM was not fond of the idea of sending unmarried men abroad, however, so Marcus needed to get married before he left for his mission station in Oregon Country.<br /> <br /> Marcus visited <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/narcissa-whitman.htm\">Narcissa Prentiss </a>at her family’s home in February 1835. The two may or may not have been acquainted beforehand, but by the end of the visit Marcus had proposed to Narcissa. Narcissa, who also wished to be a missionary and also needed to marry to do so, accepted Marcus' proposal. Both had a year to anticipate their marriage while Marcus made his journey west for the first time with Samuel Parker.<br /> <br /> Marcus and Narcissa married in February 1836 and almost immediately set off on their journey west to a new life as missionaries among the weyíiletpuu, or Cayuse people. They were joined by fellow ABCFM missionaries <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-spalding.htm\">Reverend Henry </a>and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-spalding.htm\">Eliza Spalding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-gray.htm\">William Henry Gray</a>. The missionaries traveled overland with a caravan of traders and reached the Columbia Plateau in the fall of 1836. <br /> <br /> Between 1836 and 1847, life changed greatly for the Whitmans, the other missionaries, and the Cayuse Nation. Marcus Whitman continued to practice medicine and served as a tıwáat, a weyíiletpuu doctor. Along with the other missionaries who were assigned to the Oregon missions, Dr. Whitman also attempted to convert Native peoples and introduce extensive changes to the traditional lifestyle. Many weyíiletpuu adopted some of the ideas Whitman endorsed, but not to the extent he had hoped. For example, though many began interweaving Christian beliefs into their spiritual practice, none met Dr. Whitman’s high standards for admittance to the church. He did not have any official converts over the eleven years that he operated the mission.<br /> <br /> The missionaries also quarreled with each other over how to run the mission stations and meet their goals. Some of their disagreements were very personal, and they struggled to cooperate to the point that the ABCFM ordered some of the mission stations to close. In response, the missionaries decided Marcus should ride back to Boston to appeal the decision to close the mission. Stories of his 1842 ride east to stop the ABCFM from closing some of the Oregon missions became a legend that \"Whitman saved Oregon,\" making it seem that Marcus single-handedly led to Oregon Country becoming a part of the United States. In reality, this was not the case. Though he did return west with the 1843 wave of United States emigrants and provide some guidance, that was not the intent of Dr. Whitman’s ride nor did he play a role in organizing the wagon train. <br /> <br /> Over the years, miscommunications and misunderstandings grew into frustration and conflict between the weyíiletpuu people and the missionaries. The situation came to a breaking point in 1847 when a measles epidemic struck the Columbia Plateau. Dr. Whitman’s treatments were significantly less effective for weyíiletpuu patients than they were for patients arriving from the United States. Trust between Whitman and many Cayuse people was already waning, and the imbalanced results of the doctor’s treatments struck some as suspicious. <br /> <br /> Part of Cayuse traditional law was that a tıwáat could be killed for malpractice if it resulted in death. The Whitmans were aware of this law, and in November of 1847, Marcus was warned that his welcome was running out. When he continued to lose Cayuse patients during the measles epidemic, a small group of Cayuse men decided to act on the law. On November 29, 1847, the group attacked the mission, killing Marcus and Narcissa Whitman and eleven others.<br /> <br /> The death of the Whitmans sparked outrage from United States citizens who ensured their names continued on. Cushing Eells, another missionary who had joined the Whitmans and Spaldings in Oregon Country, built Whitman Seminary on the grounds of the old mission. It later moved to Walla Walla and became Whitman College. A statue of Marcus was erected in Statuary Hall in Washington D.C. Then, one hundred years after the mission was established, the mission site became a part of the National Park Service in 1936. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> [1] Letter dated June 3, 1834, from Marcus Whitman to the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions</p>",

            "bodyText": "Inspired by her father’s work as a park ranger, and being an avid outdoor enthusiast and conservationist, Sherma Bierhaus pursued a career with the National Park Service. Little did she know that she would be paving the way for generations of women behind her.  <br /> <br /> While she was enrolled in a management program, she had the opportunity to act as the superintendent of Timpanogos Cave National Monument. This was the first time that a female acted in this role. She worked at Timpanogos from 1974 until 1982, when she was transferred to Arches National Park where she stayed until 1986. Yet again she set a record as the first female superintendent of a national park. <br /> <br /> Even as a child, she had aspirations to become a superintendent: <br /> <br /> “I told him, ‘Someday I'm going to be a superintendent of a park.’ He just laughed, he said, ‘You don't know what you're talking about.’ I said, ‘Yes I do. That's what I'm going to do someday.’ At the time it was such a male oriented agency. The superintendent’s secretaries were females, but even the clerks were male.<br /> <br /> Right everybody was male. This was not an organization for females by any means. I know that that's what my dad was thinking. He always told us we could do what we chose to do or made our minds up to do. He wasn't putting me down for thinking that way, but knowing the realities of the agency, he didn't think that it could ever happen. (...) He didn't think that the possibility of a woman becoming a superintendent was very feasible.”<br /> <br /> Despite the challenges, Sherma pushed forward with her goals, and proved that women could hold important positions within the National Park Service. Without her tenacity, women’s roles in park management would be very different. She paved the way for generations of women behind her, and inspired others to chase their dreams and pursue careers with the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> <br /> Resources: Timpanogos Cave National Monument Oral History Project",

            "bodyText": "<strong>How do you make a difference in your community?</strong> <hr /><em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em><br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lindsay Davis was a writer, teacher, and leader in the African American women’s club and settlement house movements. Through these channels, she advocated for the civil rights, education, self-determination, and equitable employment of African American women and girls in Chicago, throughout Illinois, and across the United States. Davis served as a national organizer for the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) for twelve years. Founded in 1896, the NACW encouraged self-determination for African American women and their ability to uplift others around them. The group’s motto “Lifting as We Climb” underpinned much of Davis’s work.<br /> <br /> Davis was born in Peoria, Illinois in 1855. She was the oldest of six children born to Thomas and Sophia Lindsay. They participated in local civic clubs and organizations to advocate for African American civil rights. They also promoted better housing, living conditions, education, and access to social services.<br /> <br /> As a girl, Davis attended a small, one-room school for African American children. Her parents later sent her to an integrated school 55 miles north in Princeton, Illinois because the schools in Princeton offered Black students a better education than the schools in Peoria. In 1873, Davis graduated from Princeton Township High School with high honors. She also delivered her class’s commencement address, “The Past and Future of the Negro.”<br /> <br /> After graduation, Davis became a teacher. She moved around the Midwest to work at different schools. In 1885, she married podiatrist Dr. William H. Davis. They moved to Chicago in 1893. Davis also wrote an advice column in the <em>Gate City Press</em> and contributed to the <em>Chicago Defender</em> and <em>National Notes</em>, the official organ of the NACW.<br /> <br /> After relocating to Chicago, Davis became involved in local, state, and national activism through her work in Black women’s clubs. Predominantly middle-class African American women participated in these organizations. They hoped to serve as role models for less wealthy women by protesting discrimination and promoting respectable homes, childcare, and behavior.<br /> <br /> Davis served as the first secretary of the Ida B. Wells Club. Anti-lynching activist and journalist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/idabwells.htm\">Ida B. Wells</a> founded the group in 1893 to aid local African American residents. Some of the Club’s successes include the establishment of the first African American orchestra in Chicago and the first kindergarten for African Americans in the Bronzeville neighborhood. The Ida B. Wells Club also opposed racial segregation in Chicago as part of the League of Cook County Clubs. <br /> <br /> In March 1896, Davis co-founded the Phyllis Wheatley Woman’s Club. The organization sought to improve the local neighborhood. Some of its initiatives included the closure of a rowdy saloon and the establishment of a sewing school and day nursery. During the late 1800s, many African Americans migrated from the south to northern cities. Because of the influx of African American women to Chicago, the Club also helped recent migrants find safe housing and stable employment. Davis served as club president for twenty-eight years. <br /> <br /> In 1897, Davis and Connie Curl, president of the Women’s Civic League, represented Illinois at the first biennial meeting of the NACW. This meeting was held in Howard Chapel on the Fisk University campus in Nashville, Tennessee. One of Davis’ and Curl’s goals was to secure Chicago as the meeting place for the next biennial. When they succeeded, a group of Black women’s clubs from across Illinois, informally known as the ‘Magic Seven’ decided to organize and coordinate hosting duties. By 1899, this ‘Women’s Conference’ had become the Illinois Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs. That year, the NACW hosted its second biennial at Quinn Chapel of the A.M.E. Church, the oldest African American church in Chicago.[1] <br /> <br /> In 1918, Davis served as the official historian of the Illinois Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs and wrote its history, <em>The Story of the Illinois Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs, 1900-1922</em>. She hoped that the stories of triumph and hardship would inspire younger generations to continue to advocate for Black women’s rights. In 1933, Davis finished a second book, just in time for the Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago. This work, entitled <em>Lifting as We Climb</em>, details the history of the NACW. Davis also wrote about women’s suffrage in <em>The Crisis</em>, the official magazine of the National Association for Colored People (NAACP). She and other NACW clubwomen contributed to debates about what a Black woman’s role in society should be.<br /> <br /> In addition to these larger groups, Davis was committed to meeting the needs of Black women on the South Side of Chicago. She founded a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/settlement-houses-in-chicago.htm\">settlement house</a>, the Phyllis Wheatley Home for Girls, in 1908. The home provided housing, health and educational services, and camaraderie for local African American women and girls. Founded in 1926, the last Phyllis Wheatley Home is still standing on South Michigan Avenue near 51st Street.[2] After dedicating her life to Black women and girls’ success, Davis died in Chicago in 1944.<br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> <br /> [1] Quinn Chapel as listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. <br /> <br /> [2] The former Phyllis Wheatley Home for Girls is listed in the Illinois Preservation Services Division’s Historic and Architectural Resources Geographic Information Systems database of historic sites and structures.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Selected Sources:</strong><br /> <br /> Barlas-Howell, Feride. “<a href=\"https://search.alexanderstreet.com/view/work/bibliographic_entity%7Cbibliographic_details%7C3957490/biographical-sketch-elizabeth-lindsay-davis#page/1/mode/1/chapter/bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|3957490\">Biographical Sketch of Elizabeth Lindsay Davis, 1855-1944</a>.” Biographical Database of Black Women Suffragists.

            "bodyText": "Ida B. Wells is an African American civil rights advocate, journalist, and feminist. She is an American Hero. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/suffrage60seconds_ida_b_wells.htm\">View a short video</a> about her work to guarantee access to the vote.<br /> <br /> Wells was born enslaved in Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1862. She was the oldest daughter of James and Lizzie Wells. During Reconstruction, her parents were active in the Republican Party. Mr. Wells was involved with the Freedman's Aid Society and helped start Rust College. Rust is an historically black liberal arts college. It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and was one of 10 Historic Black Colleges and Universites founded before 1869 that are still operating.<br /> <br /> Wells attended Rust College to receive her early education, but was forced to drop out. At 16, Wells lost both parents and one of her siblings in a yellow fever outbreaks. She convinced a nearby school administrator that she was 18, and landed a job as a teacher to take care of her siblings.<br /> <br /> In 1882, Wells moved with her sisters to Memphis, Tennessee to live with their aunt. Her brothers found work as carpentry apprentices, and for a time Wells continued her education at Fisk University in Nashville. While on a train ride from Memphis to Nashville in May 1884, Wells reached a turning point. She had bought a first-class ticket, but the train crew forced her to move to the car for African Americans. Wells refused on principle, before being forcibly removed from the train. As she was being removed, she bit one of the crew members. Wells sued the railroad, and won a $500 settlement in a circuit case court. The decision was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court.<br /> <br /> Following this incident, Wells began writing about issues of race and politics in the South. Using the name \"Iola\", Wells had a number of her articles published in black newspapers and periodicals. She later became an owner of two newspapers: <em>The Memphis Free Speech</em> <em>and Headlight </em>and <em>Free Speech. </em>In addition to working as a journalist and publisher, Wells worked as a teacher in a segregated public school in Memphis. She was a vocal critic of the condition of segregated schools in the city, and was fired from her job in 1891 because of her criticism.<br /> <br /> In 1892, Wells turned her attention to anti-lynching after a friend and two of his business associates were murdered. Tom Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Will Stewart started a grocery store, which drew customers away from a white-owned store in the neighborhood. The white store owner and his supporters clashed with Moss, McDowell, and Stewart on multiple occasions. One night they had to guard their store against an attack, and ended up shooting several of the white men. They were arrested, and taken to jail. Unfortunately, they did not have a chance to defend themselves. A lynch mob took them from their cells and murdered them. Wells wrote articles decrying the lynching and risked her own life traveling the south to gather information on other lynchings. One of her editorials pushed some of the city's whites over the edge. A mob stormed her newspaper office and destroyed all of her equipment. Wells was in New York at the time of the incident, which likely saved her life. She stayed in the North after her life was threatened and wrote an in-depth report on lynching in America for the <em>New York Age. </em>This was a newspaper run by T. Thomas Fortune, a former slave.<br /> <br /> She brought her anti-lynching campaign to the White House in 1898 and called for President McKinley to make reforms. <br /> <br /> In 1895, Wells married Ferdinand Barnett, with whom she had four children. Despite being married, Wells was one of the first American women to keep her maiden name.<br /> <br /> In 1896, Wells formed several civil rights organizations, including the National Association of Colored Women. After brutal attacks on the African American community in Springfield, Illinois in 1908, Wells took action. In 1909, she attended a conference for an organization that would later become the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Though she is considered a founder of the NAACP, Wells cut ties with the organization because she felt it that in its infancy it lacked action-based initiatives.<br /> <br /> Wells was an active fighter for woman suffrage, particularly for Black women. On January 30, 1913 Wells founded the Alpha Suffrage Club in Chicago. The club organized women in the city to elect candidates who would best serve the Black community. As president of the club, Wells was invited to march in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woman-suffrage-procession1913.htm\">1913 Suffrage Parade</a> in Washington, DC along with dozens of other club members. Organizers, afraid of offending Southern white suffragists, asked women of color to march at the back of the parade. Wells refused, and stood on the parade sidelines until the Chicago contingent of white women passed, at which point she joined the march. The rest of the Suffrage Club contingent marched at the back of the parade. Work done by Wells and the Alpha Suffrage Club played a crucial role in the victory of woman suffrage in Illinois on June 25, 1913 with the passage of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Act.<br /> <br /> Wells died of kidney disease on March 25, 1931 in Chicago. She leaves behind a legacy of social and political activism.<br /> <br /> In 2020, Ida B. Wells was awarded a <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/ida-b-wells\">Pulitzer Prize</a> \"for her outstanding and courageous reporting on the horrific and vicious violence against African Americans during the era of lynching.\"<br /> <br /> Ida B. Wells is associated with the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Ida B. Wells-Barnett House</a>. It is located at 3624 S. Martin Luther King Dr. in Chicago-- it is a private residence and not open to the public. It was listed as a National Historic Landmark on May 30, 1974.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/20-for-2020.htm\"><img alt=\"More Suffragists You Should Know banner\" data-render=\"1|0|0|0|1360|415|3|0|0\" height=\"415\" id=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/20-for-2020.htm||CPIMAGE:6155437|0|\" src=\"/people/images/20-suffragists-banner-w-text.jpg\" style=\"border-width:3px;text-align:center;border-style:solid;\" title=\"20 suffragists banner w text\" width=\"1360\" /></a>",

On this day, Benammi Stone Garland purchased Joshua Glover and transported him to his farm in St. Louis, Missouri. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{150}\" paraid=\"1102531409\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Glover adjusted as best he could to life in this new place. During the workday, he reported directly to his enslaver. Garland likely tasked Glover with caring for livestock and fixing equipment during the winter months and assisting in the cultivation of corn, oats, and potatoes during the planting season. After a long day of work, Glover probably spent time with the five other individuals that Garland enslaved. They may have discussed rumors of other enslaved persons who escaped. Perhaps they even shared news of the most recent laws put in place to return freedom seekers to their enslavers. Although it is not known what prompted Glover to flee from his enslavers, it is clear that he was no longer willing to live in bondage.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{156}\" paraid=\"1430238859\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Glover escaped from Garland’s plantation in May of 1852 and travelled 400 miles North until he reached Racine, Wisconsin. The exact route Glover travelled to reach Wisconsin remains a mystery. It is likely that he completed most of his travel at night to evade potential slave catchers. When he arrived in Racine, he found employment and housing with a local mill. He chose the surname “Glover” and began living his life as a free man.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{162}\" paraid=\"23641392\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Yet just because Glover had settled North of the Mason Dixon Line did not mean that his freedom was secure. In 1850, Congress passed a more stringent Fugitive Slave Act. This law allowed for Federal Marshalls to travel anywhere in the United States, take freedom seekers into custody, and return them to their enslavers. If abolitionists were to intervene in this process, Marshalls could arrest them. Those who assisted freedom seekers could face up to six months in prison and a fine of $1,000. This law put every freedom seeker in imminent danger of returning to a life of slavery.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{166}\" paraid=\"307820847\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Nelson Turner, a now free man who Glover trusted, betrayed him. In 1854, he revealed Glover’s location to Benammi Garland. Garland and a St. Louis Police Officer went to Racine, where they obtained a federal warrant for Glover’s arrest. A group of five slave catchers, led by Garland, went to Glover’s home, surprised him, and took him into custody. The group took Garland to a Milwaukee prison, and planned to take him back to St. Louis in the morning.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{170}\" paraid=\"110936882\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Racine’s strong community of abolitionists was not going to surrender Glover’s liberty. Sherman Booth led the charge for rescuing Glover. He secured a warrant from a Judge in Racine for the arrest of Glover’s former enslaver and the US Marshal involved in Glover’s capture. A group of 100 abolitionists from Racine rushed to Milwaukee to serve the warrants. When they arrived, they used a rafter from a nearby construction site to break into the Milwaukee jail. A group extracted Glover from his cell and placed him in a wagon headed out of town. Booth was later arrested for his role in Glover’s rescue. His arrest resulted in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin challenging the Constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{174}\" paraid=\"1535381807\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Glover, with the support of local abolitionists in Wisconsin, journeyed to Etobicoke, Ontario, where he lived the rest of his days. He met an Irish woman named Ann -  and their marriage was one of the first interracial marriages in Ontario. After Ann passed away, Glover remarried Mary-Anne Wattes. He worked for the Montgomery Inn for over twenty years, and developed a close relationship with the innkeeper. This proved to be an important relationship after officials accused Glover of stabbing a white man. Authorities charged Glover with “wounding with intent.” The innkeeper provided Glover with a lawyer, and was ultimately charged with “wounding without intent.” Glover served a three month sentence.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{176}\" paraid=\"1752166809\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">As Joshua Glover aged, he moved into the York Industrial Home. Glover died in Etobicoke, Ontario. Despite attempts of the innkeeper to retrieve Glover’s body and bury him with his family, The York Industrial Home gave Glover’s body to the University of Toronto Medical School. </p> <hr /> <h2 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{176}\" paraid=\"1752166809\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Learn More</h2> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{297cad02-2db1-4a64-8b69-849e27694483}{176}\" paraid=\"1752166809\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">To learn more, check out <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gis/storymaps/mapjournal/v2/index.html?appid=0e82df5004394148b125fcbe6377124e\">this Story Map</a> depicting the life and legacy of Joshua Glover.</p> <hr /> <h2 paraeid=\"{a13d4a41-a314-466c-930e-c7837dc22d6e}{123}\" paraid=\"1721473361\">Sources: </h2> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{58613234-cf38-4aba-87c9-fe2062b0ea54}{58}\" paraid=\"237825924\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Ruby West Jackson and Walter T.

He taught until 1947, when he joined the NAACP Legal Defense Fund as an attorney.<br /> <br /> In 1951, a group of students from Farmville, Virginia, was striking to obtain equal facilities at their school. When student leaders contacted the NAACP to get help, Oliver Hill and Spottswood Robinson were assigned to the case, and agreed to help them if they would try to integrate the schools, as opposed to obtaining equal facilities. This case, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, along with four others would come to the U.S. Supreme Court at the same time and become known as Brown v. Board of Education.<br /> <br /> Robinson returned to Howard University School of Law to become dean from 1960- 1964. He left to become the first African American to be appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In 1966, Judge Robinson became the first African American appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. He retired from the bench in 1989.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Ben Conn was one of the older sailors aboard the USS <em>Cassin Young </em>(DD-793). </p> <p>Ben Conn was born in Morehead, Kentucky on January 1, 1912. He grew up in a family of two boys and five girls. When he volunteered to join the U.S. Navy, he was 31 years old, married to Anna Irene Conn, and worked as a chauffeur and groundskeeper for a grain brokerage in Peoria, Illinois.</p> <p>On July 9, 1943, Conn enlisted as an apprentice seaman. Conn attended basic training in the Naval Training Station, Farragut, Idaho (the Navy’s only landlocked training base). He graduated as a seaman 2nd class (S2c). In November 1943 he began specialty training at the Radar Operators School at Point Loma in San Diego, California. In March, he completed a three-week intermediate course at the same location.<sup>1</sup> A radarman was required to operate and maintain a RADAR (<b>RA</b>dio <b>D</b>etections <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>anging) console, the primary battle station of electronic warfare equipment. They trained in specialized, damage-control repair procedures when their assigned ships ventured into combat areas. Radar served as the eyes of a fleet of ships. Conn learned how to work with two radar systems: Search RADAR, model “C”, and search RADAR, model “G”. Model “C” used long radio waves for tracking incoming planes and ships. Its range was reliable up to 30 miles when detecting a bomber flying at 1,000 feet. Search radar, model “G”, used microwaves to look for ships and to aid in navigation. This model had a reliable range up to 15 miles.<sup>2</sup> Used as radar pickets, Destroyers (and Destroyer Escorts) reported to their assigned radar picket stations that surrounded a convoy or fleet; their job was to give advanced warning of any incoming planes or ships.</p> <p>S2c Conn was one of the older sailors aboard USS <i>Cassin Young</i> (DD-973). Most of the crew of the <i>Cassin Young</i> boarded on December 31, 1943, when the ship was commissioned. Conn joined the ship the following March (after completing the training mentioned above), in time to ship out, when <i>Cassin Young</i> headed for active duty in the South Pacific. <i>Cassin Young</i> crossed the equator on April 23, 1944. For Conn and many of his shipmates, this was their first crossing and a very special occasion that earned them the coveted title of “shellback”. On his 33rd birthday (January 1, 1945) Conn was appointed radarman 3rd class (trainee).<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the spring of 1945 <i>Cassin Young</i> was active in the Okinawa campaign, serving on picket duty many times. On two occasions, kamikaze attacks struck the ship. The first attack on April 12th wounded 59 sailors and killed one sailor. The second kamikaze hit <i>Cassin Young</i> on July 30th. The attack wounded 45 sailors. Twenty-two sailors were killed; Rdm3c (T) Conn was one of them.</p> <p>Radarman 3c (T) Ben Conn was survived by his father Millard Fillmore Conn, his wife Anna Irene Conn, and six siblings. He lies buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p> <hr /> <h3><b><b>Footnotes:</b></b></h3> <ol> <li>Official Military File of Ben Conn National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St Louis, MO.</li> <li>Hyper War HYPERTEXT history of the Second World War, U.S. Radar Operational Characteristics of Radar Classified by Tactical Application, <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/Radar/Radar-1.html\">HyperWar: U.S. Radar: Operational Characteristics [Shipborne Search Sets] (ibiblio.org)</a></li> <li>Official Military File of Ben Conn National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St Louis, MO.</li> </ol>",

They settled in the pioneer town of Colorado City located on the eastern flank of Pikes Peak.<br /> <br /> About two years later, Charlotte married 27 year-old Adam Hill, a carpenter and resident of the city. She and Adam successfully homesteaded in the region until 1874 when they purchased land in the Florissant valley. After acquiring the land, they built a new home and moved there with their four children. Charlotte and Adam called their new home the Petrified Stump Ranch. <br /> <br /> The ranch was located about two miles south of the small settlement of Florissant and was in the center of one of the richest newly-discovered fossil sites in the world. Charlotte and Adam gave some protection to the petrified trees and fossil rocks on their property. The fossils and petrified trees provided Charlotte and her family a livelihood and eventually a passion. During the winter of 1874, Charlotte’s two year-old daughter, Luella, became ill, died, and was buried near the ranch. Weeks later, she gave birth to a daughter, Margaret Ruth Hill. Over time, Charlotte dug, sorted, and boxed some of the best insect and plant fossils the world would ever see.<br /> <br /> Little was known outside of Colorado about the fossil beds of Florissant until the early 1870s when some fossils made their way back east to the scientific community. In 1877, scientists from Harvard and Princeton arrived in the area to study and collect Florissant fossils. They visited the Petrified Stump Ranch, met Charlotte and Adam, and were surprised at the vast array of fossil insects and plants that Charlotte had been collecting. All of the fossils were of species that had never been discovered. Some were perfectly preserved. Her fossils ended up in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, as well as museums at Harvard and Yale. In recognition of her efforts, several fossils were named in her honor. In 1880, a local newspaper referred to Mrs. Hill as a naturalist, and the ranch was recognized as a place to visit to see Florissant fossils.<br /> <br /> Charlotte and Adam continued to live on the ranch, collect fossils, and host visitors and scientists from eastern colleges until 1883. They sold the ranch to a group of Denver businessmen and moved back to Colorado City. In 1902, they moved to Santa Cruz, California where they lived out the rest of their lives. Charlotte died in 1930 and was buried next to Adam. The ranch became part of the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument in 1969. Today, thousands of visitors walk the trails and view the fossil sites on what was once Charlotte and Adam’s ranch. </p>   <div> <div class=\"msocomtxt\" id=\"_com_1\" language=\"JavaScript\" onmouseout=\"msoCommentHide('_com_1')\" onmouseover=\"msoCommentShow('_anchor_1','_com_1')\">Sources:<br /> <span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">1880, 1890, 1900 U.S. Census</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Moncrief, Laura and Boyd, Nancy. <i>Florissant, Colorado Pioneer Cemetery - The Stories Behind the Tombstones</i>. 2009.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Fairplay Flume (newspaper), June 17, 1880.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Howbert, Irving. <i style=\"\">Memories of a Lifetime in the Pikes Peak Region. 1925<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.25px;\"><b>.</b></span></i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"> </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Meyer, Herbert. <i>The Fossils of Florissant</i>. 2003.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Leopold, Estella and Meyer, Herbert. <i>Saved in Time</i>. 2012.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Record Book of El Paso Claims Club, 1859-1861, Special Collections of Pikes Peak Library.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:137%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Ormes, Manly and Ormes, Eleanor. <i>The Book of Colorado Springs</i>. 1933.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Meyer, Herbert.

            "bodyText": "<p>Through her actions and teachings, educator Susan Paul instilled in her students a commitment to social justice, action, and change.</p> <p>Born in 1809 to Reverend Thomas Paul and Catherine Waterhouse Paul, Susan Paul grew up in a family that valued education and community involvement. Her father served as Reverend to the African Baptist Church, now known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/amh.htm\">African Meeting House</a>, and her mother became headmistress at a school on Southac Street, which later moved to their family home. Susan Paul’s exposure to her parents’ community roles deeply influenced her. As the daughter of an influential minister, she interacted with local activists such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/maria-w-stewart.htm\">Maria Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-cooper-nell.htm\">William Cooper Nell</a>, and David Walker, and she followed in her mother’s footsteps by becoming a teacher.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Susan Paul taught at Boston Primary School No. 6 and later at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/abiel-smith-school.htm\">Abiel Smith School</a>, both primary schools for Black children of the neighborhood. In addition to the standard subjects, her curriculum also included civic engagement. Paul taught her students about the evils of slavery and took them to anti-slavery meetings where they listened to local abolitionists. In 1832, she formed a Juvenile choir, which performed at anti-slavery meetings and held concerts to raise money for the cause.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Paul's moral education extended beyond her students when she wrote <em>The Memoir of James Jackson: The Attentive and Obedient Scholar, who died in Boston, October 31, 1833, aged Six Years and Eleven Months</em>, published in 1835.<sup>3</sup> Incorporating moral and religious themes, this biography educated children about living a life of character. It also made a statement about race – proving that children of color could become educated and responsible citizens. While the Baptist Sabbath School Society and the Orthodox Congregational Sabbath School Society refused to print or promote her work, Susan Paul received support from others, including James Loring, who printed her book, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, who advertised it in <em>The Liberator</em>. Historians credit Susan Paul for writing the first Black biography published in the United States.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Activism became more central to Susan Paul’s life over the years, as she actively engaged in both the abolitionist and temperance movements in Boston. In 1833, she became a life member of the New England Anti-Slavery Society and the following year she joined the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS). In BFASS, Susan Paul held officer positions, assisted in the annual Anti-Slavery Fairs, and represented BFASS in national anti-slavery meetings in New York and Philadelphia. She similarly became a leader in burgeoning temperance organizations: the local Ladies Temperance Society and the New England Temperance Society of People of Color.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>While dedicating herself to these just causes, Susan Paul struggled with personal and family tragedy. After her sister Anne died in 1835, she became responsible for her aging mother as well as her sister’s four children. Just five years later, her fiancé died of tuberculosis. Paul herself contracted the disease and died from consumption in the spring of 1841--her life cut short at 32.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Remembered as a “clear-sighted and steady friend,” Susan Paul influenced the lives of her students and the community during her brief life.<sup>7</sup> Mourning the loss of Susan Paul, abolitionist Benjamin Bacon wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>My heart is sad when I think of the loss which our cause sustains in the death of Susan Paul. Many are abolitionists from the mere force of circumstances. Not so with Miss Paul. The simple fact that oppression existed was enough to call forth her most self-denying efforts for its overthrow. Not but the wilful perversion of her mental constitution could have made her otherwise than the uncompromising enemy of slavery in every form. Peace to her memory!</em><sup>8</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Susan Paul, <em>Memoir of James Jackson: The Attentive and Obedient Scholar, who died in Boston, October 31, 1833, aged Six Years and Eleven Months, By His Teacher, Miss Susan Paul</em>, edited by Lois Brown (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000) 2, 6, 8-10.</li> <li>Susan Paul, <em>Memoir of James Jackson</em>, 11; James Oliver Horton and Lois E.

She carried a banner emblazoned with the slogan shown above when she led a procession of women through a train yard in 1919. All the women had served time in jail for protesting in support of woman suffrage. The women of the “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/democracy-limited-the-prison-special.htm\">Prison Special</a>” railroad tour of the country wore drab, baggy dresses similar to the uniforms they were forced to wear when they were imprisoned. It was fitting that Lucy led them, since she had spent more time in prison than any other American woman <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/suffragistvssuffragette.htm\">suffragist.</a></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Lucy Burns was born into a large Irish Catholic family in Brooklyn, NY in 1879. After graduating as a top student from Vassar College in 1902, Burns attended graduate school in Europe. She was attending Oxford College when she encountered the militant “suffragettes” of the<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm\">Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU)</a> led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters. Lucy left her studies to join the WSPU and participate in their confrontational demonstrations demanding women’s right to vote. She was arrested several times along with other protestors. In a London police station in 1909 she met fellow American <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul,</a> who had also joined the WSPU actions. They became good friends. Alice left Europe in 1910, but Lucy stayed on to lead the WSPU campaign in Scotland.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">After Lucy returned to the United States, she and Alice teamed up to bring new energy to the American woman suffrage movement. They moved to Washington, D.C. in 1912 to lead the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA.) The committee’s job was to work for an amendment to the US Constitution enfranchising women. Before Lucy and Alice took over, the committee had accomplished very little. The first action organized by the new committee leaders was a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woman-suffrage-procession1913.htm\">Woman Suffrage Procession</a> down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 1913, the day before Woodrow Wilson’s presidential inauguration. </p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Although the procession brought positive attention to the woman suffrage movement, Burns and Paul soon had a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/dyk-alice-paul-carrie-catt.htm\">falling-out with the NAWSA leadership</a>. They broke away and formed their own organization, the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) in 1914. The CU became the National Woman’s Party (NWP) in 1916. The strategy that Burns and Paul developed for both the CU and the NWP included building support for the amendment through actions that would gain national publicity. Lucy Burns became the editor of their publication, The Suffragist, which was distributed across the country. Her editorials were powerful and well-argued. She was a passionate, charismatic speaker who fired up large audiences but she could also be diplomatic and calming when necessary. She had a particular talent for organizing large actions like a campaign across the West during the 1916 election season.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Lucy also became the leader of the NWP’s most prominent and controversial campaign. Women began <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">picketing the White House</a> in January 1917, demanding that President Woodrow Wilson support the federal amendment to the Constitution. The picketers stood at the White House gates all day for months holding large banners that asked “What Will You Do for Woman Suffrage?” and “How Long Must Women Wait for Liberty?” Public opinion turned against the picketers when they continued the protest after the U.S. entered World War I. Rather than back down, Lucy became even more provocative. On June 20, 1917, she and Dora Lewis carried a banner accusing the president of deceiving the world when he spoke about democracy. Crowds began to gather and attack the picketers. The police threatened the NWP with arrest if they continued the protest. They persisted. Two days later, Lucy and Katherine Moray were arrested.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Over the next several years, hundreds of women faced arrest for participating in the NWP protests. Lucy was arrested six times, sometimes serving months in prison. One sentence included the “Night of Terror” at the Occoquan Workhouse on November 14-15, 1917. Women were beaten and tortured throughout the night. Prison guards handcuffed Lucy’s arms above her head and left her that way all night long. Lucy led the prisoners on hunger strikes to protest their treatment. She endured brutal force-feeding. </p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Lucy and the other members of the NWP did not stop protesting after their release from prison. They didn’t let up the pressure after Wilson finally spoke out in support of the suffrage amendment in 1918. They continued fighting for the right to vote and planned tours around the country to tell their stories, including the “Prison Special” tour in early 1919. A few months later, Congress passed the amendment in June 1919. The Nineteenth Amendment became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 26, 1920.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Lucy Burns retired from public life after victory in the woman suffrage fight. Although Alice Paul continued to work for women’s equality until her death in 1977, Lucy returned home to Brooklyn. She explained, “I don’t want to do anything more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, and now let them fight for it now. I am not going to fight anymore.”<br /> <br /> Sources include: Library of Congress, Vassar Encyclopedia, and J. D. Zahniser and Amelia Fry, <em>Alice Paul: Claiming Power</em> (2016).</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Nearly a half a century after adopting nonviolence principles, Diane Nash said in an 2017 interview that, “there was probably no greater invention during the twentieth century than Gandhi’s invention of how to really wage warfare and change society without killing or maiming our fellow human beings...”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> To be clear, for Nash, nonviolence is not a strategy or tactic, nor it is simply the absence of violence. It is a way of life. It is an understanding that the enemy is never people, but rather unjust political and economic systems. Thus, to combat racism, sexism, ignorance, etc. we must love and respect the person espousing the unjust views while attacking their attitudes and actions. Using the Greek word agape, meaning brotherly love, Nash coined the term agapic energy describe this comprehensive phenomenon. This unconditional love for humanity was the driving force behind the movement in the 1960s and can be a driving force among today’s movements, according to Nash. We honor Diane Judith Nash for reminding us of the power of love.</p> <p>Nash was on a date at the Tennessee State Fair in 1959 when she discovered segregated bathroom. A product of a middle-class Catholic upbringing in Chicago, this was the first time Nash had experienced the harsh realities of the Jim Crow south. Driven by anger and the desite to make a difference, Nash began taking courses with James Lawson, a Black minister who has spent time studying Gandhian principles of nonviolence. Aided by her beauty and wit, she quickly became a prominent leader among his students.<br /> <br /> The use of violence, she argues, is counterproductive. Violence tends to increase the problem rather than solve it. And, instead of addressing the true root of the problem, unjust systems, people get injured or hurt in the process—someone, Nash reminds us, deserves love. Once unjust systems, rather than people, are recognized as the enemy, the oppressed must understand that in order to be oppressed they cooperate in their own oppression. Using the example of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Nash argues that Black people boarded the buses, paid their fares, and walked to the segregated section. By boycotting, they withdrew their participation in the oppressive system. In doing so, they caused the system to fall. However, we must remember that the only person we can change is ourself. “When you change yourself, the world has to fit up against the new you…We changed ourselves into people who could not be segregated, and that presented a new set of options to Southern white racists,” Nash says.<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a><br /> <br /> The same agapic energy that propelled the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s can help student and youth activists today. There are six basic steps to employing nonviolent, agapic energy in affecting social change: investigation, education, negotiation, demonstration, resistance, and prevention of reoccurrence. During the investigative phase activists must focus on a specific objective and write it down. Then they must gather any information needed to accomplish the objective and identify how the oppressed are participating in their oppression. Next, activists must educate the cause’s followers on what was learned during the investigative phase. During the negotiation phase, activist must make their opponent understand their objective and make sure they understand their behavior will not be tolerated. Next, the public needs to see the purpose of the objective. In step five, resistance, the oppressed withdraws their participation in the oppression. Resistance takes on many forms. In the final stage, activists work to prevent the problem from reoccurring. Some methods may include the creation of museums, education foundations, or documentary films that examine the problem and solution.<a href=\"#_edn3\">[iii]</a><br /> <br /> Like many Black women activists in the Civil Rights Movement, Diane Nash has not maintained the high profile she had during the 1960s. Instead, she has quietly continued her activism, which remains rooted in agapic energy. Her focus has expanded to peace and the antiwar movement, housing rights, and later to children’s education. In 2016, she helped raised money for a private autopsy of Rexdale Henry, a Native American activist who was found dead in a jail under suspicious circumstances. She continues to help coordinate an annual memorial and celebration of the lives of Andrew Goodman, Michael Henry Schwerner, and James Earl Chaney. Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner were civil rights workers who were abducted and murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi in June 1964. They were working with the Freedom Summer campaign to register African American voters. Before being murdered, they were held in the same jail Henry was found in over 50 years later. Freedom, she argues, “is not something that you get and then you’ve got it…[it] is a constant, never-ending struggle, and every generation faces its own challenges.”<a href=\"#_edn4\">[iv]</a>         <br /> <br /> Nash's work is associated with the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail and the Freedom Riders National Monument. Her stepfather, John Baker, was a porter for the Pullman Company and a member of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Baker helped fund her education, thus Nash can be associated with Pullman National Monument.<br /> <br /> <em>This article is part of the \"Exploring the Meaning of Black Womanhood Series: Hidden Figures in NPS Places\" written by Dr. Mia L.

            "bodyText": "<p>Marguerite “Missy” LeHand, was Franklin D. Roosevelt's personal secretary and confidant for more than twenty years. LeHand was born in Postdam, New York to Daniel and Mary LeHand, both the children of Irish immigrants. In her childhood, LeHand's family moved to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where she was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. The illness permanently damaged her heart and would lead to her eventual premature death.</p> <p>LeHand studied secretarial science at Somerville High School. After holding a variety of clerical positions in the Boston area, she moved to Washington, D.C. in 1917 to serve as a clerk at the Department of the Navy during the First World War. FDR was then serving as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, but the two did not meet. Three years later, at the recommendation of Charles McCarthy, Roosevelt's assistant at the Navy Department, she became a secretary with FDR's vice presidential campaign when he ran on a ticket with James Cox against Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge. LeHand's work on the campaign and her evident personal devotion to FDR caught the eye of the Roosevelts. In early 1921, FDR hired her as his personal secretary and she moved to New York where Roosevelt practiced law and served as Vice President of the Fidelity and Deposit Company.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Roosevelt’s battle with polio, which left him partially paralyzed in 1921, LeHand became indispensable. During the following winters spent with a small party on the <em>Larooco</em>, FDR's houseboat, LeHand acted as hostess in Eleanor Roosevelt's absence. A reliable companion to FDR, LeHand learned to play poker, adopted his figures of speech, and enjoyed his favorite cocktails. LeHand accompanied FDR to Warm Springs, Georgia for physical therapy. And she worked with FDR to establish the first polio rehabilitation center in the country, incorporated in 1927 as the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation. That spring, LeHand suffered what she described as a heart attack, but others suspected she had suffered a mental breakdown.</p> <p>One of the few people who actually encouraged FDR's return to politics, LeHand opposed his plan to run for governor of New York in 1928, fearing the interruption in his physical therapy would prevent full recovery. When he decided to run, she suffered another illness often described as a nervous breakdown. By the time FDR was elected and assumed office, LeHand resumed work and moved into the Governor's Mansion to continue her role as secretary.</p> <p>When FDR became President of the United States, LeHand followed FDR to the White House, where she became the first woman to serve as a presidential secretary and, with Louis Howe, Steve Early, and Marvin McIntyre, she was the only female member of the \"secretariat\" that managed the West Wing. A 1933 Newsweek profile describing her as Roosevelts \"super-secretary\" brought her national fame. In 1934 she appeared on the cover of Time Magazine, only one of three women to receive a cover feature that year.</p> <p>Lehand was a popular guest among Washington society. She was glamorous (LeHand was on Washington's best-dressed list for 1937), vivacious, and playful with her West Wing co-workers.</p> <p>LeHand's importance only increased during FDR's second term. Following Louis Howe's death in 1936, she became the de facto White House Chief of Staff. She was at FDR's bedside every morning as he met with key advisors, vetted his mail, spent evenings with the president in his private study, accompanied him on weekend cruises on the presidential yachts, and as gatekeeper to the President, provided a \"back door\" entrance to the Oval Office. She was recognized as one of the most powerful people in FDR's administration.</p> <p>The exact nature of FDR's relationship with LeHand's is debated by historians, but it is generally accepted that there was an element of romance. LeHand was romantically involved during her lifetime, most notably with William Bullitt, U.S. Ambassador to Russia and later France. Her devotion to Roosevelt was the most likely impediment to marriage. She once asked a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\"</p> <p>In June 1941, LeHand collapsed at a White House dinner party and two weeks later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her old room at the White House, but quickly deteriorated over frustration that she was no longer able to work. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire—probably while smoking—LeHand returned to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts. After her departure from the White House, LeHand never saw FDR again, though he did keep in touch with letters, phone calls and sent gifts. LeHand died after another stroke in 1944.</p> <p>FDR's political advisor and speechwriter Samuel Rosenman called LeHand \"one of the most important people of the Roosevelt era.\" The president's words \"she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty\" appear on LeHand's grave marker at Mount Auburn Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>For centuries, Black women have been survivors of sexual assault. While many have chosen silence as a survival mechanism, there is a long and overlooked history of Black women, like Mrs. Recy Taylor, upholding the tradition of testimony and protest. Despite their trauma, Black women have reclaimed their bodies and dignity by testifying, in detail, in open court about their terrifying ordeals to seek justice against their assailants. Through their testimonies, Black women galvanized efforts against sexualized violence and sparked larger campaigns for racial justice. For Danielle McGuire, author of <em>At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance—A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power</em>, the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott was the last act of a decades-long struggle to protect Black women from sexualized violence and rape. That decades-long struggle began in 1944 with the brutal rape of Mrs. Recy Taylor. She courageously encountered intimidation and actively participated in two separate trials to bring her attackers to justice. We honor her as an ancestor for teaching us a lesson on courage and for her bravery in bringing attention to the sexual exploitation of Black women.<br /> <br /> It was nearly midnight on September 3, 1944, when Mrs. Recy Taylor left the Rock Hill Holiness Church in Abbeville, Alabama to walk home with Fannie Daniel (60 years old), and Daniel’s son, West (18 years old). As the trio walked along the peanut plantations that lined Abbeville-Headland Highway, they noticed an old, green, Chevrolet pass them at least three times. Young white men stared out its windows before the car rolled to a stop ahead of them. Seven white men exited the car with guns and knives. Herbert Lovett, a twenty-four-year-old private in the U.S. Army, told Taylor and the Daniels to stop. When they ignored him, Lovett raised his shotgun. As the group of white men closed in, Lovett said, “We’re looking for this girl, right here. She’s the one that cut that white boy (Tommy Clarson) in Clopton this evening.”[i] Lovett added that the sheriff, George H. Gramble, had sent them to find the alleged assailant. Taylor attempted to run, but Lovett cocked his gun and pointed it at her head, stating, “I’ll kill you if you run.” Lovett then walked Taylor back to the car and shoved her in. All seven men crowded into the car and drove away. A few miles up the road, the car turned off the main highway onto a tractor path into the woods, coming to a stop in a grove of pecan trees. Pointing his shot gun at her, Lovett demanded that Taylor disrobe. She begged to go home to her husband and family. Lovett was the first of six men who raped Taylor that night. After they were finished, they blindfolded her and dropped her off on the highway. After getting her bearings, she began the long walk home.<br /> <br /> As she approached the Three Points intersection, a vehicle approached her. Inside, was her father, Benny Corbitt and Will Cook, the former chief of police. They drove her to Cook’s store, where Fanny and West Daniel and her husband, Willie Guy Taylor, were waiting for her. West Daniel reported Taylor’s kidnapping and identified the car as belonging to Hugo Wilson. Within 30 minutes of her telling Cook what happened, Cook had Wilson, his father, and the old green sedan at his store. Wilson gave up the names of his accomplices: Dillard York, Billy Howerton, Herbert Lovett, Luther Lee, Joe Culpeper, and Robert Gramble. Wilson argued that they did not force Taylor to have sex, but that they paid her. This was a common practice in the south for white Southerners, even racist ones, to visit Black sex workers. Sheriff Gramble sent Wilson home with a $250 bond and instructions to have his parents sign and return at their leisure. The other men were not brought in or ever arrested. If Sheriff Gramble had hoped it was over that night, he was mistaken. In the days that followed, the Black community reported the incident to the NAACP in Montgomery. They responded by sending their best investigator and antirape activist—Rosa Parks.<br /> <br /> Though she had only been with the Montgomery NAACP for a year, Parks was already a seasoned activist. She had been documenting such crimes against Black women and working to ensure that these women had their day in court. Sexual assault was a personal issue for Parks, as a white neighbor attempted to assault her in 1931. Parks took the story back with her to Montgomery and began organizing. With support from local activists, she formed the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor. Its aim was to assist Black women in reclaiming their bodies against sexual violence and interracial rape. By the following spring, it was the “strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade.”[ii]<br /> <br /> On October 3 and 4, 1944, the all-white, all-male Henry County Grand Jury took up Taylor’s case. Though no one expected equal justice, they hoped for an honest hearing. It was only there that Taylor found out none of the assailants had been arrested. This meant that the only witness for Taylor were her Black friends and family. Sheriff Gramble never ordered a police line-up so Taylor could not identify her attackers in order. Deliberation lasted five minutes, and the case was dismissed. The following day, Gramble issued appearance warrants for the men the day after the case was heard.<br /> <br /> Taylor and her family faced violent intimidation. The day after it was reported her home was firebombed as the family slept. The next day Taylor moved in with her father and siblings. Corbitt, Recy’s father, took guard every night in a tree with a gun until daybreak. Black activists in Alabama and throughout the south rallied behind Taylor and demanded punishment for her assailants. As a result, Governor Sparks launched an investigation and Sheriff Gramble was questioned about his failure to ensure justice on the behalf of Taylor. He falsely claimed he started an independent investigation after the attack and that he arrested all the men involved after the assault. To discredit and intimidate Taylor, Gramble took J. V. Kitchens and N.W. Kimborough, Sparks’ private investigators, aside and claimed that Taylor had a reputation around town. Gramble claimed she had been treated for venereal disease and was arrested several times upon written request from the county health officer. Cook backed up the sheriff’s story. After the assistant attorney general, John O. Harris came to Abbeville, Gramble changed his story, claiming that her reputation “is as good as any Negro’s in that community.”[iii] Kitchens and Kimborough interviewed the assailants and almost all of them said that she was a prostitute and a willing participant. Wilson denied being present and claimed to know nothing about it. Lovett claimed he didn’t know why any of his friends would want to bring him into something like that and that he was innocent. Culpeper corroborated Taylor’s testimony in detail. Aided by the assailant’s statements, Culpeper’s admission, and affidavits, and Gramble’s recantations and lies, Governor Sparkes ordered a second grand jury hearing. The case was heard by an all-white, all-male jury on February 14, 1945. They refused to issue an indictment.<br /> <br /> Despite the outcome, Taylor’s case was a major step towards the formation of the civil rights movement. The Committee for Equal Justice for Recy Taylor expanded its approach and signaled is intent to wage war on the ritual rape and everyday assaults of Black women. The committee’s ability to mobilize local people and rally national attention laid a foundation for the formal civil rights movement. Leaders of the CEJRT, like Rosa Parks and E.D. Dixon, would later form the Montgomery Improvement Association, which was responsible for the 1955 bus boycotts. Public transportation became the target of resistance because it was easier and safer for Black women to stop riding buses than it was to bring their attackers to justice.<br /> <br /> Taylor lived with her family in Abbeville for two decades after the brutal assault, which left her unable to have more children. At some point, she separated from her husband, who passed in the early 1960s. In 1965, she moved to Florida where she found work picking oranges. Her only child, Joyce Lee, died in a car accident in 1967. She returned to Abbeville after spending many years in Winter Haven, Florida due to her failing health. Taylor received apologies from the mayor of Abbeville and from the county and state government in 2011 after the publication of McGuire’s book.<br /> <br /> Taylor’s assault speaks to a long legacy of sexual assault on Black women and the arduous task of seeking justice on their behalf. As harrowing as her story is, it is also undoubtedly inspiring. Taylor was an active participant in the journey to bring her attackers to justice. Her story speaks to the resolve of Black women to channel their pain and anger into action. Their tradition of testimony and protest has changed how sexual violence is understood. We must hear their voices and work to understand the historic and contemporary circumstances that shape the experiences of Black women. Through Rosa Parks and the struggle for justice for Black women, her story is associated with the Montgomery Bus Boycott which is a part of the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail.<br /> <br /> <em>This article is part of the \"Exploring the Meaning of Black Womanhood Series: Hidden Figures in NPS Places\" written by Dr. Mia L.

            "bodyText": "<p>Nancy Cook (1884-1962) was born on August 26, 1884, in Massena, New York. She attended Syracuse University, where she became an avid supporter of woman's suffrage and campaigned for protective labor legislation for women, the abolishment of child labor, and world peace. After graduating in 1912, she moved to Fulton, New York, where she taught art and handicrafts to high school students from 1913 to 1918. At Fulton, she reunited with Marion Dickerman, whom she first met in a Syracuse boarding house for students. The two women would become lifelong partners, living together almost their entire adult lives, sharing a life dedicated to politics, education, and progressive reform.</p> <p>When World War I erupted, Nancy threw herself into war-related activities, especially working with the Red Cross and for the Liberty Loan drive. In early spring 1918, she and Marion traveled to London to work for the women-staffed Endell Street Military Hospital. Within months, both had become nursing orderlies in overcrowded critical care units. Nancy, after only twelve days of training, had begun to make artificial limbs for soldiers disabled by the war.</p> <p>While Nancy and Marion were abroad, women had won the right to vote in New York state. When they returned to Fulton, they were stunned to learn that the progressive Joint Legislative Conference had nominated Marion to challenge an anti-woman suffrage Republican leader in the state assembly. Nancy managed Marion’s unsuccessful bid for the New York State Assembly so skillfully that despite Marion’s defeat, Nancy’s organizational abilities drew the attention of party leaders determined to increase the Democratic women's vote. Nancy, unsatisfied as a teacher, quickly left the profession when Harriet Hay Mills, chair of the Women's Division of the New York Democratic Party, asked Nancy to join her staff. Nancy would serve the party as executive secretary of the Women's Division for nineteen years, playing key roles in Al Smith and Franklin Roosevelt's gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.</p> <p>Nancy met Eleanor Roosevelt first over the telephone, when Nancy urged her to headline a fund-raising luncheon for the Women's Division. Eleanor accepted, even though she had never given a speech before that large an audience. They met face to face after the luncheon when Eleanor sought Nancy out to give her a bouquet of violets. She then invited Nancy and Marion to visit Hyde Park that summer.</p> <p>Soon Nancy and Marion became frequent guests of the Roosevelts at Hyde Park. By 1925, with Eleanor they were building Val-Kill, a shared cottage on Roosevelt property. From the cottage, Nancy managed Val-Kill Industries, a craft revival workshop established by all three women. When Eleanor became committed to redeveloping Arthurdale, West Virginia, she asked Nancy to work with the subsistence homestead program. Nancy and Eleanor oversaw the interior needs of each Arthurdale house while Nancy temporarily administered the furniture and woodworking projects of Arthurdale's Mountaineer Craftsmen's Cooperative Association.</p> <p>Yet as close as the three women had become, rifts were developing. Thrilled with FDR's victory, Nancy and Marion could not appreciate Eleanor’s anxiety over moving into the White House. By late 1933, as Eleanor’s responsibilities introduced her to a wider world and her interests and friendships expanded, she had less time to spend with Nancy and Marion. By 1936, when they closed Val-Kill Industries and dissolved their business partnership, Eleanor exchanged her share in the cottage for sole ownership of the Val-Kill factory which she converted to a house for her private use where she could entertain without imposing on or involving the other women.</p> <p>In the summer of 1938, Nancy and Eleanor had a serious disagreement. Eleanor thought Nancy and Marion did not respect her opinion. Furthermore, as historian Blanche Cook argues, Eleanor resented their inference that Nancy and Marion had helped create her. By October 1938, their intense friendship had dissolved into little more than a cordial acquaintance. The legal disentanglement of their financial relationship in the Val-Kill property, Val-Kill Industries and the Todhunter School would take most of 1939. The emotional toll was just as great.</p> <p>In 1947, Nancy and Marion sold their interest in Val-Kill to Eleanor and moved to New Canaan, Connecticut. Nancy died on August 16, 1962.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Before Shirley Graham married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/w-e-b-dubois.htm\">W.E.B. Du Bois</a> in 1951, she had earned a national reputation as a playwright, composer, conductor, director, and author. Born to an A.M.E. minister and a European mother, Graham was raised to appreciate Black culture and music. From a young age, her parents instilled in her the importance of social justice and the uplift of the Black Community. Throughout her life, she continued to advocate for the Black community. For her lifelong dedication, we honor her as an ancestor.<br /> <br /> Graham’s first career was as a composer and playwright. After brief stints at the Sorbonne in 1926, Howard University, and Morgan State University, she completed a bachelor’s and master’s degree in music history at Oberlin College in 1934 and 1935. By this time, she had already become the first Black woman to write and produce an all-black opera, <i>Tom-Toms: An Epic of Music and the Negro</i> (1932). It represented her desire to preserve Black music, particularly spirituals, which she was concerned Black people would abandon. She used the sound of the tom tom drum to tell the history of Black Americas, beginning on African soil. Her goal was to connect the Black community to their roots, something beyond the history of their enslavement. The opera premiered at the “Stadium Opera” festival in Cleveland, Ohio and drew national attention as it featured a cast of 500. The first and only time it was ever performed it drew a crowd of 10,000 on the first night and 15,000 on the second night. It was described as “not only great in conception and splendidly executed, but that it was a new opera, something different from what had preceded it in history.”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> The opera was lost until 2018 when Lucy Caplan, then a Yale doctoral candidate, found a score among Du Bois’ papers.  <br /> <br /> Following her success, Graham decided to develop her craft as a dramatist. In 1936, she accepted a position as the director of the Black division of the Chicago Federal Theater Project. Between 1938 and 1940, Graham wrote and produced five plays: <i>Dust to Earth, I Gotta Home, It’s Mornin’, Track Thirteen, </i>and<i> Elijah’s Raven</i>. Of the five,<i> It’s Mornin’ </i>is the most notable. It tells the story of an enslaved woman who kills her teenage daughter to protect her from their owner.<br /> <br /> Following her dismissal from the Young Women’s Christian Association-United Service Organization for her efforts to end discrimination against Black soldiers at Fort Huachuca in Arizona, she became the national field secretary for the NAACP. She stayed with the NAACP for a year before turning her attention to writing biographies of famous Black Americans, with the goal of teaching young people about Black history. Between 1944 and 1976, she published thirteen book-length biographies, featuring figures such as George Washington Carver, Paul Robeson, Frederick Douglass, Phillis Wheatley, Booker T. Washington, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Her biography of Douglass, <i>There Was Once a Slave </i>(1947), won the Julian Messner Award for being the “best book combatting intolerance in America.”<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a> The award included a prize of $6,500.<br /> <br /> In 1951, Graham married W.E.B. Du Bois, whom she had first met when she was 13. At the time of their marriage she was 54 and he was 83. Together, the couple fought side-by-side to improve the life of underrepresented groups in the United States. A year into their marriage, Du Bois was indicted for “un-American” activities. By this time, he had become an advocate of communism—believing it was more suitable for Black people globally. Praising communist racial attitudes, he argued that, “No universal selfishness can bring social good to all. Communism—the effort to give all men what they need and to ask of each the best they can contribute—this is the only way of human life.”<a href=\"#_edn3\">[iii]</a> However, this was the era of McCarthyism and the birth of the Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO). CONINTELPRO was a program conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1956 to 1971. It worked to discredit and neutralized organizations considered subversive to the stability of the U.S. political system. It later came under criticism from the American public and Congress for curtailing the first amendment and its tacicts. Du Bois was pursued aggressively under this program. For the next decade, the Du Bois’ endured a number of legal battles as a result of his alleged connection to the Communist party.<br /> <br /> Though he was acquitted for insufficient evidence, they decided to emigrate to Ghana in 1961. When her husband died in Ghana in 1963, she took over a number of his unfinished projects. Now widowed and without a U.S. passport, Graham Du Bois stayed in Ghana until 1966 when she was forced to leave after President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown. She moved to Cairo in 1966 after briefly living and obtaining citizenship in Tanzania. In Cairo, she lived with her son, David, a journalist. For the next decade, she travelled throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the U.S. (only twice in 1971 and 1975) promoting anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. She remained devoted to the causes of liberation for African and Black peoples, and world peace. She was diagnosed with breast cancer and went to China for treatment in 1976. Shirley Graham Du Bois succumbed to cancer in March of the following year in Beijing.<br /> <br /> Throughout her life, she remained committed to the Black community. This is evidenced by her simultaneous careers and several prestigious awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (1945-1947), the Ansfield-Wolf Award in 1949, and the National Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1950. Though she became a pariah in American civil rights history due to her association with communism, she has rightfully earned recognition as a creative powerhouse. She is associated with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-web-du-bois-boyhood-homesite-great-barrington.htm\">W.E.B. Du Bois’ boyhood home</a> in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. It was listed as a National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976.<br />   <p><em>This article is part of the \"Exploring the Meaning of Black Womanhood Series: Hidden Figures in NPS Places\" written by Dr. Mia L.

            "bodyText": "<p>Born to sharecroppers in the Mississippi Delta, Blackwell rose from humble beginnings to become one of many unsung Black female heroines of the modern Civil Rights Movement. Forced to leave school when she was 12 to earn a living, Blackwell would later become an outspoken critic of racial and economic inequality and the first Black female mayor elected in the state of Mississippi. We honor her as an ancestor for reminding us of the power to change the circumstances we were born into.<br /> <br /> Blackwell’s entrance into political activism seemingly happened overnight.  A few months after starting to work in the cotton fields, picking cotton for $3 a day, activists from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) came to Mayersville, Mississippi in June 1964. The two activists held meetings in the church she belonged to about the rights of Black Americans to vote. They wanted to recruit residents to organize a voter registration campaign. Despite being in one of the South’s most repressive states, the following week Blackwell and seven others went to the courthouse to take a voter registration test. In Mississippi, registering to vote could result in death for Black people. While outside waiting, a group of white farmers attempted to intimidate them into leaving. Only two of them could enter the courthouse and neither was told whether they passed the test or not. Blackwell and her husband, Jeremiah, lost their jobs the following day after their employer found out that they attempted to register to vote. As a result, Blackwell and her family were left without a steady income and were denied welfare payments. SNCC sent them $11 every two weeks and members of the community would give the family food. Later writing about the incident, Blackwell stated, “…what happened outside the courthouse that day was the turning point in my life.”[i]  Over the next few months, Blackwell attempted to pass the discriminatory test three times. In the fall of 1964, she passed and became a registered voter. The following January, she testified in front of the United States Commission on Civil Rights about her experiences.<br /> <br /> Committing herself to social change, Blackwell joined SNCC after meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in summer 1964. Hamer would become lifelong friends with Blackwell and serve as her mentor for community organizing and freedom fighting. Working alongside Hamer, Blackwell founded the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party in 1964. Founded as a challenge to the whites-only Democratic Party, it had two goals: first, to establish laws preventing Black children’s employment as sharecroppers; second, to establish black schools that would teach mathematics and science. Though they failed in unseating the Democratic Party at the national convention, they gave Black Americans the first ever opportunity to participate in political action. <br /> <br /> In 1964, Blackwell co-founded the Mississippi Action Community Education, a community organization which helped districts incorporate as towns. By setting geographical boundaries, this legal identity aided districts in securing government funding. In 1976, Blackwell was elected mayor of Mayersville. She was the first Black woman elected as a mayor in the state of Mississippi. Through her incorporation of the town, Blackwell was able to initiate programs to assist the poor, as she had while working with the National Council of Negro Women. Before being elected as mayor, Blackwell worked with the NCMW in the early 1970s to provide food and housing for rural families through programs like the Pig and Garden campaign. These efforts led to home ownership and improved social services for residents. Through her efforts, she was able to obtain federal grant money to get Mayersville a police and fire department, a public water system, paved streets, housing for the elderly and disabled, and other infrastructure. Blackwell served as mayor from 1976-2001. She was elected to chair the National Conference of Black Mayors in 1989 and as president from 1990-1992.<br /> <br /> Blackwell continued to be a voice for working rural families. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter selected her to participate in the national Energy Summit held at Camp David, Maryland. Recognizing the need to have educational credentials to continue her rural community development work, she applied for the National Rural Fellows Program. She was selected out of 100 applications, and at 50 years old Blackwell began studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1982. She graduated the following year with a master’s degree in regional planning. In 1992, Blackwell was awarded a $350,000 MacArthur fellowship for her efforts to create the Deer River housing development. <br /> <br /> As a result of her participation in the Civil Rights Movement, Blackwell was arrested over 70 times. Yet, her commitment to racial uplift remained unwavering. Reflecting on her own humble beginnings and activism, she stated, “I’m proof that things can change.”[ii] Unita Blackwell epitomizes the power of community-based efforts and of Black women in the Civil Rights Movement to enact change at the local and regional level.

            "bodyText": "Henrietta Jones was an enslaved woman who was owned by members of First Lady Julia Dent Grant's family prior to the Civil War.<br /> <br /> She was a nurse at White Haven in St. Louis, Missouri, and was owned by Julia's father, Frederick F. Dent. When Julia's brother George announced that he was moving to California, Henrietta was forced to travel west with him (an obituary for George W. Dent states that he moved to California in 1852). Henrietta's move to California is particularly interesting given that California had been admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850. It has been speculated that she was either kept in slavery despite state law or given her freedom and paid wages by George Dent. How Henrietta felt about this is move is a mystery. <br /> <br /> In 1879, Ulysses and Julia Grant visited California towards the end of their two-and-a-half-year World Tour. While traveling through Sacramento and San Francisco, Julia reunited with Henrietta and told the following story in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em>: <br /> <br /> \"Towards the latter part of a reception tendered to the General, a colored woman entered and was announced as Mrs. Jones. She came up and, holding out her hand, said: 'Miss Julie, I do not believe you know me. I am Henrietta, or Henny, as you used to call me at home.' I took both of her hands now. She was one of our old slaves my father had sent with my brother G.W. Dent long years ago to nurse his children. I was very glad to see Henny and told her to come to my room the next day, but I never saw her afterwards\" (p. 311). <br /> <br /> Little else is known about Henrietta's life beyond this one paragraph. There is a possibility Henrietta may have been related to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-jones.htm\">William Jones</a>, an enslaved man owned by Ulysses S. Grant while he lived in St. Louis, but evidence to fully confirm this speculation is lacking. ",

Marion received her bachelor of arts in 1911 and a graduate degree in education in 1912. After a brief teaching assignment in Canisteo, New York, in 1913 Marion moved to Fulton, New York, where she taught American history and became reacquainted with Syracuse classmate <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nancycook.htm\">Nancy Cook</a>, who taught arts and handicrafts at Fulton High School. The two women would become lifelong partners, living together almost their entire adult lives, sharing a life dedicated to politics, education, and progressive reform.</p> <p>When World War I erupted, Marion and Nancy threw themselves into war-related activities, especially working with the Red Cross and for the Liberty Loan drive. In early spring 1918, she and Nancy traveled to London to work for the women-staffed Endell Street Military Hospital. When they returned home the following August, Marion was amazed to learn that the Joint Legislative Committee and progressive Democratic leadership in Fulton had selected her to oppose Thaddeus Sweet, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/anti-suffragism-in-the-united-states.htm\">anti-woman suffrage</a> Republican speaker of the New York State Assembly. Marion had no chance of winning the election; however, with Nancy as her manager, she siphoned away enough votes to prevent Sweet from becoming the Republican gubernatorial nominee. In 1921, Marion accepted a position as dean at the New Jersey State College in Trenton and spent the summer teaching English at Bryn Mawr's Summer School for Women Workers. Unhappy, she looked for a job she loved closer to New York City, where Nancy had moved to accept a position with the State Democratic Committee. By summer 1922, Marion had moved to New York City and joined the faculty of the Todhunter School.</p> <p>Marion met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> in June 1922 when Marion accompanied Nancy, then the executive secretary of the Women's Division of the State Democratic Committee, to Hyde Park for a weekend visit. The three women, sharing political ideas and tremendous energy, became steadfast friends, working together for the Women's Trade Union League, the League of Women Voters, and the Democratic National Committee. As Eleanor Roosevelt recalled in her autobiography, \"Miss Cook and Miss Dickerman and I . . . had been from the first drawn together through the work which we were doing together. This is, I think, one of the most satisfactory ways of making and keeping friends.\" By 1927, in addition to their political work, the three women would share the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/val-kill.htm\">Val-Kill</a> property, Val-Kill Industries, and the Todhunter School. Their friendship would last more than fifteen years.</p> <p>Marion and Nancy prided themselves as diplomatic workers in the sometimes difficult relationship of Eleanor and Franklin. Eventually Marion’s allegiance appeared to Eleanor to favor FDR. By 1932, Eleanor had other new friends like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lorena-hickok.htm\">Lorena Hickok</a> who disliked Marion, and Marion, elated by FDR's victory, could not appreciate Eleanor’s great anxiety over moving into the White House. By late 1933, as Eleanor’s responsibilities introduced her to a wider world and her interests and friendships expanded, she had less time to spend with Marion and Nancy. By 1936, when Val-Kill Industries dissolved, Eleanor relinquished her share of the cottage at Val-Kill in exchange for full and clear ownership of the former Val-Kill Industries factory building which she remodeled as a private residence where she could entertain without imposing on or involving Marion and Nancy. When Marion sought Eleanor’s active help in securing a loan from Bernard Baruch to expand the Todhunter School, Eleanor, who worried about the wisdom of expanding the school when the economy was not strong, refused to invest in the expansion and was relieved when the deal fell through.</p> <p>In the summer of 1938, FDR named Marion to the President's Commission to Study Industrial Relations in Great Britain and Sweden. While she was abroad, Eleanor and Nancy had a serious disagreement. By October 1938, their friendship was in decline. Historian Blanche Cook argues that Eleanor resented the inference that Marion and Nancy had helped create her. Although Marion remained close to FDR, her future involvement with Eleanor gradually faded to only Christmas and birthday gifts. The legal disentanglement of their financial relationship in the Val-Kill property, Val-Kill Industries and the Todhunter School would take most of 1939. The emotional toll was just as great.</p> <p>Maroin continued to be active in Democratic politics and, as an alternate delegate to the 1940 Democratic convention, helped secure an isolationist plank in the foreign policy platform sought by FDR. After FDR's death in 1945, Marion and Nancy moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Marion directed educational programing for the Marine Historical Association, which later became Mystic Seaport, the Museum of America and the Sea. She died May 16, 1983 in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.</p>",

In the 1820’s, Emily married Rowan (or Robin) who was also enslaved by Fisher, despite their marriage not being legally recognized because of discriminatory laws regarding enslaved people.  Emily and Rowan had several children while held in bondage by Adam Fisher in Kentucky. Emily and her family moved with Fisher to Missouri in 1836, traveling the last 100 miles on the Santa Fe Trail from Franklin to Independence. Fisher acquired a farm on Jones Road east of Independence. Much the of the property remains today, including dwellings where people enslaved by Fisher—like Emily, her husband, and her children—would have resided.<br /> <br /> Emily’s father freed her shortly before his death in the 1850’s, though the rest of her family remained in bondage until Missouri issued its own Emancipation Proclamation on January 11, 1865.  Shortly afterward, Emily and Rowan had their marriage registered at the Jackson County courthouse on August 14, 1865. <br /> <br /> As a free woman, Emily managed the Independence Hotel. Under her care, the hotel had a reputation amongst trail travelers for exceptional service and remarkable cleanliness (which was uncommon at the time). Despite Emily’s exceptional care, the hotel business suffered during the Civil War. As a new source of income, Emily created a healing salve. She sold the salve throughout the area, carrying samples wherever she went. Stories of its healing power became legendary. </p> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">Learn more about National Historic Trails</a></h3>",

She was likely the first African American woman to own and operate a newspaper in the United States. In 1952, she became the first African American woman nominated for Vice President.</p> <p>She was born on February 14, 1874 in Sumter, South Carolina. Charlotta was the sixth out of eleven children for Hiram and Kate Spears. In 1894, she moved to Providence, Rhode Island to live with her brother. There she worked for the  black owned <em>Providence Watchman</em> for ten years selling ads. In 1910, she relocated to California for health reasons. After John J. Neimore passed away, she took control of <em>The Eagle</em>, another black owned paper.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Neimore made arrangements while he was sick for Charlotta to own the newspaper and a companion printing business. This made her the first African American woman to own and operate a newspaper. She changed the newpaper's name to <em>The California Eagle</em>, and began to expand its coverage to issues affecting African Americans. She hired Joseph Blackburn Bass as an editor in 1912, and later married him. Charlotta continued to serve as its publisher until she retired in 1951. She and her husband Joseph used the <em>Eagle</em> to push for reforms against issues such as police brutality, restrictive housing, and the KKK.<br /> <br /> Charlotta was a staunch adovate for civil liberties, women's rights, and immigration. She championed local, black owned businesses. Because of her civil rights work, her life was threatened numerous times. The FBI placed her under surveillance and she was labelled a communist. Despite this, she prevailed. By the 1930s, <em>The California Eagle</em> was the largest African American paper on the West Coast. It stood on solid financial grounds, had a circulation of nearly 60,000, and took on important editoral stands.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Joseph died unexpectedly in 1934. Following his death, Charlotta reevaluated her purpose. She began participating in the NAACP, the Urban Leage, the Civil Rights Congress, and the UNIA. She also founded the National Sojourner for Truth and Justice Club, which sought to improve working conditions for black women.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Following her retirement, she devoted her life to politics. In 1952, she became the first African American woman to run for national office as the Vice Presidential candidate for the Progressive Party. She had no dreams of winning, but she campaigned with the slogan: \"Win or lose, we win by raising the issues.\"<br /> <br /> Charlotta Bass is associated with the Historic Resources Associated with African Americans in Los Angeles Multi-Property Submission (MPS). It was approved and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 2009.</p>",

Parks' arrest on December 1, 1955 launched the Montgomery Bus Boycott by 17,000 black citizens. A Supreme Court ruling and declining revenues forced the city to desegregate its buses thirteen months later. Parks became an instant icon, but her resistance was a natural extension of a lifelong commitment to activism. Over the years, she had repeatedly disobeyed bus segregation regulations. Once, she even had been put off a bus for her defiance.<br /> <br /> Rosa Louise McCauley spent the first years of her life on a small farm with her mother, grandparents and brother. She witnessed night rides by the Ku Klux Klan and listened in fear as lynchings occurred near her home. The family moved to Montgomery; Rosa went to school and became a seamstress. She married barber Raymond Parks in 1932, and the couple joined the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). When she inspired the bus boycott, Parks had been the secretary of the local NAACP for twelve years (1943-1956). Parks founded the Montgomery NAACP Youth Council in the early 1940s. Later, as secretary of the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, she traveled throughout the state interviewing victims of discrimination and witnesses to lynchings.<br /> <br /> In the wake of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Parks lost her tailoring job and received death threats. She and her family moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1957. However, she remained an active member of the NAACP and worked for Congressman John Conyers (1965-1988) helping the homeless find housing. The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute Of Self-Development was established in 1987 to offer job training for black youth. In 1999, Parks received the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, the highest honor a civilian can receive in the United States. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) also sponsors an annual Rosa Parks Freedom Award.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Chances are you’ve seen some of artist Charley Harper's work. The bold colors and graphic shapes of his wildlife designs are immediately recognizable. He is known for the style he called “minimal realism,” in which he captured the essence of his subjects with the fewest possible visual elements. In the 1970s and 1980s, commissioned by the National Park Service's Harpers Ferry Center, Harper created 10 paintings for a series of national parks posters. These iconic posters had a lasting influence on the graphic identity of the National Park Service.</p> <p>Harper grew up on a farm in Frenchton, West Virginia. Like many children, he drew to try to understand the world. He attended West Virginia Wesleyan College and then the Art Academy of Cincinnati. He was drafted halfway through and served as US Army scout in France and Germany during World War II. Even then he kept drawing. The unit's chaplain carried Harper's art kit into battle.</p> <p>Harper returned from the war and attended the Art Students League in New York in 1946. He graduated from the art academy in 1947. That same year, he married classmate Edie McKee and embarked on a career in the art field. Harper freelanced for <em>Ford Times</em> magazine, which promoted automobile travel, creating interior illustrations and cover designs in his distinctive style. He also produced nature-themed commissions for conservation-focused organizations, including the Cincinnati Zoo, Wilderness Society, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, New Jersey Audubon Society's Cape May Bird Observatory, Byrd Polar Research Center at The Ohio State University, the Entomology Foundation, Society for Ecological Restoration, Monteverde Cloud Forest School Foundation, and Cornell Lab of Ornithology. His paintings have appeared in illustrated ads, books, magazines, posters, prints, and murals as well as merchandise like notecards, calendars, puzzles, fabrics, and more.</p> <p>In 1966 Harper wrote that if he hadn't become an artist, he would have been a conservationist. He achieved both––he became widely acknowledged as one of the twentieth century’s foremost visual spokespersons for conservation causes.</p> <p>Explore Harper’s life and work through a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charley-harper-road-trip.htm\">virtual road trip</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charley-harper-scavenger-hunt.htm\">scavenger hunt</a> of the national parks posters guided by a National Park Service graphic designer.</p>",

Lucena provided support for all of these endeavors while raising a family. The couple was memorialized in the 1930s for their role as Copper Harbor pioneers when Brockway Mountain Drive, which traverses the ridge of West Bluff, was named in their honor. The promontory overlooking Copper Harbor on West Bluff had been known locally for many years as \"Brockway's Nose,\" given its supposed resemblance to this prominent feature of his countenance. Daniel and Lucena retired in Lake Linden and died in 1899. They were buried together in Calumet’s Lakeview Cemetery, where their migrant story ends.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Old Bob was an enslaved man who lived at White Haven, the childhood home of First Lady Julia Dent Grant. <br /> <br /> Frederick F. Dent, Julia Dent Grant's father, was born (1786) and raised in Cumberland, Maryland. He grew up in a wealthy family that owned enslaved African Americans. Dent became a propserous merchant and trader, and although he was living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the 1810s (a place where slavery had been abolished in 1780), he apparently owned two enslaved African Americans when he decided to move his family from Pittsburgh to St. Louis, Missouri around 1819. Discussing her family's move to St. Louis in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em>, Juia Dent Grant recalled that \"they had a flotilla of three rafts made of huge logs fastened together with chains; on each of these rafts were erected snug little frame cabins of two or more rooms . . . the party consisted of papa, mamma, baby John, Mr. Edward Tracy, a friend of father's, also two indentured slaves, Hester and Bob, with men for handling the rafts, etc.\" There is a possibility Old Bob was born in Maryland and traveled with Frederick Dent to Pittsburgh and eventually St. Louis, where the Dent family purchased the White Haven estate in 1820. <br /> <br /> Old Bob's life at White Haven was marked by hard outdoor labor but also music and a deep spirituality. Continuing in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em>, Julia Dent Grant remarked that \"Dear old Bob, who sometimes was either frightened or more likely had his dear old tender heart touched by some special kindness, would 'get religion,' as his companions said. He would go away down in the meadow by the big walnut trees nearly half a mile off and pray and sign so we could hear him distnctly on our piazza [at White Haven]. He would give out the hymn, two lines at a time, and then sing it all by himself. How pathetic it all was. I think old Bob went to Heaven.<br /> <br /> \"It was Bob's business to build the fires for the house, and as this was long before matches came into use, he often, when he was careless and let his fires go out, had to ignite his fires with a flint and a piece of punk, something taken from decayed wood, or else he would have to walk a mile to some neighbors and bring home a brand of fire from their backlog.\"<br /> <br /> While Julia Dent Grant interpreted Old Bob's movements on and off the White Haven property as \"carelessness,\" one can see how Old Bob may have used the story of his flint or punk dying out as an excuse to have greater freedom of movement and to remove the Dent family's gaze from his every movement. In walking through the woods while singing, Old Bob used the power of nature and the power spiritual hymns to find inner peace while living in a world dominated by the oppresiveness of slavery. <br /> <br /> According to census records, Old Bob may have passed away, been sold, or otherwise left the White Haven property by 1840. According to that year's census, Frederick Dent did not own any enslaved men older than age 36. Likewise, the 1850 census indicates that the oldest enslaved man owned by Dent was age 35 and manumitted the previous year. Old Bob's presence at White Haven nevertheless serves as a reminder not just of the ways the Dent family built its wealth on the backs of enslaved laborers, but how enslaved people like Old Bob endured and made meaning of their lives despite their enslavement.  <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>A Black printer and writer for Boston area newspapers, Benjamin Franklin Roberts fought for equal access to education for his children. Though slavery had been abolished in Massachusetts in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, segregation still influenced every part of public life, including education. By the time Benjamin Roberts’ children began attending school, Boston had a two-tiered system: multiple neighborhood public schools for its White students and one public school for its Black students.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The Roberts family valued community activism, a tradition going back to Roberts’ grandfather, James Easton. In 1776, Easton enlisted in the Continental Army and helped establish the breastwork on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/dohe.htm\">Dorchester Heights</a> above the town of Boston. Not much is known about Easton’s service, but he served until 1780 and later moved to Brockton, Massachusetts. As he and his wife, Sarah, raised their family, they instilled a sense of duty into their children. Beginning in 1800, the Eastons staged protests against segregation in their church. The family protested at least six times against discrimination in various churches throughout Massachusetts.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Roberts continued that family tradition by advocating for equal education for two of his children: Sarah and Benjamin Jr. After entering his daughter into the Otis School, a local school for White children, in 1848, Roberts decided to enroll his eldest son into the same school. This plan ultimately failed and resulted in both children being denied access to their right to join an integrated classroom.<sup>3</sup> Roberts hired two lawyers, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-morris.htm\">Robert Morris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-sumner.htm\">Charles Sumner</a>, and sued on behalf of his daughter Sarah in the case<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-sarah-roberts-case.htm\"><em>Roberts v. City of Boston</em></a>. Though Sumner and Morris argued against this segregation to the best of their ability, the courts ruled against them in 1850.</p> <p>Throughout his life, Roberts used his talents as a writer and printer to advocate for his community. Following the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, he printed the <em>Caution Colored People of Boston</em> broadside warning of slave catchers in the city.<sup>4</sup> He also supported seven petitions between 1843 and 1873 advocating for interracial marriage, for equal education, against capital punishment, and for the removal of the word “color” from the statute books.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"entry for Benjamin Roberts in Boston Vigilance Committee Records\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/691d7a00-8086-4ff5-94dd-a0fe93069b07/original.jpg?\" style=\"border-width:4px;text-align:center;border-style:solid;\" title=\"Benjamin Roberts in Boston Vigilance Committee Records\" /></p> <figcaption> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><font size=\"2\"><em>On April 24, 1851, the Boston Vigilance Committee paid Benjamin Roberts $6.50 for printing 1,000 copies of the \"Caution Colored People of Boston\" broadside.</em></font></div> </figcaption> <p>In his April 10, 1850 petition on equal education, Roberts asserted his Boston roots and ancestry as the “grandson of one of the Soldiers of the Revolution.” He condemned the injustice of “having <u>two sons and three daughters</u> who are all banished from the schools nearest their residence on account of not wearing a skin quite as pale as the children of their neighbors and doomed to take the benefit of an <u>exclusive</u> school or none…”<sup>5</sup></p> <p>By the time Massachusetts integrated public schools in 1855, the Roberts family had moved to Chelsea. Benjamin Roberts brought his printing press with him and continued to print books and pamphlets for local Black authors and causes. On September 6, 1881, Benjamin Roberts died of epilepsy.<sup>6</sup> Today, he is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<sup>7</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>While there were a variety of schools for Black children to attend in the city of Boston, the Abiel Smith School was the first public school, established in 1835.

            "bodyText": "<p>There are people who give great speeches, and there are those who perform them. Hallie Quinn Brown was one of the few who performed speeches. In her era, she was recognized as one of the greatest elocutionists across two continents, Europe and America. Though she rarely appears in history books, Brown’s legacy can be found in today’s speech-language pathologists and spoken word artists. She lectured widely on the cause of temperance, women’s suffrage, and civil rights. We honor Hallie Quinn Brown as an ancestor for demonstrating the power of language and Black women’s voices.<br /> <br /> Brown was among the first to become interested in establishing Black women’s clubs. These community-based organizations promoted the idea that it was the duty of middle-class Black women to help the underprivileged. Many, like the Colored Women’s League, Brown and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-anna-julia-cooper-1859-1964.htm\">Anna Julia Cooper</a>, helped establish in 1893, adopted politics of respectability. This is a philosophy endorsed by Black elites that the way to uplift the race was to correct the “bad” behavior of the Black poor. This philosophy emerged as a response to the intensified racism, rising inequality, and declining economic mobility of the Jim Crow era. It was first used among Black club women to distance themselves from negative stereotypes associated with the Black community. For example, club women promoted temperance, cleanliness, thrift, polite manners, and sexuality purity. It was a performance for white and Black audiences to not only counter racial stereotypes but to assimilate into societal norms established by white supremacy. We now know respectability politics fail to challenge the real issues of racism and offers no guarantees of acceptance.<br /> <br /> Brown’s skill as an elocutionist moved audiences in ways that few other noted orators, past and present, could. It was said that “…she possesses a voice of “wonderful magnetism and great compass.” At times, she thrills by its intensity; at times, it is mellow and soothing. She seems to have perfect control of the muscles of her throat and can vary her voice as successfully as a mocking-bird.”[i] During her presidency (1920-1924) of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), Brown spoke against a monument proposed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The proposed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/opinion/sunday/confederate-monuments-mammy.html\">monument</a> portrayed Black women as the stereotypical “mammy” figure, a Black woman dressed as a servant carrying a white infant. She wrote “slave women are brutalized, the victims of white man’s caprice and lust. Often the babe torn from her arms was the child of her oppressor.” Brown doubted the gratitude the Daughters of the Confederacy sought to highlight with the monument.<br /> <br /> Historically, the mammy figure was part of the Lost Cause myth that depicted the enslaved as docile, content, and loyal. Widespread protest by the Black community ensued because they rejected the stereotype. Club women like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-church-terrell.htm\">Mary Church Terrell</a> and Brown mobilized and led their allies in the NAACP against the monument. Terrell wrote a widely produced, scathing editorial in <em>The Evening Star</em>, calling out white women’s past and current complicity in the sexual abuse of black women by white men. The bill proposing the monument died in the House of Representatives.<br /> <br /> While vice president of the NACW, Brown also campaigned for Warren G. Harding during the 1920 Presidential election. The NACW withheld a formal endorsement of him due to the Republican party’s weak antilynching stance, her selection as the first woman to speak on his famous front porch during his campaign is significant. Harding, like many others, recognized the influence women like Brown had over members of her community. While politicians use this to their advantage in elections, Brown saw it as an opportunity for Black women to seek positions of power. She stated “Let us remember that we are making our own history. That we are character builders; building for all eternity. Woman’s horizon has widened. Her sphere of usefulness is greatly enlarged. Her capabilities are acknowledged…Let us not ask: what shall we do with our newly acquired power? Rather, what manner of women are we going to be?”.[ii] For Brown, Black women having the ability to vote and political power was one giant leap forward in the long struggle for Black rights in America.<br /> <br /> In 1926, Brown published <em>Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction</em>. It is one of her more robust and enduring challenges to those who doubted the suitability of Black women voters. She collaborated with more than 25 women to produce a 250-page book that countered the limited visions of who and what Black women were. It contains 60 biographical sketches, essays, and poems of the leading Black women of the era from all backgrounds. <em>Homespun Heroines</em> showcases the real lives of Black women and their activism. Brown wrote “It [<em>Homespun Heroines</em>] has been prepared with the hope that they [the youth] will read it and derive fresh strength and courage from its records to stimulate and cause them to cleave more tenaciously to the truth and to battle more heroically for the right…It is our anxious desire to preserve for future reference an account of these women, their life and character and what they accomplished under the most trying and adverse circumstances…”.[iii]<br /> <br /> Hallie Quinn Brown’s skills as an elocutionist taught thousands of Black people the power of spoken language during a period in which they were not expected and welcomed to be a political force. We are still in that period. By telling her story, we can inspire a new generation of activists to find their voice and use it to enact change. Brown is associated with the Frederick Douglass Home in Washington, D.C., and the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site in Alabama. She is also associated with the Homewood Cottage in Wilberforce, Ohio. The cottage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places until 1974, when it was destroyed by a tornado.<br /> <br /> <em>This article is part of the \"Exploring the Meaning of Black Womanhood Series: Hidden Figures in NPS Places\" written by Dr. Mia L.

Born enslaved in Boxley Valley in 1851, Tim and his mother, Valissa Piety, were owned by the family of Hezekiah and Elizabeth Penn Villines. During the Civil War, tension was high in the Buffalo River Valley due to a deep division in sympathies throughout the region. Guerilla warfare ravaged the rural northern counties of Arkansas as rogue fighters called \"bushwhackers\" operated independently from army command, stealing food, livestock, and resources from local families and then setting their homes ablaze.<br /> <br /> During one such occupation by bushwhackers, Tim (age 13 or 14) was sent out by his mother on a mule to ride 30 miles to Huntsville to request help for his community. A Union army patrol unit was known to be operating near Huntsville, so several Boxley Valley families had relocated to this area for added protection. Tim gathered a team of young men from the Murphy and Penn families to come home to Boxley Valley and assist their neighbors during this tumultuous time. Upon his return to the valley with able helpers, Tim was regarded as a local hero.<br /> <br /> After the war, at age 16, Tim became a free man \"with no companion, peer, leader or father of his race to whom to look for guidance and support\" (Liles). He settled a remote bench above Boxley Valley and established a productive upland farm that he worked and managed by himself for many years. He was known to \"marry\" twice to local white women, with whom he had a total of eight children. Tim died in 1919 and is buried at Beechwoods Cemetery near Ponca.",

            "bodyText": "Mary Henry was an enslaved woman who was owned by First Lady Julia Dent Grant's family prior to the Civil War. She was interviewed by the <em>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</em> on April 22, 1900 and discussed her life at White Haven. <br /> <br /> According to the <em>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</em> article, Mary was born \"a year or two\" before Julia Dent Grant and the two were playmates while growing up at White Haven. She claimed to have been a close companion of Julia Dent Grant for many years. \"I stood as close to her as she was being married as you to my bed,\" she proclaimed. \"When her children were born, they were handed to me as they came into the world, and it was my hands that first put on them the clothes that my hands had made. For eleven years after Mrs. Dent (Julia Dent Grant's mother, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ellen-wrenshall-dent.htm\">Ellen Wrenshall Dent</a>) died I kept house for 'Old Boss' [at White Haven].\"<br /> <br /> Of Ulysses S. Grant, Henry recalled that \"he had a great teasing way about him and always liked to plauge me. He was the oldest [at White Haven], but always claimed I was older than he was.\" She also claimed that \"the saddest time of my life was when 'Old Boss' left the farm and came in to St. Louis. He shook hands with all the servants and told them good-by. I was hanging back to be the last. When he shook hands with me two big tears ran down his cheeks.\" <br /> <br /> While this newspaper interview demonstrates that Mary Henry was enslaved at White Haven and knew Ulysses and Julia Grant personally, some of the claims she made in the <em>St. Louis Globe-Democrat </em>interview are questionable. While claiming a very close personal relationship with Julia Dent Grant, Julia does not mention Mary Henry in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em> despite mentioning several other enslaved African Americans that she was close to while living at White Haven. Mary's claim that Frederick F. Dent left White Haven during the Civil War and essentially emancipated his enslaved laborers by saying \"good-by\" and leaving them to their own devices is not supported in other accounts, nor is there any legal paperwork to confirm that Dent manumitted any enslaved laborers during the Civil War. In fact, Julia Dent Grant claimed in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em> that the remaining enslaved laborers at White Haven left the property on their own accord by early 1864. Likewise, one might also take Mary's \"saddest time of my life\" comment with a grain of salt given that the <em>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</em> editor tried to use this interview to romanticize slavery in St. Louis before the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The <em>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</em> article claimed that Mary Henry was nearing death at the time of her interview, and that she had recently recieved a check from Julia Dent Grant to help pay for a burial plot at Bellefontaine Cemetery in North St. Louis (where Julia's parents are buried). However, a search of Bellefontaine Cemetery's burial records indicates that while several women named Mary Henry are buried at the cemetery, no one by that name was buried there between 1867 and 1911.  <br /> <br />   ",

            "bodyText": "Anna Arnold Hedgeman participated in and led some of the 20th century’s most important developments, including advances in education, public health, politics, and workplace justice.[i] We honor her as an ancestor for shattering glass ceilings imposed on her by her race and gender.<br />  <br /> Born in Marshalltown Iowa and raised in Anoka, Minnesota, Arnold began shattering glass ceilings in 1918. She became the first Black student at Hamlin University, a Methodist College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Four years later, she became the university’s first Black graduate. Arnold earned a bachelor’s degree in English. Arnold briefly taught at Rust College, a Black school in Holly Springs, Mississippi, before becoming disillusioned by segregation in the south. For the next twelve years, Arnold worked on an off with the YMCA. In 1933, she became the executive director of the Black branch in Philadelphia. Arnold made the branch a vital part of the community, but only stayed a year.<br /> <br /> Moving to New York in 1934 to marry Merritt A. Hedgeman, she began working with the city’s Emergency Relief Bureau. The Bureau had only recently begun to hire Black supervisors, and Hedgeman served as its first consultant on racial problems. In addition to serving the city’s Black community, Hedgeman also worked with its Jewish and Italian constituents. She stayed with the ERB until 1937 when it became the Department of Welfare. She resigned and accepted a position as director of the Black branch of the Brooklyn YWCA. While in the position she organized a citizen’s coordinating committee to seek provisional appointments to the Department of Welfare for Black constituents. The committee secured the first 150 appointments the city had ever given to the Black community. Hedgeman was also able to expand employment opportunities for Black clerks in Brooklyn department stores. Her stay with the Brooklyn YMCA was cut short after the central board viewed some of her tactics, i.e. picket lines and challenging the old guard leadership, as too militant.<br /> <br /> In 1944, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/a-phillip-randolph.htm\">A. Philip Randolph</a> offered Hedgeman a job as executive director of the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC). She accepted the position because she believed that permanent legislation was needed to outlaw discrimination in employment. After a major legislative drive in 1946 failed, Hedgeman resigned to become dean of women at Howard University.<br /> <br /> In 1948, Congressman William L. Dawson, vice president of the Democratic National Committee, asked Hedgeman to join Harry Truman’s presidential campaign. Hedgeman accepted the offer only because Dawson supported the FEPC, and became the campaign’s executive director of the national citizen’s committee. She was tasked with raising funds from African Americans. After the election, Hedgeman received a patronage appointment as assistant to Oscar R. Ewing, administrator of the Federal Security Agency. The Federal Security Agency later became the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. On February 12, 1949, she was sworn in as the first Black American to hold a position in the Federal Security Agency. At the request of Ambassador Chester Bowles, Hedgeman spent three months in India in 1952 as an exchange leader for the State Department. She resigned upon her return following the Republican victory in the presidential election.<br /> <br /> On January 1, 1954, Hedgeman became the first Black woman to hold a mayoral cabinet position in the history of New York City. She served under Robert F. Wagner as a mayoral assistant. She was responsible for eight city departments, acting as liaison with the mayor. She also gave speeches, represented the mayor at conferences and conventions, and hosted United Nations’ visitors to the city. Hedgeman stayed in the position until 1958. Growing increasingly frustrated with the city’s lack of response to Black concerns, she accepted a position as a public relations consultant for the Fuller Products Company. When S. B. Fuller purchased the <em>New York Age</em>, the nation’s oldest Black newspaper, Hedgeman was asked to serve as associate editor and columnist. Due to dwindling circulation, the paper ceased production in 1960.<br /> <br /> In February 1963, Hedgeman played an instrumental role in conceptualizing the 1963 March on Washington as a joint effort. A. Philip Randolph and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/bayard-rustin.htm\">Bayard Rustin</a> called for a march for job opportunities to be held in October 1963. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/martinlutherkingjr.htm\">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> was planning a July march to pressure public opinion on a strong civil rights bill. Hedgeman suggested that they combine efforts into a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm\">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> to be held in August 1963. She was the only woman on the organizing committee. Other women played important roles in fundraising for the event. When she realized that no women were slated to speak, she protested the minimal recognition of women who were civil rights leaders. She persuaded the male dominated committee that this oversight was a mistake. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dbates.htm\">Daisy Bates</a> was invited to speak. As plans for the march were taking shape, Hedgeman was appointed by the National Council of Churches to serve as coordinator of its newly formed Commission on Religion and Race. The purpose of the commission was to mobilize resources for Protestant and Orthodox churches to work against racial injustice in American life. One of her first assignments was to relate the March on Washington to its renewed commitment of Protestant churches for justice for all. She was asked to help mobilize thirty thousand white Protestant church leaders to march. An estimated one-third of the March of Washington participants were white. While with the NCC, she worked to ensure the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.<br /> <br /> In 1964, she published her memoir, <em>The Trumpet Sounds: A Memoir of Negro Leadership</em>. The following year she took leave from the commission on religion and race to campaign for president of the City Council of New York on the Reform Democratic ticket. Though her campaign was unsuccessful, she was the first woman and the first Black woman to run for the office.<br />  <br /> Though Hedgeman has yet to become a household name, she has received numerous honors. She received the Frederick Douglass Award from the New York Urban League; the National Human Relations Award from the State Fair Board of Texas; and awards from the Schomberg Collection of Negro Literature and the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations. Hedgeman received citations from the NAACP, the SCLC, the National Council of Negro Women, and United Church Women. Hamlin University awarded her an honorary doctorate in 1948. The New York State Conference on Midlife and Older Women awarded her the “pioneer woman” award in 1983.<br /> <br /> Anna Arnold Hedgeman passed away at the Greater Harlem Nursing home on January 17, 1990. Her legacy should inspire the next generation of change makers to continue to shatter glass ceilings despite the trials and tribulations they will endure. She is associated with the National Mall and Memorial Parks.<br /> <br /> <em>This article is part of the \"Exploring the Meaning of Black Womanhood Series: Hidden Figures in NPS Places\" written by Dr. Mia L.

            "bodyText": "<p>Caroline Love Goodwin was most likely born in 1869, although the exact year of her birth is not known. As the daughter of a socially important family in Georgia, she attended the Lucy Cobb Institute and graduated in 1886. After briefly studying art in New York City, she sailed for Europe and supported herself as a freelance artist for the next eight years. While in Europe she met Daniel O'Day, an oil businessman, and in 1901 the couple returned to New York where they married.</p> <p>O'Day remained quietly married to her husband for the next fifteen years, but his death in 1916 released an interest in activism that had lain dormant while a wife and mother. She became committed to issues of social welfare and woman suffrage and as a wealthy widow, O'Day was able to use her financial assets to further these causes. She also became active with the New York Consumer's League, the Women's Trade Union League, and the Democratic party. In 1923, she was appointed to the New York State Board of Charities, and later that year she became closely allied with other prominent social activists that included Nancy Cook, Marion Dickerman, and Eleanor Roosevelt.</p> <p>O'Day quickly became an ardent supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, and her assistance in FDR's presidential campaign of 1932 was reciprocated when the president and the first lady helped her win a congressional seat in 1934. In the House of Representatives, O'Day championed the New Deal, devoted much of her time to immigration issues, and quickly became one of the most prominent women in Congress. Just as she had opposed American involvement in World War I, she had misgivings about deepening American commitments to Europe in the late 1930s. Nonetheless, she remained loyal to the White House on almost every issue, even when it became clear that the United States was becoming more deeply entangled in World War II as a result of FDR's policies.</p> <p>O'Day, however, would not live to see the Axis powers defeated. She became seriously ill in 1942 and died in January 1943.</p> <p><em>Article courtesy of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project at George Washington University.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "Alice Derby-Erickson was born and raised in Pipestone and is the granddaughter of Moses and Estelle Crow. Her parents, Harvey and Ethel Derby, were heavily involved with Pipestone National Monument throughout the mid-1900s. Harvey and Ethel spent a lot of time at the pipestone quarries, talking to visitors and mining the stone, and they often included their children in the process. Alice and all six of her siblings (as well as their collective 21 children) became pipestone artists, either carving pipes, making trinkets, or doing decorative beadwork. Alice made pipes in her younger years, but specialized in small pipestone crafts, particularly those featuring turtles. She remembers her introduction to the craft as a young girl:<br /> <br /> “<em>My mother taught me to carve turtles when I was 9 or 10. I [helped] the family sand some of their pieces too. . . . I used to help with some quarrying, hauling dirt and building the rock wall. We would quarry by the seasons usually to avoid the water. We were always taught that we need to be happy when we come here otherwise the work will be hard.</em>”<br /> <br /> Alice was given her tribal name, Dancing Flower, by her grandmother, Estelle Crow. Alice was only 10 or 11 years old at the time, but already her grandmother could see her love for dancing in the pow wows, and she recognized Alice’s penchant for picking wildflowers. Alice grew up respecting her grandmother and the morals she upheld, and even today, wishes to follow in her footsteps. “<em>Women are so much the backbone of the family. Without us, not a lot would get done</em>.”<br /> <br /> Alice has always been closely connected to Pipestone National Monument through her family ties, but in 1975 she became a park ranger with the National Park Service. For the next 30 years, she helped visitors discover the site and learn about the heritage of this area. “<em>I wanted to have a part in this park. The ranger role fit well because of the interpretive aspect. I want people to know the importance of this place when they visit.</em>” Alice remembers working closely with another female park ranger, Betty McSwain, who also worked at the monument for 30 years. The two women strongly influenced one another, and played important roles in teaching others about the significance of this special place.<br /> <br /> Alice retired from the National Park Service in 2005. Since 2015 she has served as a sales clerk and cultural demonstrator for the Pipestone Indian Shrine Association. Today, you can visit Alice in the gift shop, and purchase her signature turtle effigies and feather motif jewelry. She is a respected third-generation pipestone artist, and her son, Travis Erickson, is one of the most well-known pipestone carvers active today. When asked what Alice would like to see for the future of the monument, she responded “<em>I would like to see it stay as it is, without any changes</em>.”",

He had five sisters and one brother and was a second cousin to respected war leader Crazy Horse. He was the fourth man in his family to go by the name Black Elk.</p> <p>Throughout his childhood, he witnessed a changing landscape in his homeland. He began having visions at only five years old but became very sick during the summer of his ninth year and saw the vision that would set him on his path to becoming a holy man. In this vision, he met with a council of the Six Grand-fathers representing the four cardinal directions as well as the earth and sky. They each offered him gifts that bestowed power, including a pipestone pipe. Through a series of events, Black Elk believed he gained not only power, but also the ability to heal. At the end of the vision he returned to his body and recovered. He kept his vision secret for several years, allowing its meaning to reveal itself as he matured into a young man.</p> <p><u><strong>The Battle of the Greasy Grass (The Battle of the Little Bighorn)</strong></u></p> <p>On June 25, 1876, when Black Elk was 12 years old, the stage was set for one of the most notable battles in U.S. history. Two years prior, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer (known to the Lakota as Pahuska, or Long Hair) led an Army expedition through the Black Hills of South Dakota to scout a location for a military post. This violated the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which designated the Black Hills as Lakota land. To make matters worse, Custer’s expedition reported the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, and the following year more than 800 miners illegally prospected in the area.</p> <p>The Lakota were not willing to lose even more land to Euro-Americans and refused to surrender the land to the U.S. Government. As tensions rose, Lakota, Dakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho bands gathered and united under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. Custer’s Seventh Cavalry attacked late on that June afternoon, initiating a battle of intense shooting and close combat. Black Elk sensed something terrible was coming prior to the battle. Though he was too young and too small to partake in much of the fighting, he did perform his first scalping and collected guns, ammunition, and clothing from dead and dying soldiers. He did not see Custer’s body, but remembered the songs his people sang following their victory over him.</p> <p><strong><u>The Horse Dance</u></strong></p> <p>The triumph did not last. In just over a year, the hero Crazy Horse would be killed at Fort Robinson, and for the next decade Black Elk’s people and other tribes continued to be persecuted and driven from their lands. Black Elk’s spiritual powers grew during this time, and he eventually revealed his vision to a medicine man named Black Road. Black Road instructed him to reenact his vision before his people in a ceremony Black Elk referred to as “the Horse Dance.” Upon completing the cere-mony, Black Elk’s fear and hesitation about the vision disappeared. Another vision and ceremony soon followed, and Black Elk became established among his people as a holy man and healer.</p> <p><u><strong>Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show</strong></u></p> <p>In 1886, men sent by Buffalo Bill Cody (who, like Custer, the Lakota called Pahuska) arrived to recruit members of the Oglala to participate in Cody’s growing Wild West show. Black Elk saw this as a promising opportunity and hoped that by better under-standing the world of the white man he could better help his own people, now suffering and oppressed. Black Elk and the other recruits travelled by train to New York and performed at Madison Square Garden with other Plains Indians, as well as white cowboys and military men.</p> <p>The following year the troupe travelled to England via steamship. They arrived in London and performed in the American Exposition, part of the Golden Jubilee cele-bration for Queen Victoria. When scheduled to return to the U.S., Black Elk and a few other men got lost and missed their ship. Stranded in a strange land, Black Elk joined a rival wild west show and travelled across Europe, developing a relationship with a French woman before reuniting with Buffalo Bill and returning home.</p> <p><u><strong>The Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee Massacre</strong></u></p> <p>Black Elk returned to Pine Ridge in 1889, the same year Congress passed an act further reducing the land of the Great Sioux Reservation by about half. He found his people worse off than when he left: short on food and ravaged by disease. Black Elk resumed his position healing the sick but watched many members of his tribe die. He heard that hope for a better future may lie in the Paiute spiritual leader Wovoka, who prophesied the coming of a new world made accessible only by performing a Ghost Dance. Black Elk participated in a Ghost Dance at Wounded Knee Creek near his home and experienced more visions.</p> <p>Congress had outlawed the practice of American Indian religions and public ceremonies in 1883, and the spread of the Ghost Dance across the West drew concern from agents on the reservations. The conflict culminated at Wounded Knee late in 1890 when U.S. soldiers slaughtered hundreds of largely unarmed Lakota men, women, and children. Black Elk was not present at the start of the onslaught but arrived to counter the attack after hearing cannon fire and gun shots. He helped survivors and wept for the dead, wishing he had died, too. Embittered by a desire for revenge, Black Elk took part in other skirmishes over the next few days before he and his people eventually surrendered under the advice of Chief Red Cloud.</p> <p><u><strong>Family and Later Life</strong></u></p> <p>The surrender marked the end of an era. The remaining Lakota were forced to adapt to a new way of life or die. Black Elk married his first wife, Katie War Bonnet, in 1892. She was a converted Catholic, and all three of their children were baptized. Katie died in 1903, and Black Elk converted to Catholicism the following year, christened under the Christian name Nicholas. He became an educator in the faith while remaining a spiritual leader among the Lakota. He remarried in 1905 to Anna Brings White, also a Catholic. Their family grew, and they remained together until Anna’s death in 1941.</p> <p>Much of Black Elk’s fame today stems from his autobiographical interviews with poet John G. Neihardt in 1930. Neihardt’s book, Black Elk Speaks, was published in 1932 but grew in popularity in the 1970s. It has been widely read and studied across the globe. In 1947, Black Elk met with anthropologist Joseph Epes Brown and dictated to him several rites of the Oglala Lakota, describing seven traditional ceremonies that involve the sacred red pipe (The Sacred Pipe). Just before his death in August 1950, Black Elk told his daughter Lucy, “The only thing I really believe is the pipe religion.”</p> <p><u><strong>Honoring Black Elk’s Lasting Influence</strong></u></p> <p>Black Elk symbolizes courage and wisdom for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people alike. His ability to embrace Christianity while adhering to tribal customs allowed him to bridge a gap and survive troubled times. His teachings spread far beyond his own people, and an impressive amount of literature details his life and beliefs. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rapid City, SD, recently nominated Black Elk for sainthood (2017), and some believe miracles are still being performed using Black Elk’s pipe.</p> <p>A monumental tribute to Black Elk’s legacy lies in his sacred Black Hills (Pahá Sápa). On August 11, 2016, officials renamed South Dakota’s highest peak after Black Elk to honor the mountain’s role in Black Elk’s vision and respect its spiritual significance to the Lakota people. The peak formerly honored General William S. Harney, and many people found the name offensive due to Harney’s role in a Lakota massacre in 1855. Black Elk Peak stands 7,242 feet above sea level, and each year tribal members make pilgrimages there to welcome the Thunder-Beings during the spring equinox.</p>",

Although her father was a Dakota Episcopal priest and she received a Euro-American education, she also spoke both Dakota and Lakota dialects fluently and learned traditional ways.</p> <p>Deloria went on to graduate from Columbia Teacher's College in 1915, but not before meeting Franz Boas, the \"father of American anthropology.\" It was the beginning of a 15-year-long collaboration during which time she helped him research the linguistics of Native American languages, translate the recorded Indigenous languages in 19th century texts, and provide valuable insights into the nuances of her culture.</p> <p>Deloria did plenty her own research as well, interviewing tribal elders, writing Dakota grammar books, translating ceremonial texts, writing the novel 'Waterlily,' and conducting studies for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in regards to the Lumbee of Robeson county and socioeconomic challenges on the Navajo Reservation.</p> <p>During the 1960's, Deloria continued to write while teaching at the University of South Dakota. She passed away on February 12, 1971 while in the process of creating a Lakota Dictionary. As she wrote in her novel Waterlily, \"...a woman with a plan is persistent,\" and Deloria certainly proved to be just that. She preserved an enormous amount of invaluable linguistic and cultural information in service to her people that still serves as a foundation for researchers today.</p> <p>Learn more about <a href=\"http://aktalakota.stjo.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=9006\">Ella Cara Deloria</a></p>",

For the first half of his life, he grew up and lived in the Wahpeton area, just across from North Dakota’s Chahinkapa Park. As an adult, Francis briefly moved to both Minneapolis and California before eventually settling in the town of Pipestone, Minnesota.<br /> <br /> Francis’s family had always had ties to the pipestone quarries, his father a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate and his mother being both Dakota and Northern Cheyenne (from the Lame Deer, Montana, area). Francis’s great-grandfather was David Eastman, brother of the renowned author and physician Charles A. Eastman. Both of Francis’s grandfathers learned the arts of pipe carving (and other pipestone craftworks) from an early employee at Pipestone National Monument.<br /> <br /> Francis’s direct relationship with the pipestone began just over ten years ago. This relationship strengthened when, approximately five years after he began working the stone, Francis fasted as part of a traditional ceremony and dreamt of quarrying the precious íƞyaƞ ša (red stone). As part of this spiritual journey, Francis envisioned a quarry that could be used by the American Indian Movement (AIM) for the purposes of teaching younger generations the process of quarrying and carrying on these traditions. Upon discussing his ideas with staff at the Monument, Francis restored what was then an inactive quarry. This quarry is now known as the Sundance Quarry, and the stone pulled from this location is used for Sundance ceremonies that take place at the Monument each year.<br /> <br /> Francis continues to quarry the stone regularly, and can often be seen helping others or assisting people new to quarrying. Francis believes that current (and future) pipestone quarriers and artisans should be proud of the legacy they represent, and he takes great pride in seeing the progress being made in the quarries. When asked what quarrying means to him, Francis responded “Belief and faith in the caƞnupa and how it helps me in life. [It is] the stone process evolving to the hands of the prayerful.”<br /> <br /> When looking forward to the future of Pipestone National Monument, Francis believes that compromise and teaching will be the pillars of future management of the quarries. “Showing our tribes and society the pipemakers and quarriers helped save the stone and its history in the past and can do so in the future.”",

            "bodyText": "George Catlin was born in Pennsylvania in 1796. As a child, Catlin was interested in Indians, natural history, science, and the arts. He was educated at home and trained as a lawyer, giving up that profession when a group of Native Americans visited Philadelphia. The group sparked his interest and he decided to devote his career to painting Indians in their native land. As a painter, Catlin was largely if not entirely self-taught. <br /> <br /> Catlin spent 1830 to 1836 traveling thousands of miles from the Missouri to the Southwest, which resulted in his producing 470 portraits and portrayals of Indian life representing almost forty different tribes. In 1832, Catlin had his most productive year for painting Indians in the field. He traveled up the Missouri aboard the American Fur Company's new steamboat <em>Yellowstone </em>on its first voyage to Fort Union Trading Post in North Dakota, almost 2,000 miles above Saint Louis. On this trip, he painted the Assiniboin, Blackfoot, Crow, Plains Ojibwa, and Cree. Further downriver he visited and painted the Hidatsa and Mandan, semi-sedentary farming tribes in their palisaded villages of earth lodges near Fort Clark. <br /> <br /> It was during his travels among many different Indian Tribes in the early 1830's that Catlin noticed many Chiefs and warriors using pipes made of a richly colored, red stone. When he asked about the stone, he was told of a single quarry near the dividing ridge between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Indians claimed the site was sacred ground where Indians of many tribes met in peace to quarry the stone which was the color of human blood. Catlin became very interested in finding the source of this remarkable stone, and set off in search of the fabled pipestone quarry.<br /> <br /> In 1836, despite objections from the Santee Sioux, Catlin insisted on visiting the pipestone quarries (what today is known as Pipestone National Monument). The Santee told Catlin that the area was off limits to whites, but Catlin later admitted that his curiosity and determination increased with their vehemence. After visiting the quarries, he took a sample of pipestone away with him and sent it to Boston to be analyzed. It was named <em>Catlinite </em>by the geologist who received the sample of this stone, which was previously unrecorded in modern science.<br /> <br /> The number of whites who visited during the 1830s increased, with shorter and shorter time between visits. By the end of the decade, the steady stream of white visitors had begun to bring the quarry to the attention of the non-Native world. ",

In the mid-1930s, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and was assigned to the Pipestone area. He married Ethel Crow (daughter of Moses and Estella Crow) in 1938 and learned the art of pipemaking and quarrying techniques from his father-in-law. In 1942, Harvey entered the U.S. Army and served in the South Pacific during World War II, where he received the Purple Heart.

Harvey and his family followed the tradition of carving and working the quarry. From 1953-1969, he worked as a seasonal worker at Pipestone National Monument. Harvey’s favorite pipe to make was the hatchet pipe. He also made other pipes, along with items such as salt and pepper shakers and open books. Harvey passed his knowledge of quarrying and carving on to his seven children (Raymond “Chuck” Derby, Marge Parsons, Carol Derby, Jeff Derby, Alice Erickson, Betty Tellinghuisen, and Maddie Redwing), who would pass the tradition on to their own children. The quarry he and his family used was originally located south of the present trail, but in 1960 the Derby family moved to the north side of the trail (called the Spotted Quarry area). His daughter, Alice, continues to quarry at the family pit today.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#1c1e21\">Harvey is featured in the book \"Pipes on the Plains\" and the movie Calumet: Pipe of Peace.

            "bodyText": "<strong>\". . . <em>a prodigious quantity of blood-red stone . . . mixed with the fragments of the old red sandstone that are sliding from the hill, gives to the prairie an extraordinary aspect almost impossible to describe.</em>\" </strong>-Joseph Nicollet, July 5th 1838 journal entry<br /> <br /> Born in 1786 in France, Joseph Nicollet excelled in astronomy, mathematics, and geography. He found employment at the Paris Observatory and built a strong reputation for his expertise. However, the economic and political unrest of 1830s France convinced him to try to make a name for himself in the United States instead.   <br /> <br /> Once in America, Nicollet was determined to embark on a scientific expedition to accurately map the area surrounding the upper Mississippi River. He secured financial support from the wealthy Chouteau family in St. Louis and went on to lead three expeditions between 1836 and 1839. In 1836-1837, he went up the Mississippi to Lake Itasca and then along the St. Croix River. Then in 1838, he traveled from Fort Snelling to the Pipestone Quarries, where he met Indigenous people quarrying pipestone.<br /> <br /> On July 1st, he wrote of camping near Indigenous families on their way to the quarries, and that \"<em>It is at this time that the nations of the Missouri make their pilgrimage to the red stone, and were it not for the fear of smallpox, we would probably already have encountered many of their bands.</em>\" He also noted that the pipestone had typically been exposed at the surface, but by the time of his writing in 1838, he observed that Indigenous quarriers \"...<em>have regretted that the red stone is exhausted at all the places where it can be extracted without difficulty. To reach it now, it is necessary to remove a layer of old red sandstone </em>[Sioux quartzite] <em>4 1/2 feet thick.</em>\"<br /> <br /> In reference to the pipestone itself, Nicollet wrote, <em>\"The discovery of the red earth is due to the passage of animals [buffalo] which hollowed out a deep pathway, as they do in the regions of seasonal migration where they try always to take the same route. The pathway revealed the surface of the red rock. One can imagine, then, in nations for whom the pipe is among the most important of necessary objects what a windfall it was to be provided with a soft stone of their favorite color, suitable for making pipes, in an immense land where there is no other workable rock.\"</em><br /> <br /> While at the quarries, he and members of his expedition (John C. Fremont, Charles Geyer, Joseph Renville Jr., J. Eugene Flandin, and Joseph LaFromboise) carved their names into a rock near the top of the falls. Twenty years later, that same rock was used as the center marker inside of the 1-square mile boundary of Pipestone Reservation. The rock and the inscriptions of their initials can still be seen today on the Circle Trail.  <br /> <br /> Finally in 1839, Nicollet led an expedition across the stretch of land between the Missouri and upper Mississippi rivers. His journeys resulted in the influential book, <em>Map of the Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi</em>, which was a remarkably accurate record of an area more than half the size of Europe. His journals tell us that he learned much from the inhabitants of this region, particularly the Dakota and Ojibwe people. Unlike other maps created at the time, Nicollet's maps recorded Indigenous place names of locations throughout the region. <br /> <br /> In addition to the infrastructure that Nicollet's name today (roads, a city, a county, etc.), Harold Torness (a banker and Nicollet-enthusiast) initiated the effort in cooperation with the Dakota people to build a <a href=\"https://www.sissetonmuseum.com/nicollet-tower\">tower and interpretive center</a> to memorialize Nicollet in 1991. From the top of the tower in Sisseton, visitors can view North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and the Coteau de Prairies. <br /> <br /> Joseph Nicollet died in 1843 in Washington D.C. after a long battle with illness. His tombstone reads \"He will triumph who understands how to conciliate and combine with the greatest skill the benefits of the past and the demands of the future.\"     <br /> <br /> His journals are available for free <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/journalsofjoseph0000nico/page/n5\">online</a>.<br /> <br /> <sub>**All quotes from <em>Joseph N.

When Joe was a baby, his parents were forced to travel to Mendota, MN, with a number of other Mdewakanton Sioux families who were facing troubled times in the vicinity of their homes. The United States government had forced them to leave their land and relocate to Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. After a few years, the family relocated again to an area near Egan, SD, and Joe attended school in Flandreau, SD.

            "bodyText": "Moses and Estelle established the Pipestone Dakota Tribal Community, and together they worked hard to ensure that future generations of Dakota people knew and respected the traditions of their ancestors.<br /> <br /> Born Estelle Eugenia Pearsall in 1901, Estelle was the eldest of five daughters born to Fred Pearsall, a Euro-American, and Eunice Amos, a Sisseton woman. Estelle and her sisters were raised to speak both Dakota and English, and though her family moved around to some degree during her childhood, they were always heavily involved with the local Dakota communities. When Estelle’s mother passed away in 1914, the family returned to Granite Falls, Minnesota, and shortly thereafter, Estelle was sent to attend the Pipestone Indian School, an assimilation school built near the pipestone quarries. It was there that she would meet her future husband, Moses Crow, a Mdewakanton from Santee, Nebraska. He had served in the medical corps in World War I and worked at the school in the dairy barn and as a fireman. Together, they would build the foundation for today’s pipe-carving community.<br /> <br /> Moses and Estelle fled the Pipestone Indian School and eloped in 1917, leaving the area for about ten years before returning to Pipestone in 1927. The couple had ten children, and were largely responsible for founding the Pipestone Dakota Tribal Community. All of the members of this group are enrolled or lineal Dakota people, many belonging to the Sisseton/Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation. Three families comprise the majority of this community, each of which can be traced back to Moses and Estelle Crow. Those families are the Bryans, the Derbys, and the Taylors. Estelle’s daughter Clara married George Bryan, and another daughter, Ethel, married Harvey Derby; both men were active pipestone quarriers in the early 1940s following the establishment of Pipestone National Monument. Moses’s sister, Julia, was married to Joe Taylor (“Indian Joe”), a Mdewakanton man who not only introduced Moses to pipe-making, but was almost solely responsible for keeping the quarrying legacy alive in the early 20th Century. These three families and their descendants are still considered the backbone of the pipestone quarrying tradition today.<br /> <br /> Moses mentored the next generation of pipemakers until his death in 1938, but Estelle outlived her husband by 50 years. Estelle rarely worked with the pipestone directly, spending much of her time taking care of the children, but she was known to carve horses from time to time. She remarried one of Moses’s close friends, Robert Wilson, and continued to play an important role in the Pipestone Dakota Tribal Community. Over 100 people belong to the Community today, and most of them are direct descendants of Moses and Estelle. In her later years, Estelle was fondly called “Grandma Wilson,” not only by her own family members but by the Pipestone community as a whole. She passed away in 1988, but continues to be fondly remembered by many in the area. Their legacy lives on through the craftwork of their heirs.<br />  ",

A descendant of Moses Crow and Estelle Crow-Wilson, Pam primarily learned how to work the pipestone from her mother, Betty Derby-Tellinghuisen. As a child, Pam and her brother Todd would dig dirt and toss rocks around their mother’s quarry. Often, Pam’s relatives would gather at her grandmother’s house; the adults working the stone, carving turtles and other objects, as the cousins ran around and played. Occasionally, the children were persuaded to carve the stone as well, and this was how Pam first developed her skill. She began with simplistic arrowhead and heart designs taught to her by her mother.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-variant-ligatures:normal\"><span style=\"font-variant-caps:normal\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"widows:2\"><span style=\"text-decoration-style:initial\"><span style=\"text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"word-spacing:0px\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Helvetica\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#1d2129\">In her twenties, Pam was added to her mother’s quarry permit, and she continued to improve her skill as a pipestone artist. Her brother taught her to make pipes, and eventually she developed her own turtles, following the styles of her mother and aunts. Her relationship with the quarry also developed, and she finds that the quarry often has a calming effect on her that allows her to escape the everyday worries of life. “There is a sense of peacefulness out there,” says Pam, and she wishes she could find time to quarry more often. She appreciates the exercise that quarrying involves, as well as the sense of relief and accomplishment she feels after a hard day’s work. Pam became the sole quarrier in her family’s pit when her mom retired 14 years ago, and she continues to work the same quarry today.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-variant-ligatures:normal\"><span style=\"font-variant-caps:normal\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"widows:2\"><span style=\"text-decoration-style:initial\"><span style=\"text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"word-spacing:0px\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Helvetica\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#1d2129\">Pam currently serves as the Sales and Shipping Manager for the shop run by the Pipestone Indian Shrine Association (PISA) at Pipestone National Monument. PISA is very important to her family, as they played a major role in the development of the organization. Pam enjoys working for PISA, and has done so for 14 years. She still demonstrates her pipestone carving skills regularly, and likes to challenge herself by attempting to carve at least one new, unique item per year. Pam has carried on her family’s traditions in more ways than one, and she believes her ancestors would be proud of her and her living relatives. She hopes that younger generations will become interested in quarrying, and will continue the sacred practice.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p><span>Tecumseh began life in the Shawnee village of Piqua, Ohio on March 9, 1768 as a great meteor flashed and burned its way across the heavens. This event accounts for his name: The Shooting Star, or Celestial Panther Lying in Wait. Tecumseh grew to be a famous warrior and dynamic orator. These skills, paired with his belief that the white man would never rest until all American Indians were dispossessed, made him a powerful and influential force. </span><br /> <br /> <span>Tecumseh conceived of an alliance of all remaining native people, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, from the prairies of the Midwest to the swamplands of Florida. All Indian people would set aside their ancestral rivalries and unite into a single movement to defend their culture, their homelands, and their very lives. </span><br /> <br /> <span>Providing spiritual impetus for Tecumseh's movement was the teaching of his younger brother, known as Tenskwatawa, The Open Door, or The Prophet. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1808, the Shawnee brothers established a new capital on the banks of the Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers, while Tecumseh traveled extensively in an effort to build his alliance. </span></p> <p><span>In the summer of 1811 Tecumseh <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/Choctaw-Warriors-consider-alliances.htm\">traveled south</a> to meet with the Creek, Chickasaw, and Choctaw people. The Shawnee leader had promised a sign of his power, and as he arrived in Alabama a huge comet appeared, brightening the skies and fading after his departure. Then, shortly after he left for Prophetstown, a series of violent earthquakes arched out of their epicenter in southeastern Missouri to destroy lives and property throughout the midwest and south. In the minds of the Creek and many others, Tecumseh had made good on his promises. </span></p> <p><span><span>Meanwhile, growing tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain exploded into war. Tecumseh saw the War of 1812 as his final opportunity to construct an independent Indian nation. He journeyed to Canada in July of 1812 and forged an alliance with the British. General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/isaac-brock.htm\">Isaac Brock</a> placed Tecumseh in command of all Native American forces with the understanding that, should the British and Indians be victorious, the Old Northwest would comprise an independent Indian nation under British protection. </span></span></p> <p><span><span>Despite a number of victories, this partnership turned fatal on October 5, 1813, at the Battle of the Thames River. Outnumbered three-to-one by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-henry-harrison.htm\">General William Henry Harrison</a>'s army, the Indian and British forces were overwhelmed, without fortifications, and ultimately doomed.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Tecumseh's vision of a unified American Indian homeland was never fully realized.</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> Within 35 years of Tecumseh's death at Moraviantown, many Native nations east of the Mississippi River were forcibly relocated. But today the great Tecumseh is still revered for his intelligence, leadership, and military skills, and he is honored throughout North America.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "Snow swirled on a cold night in January 1932 as 35 members of the Pipestone community gathered in the Calumet Hotel. They sought to form a permanent organization to advocate for preservation of the beloved pipestone quarries. Shrewd and determined, Winifred Bartlett became their president, and served as a driving force for the establishment of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pipe/index.htm\">Pipestone National Monument</a>.<br /> <br /> Winifred Bartlett was born in 1885 on a farm located a few miles north of the pipestone quarries. From an early age, she enjoyed exploring the area surrounding the quarries on foot. She frequently visited the site to take in views of the falls, examine the wildflowers, and watch the quarriers work. Her interest in preservation developed as she began to understand the historical and cultural significance of the location. Shejoined the local Catlinite Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and strongly supported the organization’s movements to protect the inscriptions left by the Nicollet expedition and preserve the native prairie wildflowers.<br /> <br /> Winifred trained as a teacher, but eventually pursued a career in the court systems. In the mid-1920s, she served as a court reporter during the settlement case between the Ihanktonwan/Yankton Tribe and the federal government, in which the Tribe was compensated to clear the land title claim to the Pipestone Indian Reservation. Through this case, the land title of the pipestone quarries was transferred over to the U.S. Government, with the provision that American Indians would be granted access to the quarries for as long as they so desired. During her exposure to this case, Winifred gained an appreciation for tribal traditions and belief systems, and heard first-hand accounts from tribal elders relating the difficulties facing those who wished to travel to the pipestone quarries. These experiences shifted Winifred’s focus to the need for stronger protection of the cultural aspects of the site. In 1927, Winifred became the first female county clerk of court in Minnesota, and through this position she made professional acquaintances with bureaucrats in larger cities, which allowed her to elevate her advocacy for protection of the pipestone quarries.<br /> <br /> Winifred Bartlett was recognized as a strong civic activist in the Pipestone community. She led the local DAR chapter and spearheaded the group’s efforts to preserve significant features, including the area of the Three Maidens. On January 14, 1932, when nearly 40 members of Pipestone civic, social, religious, and governmental groups gathered in the Calumet Hotel to form the Pipestone National Park Association (quickly renamed the Pipestone Indian Shrine Association, as the group desired more of a cultural preserve than a recreational park), Winifred was easily elected President due to her local expertise and enthusiasm. Over the next few years, the group lobbied for federal protection of the area, and Winifred self-funded her travel to Washington, D.C., to speak in favor of designating a national park at the site. Eventually, on August 25, 1937, Congress approved the act to establish Pipestone National Monument. Winifred Bartlett continued to be involved with the Monument and the Pipestone community, and was present at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the new visitor center built in 1958. She died in 1982 at the age of 96, and is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.",

Estella and her husband, Benjamin F.

            "bodyText": "Patsy Matsu Takemoto was born in Pā‘ia, Hawai‘i Territory on the island of Maui on December 6, 1927. Her parents, Suematsu and Mitama Takemoto, were second-generation Japanese immigrants. Hawai‘i became a U.S. territory in 1900 but was not admitted as a state until 1959. <br /> <br /> During college, Patsy encountered racial and gender discrimination, which inspired her later advocacy for civil rights and equal opportunity. As a junior at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, she successfully challenged racial segregation in student housing. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in zoology from the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, Patsy applied to several medical schools. Because she was a woman, her applications were all rejected.  <br /> <br /> Patsy switched gears and applied to the University of Chicago Law School. Even though she was born in Hawai‘i, she was mistakenly accepted as part of a ‘foreign student quota.’ There was only one other woman in her class, Minna Rodnon Buck. During law school, Patsy met and married John Mink, a graduate student. Their daughter Gwendolyn was born in 1952.  <br /> <br /> After earning her law degree, Chicago law firms refused to hire Patsy because of her race and interracial marriage. The Minks moved to the Territory of Hawai‘i, where Patsy became the first woman in Hawai‘i licensed as an attorney. She was admitted to the bar in 1953, permitting her to practice law in the Territory. Yet, firms continued to turn her down. Undeterred, Patsy taught business law, started her own private practice, and joined the Democratic Party.  <br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Congressional portrait of Patsy Mink\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|600|836|0|0|0\" height=\"836\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6585259|0|\" src=\"/articles/images/Patsy_Mink_1970s-Congress-Portrait-Files.jpg\" title=\"Patsy_Mink_1970s Congress Portrait Files\" width=\"600\" /><br /> <br /> In 1955, Patsy became an attorney for the Hawai‘i territorial legislature. The following year, she was elected to the territorial House and later to the territorial and state Senates. When Congress admitted Hawai‘i as a state in 1959, Patsy ran for the sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Because she sometimes broke with other Democrats in the Hawai‘i legislature and resisted their efforts to influence her politics, local party leaders resisted her campaign and contributed to her defeat. After the 1960 census, Hawai‘i obtained a second member in the U.S. House. In 1964, Patsy successfully ran for this new seat. She served in the House from 1965 until 1977, the first woman of color and the first Asian American to do so.  <br /> <br /> As a Congresswoman, Patsy was a fierce advocate for women, children, and minorities. She was a strong supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society programs and promoted civil rights legislation. Some of Patsy’s most notable accomplishments were as a member of the Committee for Education and Labor. She fought for various educational reforms, including a national daycare system, Head Start, and the Women’s Educational Equity Act.   <br /> <br /> Patsy Mink is perhaps best known for her work with Representative Edith Green and Senator Birch Bayh on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions that receive federal funding. As its major author and sponsor, Patsy has been called, “The Mother of Title IX.”  <br /> <br /> Even when it put her at odds with her own party, Patsy was unafraid to speak out.  She was one of the only members of Congress to oppose the Vietnam War. She also testified against the Supreme Court nomination of Judge George Harrold Carswell, citing his discrimination against women. In 1971, she sued the Environmental Protection Agency to release documents about nuclear testing under the Freedom of Information Act. That year, she became the first Asian American woman to run for president. Running as an anti-war candidate, Patsy opposed the Nixon administration’s reversals of civil rights legislation and continuation of the Vietnam War.   <br /> <br /> In 1976, Patsy gave up her House seat to run in the U.S. Senate primary. She lost to her fellow congressman, Spark Matsunaga. After this defeat, President Jimmy Carter appointed Patsy the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International, Environmental, and Scientific Affairs. After leaving this post in 1979, Patsy spent several years supporting community and political organizations in Hawai‘i. She was elected to and eventually chaired the Honolulu City Council.  <br /> <br /> Even when out of elected office, Patsy remained focused on lawmaking. In 1989, she founded The Public Reporter. This watchdog organization reported on the actions of legislative committees to help the public better understand the lawmaking process.  <br /> <br /> In 1990, Patsy returned to the U.S. House. During her second tenure in Congress, Patsy continued to advocate for gender equality and education. She also cofounded the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in 1994, and served as its chair. Patsy died from complications of chicken pox just one week after she won the House primary election in 2002. It was too late to remove her name from the general election ballot, and on November 5, 2002, she was posthumously re-elected to Congress. Her vacant seat was filled by Ed Case after a special election. After her death, Title IX was renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act.  <br /> <br /> Patsy is buried at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/national-memorial-cemetery-of-the-pacific.htm\">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Hawai‘i. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Sources:   </strong><br /> <br /> Cruz, Tania and Eric Y.

An astounding artist, she trained at the National Academy of Design in New York City before meeting her husband, Aurelius W. Brodt. In 1863, Helen and her husband moved west and settled in Red Bluff where Helen worked as a schoolteacher and continued to practice art.<sup>[1]</sup></p> <p paraeid=\"{4646b530-12a1-4c4d-88e4-1b4287d61df8}{199}\" paraid=\"1084939215\">In 1864, Helen and Aurelius were camping near Lassen Peak to enjoy fresh air as recommended by ailing Aurelius' physician. A nearby climbing party spotted the smoke from their fire.<sup>[2]</sup> The party lead, <a href=\"https://exploringshastahistory.blogspot.com/2018/08/major-pierson-barton-reading-1816-1868.html\">Major Pierson B. Reading</a> was an esteemed pioneer who also owned a mining claim with Kendall Vanhook Bumpass in the Lassen area and namesake of Reading Peak. Reading invited Helen and Aurelius to join his party and on August 28, Helen Brodt became the first white woman to summit Lassen Peak. Reading was so impressed with her that he named a small alpine lake south of Lassen’s summit, Lake Helen.<sup>[3] </sup><br /> <br /> Aurelius wrote about the summit in a letter to mother: </p> <p paraeid=\"{4646b530-12a1-4c4d-88e4-1b4287d61df8}{199}\" paraid=\"1084939215\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“…last week Helen and myself climbed and stood upon the very top of Lassen’s Peak, eleven thousand feet above the level of the ocean. It was a thrilling adventure—we walked over snow and ice that had probably laid there for centuries—we found a crater in active operation, sending up vast clouds of sulphuorous steam and making a deafening roar, similar to an immense steam engine blowing off steam.”...“We found a beautiful little lake near the top of the mountain, which was named Lake Helen, after my wife, she being the first white woman that ever saw it.”<sup>[4]</sup></p> <p paraeid=\"{4646b530-12a1-4c4d-88e4-1b4287d61df8}{220}\" paraid=\"1975482963\">After living in Red Bluff, the Brodts moved to Berkeley and then Oakland, where, in 1867, Helen was the first art teacher of Arthur Matthews, a renowned Californian artist. Helen’s paintings won awards at the New Orleans Exposition in 1880 and Chicago World Fair in 1893.<sup>[5]</sup></p> <p paraeid=\"{4646b530-12a1-4c4d-88e4-1b4287d61df8}{228}\" paraid=\"1608911157\">Helen Tanner Brodt passed away in 1908. Her daughter, Ethel, was instrumental in creating and dedicating a historical marker at Lake Helen in 1933 so Helen’s artistic and athletic accomplishments can be noted by future generations.<sup>[3]</sup> <br />  <br /> View a <a href=\"http://collections.museumca.org/?q=collection-item/a65173381\">watercolor box</a> and <a href=\"http://collections.museumca.org/?q=collection-item/a65173382\">pastel box</a> used by Helen and a few of her paintings: <a href=\"http://collections.museumca.org/?q=collection-item/a8733\">Mission Carmel</a>, <a href=\"https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt4d5nb01h/?brand=oac4\">Mount Shasta and a mountain lake</a>, and <a href=\"https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt838nb2pk/?brand=oac4\">Mount Shasta viewed through trees</a>.<br /> <br /> [1] Charlene Sands, <em><a href=\"https://petticoatsandpistols.com/2009/03/23/strokes-of-brilliance-women-artists-of-the-west-by-charlene-sands/\">Strokes of Brilliance—Women Artists of West</a> (Petticoats & Pistols, March 23, 2009).</em><br /> [2]<em> </em>Harry Noyes Pratt,<em> A Woman Pioneer on Lassen's Peak (</em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=CXjPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA488&lpg=PA488&dq=a+woman+pioneer+on+lassen+peak+overland+monthly&source=bl&ots=UQqnCktQjQ&sig=ACfU3U0kz8NLpGh00n4yJtocsQ5gcX_dZQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwmMLSmYfrAhWxMn0KHVtWAgQQ6AEwBHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=a%20woman%20pioneer%20on%20lassen%20peak%20overland%20monthly&f=false\">Overland Monthly and the Out West Magazine</a><em>, Volume 82, November 1924, 488 & 524).</em><br /> [3] Rebecca Yerger, <a href=\"https://napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/real-napa/columnists/rebecca-yerger/rebecca-yerger-memory-lane-the-women-of-wilson-s-inn/article_4d568a9d-9fcf-5486-b227-73b5f2d462a9.html\">Rebecca Yerger, Memory Lane: The Women of Wilson's Inn</a><em> (Napa Valley Register, March 24, 2019).</em><br /> [4] May Hazel Southern, <em>Our Storied Landmarks, Shasta County California </em>(Southern, 1942).<br /> [5] Barbara Lekish,<em> Embracing Scenes about Lakes Tahoe & Donner: Painters, Illustrators & Sketch Artists 1855-1915 (Great West Books, 2003), 30.</em></p>",

It remains <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/honoring-harriet-keeler-at-brecksville-reservation.htm\">a remarkable testament to a remarkable life</a>. Even today, public monuments to a professional woman are rare. Keeler was a Cleveland educator, botanist, author, suffragist, and lover of nature. Each aspect of her self-made career brought her a measure of celebrity far beyond northeast Ohio.<br />  </p> <h4><strong>Teacher</strong></h4> <p>Keeler was born into a prosperous farm family in New York state in 1846. After leaving school at age 14, she began teaching in Cherry Hill. This was one of the few careers available to women at the time. She went on to a college preparatory school that taught mostly men and then to Oberlin College. Earning a bachelor of arts degree distinguished her from other female job seekers. (Keeler returned to get a master of arts degree in 1900.)</p> <p> </p> <p>After she graduated in 1870, she began a 38-year career with the Cleveland Public Schools. She was described as brilliant and inspiring. At first she taught English, becoming a favorite teacher for many. Later she became the principal of Central High School, retiring in 1908.</p> <p> </p> <p>From January to September 1912, “Miss Harriet Keeler” was called back to service and appointed superintendent of schools. The story was picked up nationally. Under the heading <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014689/1912-04-13/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1789&index=8&rows=20&words=Harriet+Keeler&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1963&proxtext=harriet+keeler&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1\">“Concerning Women,”</a> <em>The Maui News</em> (Hawaii) reported how hers was one of “six important positions filled by a woman in a city which two years ago had but one woman in a public office...” The others were a female tenement inspector, an assistant librarian, a woman in charge of “outdoor relief,” and two school board members.</p> <p> </p> <p>On January 10, <em>The Day Book</em> (Chicago) ran <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1912-01-10/ed-1/seq-6/\">a short article with a photo</a>. The text reads:</p> <p>“Miss Harriet Keeler, aged 65, is the second woman to be made superintendent of schools of a large city. To settle factional rows, Cleveland has elected her to that position, following the example of Chicago, where Mrs. Ella Flagg Young is head of the scholls [sic]. Miss Keeler gets $6,000 a year. Miss Keeler is a woman of high literary attainments. She has written several valuable textbooks. She is younger than her years indicate and is vigorous and active.”<br />  </p> <h4><strong>Author</strong></h4> <p>Despite her long career in education, Keeler was best known during her lifetime as an author. Although she published various English textbooks and a biography, she is most remembered for her seven nature guides. They reached a national audience and were reprinted multiple times. The first was <em>The Wildflowers of Early Spring</em> (1894). The most famous, <em>Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them</em> (1900), was printed by Charles Scribner’s Sons and remains available via The Kent State University Press. According to Oberlin College, Keeler traveled across the United States and abroad to study nature.</p> <p> </p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/669\">online profile of Keeler</a>, Richard Raponi noted that botany was a socially acceptable field of study for women starting in the early 1800s. “Botany, with its practical application in preparing home remedies, had been taught to women in order that they could perform domestic duties and educate children. Women played an integral part in the identification and organization of North American plant life, but often in an informal role.” There was a division between “scientific” and “recreational” study of plants, the latter being the domain of women and writers. Keeler followed in this tradition.</p> <p> </p> <p>Keeler’s work was part of the Nature Study Movement which began in the 1890s. As America industrialized, it became popular for people to escape urban pollution and crowding by exploring the countryside. In contrast to city life, nature was often romanticized and associated with virtue. Guides, cameras, and collecting jars became the tools of wanderers. Keeler’s writing blended her technical mastery of botany with her knowledge of literature and writing. She spiced up her science with references to Longfellow, Thoreau, Emerson, Whittier, and other prominent authors. Progressive educators such as Keeler wanted to foster an appreciation for the natural world through outdoor experiences.<br />  </p> <h4><strong>Citizen</strong></h4> <p>In addition to her professional accomplishments, Keeler was active in the civic life of northern Ohio. She was a respected voice in the Progressive Era women’s club movement. In a profile, Case Western Reserve University lists her activities as “president of the Cuyahoga County Suffrage Association, founding member of the College Club, charter member of the Fortnightly Club, Oberlin College trustee, and memberships in the Woman’s Club, Women’s City Club, and Garden Club.” In 1888 the president of what was then Western Reserve University invited Keeler to serve on the newly created Mather Advisory Council. These first 12 women helped guide the university in establishing a college for women. She was a member until her death, serving both as vice-president and president. In 1913 Western Reserve University awarded her an honorary degree.<br />  </p> <p>Keeler passionately advocated for women’s voting rights. As a young woman, she was inspired by Oberlin alumna, abolitionist, and suffragist <a href=\"https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Betsy_M._Cowles\">Betsey M. Cowles</a> to pursue high education. Later Keeler brought her scholarship to this cause. About 1885, she wrote a remarkable pamphlet called <a href=\"https://ohiomemory.org/digital/collection/p267401coll32/id/28116/rec/3\">“The Question of Woman Suffrage as it Seems to Me.”</a> In it, Keeler talked about the “world-wide revolt of woman against what she deems the intolerable conditions of her life.” She reviewed the concerns of women in China, Russia, and Islamic countries as voiced at an international convention in Budapest. She described suffrage in the context of societal changes caused by the industrial revolution. “By the development of machinery, by the application of steam and electricity, through the organization made possible by the telegraph and the telephone, all the varied industries which were once the occupation of women, which were carried on under the family roof-tree, have been swept out of the home into the factories—and women have followed their work.”</p> <p>Keeler continued “. . . water, light, pure air, prevention of disease, have passed away from the control of the individual. It is urged that women should stay at home, but the home-maker is helpless to care for and protect her children unless she can dominate the collective authority which controls smoke, noxious gases, ventilation of buildings, laws for garbage, areas of school spaces, etc. Can a mother give her child wholesome food? Not without control of the food supply . . .” She added that “. . . men habitually think in terms of the dollar; women habitually in the terms of welfare . . .”<br />  </p> <p>On June 7, 1912, <em>The Pensacola Journal</em> (Florida) ran a story called <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062268/1912-06-07/ed-1/seq-5/#date1=1789&index=9&rows=20&words=Harriet+Keeler&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1963&proxtext=harriet+keeler&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1\">“Women Educators Want the Ballot.”</a> Keeler is quoted as favoring woman suffrage: “The work has gone as far as man can take it alone . . . If it progresses much farther it will have to be with the help of women.”</p> <p>In 1913, with the Ohio campaign heating up, the Woman Suffrage party <a href=\"https://clevelandhistorical.org/index.php/files/show/6595\">opened its headquarters in Cleveland</a>. Keeler served as its president that year, but stepped away early due to health issues. Cuyahoga County had 4,000 members at the time. The League of Women Voters of Ohio included Keeler as a pioneer on its <a href=\"https://ohiomemory.org/digital/collection/p267401coll32/id/27670/rec/6\">1930 “State Roll of Honor.”</a> This was part of the national organization’s 10-year celebration. (League of Women Voters formed upon passage of the 19th amendment.) Keeler was also a member of the National Woman’s Suffrage Association.<br />  </p> <h4><strong>Keeler’s Legacy in Cuyahoga Valley</strong></h4> <p>There are two places in Cuyahoga Valley National Park where we can reflect on Harriet Keeler’s legacy. The first is in the Brecksville Reservation. Here, shortly after Keeler’s death in 1921, some of the first parkland preserved in the valley was set aside in her honor. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/honoring-harriet-keeler-at-brecksville-reservation.htm\">Harriet Keeler Memorial Woods</a> became the core of what is now the largest property of Cleveland Metroparks. During this period, Raponi described “the blossoming of a nationwide crusade to create idealized, rural-esque park spaces for city dwellers.” This woods was one of the seeds planted during the period when the National Park Service, Cleveland Metroparks, and Summit Metro Parks were born.</p> <p> </p> <p>The other site is Blossom Music Center. Going back to the list of Keeler’s activities, the Fortnightly Musical Club laid the groundwork for the Cleveland Orchestra. Today the orchestra’s summer home, Blossom Music Center, is in the national park.<br />  </p> <p>As you visit these places, consider the scope of Harriet Keeler’s accomplishments. What do you want your legacy to be?</p>",

            "bodyText": "It is undeniable that vice played a big part in the gold rush days of Skagway. Saloons, gaming halls, and prostitution were revenue machines. Women in the sex industry came from all walks of life. Some professional women followed the migration of thousands of stampeders and their money. Being abducted into sex trafficking was common, forcing women to work as prostitutes against their will. Some women arrived in Skagway with husbands or family who either died or deserted them. With few options to support themselves, one way to make money was prostitution.<br /> <br /> Ella D. Wilson was an African American sex worker living in Skagway. Her profession was one of the most dangerous a woman could have in the gold rush. In May 1898 Ella transitioned from a citizen to a statistic when she was found dead. Cause of death: murder. They discovered Ella in her bed, a pillowcase over her head and a gag in her mouth. Her wrists and ankles were tied together, her money and jewelry missing, her trunk rifled through. Next to her bed, nothing except a pair of rubber boots and a pistol. Everything pointed to a robbery gone wrong. <br /> <br /> Rumor had it that Ella had $2,000 dollars in her possession (roughly $60,000 in 2016). A well-known madam from Denver, Mattie Silks, accused the notorious Skagway con-man Jeff “Soapy” Smith as the one responsible for Ella’s death. In lawless Skagway, nothing came of this accusation. Just five weeks later, Soapy Smith died in a shootout. To this day the murder of Ella D. Wilson remains unsolved. <br /> <br /> Ella may be gone, but she is not forgotten. Her final resting place is the Gold Rush Cemetery.  Located at the north end of Skagway this is a well visited point of interest. Interred at the base of Reid Falls are famous and colorful characters from Skagway's gold rush days. Ella's grave is just a few dozen feet away from the grave of the man accused of murdering her, Soapy Smith.",

In 1906, when she was 13, her family moved to the Arizona Territory. Her father, TJ Sparkes, Sr., bought several mines in the area, and in 1930, was elected Arizona State Mining Inspector. When her father died, Grace inheirited his mines.<br /> <br /> Grace worked for the Yavapai County Chamber of Commerce in Arizona, and later became the Immigration Commissioner, a position she held until 1945. In these positions, Grace often pushed for the preservation of historic sites in the state. After leaving her position, Grace and her sister Charity moved to Hereford, Arizona where, for the next twenty years, they worked the State of Texas Mine that Grace had inheirited. They saw little profit.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c4493a19-2f2d-483f-91a6-be04dcaa0deb}{253}\" paraid=\"716011840\">From the 1930s, Grace was an advocate for national parks. She supported the excavation of the ruins of the Tuzigoot Pueblo during the Great Depression and advocated for establishing it as a national monument. She later secured a grant to build a museum adjacent to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tuzi/index.htm\">Tuzigoot</a>. Grace also played a crucial role in establishing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/coro/index.htm\">Coronado National Monument</a> and expanding <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/moca/index.htm\">Montezuma Castle National Monument</a>. By 1960, Grace worked part-time as a Park Historian documenting park histories and providing historical interpretation to park visitors.<br /> <br /> Grace never married. She died at age 70 in 1963.<br /> <br /> <strong>More information:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://www.arizonahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/upLoads/library_PC_Sparkes-GraceM.pdf\">Grace Sparkes Photographs Finding Aid</a> at the Arizona Historical Society</p>",

            "bodyText": "John Gray Foster was born on May 27, 1823 in Whitefield, New Hampshire. An 1846 graduate of West Point, he served as an engineer in the war with Mexico where he was wounded. He was then an instructor at West Point, and in 1858, he was assigned to Charleston as a captain of engineers to oversee the underway construction of Fort Sumter. He was with Major <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-anderson.htm\">Robert Anderson</a>’s US Army garrison at Fort Sumter when on April 12, 1861, Confederate guns opened fire causing Anderson to evacuate two days later. Little did Foster know then that three years later he would return to lead Union efforts to reclaim Fort Sumter and occupy Charleston. <br /> <br /> After leaving Charleston, he served in North Carolina under Maj. Gen. Burnside. In July 1862, he was appointed to the rank of Maj. Gen. of volunteers and commanded the Department of North Carolina until December of 1863. He was then sent to Tennessee and assigned command of the Army and Department of the Ohio. He was there only a short time before being injured when a horse fell on him. Despite the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, which allowed the enlistment of African Americans into the US Army, Foster never supported the use of black soldiers and never attempted to enlist them.Recovering from his injuries, he assumed command of the Department of the South on May 26, 1864, where one of his priorities would be the capture or destruction of Fort Sumter. <br /> <br /> Foster returned to Charleston Harbor with energy. He immediately conferred with Admiral <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-a-dahlgren.htm\">John A. Dahlgren</a>, the US Navy blockade commander to coordinate operations. He ramped up the bombardment of the city as well as of Forts Sumter and Johnson. He made plans to assault Fort Sumter and requested assault boats and a large scaling ladder to allow soldiers to scale the wall simultaneously. However, resources were being demanded from both the Army and Navy for use in other sectors, thus Foster was left without support for these and other schemes he later proposed. So, he could only continue to try to bombard the fort into submission. <br /> <br /> By September, the supply of ammunition and powder had dwindled substantially as these resources were being diverted to support Grant’s and Sherman’s campaigns. Foster’s requests for more heavy guns was also denied, thus what was deemed the Third Great Bombardment that had lasted sixty days with 14,666 rounds fired at the fort, ended on September 4, 1864. Only haphazard firing occurred from then until the Confederates abandoned Fort Sumter on the night of February 17, 1865. <br /> <br /> Still suffering from old war wounds and the accident with his horse a year earlier, Foster took a leave of absence on February 6, 1865, just two weeks before the Confederates evacuated Charleston. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/quincy-a-gillmore.htm\">Quincy A. Gillmore</a>, who had previously commanded the Department of the South from June 1863 until May 1864 and, during that period, had sought unsuccessfully to capture or destroy Fort Sumter. <br /> <br /> After the war, Foster served in the regular army engineers attaining the rank of colonel. He was noted for his work in military and underwater surveying, becoming an expert in underwater demolition. He served as an assistant to the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC for several years. His last duty station was at a post on Lake Erie. He died on September 2, 1874 in Nashua, New Hampshire. ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Charles Follen McKim is one of the most celebrated American architects of the late nineteenth century. Along with William Rutherford Mead and Stanford White, he provided the architectural expertise as a member of the partnership McKim, Mead & White.</p> <p>McKim was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania to Presbyterian minister and abolitionist James Miller McKim (1810-1874) and Sarah Speakman McKim. After attending Harvard University, McKim studied architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts (“School of Fine Arts”) in Paris from 1867-1870. Upon his return to America, he was employed as a draftsman in the office of Gambrill and Richardson in New York City and fell under the influence of his mentor, architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-1886), while the latter was completing Trinity Church in Boston.</p> <p>In 1879, McKim formed his own firm in partnership with William Rutherford Mead (1846-1928) and Stanford White (1853-1906) and together established the most successful and influential architectural practice of its time. In the early years of their practice, the firm specialized in the design of informal summer homes for the wealthy, clustered in the areas of Long Island, the New Jersey shore, and Newport, Rhode Island.</p> <p>In later years, McKim became a major proponent of classical architecture in the tradition of the Italian Renaissance. Among the celebrated examples of this era (sometimes referred to as the American Renaissance), are the Boston Public Library (1887), the Columbia University library (1893), the University Club (1899), the Morgan Library (1899), and Pennsylvania Station (1904-1910; demolished). Many of their residential projects for the American millionaires during this time are also based on classical concepts.</p> <p>With Daniel Burnham (1846-1912) and Richard Morris Hunt (1827-1895), McKim oversaw the building program of the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893. The impact would establish a neo-classical revival and have a profound effect on architecture across America for decades to follow.</p> <p>McKim suffered from depression as early as 1878. His personal life was plagued with a series unpleasant and tragic circumstances. McKim first married Annie Bigelow in 1874. Four years later, she divorced him, alleging “unnatural acts” according to biographer Mosette Broderick who surmises this might have been an allusion to homosexuality. Annie obtained sole custody of their daughter and changed the girl’s last name. McKim did not see his daughter again for nearly two decades. McKim later married Julia Amory Appleton in 1885. Julia, and McKim’s child with her, died a year and a half later. But some measure of happiness came in 1899 when he was reunited with his daughter, and he received two important commissions—the monumental Pennsylvania Station (completed in 1910), and an architectural gem, the Morgan Library (completed in 1906).</p> <p>McKim was a perfectionist, painstakingly committed to classical precedents. His buildings are distinct from the more exuberant examples by his partner Stanford White. McKim’s buildings are marked by dignity and sobriety, committed to the purest forms of classicism. He was a highly persuasive personality, and knew what was aesthetically correct. McKim never argued with his clients, but often got his way through polite persistence.</p> <p>McKim suffered a breakdown in 1908 and died the next year at age 62.</p> <p>McKim was a member of the Congressional commission for the improvement of the Washington park system, the New York Art Commission, the Accademia di San Luca, the American Academy in Rome, and the Architectural League. He became a National Academician in 1907.</p> <p>McKim received numerous awards during his lifetime, including the Medaille d'Or at the 1900 Paris Exposition and a gold medal from Edward VII of the United Kingdom (for his work on the restoration of the White House). He received honorary doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, an honorary degrees of A.M. from Harvard, and from Bowdoin. He was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1877 (and served as its president), and posthumously received the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1909.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Robert Henderson Robertson was an American architect who designed numerous houses, institutional buildings and churches. He was an pioneer in steel skyscraper design in New York City.</p> <p>Robertson was born on April 29, 1849. His parents were Archibald Robertson, a merchant, and Elizabeth Henderson. Robertson’s father was a descendant of the McIntyre Iron Company in New York’s Adirondack region. Robertson graduated from Rutgers College in 1869. He began his architectural training in Philadelphia, in the office of Henry A. Sims. Soon after, he moved to New York and married Charlotte Markoe, daughter of a New York physician. By 1873, he worked in the office of Edward T. Potter, who was then designing the house built for Mark Twain in Hartford, Connecticut.</p> <p>Robertson established the firm Potter & Robertson with William A. Potter, whom he had met while working in the office of Edward Potter. They dissolved their partnership in 1881, occasionally collaborating until Potter retired in 1902. Robertson was responsible for at least 56 substantial projects from 1881-1909, including large country houses and town houses, churches and institutional buildings, railroad stations (including Mott Haven Depot in the Bronx and Canandaigua in upstate New York), banks, and some of New York’s earliest skyscrapers. Heavy Romanesque buildings that relied on the use of heavy, rocky brownstone for articulation was among his trademark features in the 1880s.</p> <p>Early skyscrapers designed by Robertson include the Lincoln Building (ca. 1885), the Corn Exchange Bank (1893-94), and the American Tract Society Building (1894-95). Though often published, his work was not critically admired, one reviewer noting, “none of these tall buildings contributes very distinctly to the solution of the specific problem of the tall building, and none can be called successful in its entirety. The architect’s power of design is shown in the parts, rather than in the whole, in the picturesque features in which his other work abounds.” Robertson’s most enduring legacy may be in the surviving buildings that were not noticed in his lifetime—the house and barns at Shelburne Farms (begun 1899) for Dr. William Seward Webb and Lila Vanderbilt, Santanoni (National Historic Landmark), the great camp designed for Robert Pruyn in the Adirondacks (1892-93), and the Coach House and Stables built for Frederick Vanderbilt in Hyde Park, New York.</p> <p>Robertson was a musician, and president of the Mendelssohn Glee Club, for whom he designed a club house in Manhattan in 1891. He was elected a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1885.</p>",

Her early childhood came in the years when Stalinist repressions eliminated the crème of Russian intellectual and political elite, and World War II left the country in ruins. As the man-made world collapsed under ideological and political clashes, nature was a source of solace, and it is perhaps not surprising that Lyudmila chose biology as her field of study. In 1959 she graduated from the Department of Biology and Soils of Moscow University. Her work was focused on the study of neurons in mammal and bird brains, animal behavior and navigational systems. Throughout her entire career, the Arctic played an important role in Bogoslovskaya’s research. One of her early projects explored the acoustic system of juvenile harp seals in the White Sea, and in 1971 she began research on whale behavior and physiology in Chukotka. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Working closely with indigenous people in Chukotka introduced Bogoslovskaya to the depth of indigenous peoples’ knowledge about their environment, and their deeply rooted practices of nature conservation. A keen listener, she incorporated indigenous observations in her research, and even utilized <i>baidaras </i>- traditional open skin boats of Chukotka – for her expeditions along the coast of Chukotka and to Ratmanov Island in Bering Strait. While continuing her biological research, and working towards her doctorate in biology, which she defended in 1987, Bogoslovskaya became increasingly interested in indigenous subsistence and heritage and began lobbying for subsistence rights of Chukotka’s indigenous peoples. In 1982 she petitioned the Ichthyologic Commission of the Soviet Union to restore indigenous subsistence hunting for bowhead whales, which was prohibited by the Soviet government since 1976.  Bogoslovskaya argued that whaling is an essential element for cultural preservation of local indigenous communities, which practiced sustainable whaling for millennia. Thanks to her unyielding efforts, indigenous whaling in Chukotka was restored in 1997.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">In 1970s, Bogoslovskaya began advocating for the creation of specially protected territories in Chukotka. According to her vision, such areas would preserve coastal and near-shore ecosystems and the cultural heritage of indigenous people. By the 1990s this idea gained support at high levels, especially after Presidents of the USSR and USA announced the intent to organize an international Beringia park. While the U.S. had existing parks in the Bering Strait region, there were no specially protected areas in Chukotka. Together with V. Krasilov, Bogoslovskaya was charged with developing the strategic plan for the Russian Beringia park. Building upon their work in Chukotka, community consultations, and experience of Alaskan parks they visited, Krasilov and Bogoslovskaya developed the concept of a park that would combine nature conservation with cultural preservation, protecting nature, traditional lifestyle, and subsistence. Their plan, although enthusiastically received at first, encountered several setbacks. The new Russian Beringia natural and ethnic park opened in 1993 as a regional park without international status. In 2013, the park received national status. Together with the NPS Shared Beringian Heritage Program, the National Beringia Park is working on deepening international collaboration in preserving cultural and natural heritage of Bering Strait and adjacent regions.  </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">During the last two decades of her life Bogoslovskaya worked at the Institute of Cultural and Natural Heritage in Moscow, where she organized the Center of Traditional Subsistence. During this time, she oversaw graduate students, published her research, collaborated on several joint volumes, and continued playing an active role in developing the Russian Federation’s legislation on traditional subsistence. She left a prolific legacy of published work, including a Russian-language manual on whales of Chukotka created for indigenous hunters (</span></span></span><i><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Киты</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Чукотки</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">: </span></span></span><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Пособие</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">для</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Морских</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Охотников</span></span></span></i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">), the compendium of Eastern Chukotka indigenous knowledge about local ice, snow and winds (</span></span></span><i><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Наши</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Льды</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">, </span></span></span><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Снега</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">и</span></span></span> <span lang=\"RU\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Ветры</span></span></span></i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">), and English-language coedited volumes <i><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"color:#201f1e\">Maritime Hunting Culture of Chukotka </span></span></i><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"color:#201f1e\">(</span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/beringia/publications.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">https://www.nps.gov/subjects/beringia/publications.htm</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:#201f1e\">) and <i>Inuit Whaling and Sustainability</i> </span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Lyudmila-Bogoslovskaya/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ALyudmila+Bogoslovskaya\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">https://www.amazon.com/Books-Lyudmila-Bogoslovskaya/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ALyudmila+Bogoslovskaya</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:#201f1e\">.</span></span></span></span></span>",

Corporations were seeking to build new developments in the Marin Headlands and highways were proposed to run through wild ridgelines in San Mateo County.<br /> <br /> Living in San Francisco’s Richmond District at the time, Amy Meyer was <em>“looking for a small community project”</em> in 1970 when she heard about a neighborhood effort to stop the development of a small parcel near her home. In January 1971, Meyer took action. She helped form a coalition of park advocates, <strong>People for a Golden Gate National Recreation Area, </strong>becoming co-chair of the group alongside wilderness advocate, five-time Sierra Club President<strong> Ed Wayburn</strong>. Advocacy groups such as the People for a Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Headlands, Inc., and the later Peninsula Open Space Trust, along with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/historyculture/congressman-phillip-burton.htm\">U.S. Congressman Phillip Burton</a> sought to block construction and development of open outdoor spaces.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Top left: Amy Meyer welcoming hikers to the Presidio, 1971.

Once the park was established, a Citizen's Advisory Commission was appointed to assist and recommend future actions, to filter and organize the wants and needs of the population.<br />  </p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>\"The people out here since the Gold Rush have said, 'This is a gorgeous place and we’ve got to save it.' San Francisco began protecting its beaches in the 1870s. Muir Woods became a National Monument in 1907. Mount Tam was protected beginning in the 1920s. There’s a tradition, an attitude about this beautiful place that we’ve got to keep it whole. But there’s also a saying that goes, 'All of our gains are temporary, all of our losses are permanent.' So we have to keep watching out and working all the time to protect these natural and cultural treasures.\" - Amy Meyer</em></strong></p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Although Meyer says the original concept called for an <em>\"8,000-acre park\"</em>, almost 50 years after the original legislation, the park is over 80,000 acres of overlapping history and biodiversity north and south of the bay. Amy Meyer has devoted more than 38 years to the creation and preservation of the park. She is the author, in collaboration with Randolph Delehanty, of <strong>“New Guardians for the Golden Gate”</strong>, which details how the people of the Bay Area and their legislators protected the Golden Gate as parklands for public use. Meyer is still co-chair of People for a Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and is the former vice chair of the GGNRA and Point Reyes National Seashore Advisory Commission. She was appointed by President Clinton as a founding board member of the Presidio Trust and is currently chair of People for the Parks/Presidio.<br /> <br /> Widely recognized for her work, she has earned awards from San Francisco Tomorrow, National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club, local and state government officials, and many others. Today, millions of people enjoy and visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/index.htm\">Golden Gate National Recreation Area</a> annually, named one of the most visited units in the National Park Service.<br /> <img alt=\"Amy Meyer walking along Baker Beach\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|708|538|0|0|0\" height=\"538\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:477060|0|\" src=\"/goga/learn/historyculture/images/Intro-panel-3-Meyer.jpg\" title=\"Amy Meyer walking along Baker Beach\" width=\"708\" /><em><sub>Amy Meyer walking on Baker Beach, 1973.

He was largely raised by his maternal grandparents before being forced to attend day school on the reservation. The school attempted to assimilate American Indian children into Euro-American culture, and Lame Deer claimed the teachers only taught 3</span></span></span><sup><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">rd</span></span></span></sup><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"> grade. He attended the school for six years but did not learn to read, write, or speak English. Lame Deer then attended boarding school for two years before running away. Of his school years he later said, “They couldn’t make me into an apple – red outside and white inside.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> </span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">At the age of 16, he participated in his first <i>hanblechia</i>, or vision-seeking. He wished to become a medicine man, and the ceremony would mark his transition from boy to man. He spent four days and nights alone in a vision pit on a high hill, finding solace in his pipe. Eventually, a vision came to him in which his great-grandfather, Chief Tahca Ushte (Lame Deer), appeared before him. Young Lame Deer understood he was to take his great-grandfather’s name and awoke from the vision pleased. Throughout his adult life, he preferred this traditional Lakota name to the Christian name (John Fire) he had been given.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:118%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> </span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><b><u><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">The Heyoka and the Rodeo Clown</span></span></span></u></b></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Lame Deer’s mother died when he was 17 years old. Her death altered his family and transformed his life. His father gifted him livestock, but Lame Deer soon traded these for rodeo gear and a Model T Ford. He joined the rodeo circuit, first as a rider and later as a cross-dressing rodeo clown named Alice Jitterbug.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> </span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Lame Deer was also a <i>heyoka</i>, or sacred clown, within his tribe. A <i>heyoka</i> is someone visited by Thunder-Beings in a dream, and they are known for their contrary and often comedic behaviors. Lame Deer compared his role as a <i>heyoka</i> to that of being a rodeo clown, describing the latter as “almost like doing spiritual work.” Lame Deer’s contradictory nature was not limited to his time as a rodeo clown. Throughout his early adulthood he was variously a wanderer and a prisoner; a criminal and a law officer; a sheepherder and a bootlegger; a hippie and a veteran; a womanizer and a holy man. Time spent in saloons, jail cells, and the U.S. Army taught Lame Deer more about the English language than his formal education ever had.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><b><u><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Spiritual Influence and Legacy</span></span></span></u></b></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:120%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:120%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">As Lame Deer matured, he recognized that the pipe religion held more value to him than peyote rituals or Christian teachings. He performed pipe ceremonies and participated in activist movements protecting Lakota traditions and beliefs, including a sit-in at Mount Rushmore where he was accompanied by friend and artist Richard Erdoes. Over the course of their friendship, they collaborated on <i>Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions</i> (1972), a book that appealed largely to youth of the 1960s – 70s counterculture movement. In his final years, Lame Deer expressed his pleasure at witnessing this cultural shift of minorities finding their voices and speaking out. He died in 1976 at the age of 73, but his descendants continue to uphold his mission and spiritual practices.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"line-height:125%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><i></i></span></b></span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">**Photo citation: Richard Erdoes photographs from the Richard Erdoes Papers, Yale Collection of Western Americana, Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, © Yale University.

            "bodyText": "<h2>Early Life</h2> Maria Pambrun was born on October 5, 1826, at Fraser Lake in what is now known as British Columbia, Canada. Her mother was Catherine Humpherville, a Métis woman of Indigenous and European descent, who was often called \"Kitty.\" Maria's father was a French-Canadian clerk working for the Hudson's Bay Company named Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun. Pambrun was a British Army veteran who had served in the War of 1812 before joining the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), a British fur trade company that operated throughout North America. Pierre and Catherine Pambrun were initially engaged in a \"country marriage\" or <em>marriage à la façon du pays</em> - a common fur trade-era arrangement wherein fur traders and Native or Métis women entered into marriage agreements without the involvement of a church or government, both of which could be hard to find in the North American West at that time.<br /> <br /> In the early years of Maria's life, she, her parents, and her siblings (older brothers Andrew Dominique, b. 1821, and Pierre, b. 1823, and younger brother Alexander, b. 1829) moved from post to post as her father rose through the HBC ranks. From Fraser Lake, they moved to the HBC's Fort Babine in 1830, where Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun served as the clerk in charge. Shortly after that, they relocated to Fort Nez Perces, where Maria's father became the Chief Trader.<br /> <br /> Fort Nez Perces was a fur trading fort located on the north side of the Columbia River, near present-day Wallula, Washington. Fort Nez Perces had been built in 1818 by the North West Company, the HBC's main rival in North America. When the North West Company and the HBC merged in 1821, the HBC took over operations at the North West Company's existing forts, including Fort Nez Perces. In the winter of 1824-25, Fort Vancouver was built in present-day Vancouver, Washington, to oversee all the posts in the region.<br /> <br /> At Fort Nez Perces, four more children were added to the Pambrun family: Thomas, b. 1832, Ada, b. 1835, Harriet, b. 1837, and Jean Baptiste, b. 1839.<br /> <br /> In 1836, American missionaries Narcissa and Marcus Whitman established the Whitman Mission at Waiilatpu, not far from Fort Nez Perces. The missionaries often relied on Fort Nez Perces for supplies and used the HBC's overland express to carry their mail. Catherine Pambrun also helped Narcissa Whitman after Narcissa gave birth to a daughter at the mission in March 1837. Narcissa wrote to her family: <blockquote> <p>\"[Catherine Pambrun], with my husband, dressed the babe. Mrs. P. never saw one dressed before as we dress them, having been accustomed to dress her own in the native style.\"</p> </blockquote> Catherine Pambrun was known for retaining the Cree traditions she had been raised with, but like many Euro-Canadian fathers of Métis children, Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun hoped that his daughter would assimilate into Canadian and American culture as a way to safeguard her against discrimination for her Indigenous heritage. He persuaded Narcissa Whitman to give Maria reading lessons and attempted to found a school at Fort Nez Perces.<br /> <br /> In November 1838, Maria and her siblings watched as their parents were married by Catholic priest François Norbert Blanchet. Father Blanchet was visiting Fort Nez Perces from Fort Vancouver, where he and Father Modeste Demers had recently arrived to establish a Catholic mission. On this same visit, the Pambrun children were baptized.<br /> <br /> Earlier in 1838, additional American missionaries arrived at Waiilatpu, a group that included a bachelor named Cornelius Rogers. In early 1841, Maria's father decided that Rogers would be an ideal husband for his 15-year-old daughter. The American missionaries, including the Whitmans, strongly opposed the match, principally because the Pambruns were Catholics and because of their racist attitudes towards Métis women like Maria. Additionally, the Pambrun family were mainly French-speaking, and the Whitmans did not consider Maria to be suitably educated, though she could read and write. In May of that year, Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun was horseback riding with Rogers when he fell from his horse and suffered an injury that resulted in his death. Pambrun had made arrangements to have Rogers and Maria married before he died, despite the Whitmans' objections, including giving Rogers \"a hundred pounds sterling\" in his will. But after her father's death, Maria refused to marry, and Rogers returned the money to the Pambrun family. Maria's mother was pregnant at the time of her father's death, and the youngest Pambrun child, Sara, was born later that year. <h2>At Fort Vancouver</h2> <br /> After Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun's death, Catherine Pambrun and her children moved to Fort Vancouver. There, Catherine, and perhaps Maria too, supported the family by doing \"fine needlework.\" They likely lived in an apartment in the fort's Bachelors' Quarters, a long building divided into apartments for the fort's clerks and guests. The Bachelors' Quarters also included a lending library - the first in the Northwest. The building was not just home to bachelors - clerks' wives and children also lived with them there.<br /> <br /> At Fort Vancouver, Maria met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/forbesbarclay.htm\">Dr. Forbes Barclay</a>. Barclay came from the Shetland Islands, and had received his medical training at Edinburgh University and the Royal College of Surgeons in London. He joined the HBC in 1839, and arrived at Fort Vancouver in March, 1840. There, he fulfilled many roles. Barclay oversaw both the hospital inside the fort, which served the HBC officers and their families, and a second hospital near the Columbia River waterfront, at the southern end of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/the-village.htm\">Village</a>. The Village was where HBC tradesmen, laborers, fur trappers and traders, and other employees lived; this second hospital served those working class employees and their families. Barclay was also in charge of the fort's Indian Trade Shop, where furs could be traded for goods imported from England. Finally, Barclay served as the librarian of the fort's library. In 1842, he and Maria were married. She was sixteen; he was thirty years old.<br /> <br /> For the next eight years, the Barclays and Pambruns lived at Fort Vancouver. In 1845, Maria and Forbes Barclay's son, Jean Jacques, was born. Barclay asked his superior, Chief Factor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnmcloughlin.htm\">Dr. John McLoughlin</a>, who also had medical training, to assist with the birth, but McLoughlin simply replied that he would pray for the Barclays, and Forbes was left to deliver his son alone. Jean Jacques Barclay died at the age of two from diphtheria and was buried in the Hudson's Bay Company cemetery on the slope to the northwest of the fort.<br /> <br /> In 1844, Pierre Chrysologue Pambrun's remains were brought to Fort Vancouver and buried in the HBC cemetery. Maria's youngest sister, Sara, died in 1844 and was also buried there.<br /> <br /> Maria had two more sons at Fort Vancouver: Peter Thomas, b. 1847, and Alexander Forbes, b. 1849. Between periodic disease outbreaks and the everyday dangers of living and working at Fort Vancouver before the advent of modern medicine, it was not uncommon for children living there to lose one or both parents. Dr. McLoughlin established an \"orphans fund\" to help care for these children, and some HBC officers at the fort, including Forbes Barclay, took in orphaned children to care for them. In addition to their two sons, the Barclay home was \"always filled with orphans.\" <h2>The Move to Oregon City</h2> <br /> In 1850, Forbes Barclay retired and the family moved to Oregon City, Oregon. Oregon City was also the place where Dr. John McLoughlin had retired in 1846, and by 1850 it was considered a bustling city, and a popular destination for American emigrants crossing the Oregon Trail. Maria's mother, Catherine, and her younger sisters also moved to Oregon City. In the 1850 federal census, the Barclays and Pambruns are listed as neighbors. In one home were Maria, Forbes, and their two young sons; in the other were 42-year-old Catherine Pambrun, her daughters Harriet, 14, and Ada, 16. In 1851, the Barclays welcomed Maria's older brother, Andrew Dominique, to their home. As a boy, Andrew had been sent to be educated at the HBC's Red River Settlement, and Maria offered him a home upon his return to the Northwest. After a brief time looking for work as a teacher in Oregon City, Andrew joined the HBC and moved to Fort Vancouver.<br /> <br /> As at Fort Vancouver, in Oregon City, Forbes Barclay continued to serve in many positions. He worked as a family doctor, a coroner, a school superintendent, a city councilman, and even the mayor of Oregon City from 1864 to 1873.<br /> <br /> In Oregon City, the Barclays had four more children: Adrienna Catherine (known as Katie), b. 1852, Harriet, b. 1854, William Charles, b. 1856, and Edmund, b. 1859. The 1860 federal census reveals that by that year, the Barclays had taken in Catherine and Harriet Pambrun. The extended family was still living together in 1870, though Maria's son Peter Thomas had moved to San Francisco.<br /> <br /> The Barclay, Pambrun, and McLoughlin families living in Oregon City remained close, bound together by their shared experiences at Fort Vancouver. When McLoughlin's daughter, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eloisamcloughlin.htm\">Eloisa</a>, and her husband had their first child in 1852, John McLoughlin served as the child's godfather (and grandfather) and Catherine Pambrun was named godmother. When Maria and Forbes' daughter Harriet was born in 1854, Dr. McLoughlin served as a witness at her baptism.<br /> <br /> In 1873, Forbes Barclay died, and was buried in Oregon City's Mountain View Cemetery. <h2>Later Years</h2> <br /> By 1889, Maria had moved to Portland, Oregon, possibly to be closer to her children, Katie and Alexander, who also lived in Portland. By that time, her sister Harriet, who had lived with her for many years in Oregon City and was likely the namesake of her daughter, Harriet Barclay, had married and moved to Yamhill, Oregon. Their mother had gone with Harriet. Catherine Pambrun died in 1886, and was buried in Yamhill.<br /> <br /> Maria Barclay died in Portland on April 2, 1890, at the age of 63. She was buried with her husband in Oregon City.<br /> <br /> On April 5, 1890, an obituary of Maria Barclay was published on the front page of the <em>Morning Oregonian</em> newspaper. It contained the following passage: <blockquote> <p>\"Mrs. Barclay was a woman of strong will and sterling integrity, accompanied with a kind disposition and a loving heart. Associated intimately with the people who lived the history of Oregon as a territory and a young state, and possessed of a wonderful memory stored with the facts and associations of pioneer life, she could talk by the hour of those early times...Among the earliest pioneers, she labored zealously, doing so far as she was able the part allotted her in life...She leaves none but friends, who will long remember her many excellent qualities and kind acts.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Tracing Her Steps</h2> <br /> Today, the National Park Service cares for three places that were important to Maria Pambrun Barclay's life.<br /> <br /> At <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whmi/index.htm\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> in Walla Walla, Washington, get a sense for Maria's early years in the eastern part of Washington State.<br /> <br /> At Fort Vancouver National Historic Site in Vancouver, Washington, visit the fort's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovaits.htm\">Indian Trade Shop and Hospital</a> to see a recreation of where the Barclay family lived inside the fort, and where Forbes Barclay worked.<br /> <br /> At the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/mcloughlin-house.htm\">McLoughlin House Unit of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a>, see the historic Barclay House.

            "bodyText": "<p>“In all the states of the Union…there are good people who know and speak of her as Mother Wallace, sweet-tongued apostle of temperance and reform.” – Major General Lew Wallace’s eulogy to his mother Zerelda Sanders Wallace<br /> <br /> Born on August 6, 1817, Zerelda Grey Sanders had a keen interest in learning and reading from a young age. After attending grammar and boarding school, Zerelda was known to accompany her father, a physician on his house calls. She married David Wallace, the lieutenant governor of Indiana on December 25, 1836 and became the step-mother to his three sons, including nine year old <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lew-wallace.htm\">Lewis “Lew” Wallace</a>. Only 19 years old at the time of her marriage, Zerelda became the first lady of Indiana in her early twenties. David Wallace served as the governor of Indiana from 1837 – 1840 and in 1841 was elected to the United States Congress where he served one term. <br /> <br /> Zerelda raised not only her step-sons, but also eventually had six children of her own, three of whom survived to adulthood. During this period she also supported her husband’s political and legal career prior to his death in 1859. Having little in the way of funds following David Wallace’s death, Zerelda refused help from her extended family and instead was determined to make it herself. She opened the Wallace home up to boarders to support her family and in 1870 began to care for her four grandchildren following the death of her daughter Mary. <br /> <br /> Zerelda had always had an interest in politics and social reform, in 1873 she began her direct involvement in both the temperance and suffrage movements. In March 1874, she helped organize the Women’s Christian Temperance Union in Indiana and was elected the union’s first president. In this roll she testified in 1875 before the Indiana General Assembly, presenting a temperance petition to the assembly with over 21,000 signatures. Zerelda later credited the contempt she received by from the General Assembly as the driving force behind her joining the suffrage movement. <br /> <br /> In 1878, Zerelda formed the Equal Suffrage Society of Indianapolis and was elected its first president. Now a suffragist, Zerelda testified before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1880. A year later she helped lobby the Indiana General Assembly to approve a women’s suffrage amendment to the Indiana State Constitution. Though two separate assemblies approved the suffrage amendment, in 1881 and 1883, the Indiana Senate refused to act on the amendment. No further suffrage action occurred in Indiana until the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920.<br /> <br /> Following the failure to get a suffrage amendment passed in Indiana, Zerelda became convinced that the fastest, most efficient way to secure women’s suffrage was through a national constitutional amendment. Zerelda corresponded with famous members of the national suffrage movement, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a>, and became a popular orator at suffrage conventions and meets. In 1887, Zerelda’s Equal Suffrage Society of Indiana became affiliated with the National Women Suffrage Society. In 1888, shortly before her stepping back from public life, Zerelda spoke at the International Conference of Women in Washington, D.C. <br /> <br /> Zerelda Wallace spent her twilight years living with her daughter, Agnes, in Cataract, Indiana before passing away in 1901. Though Zerelda never got to place a vote in a state or national election, her work with the suffrage movement bore fruit in the form of the 19th Amendment. At the time, 36 states were required to ratify the amendment before it could go into effect. Zerelda’s home state of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/indiana-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">Indiana was the 20th state to ratify the 19th Amendment</a>, doing so on January 20, 1920. The 36th state ratified the amendment in August and women in the United States gained the right to vote on August 26, 1920. </p>",

For most of her career, she taught at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, Kentucky.[1] After studying at several different colleges, Alice received an bachelor of arts from State University in 1930, now Simmons College of Kentucky, and another bachelor of arts from Kentucky State Industrial College, now Kentucky State University, in 1936. <br /> <br /> Like her sister <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgia-nugent.htm\">Georgia</a>, Alice Nugent played an active role in Black women’s clubs and other civic organizations in Kentucky. Both Alice and Georgia were founding members of Louisville’s Women’s Improvement Club (WIC).  WIC promoted education and health for African American women to demonstrate their “worthiness” of the vote. <br /> <br /> Alice was a member of the Louisville and Kentucky Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs. In late 1903, she joined her sister Georgia to establish the Kentucky Chapter of the State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs. It was later called the Kentucky Association of Colored Women’s (KACWC). At the time of its founding, Alice was elected to the KACWC Committee on Credentials as a representative of WIC.   <br /> <br /> As a talented pianist, Alice Nugent created musical arrangements for several KACWC events. One of her most notable contributions was the KACWC’s song, “Kentucky Clubs.” Alice wrote the song in 1916 while serving as the KACWC corresponding secretary. Sung to the tune of “Kentucky Schools,” Alice applauded the enthusiasm and pursuits of Kentucky’s Black women’s clubs in the song. She also alluded to Kentucky’s place within the national movement, by including the National Association for Colored Women’s (NACW) motto, “Lifting as we climb.”   <br /> <br /> In June 1919, Georgia and Alice Nugent bought a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nugent-house-louisville-kentucky.htm\">house</a> on 6th Street in downtown Louisville. The house became home to Georgia and Alice, their sister Mollie, their brother-in-law Thomas Williams, their father George, and various boarders. Because of the Nugent sisters’ civic involvement, their home hosted many events and guests associated with their work.   <br /> <br /> Over the years, guests at the Nugent House included Annie Malone, the president of Poro College, an African American-owned cosmetology school in Chicago. Mrs. Ora Brown Stokes, a National Consultant of the National Youth Administration, also stayed at the house. The National Youth Administration provided work for youth during the Great Depression. Stokes also served as the president of the Southeastern Section of the NACW and the Virginia Negro League of Women Voters. In 1939 and 1941, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-mcleod-bethune.htm\">Mary McLeod Bethune</a> visited the Nugent House. Bethune was a civil rights activist, suffragist, and the first elected African American female official in the United States. Alice sometimes accompanied Bethune while she worked as the director of Negro Affairs for the National Youth Administration.  <br /> <br /> Although Alice Nugent is perhaps better known for her hostess role, she continued to contribute to club activities. Throughout her life, Alice staunchly advocated for children and education. As a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, she was a big supporter of scholarships for women seeking to attend college. She also served on the Kentucky Negro Educational Association’s Scholarship Loan Fund Committee.  <br /> <br /> Alice Nugent retired from teaching in 1946. She died on November 30, 1971. She was the last remaining member of her family. Today, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority’s Louisville Alumni Chapter awards the Alice Nugent Scholarship in her honor.   <br /> <br /> <em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Notes: </strong><br /> <br /> [1] <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/paul-laurence-dunbar.htm\">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a> was one of the most significant African American poets during the early 1900s.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Sources: </strong><br /> <br /> Bache, Laura. “Nugent House Completed Draft.” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

Her mother, Marguerite, was the daughter of a Swiss fur trader and a First Nations woman whose name is unknown. Her father, Dr. John McLoughlin, was a rising star in the North West Company, a fur trading organization that rivaled the powerful Hudson's Bay Company. At the time of her birth, Eloisa joined an already-large family - she would likely have known three half-sisters from her mother's previous marriage (a half-brother from this marriage was already in the Pacific Northwest), a half-brother from her father's first marriage, older brother John, Jr., and older sister Eliza. The family would be completed in 1821 with the birth of Eloisa's younger brother, David.</p> <p>John and Marguerite McLoughlin were not officially married until 1842, when Catholic missionaries to Fort Vancouver performed the service. However, their informal marriage, though not sanctified by church or state. was a dedicated one. Despite long periods of absence because of his work, McLoughlin always returned to Marguerite and their children.</p> <p>In 1821, the North West Company had effectively been absorbed by the Hudson's Bay Company in a merger that McLoughlin himself had helped negotiate in London. McLoughlin was promoted to \"Chief Factor,\" then sent to the Pacific Northwest to establish Hudson's Bay Company operations in the region. A spot was chosen on the north bank of the Columbia River, and Fort Vancouver was built and christened in 1824.</p> <p>Eloisa, then seven years old, her brother David, and her mother made the overland journey from Fort William to Vancouver with their father. Elder siblings John, Jr., and Eliza remained in eastern Canada, where they were to attend school.<br />  </p> <h2>Coming of Age at Fort Vancouver</h2> <p><br /> In an account of her life, Eloisa described life at Fort Vancouver as isolating and cloistered. Though they lived in the fort's most comfortable accommodations, the Chief Factor's family was kept separate from the fort's many employees and visitors. In the Chief Factor's House, the families - women in particular - ate in a separate mess, while McLoughlin held court int he house's central mess hall. Eloisa stated, \"The families lived separate and private entirely. Gentlemen who came trading to the Fort never saw the family. We never saw anybody.\"</p> <p>A notable exception came with the arrival of American missionaries to the fort. Dr. Marcus Whitman, who arrived at the fort in 1836 while preparing to establish a mission near Walla Walla, Washington, dined in the ladies' mess along with his wife, Narcissa. In her journal, Narcissa Whitman described the nineteen-year-old Eloisa as \"quite an interesting young lady.\"</p> <p>As Eloisa approached a marriageable age, she first drew the attention of fur trader Francis Ermatinger, a Hudson's Bay Company clerk with extensive field experience. Ermatinger began his appeals to McLoughlin for his daughter's hand as early as the winter of 1831-32. Though he described her as a \"fine Girl\" who had \"improved much by the company of the Ladies from England and America,\" Ermatinger's letters intermingle his desire to marry into the McLoughlin family with his interest in furthering his career and settling down after living the peripatetic life of a fur trader. After asking repeatedly, Ermatinger received his final refusal from McLoughlin in 1838. Ermatinger attributed his failure to the fact that he was too old for Eloisa (he was nineteen years her senior). At the time of that final defeat, Ermatinger wrote in a letter to his brother it was clear who Eloisa's husband was to be: William Glen Rae.</p> </div> </div> <h2 class=\"CS_Layout_SpacingHeight\" id=\"cs_spacer_5209430\">Eloisa's First Marriage <br />  </h2> <div class=\"cs_control CS_Element_Custom\" id=\"cs_control_5209430\"> <div class=\"Component text-content-size text-content-style ArticleTextGroup clearfix\"> <p>In the spring of 1838, Eloisa was married to William Glen Rae, a clerk who had been stationed at Fort Vancouver since 1837.</p> <p>The ceremony was performed by Hudson's Bay Company chaplain Reverend Herbert Beaver. Beaver had developed a strong dislike for both Fort Vancouver and (especially) Dr. John McLoughlin. Rae had earned Beaver's ire by extension, since the clerk was one of several HBC employees at the fort who openly sided with McLoughlin against him. Of the wedding, Beaver wrote that he wished he had \"united the girl, who is of an amiable disposition and tolerable education\" with a \"young man of a milder disposition.\"</p> <p>Rae was born in 1808 in Orkney, Scotland. His father served as a Hudson's Bay Company agent in the area, and the family lived in the Hall of Clestrain. Rae's younger brothers, Richard and John, would also join the Hudson's Bay Company. John would go on to become one of the most celebrated arctic explorers of the 19th century.</p> <p>William Glen Rae arrived in Canada in 1827. In 1832, in his notorious \"Character Book,\" in which he wrote candid descriptions of many company employees, Hudson's Bay Company Governor George Simpson wrote that Rae was \"A very fine high spirited well conducted Young Man of tolerably good Education. Stout Strong and active, he is quite a Mechanical Genious [sic] and can turn his hand to any thing...[Rae] promises to become a rising Man in the country.\"</p> <p>On February 3, 1839, Eloisa gave birth to her first child: a son named John. The witnesses at young John's baptism a week later included his uncle, John McLoughlin, Jr., who by this time had rejoined the family at Fort Vancouver and become an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company.</p> <p>By 1840, former suitor Francis Ermatinger, a friend of Rae's, had no hard feelings. In a letter to his brother, Ermatinger gives us a window into the happier early years of Eloisa's marriage, writing that \"Mrs. Rae is really a good woman and an affectionate wife.\"</p> <h2>Fort Stikine</h2>   <p>In 1839, Rae was promoted to Clerk in Charge and sent to Fort Stikine, a rugged outpost in Russian Alaska. Eloisa accompanied him, perhaps with baby John. John McLoughlin, Jr., also joined them; he had been assigned to the fort as a clerk and surgeon.</p> <p>Eloisa described Fort Stikine as \"a miserable place...There were only flat rocks and not trees around close. Within half a mile; just bare rocks.\" Alcohol was a prominent part of life at Stikine, and Eloisa describes its contributions to the fort's turbulent, destructive atmosphere, explaining that the fort's employees were \"buying liquor and fighting all the time among themselves just outside the fort. I did not like it at all; it was terrible.\"</p> <p>In 1841, Rae received a new assignment, and the family boarded the steamship <em>Beaver</em>, heading south. Heavily pregnant at the time of their departure, Eloisa gave birth aboard the <em>Beaver</em> to her daughter, Margaret Glen, on March 21. By May 15, the Raes had arrived at Fort Vancouver, where Margaret Glen was baptized.</p> <h2>California</h2>   <p>For years, John McLoughlin had resisted the Hudson's Bay Company's desire to set up a post in California. However, by 1841, he had relented and, without consulting HBC officials, sent William Glen Rae to establish a post in Yerba Buena, a city we today call San Francisco. With the new position came an illustrious new title: Chief Trader. After a period of recuperation in Vancouver, Eloisa and their two children joined him there.</p> <p>McLoughlin had assigned Rae with establishing the post without having gotten the explicit support of Governor George Simpson. In 1842, McLoughlin visited the San Francisco post with Simpson. After leaving the post, Simpson decided that it should be closed by the end of 1843. McLoughlin resisted the ruling, insisting that the post could be successful.</p> <p>In her autobiography, Eloisa describes a vibrant, interesting Spanish community in the growing town. While there, she gave birth to her third child - a daughter named Louisa, born in 1843. Her husband, however, was plagued by a host of issues in running the San Francisco post: a lack of open lines of communication with the HBC, a lack of reliable help, and hostile local authorities. His problems were magnified by his own involvement in contentious local politics, and a combination of alcoholism and depression. On January 19, 1845, William Glen Rae committed suicide.</p> <p>In the days leading up to this tragedy, Eloisa had been \"confined in childbirth\" as she prepared for the birth of the couple's fourth child. Rae had discussed his fears that he was to be attacked by local militants because of his misguided interference in local revolutionary politics, and had expressed his suicidal intentions. Eloisa pleaded with him, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Shortly after Rae's death, she gave birth to a son, William Glen Rae, Jr., who died shortly after his birth.</p> <p>Not knowing what had happened, that March, McLoughlin sent a ship to San Francisco with orders to close the post. It returned to Fort Vancouver in June, carrying widowed Eloisa, her three children, and news of the tragic fate of the Hudson's Bay Company's Californian ambitions.</p> <h2>Oregon Country</h2>   <p>The deteriorating relationship between McLoughlin and the Hudson's Bay Company came to a head in the spring of 1845, when McLoughlin's tenure as the head of the Columbia District was ended. Additional financial penalties issued by the company forced McLoughlin to reture at a home he built on his land claim in Oregon City, Oregon, near the Willamette Falls. Dr. John, Marguerite, Eloisa, and her children, moved into the house in early 1846.</p> <p>In 1850, Eloisa married Daniel Harvey, an Englishman who was in charge of McLoughlin's Oregon City mills, and who had previously been a Hudson's Bay Company employee. The couple had three more children - Daniel, Jr. (born in 1851), Mary Angelique (born in 1854), and James William McLoughlin (born in 1856). Together, the McLoughlins and the Harveys - a blended family of ten total people - lived in the four-bedroom Oregon City house.</p> <p>Dr. John McLoughlin died in 1857, and Marguerite died in 1860. In 1867, the Harveys moved to Portland, Oregon. In 1868, Daniel Harvey died. At the age of fifty, Eloisa was widowed for a second time.</p> <p>Her daughters Margaret Glen and Louisa and sons Daniel Jr. and James William McLoughlin remained in the area. In her will, Eloisa spoke especially kindly of James - her youngest child - for the care he gave her in her later years.</p> <p>Eloisa McLoughlin died on October 1884, at the age of sixty-six. She is buried in Portland's Lone Fir Cemetery, alongside Daniel Harvey, Sr., and her sons Daniel Harvey, Jr., and James William McLoughlin Harvey.</p> <h2>Tracing Her Steps</h2> <p><br /> Discover Eloisa's first home, Fort William, at Thunder Bay, Ontario's <a href=\"http://fwhp.ca/\">Fort William Historical Park</a>.<br /> <br /> Learn about the place where Eloisa grew up at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/hbcfort1.htm\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a>, where you can visit a reconstruction of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovachieffactorshouse.htm\">Chief Factor's House</a>.

            "bodyText": "After graduating from Central Colored High School, Georgia attended State University, now Simmons College of Kentucky, and Kentucky State Industrial College, now Kentucky State University. She began her almost 50-year teaching career in 1889. Georgia worked in several of Louisville’s segregated schools and taught Sunday school classes at the Lampton Street Baptist Church. In addition to being active in her church, Georgia played a prominent role in many local and state-level civic organizations.   <br /> <br /> On September 25, 1896, African American suffragist and anti-lynching advocate <a href=\" https://www.nps.gov/people/idabwells.htm\">Ida B. Wells</a> delivered her “Lynching in America” speech in Louisville. This speech inspired Georgia and some of the other Louisville women in attendance to establish the Woman’s Improvement Club (WIC). Beginning with 30 to 40 members, this organization advocated for Black women’s access to the ballot. WIC also promoted education and health for African American women to demonstrate their “worthiness” of the vote. At the time of its founding, Georgia Nugent was elected club secretary. Within two years, she became club president and served in this role until her death.  <br /> <br /> In late 1903, Georgia organized a state-wide Black women’s clubs’ event with her sister <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-nugent.htm\">Alice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nannie-helen-burroughs.htm\">Nannie Helen Burroughs</a>, and other activists. On December 31, 1903, they gathered at Plymouth Congregational Church to form the Kentucky Chapter of the Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs. Speakers at the event included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwca/index.htm\">George Washington Carver</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tuin/index.htm\">Tuskegee Institute</a>, Kelly Miller of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/washington-dc-andrew-rankin-memorial-chapel-frederick-douglass-memorial-hall-and-founders-library-at-howard-university.htm\">Howard University</a>, and Elizabeth Lindsay Davis, a national organizer from Chicago. At the time of its founding, the organization included 13 Black women’s clubs. It was later renamed the Kentucky Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (KACWC). By 1935, the organization’s membership had increased to 2,500 women from 112 clubs. Georgia Nugent served as KACWC’s first president.   <br /> <br /> Under Georgia’s leadership, KACWC advocated for Black women’s voting rights and spoke out against lynching and segregation. Many of the organization’s initiatives included support for social reforms for African American children and the elderly. KACWC supported the creation of day care facilities, hospitals, community centers, scholarship funds, and housing for senior citizens and troubled youth.  <br /> <br /> Many African American women from Kentucky also played a role in the founding of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) in 1896. In 1914, Georgia Nugent was elected the NACW’s corresponding secretary; within four years, she was elected chairman of the executive board.   <br /> <br /> Because of Georgia and Alice Nugent’s involvement in civic organizations, their <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nugent-house-louisville-kentucky.htm\">home</a> hosted many guests and events associated with their work. As part of her duties, Georgia also spent a lot of time away from home. She traveled extensively to attend and speak at many state and national events. For example, she attended the Twelfth Biennial NACW convention in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1920. In her speech, she discussed women’s suffrage and the ratification of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">Nineteenth Amendment</a>. This Amendment made it illegal to deny the vote based on sex, but it generally did not apply to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-american-women-and-the-nineteenth-amendment.htm\">African American women</a> who were excluded by other means. <br /> <br /> After decades of teaching, Georgia Nugent retired in June 1938. She died almost two and a half years later on November 25, 1940. She served as the president of the Woman’s Improvement Club for 41 years. After her death, the organization was renamed the Georgia A. Nugent Improvement Club. <br /> <br /> <br /> <em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em><br />  <br /> <strong>Sources: </strong><br /> <br /> Bache, Laura. “<a href=\"https://heritage.ky.gov/Documents/Nugent%20House%20COMPLETED%20DRAFT%2001%2010%202020.pdf.\">Nugent House Completed Draft</a>.” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

Realizing that he had no idea where he was and no food or sleeping bag, he quickly decided that he must move or freeze to death—the temperature was 40 below zero and would only drop as night fell.</p> <p>So, after wrapping himself in his silk parachute, he began descending to the river below. The explosion and fire at the crash site had destroyed any supplies he might use, so Crane took stock of his only survival tools: two packs of matches, a Boy Scout knife, and his parachute that served as a sleeping bag. For nine days he huddled in an improvised campsite under a spruce tree where he dreamed of steak, mashed potatoes, and milkshakes and battled feelings of despair. The squirrels he tried to kill skipped away from his makeshift spear, bow and arrow and slingshot, and after nine days of living on nothing but water, he knew his strength would not last.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yuch/learn/historyculture/leon-crane-survival-story.htm\">Read the incredible 81 days below zero survival story of Lt.

            "bodyText": "<h2>Early Life</h2>   <p>Little is known about Marguerite McLoughlin's early life, but some details can be found in historical records about the lives of her parents.<br /> <br /> Marguerite's father, Jean-Etienne Waden, was from Vaud, Switzerland. In 1755, at the age of 17 or 18, he came to what was then called \"New France\" – an area now called Canada – as a soldier with the Compagnies Franche de la Marine, French colonial regulars. Waden arrived on the continent at the beginning of the Seven Years War, or as it's more commonly called in the United States, the French and Indian War. Waden spent much of the war in and around Montreal. In May 1757, he is recorded as having \"renounced the Calvinist heresy\" at Notre-Dame of Montreal. This most likely means that he had been raised in Switzerland as a Protestant. The majority of French Canadians at this time were Catholic, and Protestant worship and teaching were prohibited. By becoming a Catholic just two years after his arrival, Waden may have already been planning his future in Canada. <br /> <br /> In September 1760, the French surrendered to the British at Montreal. By the end of the month, all French officials and troops were sent to New York as prisoners of war, and were then sent back to France. Waden, however, stayed behind in Montreal. It has been suggested that he was able to do so because he may have deserted his regiment sometime before the surrender.<br /> <br /> In November 1761, Waden married Marie-Josephe Deguire dite LaRose, and between 1762 and 1767, the couple had six children. In 1763, Waden became a property holder in Montreal. However, after 1767, Waden seems to disappear from the historical record in Montreal, and it's around this time that he began his career in the fur trade.<br /> <br /> In 18th century North America, the fur trade was a pillar of the economy across much of the continent. Furs accounted for a vast majority of commercial exports. In late 18th century Canada, much of the fur trade was characterized by independent fur trappers and traders who purchased government licenses granting them permission to travel into western Canada to trap furs. Throughout the 1770s, Waden's name appears in the fur trading licenses granted at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grpo/index.htm\">Grand Portage</a>, a post that sits on the northern side of Lake Superior. It does not appear that Waden's wife and family accompanied him.<br /> <br /> The location of Grand Portage is in a part of North America that was historically inhabited by people from several tribes. including the Cree, Dakota, and Ojibwe. Perhaps somewhere in this area, Waden met Marguerite's mother. She was an Anishinaabe woman whose name has been lost to history. The historical record suggests she was Ojibwe. She gave birth to Marguerite around 1775. Whether she had additional children is unknown.<br /> <br /> While we don't know much about Marguerite's mother's life specifically, there are some general things we might assume. She probably would have strongly identified with her family's clan, which would have been represented by an animal totem. She would have spoken an Ojibwe dialect, and probably French. She would have grown up in a birch-bark wigwam. She might have helped prepare manoomin, wild rice, which is both a significant dietary staple and an important part of Ojibwe culture and beliefs. She may have told her daughter traditional Ojibwe stories, like those about the <em>maymaygwaysiwuk</em>, secretive little people who live underwater in Lake Superior and paddle stone canoes.<br /> <br /> Relationships between fur traders and Indigenous women were very common in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Native women were skilled interpreters, they had a deep knowledge of how to live off the land, and partnering with a Native woman could create a valuable alliance for both a fur trader and the woman's tribe or village. These so-called \"country marriages\" or <em>mariages à la façon du pays</em> were sometimes sealed with a ceremony or ritual that involved an exchange or acceptance of gifts, but they generally did not involve the church or government.<br /> <br /> Fur trade marriages could also be very temporary. If either partner wanted to leave the marriage, it could be ended, to the benefit or detriment of either partner. European fur traders often entered into relationships with Native women knowing that they would one day retire, return to city life, marry European women, and leave their Native wives behind. In Waden's case, of course, he already had a wife and family at home in Montreal.<br /> <br /> Marguerite and her mother likely accompanied Waden on his journeys into the Canadian interior throughout the late 1770s. Then, in March 1782, while at Lac la Ronge, Waden was shot and killed by Peter Pond, a rival fur trader who felt that the Lac la Ronge area was his territory and that Waden was trespassing.<br /> <br /> It isn't known if Marguerite, who would have been seven years old, and her mother were with her father when he was murdered, but it certainly wouldn't have been unusual for a fur trader to be traveling with his Native wife and child. We also don't know what they did after Waden was killed. Perhaps Marguerite's mother became attached to another fur trader to keep the family going, perhaps they returned to her tribe, or perhaps Marguerite and her mother eked out an existence at Lac la Ronge or another fur trade post.<br />  </p> <h2>Marguerite's First Marriage</h2> <p><br /> Sometime around 1794, at the age of about 19, Marguerite entered into a relationship with North West Company clerk Alexander McKay, who was then stationed at Lac la Loche. Alexander was born in the Mohawk Valley of New York to a Scotch-Irish family. After the Seven Years War, his family had settled at Glengarry, just south of Montreal. McKay was known as an expert at land-based travel, and in 1793, around the time he met Marguerite, he had recently served as a lieutenant in Alexander McKenzie's expedition to the Pacific Ocean on behalf of the North West Company. This made McKay among the first Europeans to have crossed the breadth of North America.<br /> <br /> Between 1794 and 1801, Marguerite and Alexander had four children: three daughters, Nancy, Mary, and Catherine, and one son, Thomas. The children were baptized at St. Gabriel Presbyterian Church in Montreal, but in the cases of Nancy and Catherine, were not baptized until they were three or four years old because of the difficulty of getting to the church from Alexander's far-flung duty stations. In Catherine's baptismal record, Marguerite is not mentioned by name, but is instead called \"a woman of the Indian country.\"<br /> <br /> In 1808, Alexander resigned from the North West Company and retired to Montreal. In 1810, he became a partner in the Pacific Fur Company, a newly-formed, American fur trading enterprise founded by John Jacob Astor. Astor sent overland and over sea expeditions to set up a post at the mouth of the Columbia River. Alexander joined the sea bound expedition on board the ship <em>Tonquin</em> and took Thomas, who was then just 13 years old. The expedition reached the Columbia River in March 1811. That June, Alexander was killed when a trading expedition on Vancouver Island turned violent. Thomas survived, and stayed on the Northwest coast at the newly established Fort Astoria.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Life at Fort William</h2> <p><br /> Marguerite and Alexander undoubtedly knew that their relationship was not necessarily a permanent arrangement, and for employees and wives of the North West Company, this was normal. In fact, it was so normal for North West Company employees to leave behind their wives, that they sometimes made arrangements for their care once they were gone, which sometimes meant \"matching\" them up with other honorable gentlemen in the Company's service. The Company itself knew that making sure women were officially attached to men was in its best interest – unattached women at fur trade posts were seen as troublesome.</p> <p>At the time of Alexander's resignation in 1808, he was at the North West Company's Fort William, located on the northern edge of Lake Superior. Around that time, Marguerite met Dr. John McLoughlin, who was also stationed at Fort William. McLoughlin was a young bachelor who was caring for his infant son, Joseph, whose Native mother had probably died in childbirth.<br /> <br /> McLoughlin, who was about ten years younger than Marguerite, had been raised in Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec. He had initially studied medicine, but had joined the North West Company as a physician and clerk in 1803. He had intended to leave the fur trade in 1808, after his first contract had expired, but he renewed so that he could help fund his brother David's medical education in Scotland. As a result, he was at Fort William at the same time that Marguerite became single again. Marguerite and John McLoughlin's relationship may have had its romantic side, but it was also, perhaps primarily, a convenient arrangement for a pair of individuals who both had young children needing protection and care.<br /> <br /> Their first child, John McLoughlin, Jr., was born in August 18, 1812. Their daughter, Elisabeth, was born in 1814. A second daughter, Eloisa, was born in the spring of 1817, and their final child, David, was born in 1821.<br /> <br /> Many years later, Eloisa described her father as \"hasty in temper\" but \"quite good hearted.\" Many contemporaries noted that Marguerite had a calming influence on her hot-tempered husband, and this dynamic might have emerged early in their relationship.<br /> <br /> During the early years of their marriage, the McLoughlins spent their summers at Fort William during the annual fur trade rendez-vous. At the end of the summer, the family would then travel about 200 miles west and spend the rest of the year in the North West Company's Rainy Lake District. In 1814, after the birth of their second child, McLoughlin became a wintering partner of the Company, and after that largely remained at Fort William. While they were at Fort Wiliam, the family lived in the surgery and apothecary building near the fort's gate.  <br /> <br /> In the 1810s, internal conflicts and tensions between the North West Company and its main rival, the Hudson's Bay Company, were rising. This corporate turbulence caused a fair amount of drama in the McLoughlin home. In 1816, McLoughlin, among with the other partners at Fort William, was arrested by the Hudson's Bay Company under suspicion that they had instigated an attack on Hudson's Bay Company men and settlers at the Battle of Seven Oaks. While McLoughlin awaited his trial in Montreal, Marguerite spent the winter of 1816-1817 alone at Fort William, pregnant with her daughter, Eloisa. She was also alone for Eloisa's birth that February. McLoughlin's trial was ultimately delayed and he was able to return to Fort William that summer. The trial was re-scheduled in 1818, and Marguerite was left alone with their children again, this time for over a year. He was ultimately acquitted of the charges.<br /> <br /> By 1820, Marguerite's three eldest daughters from her first marriage were in their teens or twenties, and at least one of them was married. That year, the McLoughlins made what was no doubt a difficult decision to ensure that two of their children would receive a good education. Eight-year-old John Jr. and six-year-old Elisabeth were sent to Montreal, where McLoughlin's uncle, Simon Fraser, was to oversee their educations.<br /> <br /> That fall, Marguerite, who was pregnant with their son David, was left again at Fort William with three-year-old Eloisa, while McLoughlin sailed to England to take part in an event that would have huge consequences for their family: the merger of the North West and Hudson's Bay Companies. After the merger was signed in London in March 1821, McLoughlin sailed back to Montreal, only to double back to Europe because he felt ill and wanted to be in the care of his brother, who was by that time a well-known physician in Paris. McLoughlin finally returned to Fort William in March 1822, after a two-year absence.<br /> <br /> In 1824, now an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, McLoughlin, along with Marguerite, Eloisa, and David, traveled to the HBC's York Factory on the coast of Hudson's Bay, Canada. There, he was given his order to establish what would become Fort Vancouver.</p> <h2>Establishing Fort Vancouver</h2> <p><br /> The McLoughlins first journeyed to the already-established Fort George, formerly Fort Astoria, which Alexander McKay had come to the Northwest to build. Eloisa, who was seven years old when the family made the journey to the Pacific Northwest, later said that neither her father nor she were very impressed with the fort. From Fort George, the McLoughlins traveled up the Columbia River to establish Fort Vancouver in a plain on the river's north bank.<br /> <br /> Fort Vancouver was established as a regional headquarters and supply depot for the Hudson's Bay Company's operations in the Northwest. In the first half of the 19th century, it was a major population center along the West Coast, and was home to a diverse community of Europeans, Native people from about 25 different tribes, Native Hawaiians, and Métis people.<br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the fort was a bustling, relatively cosmopolitan spot, Marguerite, Eloisa, and the other upper class women living inside the fort, which included the family of Chief Trader James Douglas, lived fairly cloistered lives. Eloisa later stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The ladies who were there then lived separately in their own Mess room. When my father had company – distinguished visitors or others – he entertained them in the general Mess room, and not in the family mess room. The families lived separate lives entirely. Gentlemen who came trading to the Fort never saw the family. We never saw anybody.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Still, despite this feeling of isolation, Marguerite was responsible for managing servants, looking after children, and doing handwork. She was particularly known for her skills as a seamstress and beader.<br /> <br /> The family did have a number of reunions while they were at Fort Vancouver. Marguerite again saw her son, Thomas McKay, who was still working in the Northwest fur trade. Joseph McLoughlin also joined them later, as did John McLoughlin, Jr.<br /> <br /> However, at this point in her life, it is unlikely that Marguerite ever again saw her four eldest daughters, though McLoughlin saw at least two of the daughters on subsequent trips to Eastern Canada and England. <br /> <br /> A notable exception to Marguerite and Eloisa's isolation at the fort came with the arrival of American missionaries in the 1830s. Dr. Marcus Whitman, who arrived at the fort in 1836 while preparing to establish a mission near Walla Walla, Washington, dined in the ladies' mess room along with his wife, Narcissa. In her journal, Narcissa wrote that Marguerite made an impression by riding a horse \"gentleman fashion,\" as was more common among Native or Métis women.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Highs and Lows in the 1840s</h2> <p><br /> In 1838, Eloisa was married to William Glen Rae, one of Fort Vancouver's clerks, and the couple welcomed a son, John, in February 1839. Marguerite was named as the baby's godmother (in addition to being his grandmother), and John Jr. was named as godfather.<br /> <br /> However, later that year, Eloisa, her husband and son, and John Jr., would be on their way to Fort Stikine, a rugged outpost in Russian Alaska, where William Glen Rae was to serve as Clerk in Charge and John Jr. had been assigned to act as a clerk and surgeon. The Rae family returned in 1841, along with a new baby, Margaret Glen, while John Jr. remained in Alaska.<br /> <br /> For much of the year, Eloisa stayed at Fort Vancouver while William traveled on to San Francisco (then called Yerba Buena) where he was to establish a new Hudson's Bay Company post. Marguerite, who was also named as Margaret Glen's godmother, likely spent this time helping to care for her daughter and grandchildren. Eloisa joined her husband later that year.<br /> <br /> In April 1842, tragedy struck. At Fort Stikine, John Jr., who had been left in charge of the post, was shot and killed by his men. Hudson's Bay Company Governor George Simpson had concluded that John Jr.'s alcoholism and poor leadership made him responsible for his own murder. This allegation was devastating to the McLoughlin family, and was an important factor in the deterioration of the relationship between the Company and Dr. McLoughlin.<br /> <br /> In November 1842, Marguerite and John McLoughlin were officially married in a Catholic ceremony, an act which had the effect of \"legitimizing\" their four children in the eyes of the law and the church.<br /> <br /> Then, in January 1845, another catastrophe struck. The post that William Glen Rae had established in California had floundered. This discouragement, coupled with alcohol abuse, led Rae to commit suicide. As Eloisa and her three children (a daughter, Louisa, had been born in San Francisco) mourned and waited for a ship to bring them back to the Northwest, Dr. John McLoughlin was finally forced out of the HBC following months of disagreements over how the region was to be managed.<br /> <br /> In early 1846, the McLoughlins moved to Oregon City, where a fine, white, two-story, four-bedroom home had been built for them. In the summer of 1846, Eloisa and her children joined them there.<br />  </p> <h2>Oregon City in the 1850s</h2> <p><br /> The McLoughlins' Oregon City residence became a bustling family center. In 1850, Eloisa remarried to Daniel Harvey, a former HBC employee and the head of her father's Oregon City mills, and the couple had three more children. Just as John and Marguerite had brought together a large, mixed family at Fort William, the McLoughlin-Rae-Harvey family in Oregon City ultimately included four adults and six children living together in the same household.<br /> <br /> McLoughlin became a United States citizen in 1851. He also briefly served as the mayor of Oregon City, and was an active merchant and mill owner. The family enjoyed a certain degree of wealth and stature in the community.</p> <p>Marguerite died in 1860, at the approximate age of 85. Today, her grave rests alongside that of her husband (who died in 1857), and is located next to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/mcloughlin-house.htm\">McLoughlin House</a>, a unit of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.</p>",

Lothrop. She spent her childhood in Boston and married Charles Dudley Homans in 1856. They lived together in Boston, but spent summers from the 1870s and onward at their cottage near Schooner Head Overlook, just a few miles from Bar Harbor. Eliza's brother also had property on Mount Desert Island, which had been purchased jointly with the father of George Dorr and later become part of Old Farm estate.<br /> <br /> After Eliza's husband Charles died in 1886, she continued to travel, manage properties across New England, and found a ladies' social club with her sister. In the following two decades, both of her children died within a year of each other and she found solace in her connection to Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> Now a longtime summer resident of Bar Harbor, Eliza Homans owned approximately 140 acres of land which included the Bowl, the Beehive, and the south side of Champlain Mountain. The Beehive rises 500 ft above the ocean on the southeastern edge of Mount Desert Island, and the Bowl is a small pond just in front of it. Homans decided this land, with its tremendous natural features, could not truly be \"owned\" and needed to be shared.<br /> <br /> In May 1908, she sent a deed to Charles W. Eliot, president of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/hctpr.htm\">Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations</a> (HCTPR). She opted for the land transfer, but not her name, to be publicized. This was the first land donation to HCTPR, starting the momentum for subsequent land donations and purchases to what would later become Acadia National Park. Homans' friendships with other conservationists like Charles W. Eliot and family connections to the island may have influenced her decision to donate her land. Her land transfer did have reservations, including the right to shoot, fish, boat and keep a boathouse on the Bowl. The Beehive Mountain Aqueduct Company.was also permitted to continue using the pond as a public water supply.<br /> <br /> Eliza Homans died in 1914 in Bar Harbor, Maine and was buried with her husband in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Between 1915 and 1916, Homans Path was constructed in her name as part of a trail network at and around Sieur de Monts. It is a steep trail consisting of granite steps, tight passages, and overhangs, where hikers can continue onto the summit of Dorr Mountain via other connector trails.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The descendant of Huguenot refugees, John Bard spent his childhood in Burlington, New Jersey. As a young man, he apprenticed to a surgeon in Philadelphia. About 1740, he married Suzanne Vallaeu, granddaughter of Peter Fauconnier. Six years later, he moved to New York, where he quickly established himself as a leading physician, becoming the first President of the New York Medical Society. By 1764, he had inherited, through his wife, most of the Fauconnier patent located at present day Hyde Park, and, in addition, he reconstituted the original tract by purchasing parcels of land that had been previously sold by Fauconnier. With this ample property at his disposal, he made plans to retire from medical practice and develop the Hyde Park estate into a working farm and country seat. His son, Samuel, then 22 and a medical student in Edinburgh, was eager to assist him inlaying out the grounds and offered to have a plan drawn in Scotland. No records indicate that such a plan was created. Dr. John Bard's estate at Hyde Park was developed to a lesser degree than the aspirations of his son. </p> <p>Unlike his successors at Hyde Park, Dr. John Bard seemed to have little interest in the scenic qualities of the Hudson River and instead viewed it solely as a means of transporting goods and supplies. Shortly after 1764, he established a farm on what is now the east side of the Albany Post Road, which included a farm house, barn, an orchard of between 500 and 600 apple trees, as well as meadows, upland, etc. He also had three boat landings on the Hudson River. Bard seemed plagued by financial difficulties, and in 1768, he put the entire property up for sale. </p> <p>Bard did not sell his entire property in 1768, but, over the next thirty years, he sold about 1,500 acres of the original 3,600. He also abandoned temporarily the idea of retiring to country life. In 1772, however, he returned and built a house near his farm complex. Financial losses from investments in mining and iron works caused Dr. Bard to return to medical practice in New York City after the American Revolution, where he formed a partnership with his son, Dr. Samuel Bard. In 1798 at the age of 83, he returned again to Hyde Park, dying there in 1799.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Samuel Bard was a prominent medical practitioner, professor, and a founder of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. He was a significant figure in the American Enlightenment and a botanist.</p> <p>Bard was a driving force behind the creation of the New York hospital in 1770 (and then again later, in 1791), as well as the College of Physicians and Surgeons, which had long been his ambition. As a teacher at Columbia, he was known for his teaching style, which coupled lectures with bedside demonstrations. He wrote on medical subjects such as diphtheria, yellow fever, and obstetrics, as well as medical ethics—he authored the nation’s first textbook on the subject—and was what might be described as an early public health advocate.</p> <p>Samuel Bard settled at Hyde Park in the spring of 1798, just one year before his father John Bard’s death. He maintained the working farm developed by his father while also carrying out many of the ideas for an ornamental pleasure ground in the natural style. Taking full advantage of the property’s dramatic topography, Bard erected a house south of the farm complex on a natural terrace—a broad ridge at the summit of a steep, wooded slope rising 300 feet above the river. Although the house itself was relatively modest, the view from its west front encompassed a stunning 180-degree panorama of the Catskill Mountains to the north and the Hudson Highlands to the south. In February 1799, anxious “to have the ground about his house in order,” Bard turned his attention to the surrounding landscape, requesting honeysuckle and the latest catalog from the Prince Nursery in Flushing, presumably in connection with the garden he was laying out near the house. On the west front he created an extensive lawn overlooking the Hudson River that became one of Hyde Park’s distinguishing features. He reportedly solicited the assistance of the Philadelphia agriculturist Richard Peters in procuring enough grass seed to sow two acres, so that he might “bring the ground round about his house into a greensward.”</p> <p>Bard also planted specimen trees, among them a Gingko that has survived into the twenty-first century as one of the oldest examples in North America. He treated the extensive ridge on either side of his house as a park, retaining many of the native trees and culling others to create scenic overlooks. While staying at Hyde Park in 1832, the artist Thomas Kelah Wharton described the effect: “The front lawn occupies the whole level plateau on the top of the ridge, and splendid old trees are left standing at intervals with seats scattered here and there from which you can survey at leisure and in the shade, the exquisite beauty of the river scenery below.” The “celebrated belt of forest trees that extends along the whole [ridge] line,” appears clearly in a map of 1847. Crum Elbow Creek ran through the property and Bard seems to have diverted the water in places to create fish ponds, which he intended to stock with carp and tench imported specially from England. He also erected a greenhouse, where he further developed his expertise in botany by experimenting with the cultivation of “beautiful and rare plants,” many of them obtained through botanical exchange with correspondents in Europe. Bard’s greenhouse, according to his son-in-law, John McVickar, was “the first, in that northern climate, which substituted, with success, the heat of fermentation for the more expensive and dangerous one of combustion.”</p> <p><i>Sources</i></p> <p><i></i>John McVickar, <i>A Domestic Narrative of the Life of Samuel Bard, M.D., LL.

            "bodyText": "<p>James Rudolph Garfield, second son of James and Lucretia Garfield, was born in Hiram, Ohio on October 17, 1865. The two oldest Garfield sons moved through most of their early lives together, even though they were two years apart in age and very different in looks and temperament. Hal was brown eyed and stocky and resembled his father in sociability. But he was a plodding student, deliberate in thought and action. Jim had his father’s fair complexion and promise of his height, but a lanky frame. He was moody, quick-tempered, and more resistant to correction than Hal, but a quicker learner.<br /> <br /> Jim and Hal were with their father at the White House on the morning of July 2, 1881. Their mother and the younger children were in New Jersey, but the plan was to reunite with Mrs. Garfield and Mollie that day for a trip to Williams College, where the two young men would be enrolled for the fall semester. The youngest sons were going home to Mentor for the summer. Hal and Jim followed their father to the train station in a separate carriage. When they stepped out at the depot, they heard shots fired, and went in to find their father bleeding on the floor of the ladies waiting room. Their world was completely changed.<br /> <br /> Jim had attended St. Paul’s School in Concord, Massachusetts with Hal, was tutored by Dr. Hawkes at the White House, and then the two went on to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. After graduating in June 1885, they attended Columbia University’s Law School. Jim worked in the law firm of Bangs and Stetson in New York, while Hal studied in England.<br /> <br /> After being admitted to the Ohio bar in 1888, and establishing the Garfield and Garfield law firm, James married Helen Newell on December 30, 1890 in Chicago, Illinois. Helen was a friend of Hal’s wife, Belle, and the daughter of John Newell, president of the Lake Shore Railway. The couple built a home just west of Lucretia Garfield’s Lawnfield estate, calling it Hollycroft. There they raised four sons: John Newell, born February 3, 1892; James A. II, born April 18, 1894; Newell arrived August 1. 1895; and Rudolph Hills on September 13, 1899.<br /> <br /> Of all the Garfield sons, James R. was the most involved in politics, at both the local and national levels. He served on the Mentor Village Council and the school board. In 1889, he organized a committee to consider creating a free public library for the village. He was named president of the group, and organized the fundraising and book collecting effort—even persuading his younger brother Abram to design the library building.<br /> <br /> James R. Garfield became an active, reform-minded Republican and served two terms in the Ohio Senate from January 1896 to April 1898. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to the Federal Civil Service Commission, which had been established as a result of his father’s assassination. The next year, Roosevelt made Jim Commissioner of Corporations in the Department of Commerce and Labor.<br /> <br /> In 1907, Jim was named Secretary of Interior and quickly became part of Roosevelt’s inner circle, the “tennis” cabinet. Thought by many to be the best interior secretary to that time, James R. modernized the department, spearheaded Roosevelt’s efforts to conserve public resources, and was active in American Indian affairs. President Roosevelt visited the James R. Garfield family at their home in Mentor during this time. Jim was later closely associated with the Progressive Party.<br /> <br /> Jim returned to his Cleveland law practice in 1909 and was the senior partner in the firm of Garfield, Baldwin, Jameson, Hope and Ulrich. He played a prominent role in Cleveland civic and charitable organizations. He was one of the founders and a trustee of the Community Fund, vice-president of the Cleveland Welfare fund, and the first legal counsel for the Cleveland Foundation. He also served as a trustee for various groups including the Speech and Hearing Clinic, the Humane Society, Lake View Cemetery, Lake Erie College, Williams College, and the Western Reserve Historical Society. The five children of James and Lucretia Garfield donated their parents’ Mentor home and immediate surrounding property to the Western Reserve Historical Society in 1936, and James R. delivered the dedication speech at the grand opening of Lawnfield later that year.<br /> <br /> Helen Newell Garfield died in a car accident in August 1930, and Jim sold Hollycroft in the 1940s. The house was lost to fire in 1965. James R. spent his last years living with his younger brother, Abram. He died on March 24, 1950 and is buried near Helen at Mentor Cemetery.<br />  </p>",

            "bodyText": "<h3>Forgotten Women of the Wayside:<!--3--></h3>   <p>One of the lesser-known residents of the Wayside is Mary C. Pratt, who ran a boarding school in the house from 1871 to 1879. Little scholarship on her exists, and what can be found is spread out through census records, birth and death certificates, and hints in newspaper articles. While some may not find Pratt as prestigious as a Hawthorne or a Lothrop, what details can be found about her life are fascinating, and suggest a woman whose memory is just as valuable as any Wayside celebrity.</p> <p>Pratt was born on June 3, 1831 in the port town of Cohasset, Massachusetts.<sup>1</sup> Her father, Captain Peter Pratt, was a mariner<sup>2</sup> with four children from a previous marriage<sup>3</sup> ; her mother, Mary Roulstone of Boston, was 16 years his junior.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Not much could be found concerning Pratt’s childhood. Her parents had two more daughters; Charlotte (born in 1833)<sup>5</sup> and Georgiana (1837-1838).<sup>6</sup> The family does not appear to have left Cohasset before Peter’s death in 1851.<sup>7</sup> Pratt herself never married; however, Charlotte married James O. Josselyn of Virginia in 1853,<sup>8</sup> and welcomed a daughter named Ida two years later.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>The family seems to have moved around a great deal in the intervening years. The 1860 census places Pratt, her mother, and Ida in a boarding house in Braintree, Massachusetts.<sup>10</sup> By 1870, however, Pratt was “teaching private school” in Charlestown, New Hampshire. The 1870 household consisted of Pratt, her mother, a teacher, a servant, and five students, including Ida.<sup>11</sup> A report by the Department of Education suggests that Pratt founded the school in 1866.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>Pratt’s involvement with the Wayside began in 1871, when she leased the house from Abby Gray and moved her school there, christening it the Wayside Family School. She bought the home officially in 1873.<sup>13</sup> According to an article in the <i>Concord Freeman,</i> Pratt had been attracted to Concord’s “literary advantages,”<sup>14</sup> and so fittingly set up her school in the former home of the Alcotts and Hawthornes. Most of the pupils were girls, but a few boys were welcomed, including the sons of Anna Alcott Pratt (no relation to their teacher).<sup>15</sup> The Alcotts’ association with the school does not end there. Before the school opened, Bronson Alcott would guide visitors on tours of Hawthorne’s former home<sup>16</sup> ; now, he took an active role in school events. An entry in one of his journals describes “meet[ing] the young ladies at the Wayside and tell[ing] them something about Hawthorne, Thoreau and Louisa.”<sup>17</sup></p> <p>The school was prestigious, serving “the best families in New England,” and was “very select.”<sup>18</sup> Contemporary articles from the <i>Concord Freeman</i><sup>19</sup> and other newspapers bear up this point. The school was said to house “budding misses”<sup>20</sup> who “perpetuated the tradition of refinement and cultivation earlier fostered by the Alcott and Hawthorne families.”<sup>21</sup> The 1874 graduation ceremonies boasted several prominent speakers, from Bronson and May Alcott to Ralph Waldo Emerson.<sup>22</sup> The Concord Freeman describes it as an elegant scene:</p> <blockquote>“The lawn adjoining was hung with chinese lanterns, and provided with seats, also a stand for music… eight of the young ladies entered the lawn… over their heads waged the spreading branches of oak, and under their feet was a carpet of soft green grass.”<sup>23</sup></blockquote> <p>The Wayside Family School closed down in 1879, when Pratt sold the property to Nathaniel Hawthorne’s youngest daughter Rose Lathrop with the plan to move her school to Belmont, Massachusetts.<sup>24</sup> Indeed, the 1800 report of the Commissioner of Education lists her as the principal of the “Family School for Young Ladies” in Belmont<sup>25</sup> , and the 1880 census places her there with her mother and a servant, running a “day school and keep[ing] boarders.”<sup>26</sup> She does not, however, appear to have lived there long; city directories and censuses as well as the mortgage papers from Daniel Lothrop’s purchase of the Wayside place her on Warren Street in Needham, Massachusetts by 1889, unassociated with any school.<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px; vertical-align: super; color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">27</span></p> <p>The final record of Mary C. Pratt before her death is the 1910 census, which places the 79-year-old Pratt in Needham with Mary Cunningham, a maid.<sup>28</sup> Pratt died in 1918, at the age of 87, and is buried in Cohasset Central Cemetery with her family.<sup>29</sup></p> <p>These are the details that exist; what Pratt herself was like, her personality, hopes, and dreams, are all speculation. She appears to have supported her mother until the latter’s death in 1883.<sup>30</sup> Like Louisa May Alcott, she remained unmarried and made her own living, an unusual path for a woman of her time. And yet, her school seems to have trained young, rich girls to take the traditional feminine roles expected of them, if the <i>Concord Freeman</i> articles are any indication. What may this suggest about Pratt’s life and beliefs? Could she, like Alcott, have chafed against expectations of women, and started her school to make her own way in life? Or did she teach out of necessity, to support her mother after her father’s death? What was her life like during the Civil War in her thirties? How would she have reacted to issues such as Reconstruction and women’s suffrage? Sadly, all of this remains unknown. However, in gleaning what information we can, we can preserve a fragment of the memory of this forgotten woman of the Wayside.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4><strong><u>Sources</u></strong></h4> <sup>1</sup>Mary C.

            "bodyText": "Struck By The Ree was a realist whose life begins in legend. The story goes that in 1804, Lewis and Clark were on their famous expedition and heard about the birth of a baby boy nearby. They asked to see him and proceeded to wrap the baby in an American flag. Some versions of the story claim that the explorers baptized him as an American while others claim the men predicted the child would grow into a great leader.<br /> <br /> The explorers themselves did not note this event, but they did hold a council with the Ihanktonwan Tribe at Calumet Bluff the year Struck By The Ree was presumably born. The story serves as a symbolic reminder of the relationship that Struck By The Ree attempted to cultivate between his people and the growing Euro-American population.  <br /> <br /> There is much that is not known about Struck By The Ree. His name was supposedly earned in combat against the Arikara (also known as the Ree). He is often referred to as either Struck By The Ree or Strike The Ree, but signed the Treaty of 1858 as Pa-la-ne-a-pa-pe, the man that was struck by the Ree. As a grown man, he became the principal chief of the Ihanktonwan (Yankton) Tribe.<br /> <br /> After George Catlin's 1836 visit to the pipestone quarries provoked widespread curiousity and interest, Euro-American settlers began arriving in increasingly large numbers. Struck By The Ree visited Washington D.C. in 1857 to lobby on behalf of his people, but to no avail. He is credited with saying:<br /> <br />  <em>\"The white men are coming like maggots. It is useless to resist them. They are many more than we are. We could not hope to stop them. Many of our brave warriors would be killed, our women and children left in sorrow, and still we would not stop them. We must accept it, get the best terms we can get and try to adopt their ways.\"</em><br /> <br /> Struck By The Ree sought to create a peaceful coexistence between the new settlers and his people in the face of massive cultural upheaval. In 1858, the U.S. government drafted a treaty that ceded to it over 11 million acres and placed the Ihanktonwan on a 475,000-acre reservation 150 miles from the pipestone quarries with the promise of education, agricultural training, and $1.6 million over 50 years. Struck By The Ree refused to sign it unless his people were guaranteed free and unrestricted use of the pipestone quarries. The government agreed and created a unique, 1-square mile reservation intended specifically to protect the quarries. <br /> <br /> Despite broken promises and mistreatment of his people (which he would later speak against in the Doolittle Commission), Struck By The Ree continued to push for peaceful relations between Indigenouns people and Euro-Americans. In the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, he even warned white settlers of the impending violence, althought this did not spare him from the settlers' vengeance in the war's aftermath as the Dakota people were expelled from Minnesota and bounties were places on their scalps.  <br /> <br /> Although little is written about Struck By The Ree, what has been recorded about him reveals a gift for the long view. He never stopped trying to help the Ihanktonwan Oyate adapt to change and was firm in his argument for peace. Presidents Pierce, Grant, and Garfield all gave Struck By The Ree medals to commemorate his tireless efforts to establish peaceful relations between American Indians and Euro-Americans. Furthermore, without his insistance and foresight in 1858, would the pipestone quarries have survived either the onslaught of settlement and rapid development or possible overuse by non-Natives?  ",

He wanted to join the army, but had a young family to think about. In 1862 he, like many other Hiram boys had the chance to join his brother-in-law's regiment, the 42nd OVI, but decided to answer an advertisement to drive wagons for the Ohio Quartermaster Corps. This led John to a job as a wagon master where he would be in command of drivers and supplies vital to the Union army. <br /> <br /> Private Rudolph led twelve supply wagons to eastern Tennessee, then on to the Cumberland Gap on the border of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. Union General George Morgan and his troops were holding the major passageway, but were in desperate need of food. Among the regiments at the gap were the 42nd OVI and John’s brother, Joe Rudolph. It is not recorded, but quite likely the two brothers had a chance to visit for a brief moment. If they did, it was the last time the two would ever see each other. After the journey to Cumberland Gap, John became seriously ill. High fever, severe diarrhea and bouts of delirium set in. He was sent to the army hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. Further examination revealed typhoid fever, for which there was no effective treatment.<br /> <br /> During the course of the war thousands of soldiers on both sides were struck down with typhoid, usually dying within four to six weeks. Many of the soldiers drank tainted water which carried the deadly bacteria. John’s time was short, and his wife Marthawho had four-week old twins, Ernest and Lewis, was unable to make the trip to see her husband. John died on August 12, 1862. His mother Arabella brought his body back to Hiram for the funeral because John's wife was not able to travel. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery in Hiram.  <br /> <br /> Learn more about John's Civil War service <a href=\"https://garfieldnps.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/john-rudolph-the-forgotten-son/\">here</a>. </p>",

            "bodyText": "Only 2.7 miles separate the Little and Big Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, but the international border between the US and Soviet Union/Russia made this distance nearly impossible to cross for much of the twentieth century.  <br /> <br /> On August 7, 1987 the American swimmer Lynne Cox confronted the icy waters of the Bering Strait and the frigid political climate of the Cold War by swimming from the US Little Diomede Island to the Soviet Big Diomede. The swim was a peace gesture, inspired by a dream to bridge the distance between the two countries involved in the Cold War battle.<br /> <br /> Cox grew up in a family of swimmers. Her grandfather swam across the Hudson River, and her parents taught her and her brother Dave to swim at early age. At age fifteen, she set a new record for crossing English Channel for both men and women, and three years later became the first woman to swim across Cook Strait, the 13 ½ mile shark-infested body of water between New Zealand’s North and South Islands. Cox conceived the idea to swim across the Bering Strait from the US to Russia in 1976, but it took her eleven years to bring this dream to the reality. Political tensions between US and Soviet Union stalled fundraising, and Soviet authorities were not responding to the swimmer’s request for permission to cross the border.<br /> <br /> In 1987, Cox decided that the time had come. With personal funds, some support from friends and family, and a free ticket from Alaska Airlines, she arrived on Little Diomede, but thirty hours before the scheduled swim, there was still no word from the Soviet side. Instead, two large ships appeared in the middle of the strait, to which US responded by sending jet fighters. For a short while it looked like Cox’s peace initiative had taken a very wrong turn. Finally, 24 hours before the scheduled time, permission came from President Gorbachev. This was exciting news to both the swimmer and her local indigenous Inupiaq guides, who were to accompany her in their traditional skin boats and see their relatives on the Russian side for the first time in over forty years.<br /> <br /> When the thirty-year-old swimmer finally stepped into the Strait on the foggy morning of August 7, 1987, the 38° F water took her breath away. \"The cold was like a huge vampire pulling the heat from my body,” Cox recalled, “I looked down at my fingers and they were totally grey, like the hands of a cadaver.\" The Inupiaq guides were supposed to guide her to Big Diomede, but none of them had ever been there and with a rusty compass as the only means of navigation, there was a fear that they’d miss their target altogether. <br /> <br /> Finally, a Russian support vessel emerged from the fog, a sight that Cox called “one of the most beautiful sights in her life.” The excitement was building, and an English-speaking Soviet journalist informed Cox, that there was a Russian welcoming party waiting for her… half a mile farther than the closest shore point. The freezing swimmer had a tough choice to make. “I decided to go that extra half mile, she says, because I felt like if I touch rock, instead of somebody’s hand, what have I done? “Nothing! There was no connection with the people on the opposite shore.” As she got close to the beach, the people began waving and jumping. “They were so excited,” Cox said, “because they realized that for the first time in 48 years the border was open, and they were there to witness it and greet us.”<br /> <br /> When after two hours and five minutes in the water Cox came to shore, she could not pull herself up. She extended her arm and two Russians in military in uniform grabbed her. \"I instantly felt this heat from their warm hands,” Cox recalls, “and they were speaking Russian, and I thought, oh my gosh, we really made it!”<br /> <br /> In a tent nearby, Soviet doctor Rita Zakarova covered Cox with hot-water bottles, put her in a sleeping bag, and then embraced her. For the American, the moment symbolized the entire trip. For the world, Lynne Cox’s swim across of the Bering Strait symbolized hope for a new era in the US-Russia relationship. When President Gorbachev travelled to Washington to sign a nuclear weapons treaty later that year, he and President Reagan raised a glass to toast the swimmer. \"She proved by her courage how close to each other our peoples live,\" Gorbachev said.<br /> <br /> Bering Strait continues to play an important role in the US - Russian relationship. In 1990, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev announced their intention to create an international park spanning the Bering Strait and expand cooperation in the field of environmental protection and the study of global change. The NPS Shared Beringia Heritage Program works to strengthen this cooperation in the Bering Strait region.<br /> <br /> Lynne Cox had a long and distinguished career as an endurance swimmer and activist. Today, she continues sharing her experiences as book author, public speaker and educator, motivating audiences by describing how one can overcome extraordinary obstacles by taking risks, working with teams, and ultimately achieving the impossible.<br />  ",

Ted</span><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"> was the first born at the family estate at Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay, NY. Like all the Roosevelt children, Ted was greatly influenced by his father, but </span><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">built his own impressive life, especially in terms of his military career.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Throughout his youth, Ted was educated in both public and private schools including the prestigious Groton School in Massachusetts. While attending school, his father would write him letters encouraging Ted to push himself, especially in sports and specifically in football. As time came for him to choose a university, Ted looked towards West Point or Annapolis in pursuit of a military career, while his father preferred Ted attended his own alma mater, Harvard University, and serve his country in the military as a volunteer if the need arose.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Ted chose Harvard over a military school and found success upon graduation in banking and business. He married Eleanor Alexander in 1910 and they settled close to Sagamore Hill. Still interested in serving in the military, he found his initial opportunity to serve during World War I. In 1915, he joined a camp in Plattsburgh, New York which prepared young men for war as officers. Doing his best to “practice what father preaches,” as his youngest sibling Quentin put it, Ted was commissioned along with his brother Archibald, to serve as officers in June 1917.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Ted’s initial post was in France and about a month after he traveled there, his wife Eleanor followed him to work with the YMCA. Her presence and their Parisian home became a respite for Ted, Archie, Quentin, and Ethel’s husband Dr. Richard Derby as they were all sent overseas. This was especially important because at one point during the conflict, Ted had been shot in the leg and it was Dr. Derby’s care that saved both his leg as well as his life. During his service in World War I he received the Croix de Guerre among other medals.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">After returning home, Ted and Eleanor continued to make a name for themselves. Ted, following in his father’s footsteps, decided to run for political office in New York State. In 1919, he was elected to the New York Assembly and in 1924 was the Republican nominee but lost the race for New York Governor. He was appointed as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1921 as a part of the Harding administration. In 1929, he served as Governor of Puerto Rico and by 1932 he was appointed as the Governor General of the Philippines.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">In 1938 he built a residence at Sagamore Hill on 5 acres of an apple orchard that he purchased from his mother. He and his wife, along with his children Grace, Theodore IV, Cornelius, and Quentin II spent many summers here. In 1960 his wife donated the estate to the National Park Service, and it is now known as the Theodore Roosevelt Museum at Old Orchard at Sagamore Hill.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Ted’s final act of service came in World War II, where he reached his highest military rank of Brigadier General. He served under General George S. Patton in the African theatre and was later reassigned to the western front. Ted was 56 years old when he famously became the highest ranking officer on the beaches during the Invasion of Normandy, personally escorting soldiers on Utah beach under heavy fire. Ted suffered a heart attack and died less than 5 weeks later on July 12, 1944.

Her captors took her across the tallgrass prairie and through the Pipestone Quarry before releasing her for a ransom in the Dakota Territory.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Born in New York, Abbie Gardner and her family continually moved west in pursuit of the frontier throughout her childhood. They finally settled in Iowa on the shore of West Okoboji Lake in July of 1856. The following winter proved unusually harsh, resulting in food shortages that threatened starvation for both the Euro-American settlements and nearby American Indian encampments. One of these camps included Inkpaduta and his followers.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">After being refused help, disarmed, and pushed out of the area by settlers, Inkpaduta and his band launched a series of small raids against settlments they passed as they made their way to Abbie’s community at Spirit Lake (near modern-day Okoboji). They killed over 30 people there (including most of Abbie’s family) in an attack that became known as the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857. Abbie and three other young women were taken captive as the band fled the scene and returned to the Minnesota Territory.<br />  </span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Later in life, Abbie recalled camping on the prairie near the “the great Red Pipestone Quarry” before the party proceeded to the Dakota Territory. During their brief stay here, Abbie remembered that her captors were “engaged in the delightful task of gathering the pipestone and shaping it into pipes, which were formed in the manner foretold ages ago.” Abbie eventually returned to the pipestone quarries and pointed out the location of their temporary camp.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Of the four female captives taken by Inkpaduta’s band, Abbie was one of two who survived. Elizabeth Thatcher and Lydia Noble were killed by their abductors, but two Wahpeton Dakota hunters purchased Margaret Marble and turned her over to the State of Minnesota. Officials sent three Yankton scouts to recover Abbie. They successfully negotiated her ransom and received $400 each for her return.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Following her release, Abbie reunited with her only remaining sibling, her sister Eliza. She also met Cassville Sharp and married him on August 16, 1857. They had three children and returned to Iowa where Abbie published a book about her experiences both during and after her abduction by Inkpaduta. She tried to reclaim her family’s original home, but was unsuccessful until 1891, when she regained 13 acres of her father’s land claim. Abbie lived there for the next 30 years (now Arnold’s Park) and ran the location as a tourist attraction until her death in 1921.</span></span></span></span><br />  ",

And I’ve been able to do it.”</strong><br />   <p>For the past several decades, our country has witnessed an astonishing number of firsts accomplished by American women. Ada Deer laid the foundation for the successes of many modern American women through her political trailblazing and activism.</p> <p>Ada Deer was born August 7, 1935 on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin. From a young age, she looked up to her mother: a strong-willed Anglo-American woman from Philadelphia who learned about Native American cultures while serving as a nurse for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Appalachia and South Dakota before moving to Wisconsin and marrying a Menominee man.</p> <p>Ada’s mother began bringing her to Menominee general council meetings when she was only four years old. “Our mother did her best to expose us to the world,” Deer remembers, and attributes her confidence and convictions to her mother’s influence. “My mother was a fierce crusader for Indian rights,” says Deer.</p> <p>Deer excelled in school and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison on a tribal scholarship. She became the first member of the Menominee Tribe to graduate from the University and the first Native American to earn an MS in Social Work from Columbia University. Ada worked as a social worker in New York City, Minneapolis, and Puerto Rico before landing a position as Community Service Coordinator with the BIA in Minnesota in 1964.</p> <p>Oppressive 1950’s legislation served as a catalyst for Ada to lobby on behalf of the Menominee people. She organized a grassroots movement to help end the Termination Era and restore her tribe’s rights that had been taken away from them in 1954. As a result of this success, she became the first woman to chair the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin.</p> <p>Deer’s political activism continued as she ran for Wisconsin’s secretary of state in 1978 and 1982. In 1992 she nearly became the first American Indian woman elected to the U.S. Congress, losing narrowly to Republican Scott L. Klug. In 1993, President Clinton appointed Deer to serve as Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, heading the BIA. This position allowed her to reform the Bureau and help set federal policy for more than 555 American Indian tribes.</p> <p>Deer also served as chair for the Native American Rights Fund and organized leadership workshops for American Indian women. As an educator, she directed the American Indian Studies Program at UW-Madison and earned recognition by the National Association of Social Workers as a Social Work Pioneer in 2010. She was inducted into the National Native American Hall of Fame in November 2019.</p> <p>Deer recently participated in a UW-Madison initiative to improve the experiences of indigenous students by hosting Native elders on campus for meaningful cultural and educational exchanges. At the age of 84, she continues to be involved in strengthening American Indian communities and education.</p> <p>Learn more about her life and legacy here:<br /> <a href=\"https://womeninwisconsin.org/ada-deer/?fbclid=IwAR3ujEe4eQAOPePsH0EYGwub6Hu__bJAZhuv9oaFdfeYi28Hkomwpt7ppHE\">https://womeninwisconsin.org/ada-deer/</a><br /> <a href=\"https://news.wisc.edu/ada-deer-a-lifetime-of-firsts/?fbclid=IwAR3Cybw6JaCeKBJbR8E1xwsnSjWVmVBhEh_h6AtWhOWtRnMxtOHqwJrzyvo\">https://news.wisc.edu/ada-deer-a-lifetime-of-firsts/</a></p> </div>",

The couple were married in 1881 and owned a ranch near Glenwood Springs, Colorado where they raised horses and cattle. Both of their children were born on the ranch but soon died of scarlet fever. In 1906, after hearing rumors of gold strikes in Alaska, Arthur and Sadie decided to sell their belongings, rent out their ranch, and move north for a new life along the Yukon River.</p> <p>By 1907 the Reynolds had reached Alaska and were on their way by steamboat to the tiny outpost of Nation City near the mouth of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yuch/learn/historyculture/steam-donkey.htm\">Fourth of July Creek</a>. For the next ten years, the couple worked a mining claim far up the creek, thawing frozen ground using a boiler and fires, digging ditches to deliver water to the camp, and processing gold-rich gravel with a device called a rocker. They periodically left the daily grind of mining to visit Seattle or to travel northern rivers in a steamboat Arthur Reynolds built around 1914 and learned to captain (this is where he got his nickname \"Cap\").

            "bodyText": "<p>Theodore Parker rose to fame as a controversial, even heretical, Unitarian minister. Later, his militant opposition to slavery demonstrated that the arc of the moral universe could bend through force of will.</p> <p>Theodore Parker recognized the legacy and responsibility of the American Revolution from an early age. His grandfather, Captain John Parker, led the Lexington militia on April 19, 1775, the day the Revolutionary War began.<sup>1</sup> The youngest of eleven siblings, Parker grew up humbly on a farm in Lexington.<sup>2</sup> Incredibly intelligent, he largely educated himself. He could not afford to attend Harvard, so he earned his degree by teaching himself the material and only traveling to campus for exams.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>After saving some money by working as a schoolteacher, Parker continued his studies at Harvard Divinity School. He met Lydia Cabot, a young woman from a wealthy, influential family, during his time as a teacher.<sup>4</sup> Their desire to marry led Parker to settle for a pulpit in the Boston suburb of West Roxbury--not his dream position, but one that provided enough financial stability to wed. Their relationship quickly deteriorated, however, as their strong personalities clashed and they discovered they could not conceive children.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>The beginning of Parker's pastoral career coincided with the Transcendentalist controversy of the 1830s, in which Ralph Waldo Emerson and other thinkers explored a nature-based Christianity. Parker took interest as the Transcendentalists cast doubt upon the divinity of Jesus Christ and whether New Testament miracles truly happened.<sup>6</sup> He began incorporating Transcendentalist ideas into his sermons, though he tried not to scare away his flock: \"I preach abundant heresies,\" he wrote, \"and they all go down—for the listeners do not know how heretical they are.\"<sup>7</sup> In 1841, he brought his beliefs out into the open with a sermon titled, \"The Transient and Permanent in Christianity.\" The sermon represented a complete break with Unitarian orthodoxy and established Parker's reputation as a heretic.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>As Parker's theological infamy grew, so did his interest in social reform causes, such as women's rights, temperance, and the abolition of slavery. In one 1853 sermon, Parker argued that, if humanity followed the laws of nature:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Woman has the same individual right to determine her aim in life, and to follow it; has the same individual rights of body and of spirit,--of mind and conscience, and heart and soul; the same physical rights, the same intellectual, moral, affectional and religious rights, that man has.</em></p> <p>He argued that women should be allowed to vote, and to become doctors, lawyers, and ministers.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>Parker wanted to end slavery, though, like many White abolitionists, he maintained White supremacist beliefs and questioned the possibility of racial equality.<sup>10</sup> His anti-slavery work intensified with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the subsequent creation of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">third Boston Vigilance Committee</a>.<sup>11</sup> Within the organization, Parker served as chairman of the Executive Committee, delivered speeches, and drafted posters.<sup>12</sup> He defended <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">William and Ellen Craft</a> from slavecatchers and argued so strongly against the rendition of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a> that he faced charges of inciting a riot.<sup>13</sup></p> <p>As the debate of slavery intensified through the 1850s, some abolitionists, including Parker, accepted violent tactics and carried weapons.<sup>14</sup> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a>, already famous for killing pro-slavery extremists in the contested Kansas Territory, turned his efforts eastward and planned an uprising in Virginia. Theodore Parker became part of the Secret Six--a group of wealthy benefactors who supplied Brown with money and supplies.<sup>15</sup></p> <p>Parker's health deteriorated as the Secret Six worked to support Brown. He suffered from tuberculosis, the same disease that had caused many premature deaths in his family.<sup>16</sup> Following the conventional wisdom of the era, Parker traveled to another climate in the hope of healing his lungs. In the spring of 1859, Parker and his wife ventured first to the Caribbean and then to Europe. He learned of Brown's failed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/john-browns-raid.htm\">Harpers Ferry raid</a> and impending execution that autumn. Parker wholeheartedly defended Brown's actions in one of his final public statements:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Brown will die, I think, like a martyr, and also like a saint. His noble demeanor, his unflinching bravery, his gentleness, his calm, religious trust in God, and his words of truth and soberness, cannot fail to make a profound impression on the hearts of Northern men; yes, and on Southern men. For 'every human heart is human,' &c. I do not think the money wasted, nor the lives thrown away. Many acorns must be sown to have one come up; even then, the plant grows slow; but it is an Oak at last.</em><sup>17</sup></p> <p>Theodore Parker died in Florence on May 10, 1860, at just 49 years of age.<sup>18</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Paul E.

The 1880 and 1900 censuses verify his literacy.<br /> <br /> Per his testimony, Gideon stated that he had a wife and three children and that for a two-month period the family moved temporarily to “take care of crop” and he had to attend to a “bad fence”.<br /> <br /> The witnesses were Frank W. Hall, James M. Hunsucker, Standford Hunsucker, and Robert Watson. Mr. Watson stated that in the winter of 1879, Gideon had a “log house with two rooms and other outbuildings and about 16 acres of land cleared and in cultivation.” He cultivated crops over “5 seasons”.<br /> <br /> Gideon H. Murphy was born July 27, 1846 in Sevier County, Arkansas to Gideon “Gid” and Delilah Murphy who had five other children, (Lively “Comely” Murphy-Turrentine born February 4, 1839 in Sevier County, Arkansas and died May 22, 1916 in Sevier County, Arkansas; Ellen Murphy-Polk born May 12 1842 in Sevier County, Arkansas and died February 11, 1918 in Howard County, Arkansas; Daniel W.

Murphy, son of Cassandra Harpole and J.W. Murphy. Cassandra was the daughter of Captain John Harpole of Wilson County, Tennessee. Captain Harpole acquired land in southwest Arkansas territory circa 1817. He along with his wife Sarah and his daughters Mary Polly Harpole-Carr; Sarah Harpole-Props; Nancy Harpole-Hill; Margaret Harpole-Crabtree along with their children and the following enslaved individuals moved from Wilson County, TN to Hempstead County, Arkansas territory circa 1818; Rueben, Lively, Sarah, Nancy, Winnie, Ben, Mary, Dolly, Minty, Gid (father of Gideon H. Murphy), Hardy, and Matilda.<br /> <br /> Gideon H. Murphy along with his mother and siblings are listed on the Freedmen’s Bureau records for the Paraclifta office (Sevier County, Arkansas) in 1865 having received rations. He is also documented on the Freedmen’s Bank Records dated June 26, 1873, occupation: photographer.</p> <p>Per the 1880 Sevier County, Arkansas census, Gideon is enumerated with his wife Allice and their four-month-old daughter Mereda. He is living next to his brother Dan Murphy and their mother Delilah and sister Arabella. <br /> <br /> <strong>~ Contributed by Lyle Gibson, descendant</strong><br /> <img alt=\"A man sits in a black shirt and with crossed arms at his computer and recording gear on the desk behind him.

Murphy. Mariah was born circa 1838 in Arkansas and died 1911 in Howard County, Arkansas. Mariah was married to Reuben Harpole. Mariah helped to raise many of her nieces and nephews and her two younger siblings, hence the nickname “Big Sis”. Mariah’s siblings were; Gideon Harpole Murphy born circa 1816 TN; Hardy Harpole Murphy born 1817 in TN and died 1885 in Sevier County, AR; Winnie Harpole born circa 1817 in TN; Angeline Harpole-Booker born circa 1836 in AR; Tilman Patterson Harpole born January 6, 1842 in Lafayette County, AR and died April 11, 1916 in Kansas City, MO; and Catherine Kate Harpole-Burrell born March 1844 in Lafayette County, AR and died March 10, 1927 in Lafayette County, AR. DNA technology is bridging the gap of history and slavery as descendants of Winnie Harpole, Angeline Harpole-Booker, Tilman P. Harpole, and Kate Harpole-Burrell share DNA matches helping to reconstruct the family tree. <br /> <br /> <strong>About the contributor</strong>: Lyle Gibson is the 1st cousin five times removed of Gideon H.

Jesse married Hulda Minthorn in 1870, and had three children: Theodore, Herbert, and Mary.</p> <p>Jesse built a Blacksmith Shop at the corner of Downey and Penn streets in 1871. He was one of three blacksmiths in a town of 500. West Branch was a farming community, and many of its residents had horses, buggies, and wagons that needed repair. In 1877, Jesse advertised in the West Branch Local Record: \"Horse shoeing and plow work a specialty. Also dealer in all kinds of pumps. Prices to suit the times.\"</p> <p>In 1878, Jesse sold the Blacksmith Shop and started a new farm implement business on the corner of Downey and Main streets. The new shop was the first in town to manufacture barbed wire. He sold plows, harrows, and other farm equipment, as well as buggies and sewing machines. Jesse almost always included a joke of some kind in his advertisements, highlighting his jovial nature and good humor. </p> <p>On December 13, 1880, Jesse Hoover died of heart failure brought on by pneumonia.

            "bodyText": "Known as the \"Shoemaker Philanthropist,\"<sup>1</sup> John Augustus dedicated his life to prison reform, the temperance movement, and anti-slavery causes.<br /> <br /> Born around 1785 in Medford, Massachusetts,<sup>2</sup> John Augustus left few records about his early life. In a letter written by abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/theodore-parker.htm\">Theodore Parker</a> to one of his churchwardens, Parker described Augustus as \"the illegitimate son of somebody.\" Parker also wrote that Augustus married one of Parker’s cousins, \"but they married before I was born.\"<sup>3</sup> Sometime between birth and adulthood, Augustus moved to Lexington, Massachusetts, where he established his career as a shoemaker.<sup>4</sup> By 1830, he moved his family and business to Boston.<sup>5</sup><br /> <br /> Few documents exist to clarify when or what drew Augustus to the abolitionist cause. An article in <em>The Liberator</em> confirms Augustus served in the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in 1839,<sup>6</sup> and records show he donated money at the New England Anti-Slavery Convention in June 1841.<sup>7</sup><br /> <br /> However, Augustus did leave behind a published record of his prisoner reform efforts titled, <em>A Report of the Labors of John Augustus: For the Last Ten Years, in Aid of the Unfortunate: Containing a Description of His Method of Operations; Striking Incidents, and Observations Upon the Improvement of Some of Our City Institutions, with a View to the Benefit of the Prisoners and of Society</em>.<br /> <br /> According to his own writing, Augustus began paying bail for prisoners in August 1841 after speaking with a \"drunkard\" in the police court. He believed the man could reform his ways if given the chance.<sup>8</sup> His views on temperance influenced his belief in helping these individuals as he wrote, \"to liberate the wretched inebriate from the prison of his own destructive vice... by removing from him the pernicious influences by which he had been surrounded.\"<sup>9</sup><br /> <br /> Augustus used his own money to cover these bails and did not accept funds from any person or organization. He wrote, \"I am therefore not accountable to any sect, society, or individual for the manner in which my efforts have been applied.\"<sup>10</sup><br /> <br /> Despite giving up his business in 1846,<sup>11</sup> Augustus remained a well-known shoemaker. Two years later, a book about shoemakers titled <em>A Wreath for St. Crispin: Being Sketches of Eminent Shoemakers</em> included a biography on Augustus and featured an inscription for him. The book includes a poem extract about Augustus delivered before the Boston Mechanics' Apprentices' Association by a J. M. W. Yerrington who wrote, \"But one there lives in humbler life obscure, Who still moves on, the solace of the poor...Who sees in man, whate'er his stains may be, A brother hastening to eternity.\"<sup>12</sup><br /> <br /> After leaving his trade, Augustus continued with his reform work and other social justice causes. He supported anti-capital punishment efforts by attending meetings.<sup>13</sup> According to the membership roster in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/austin-bearse.htm\">Austin Bearse</a>'s <em>Reminiscences of the Fugitive Slave Law Days in Boston</em>, Augustus participated as a member of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">1850 Boston Vigilance Committee</a> as well.<sup>14</sup><br /> <br /> Though few records exist to describe Augustus' work on the Vigilance Committee, his prisoner reform records are well documented. By January 1852, Augustus had posted bail for \"eleven hundred persons, both male and female, and only one of them has ever forfeited the bonds.\"<sup>15</sup><br /> <br /> Augustus died on June 21, 1859 and is buried in the Old Burying Ground in Lexington.<sup>16</sup><br /> <br /> Shortly after Augustus' death, Theodore Parker wrote: <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">His death is a public loss...All the members of the United States supreme court might die next month, and the president of the United States follow suit, and half the governors of the Union, — and unitedly they would not be so great a loss as poor old John Augustus. The fair record of his life...would be one of the most extraordinary and instructive pieces of biography ever written.<sup>17</sup></div> <br /> In another letter, Parker once again referenced Augustus: \"Though he held no public office, sat on no platform of honor in public meetings, nor ever shared a civic feast, he yet did more service, I think, to Boston, than all her Mayors for thirty years.\"<sup>18</sup> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li><em>The Liberator</em>, June 15, 1849, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/\">Newspapers.com</a>.</li> <li>\"Massachusetts, U.S., Death Records, 1841-1915,\" digital image s.v. \"John Augustus,\" <a href=\"https://ancestrylibrary.proquest.com/aleweb/ale/do/login\">AncestryLibrary.com</a>.</li> <li>Theodore Parker to Mr. Manley, August 4, 1859, in <em>Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker, Minister of the 28th Congregational Society, Boston</em>, ed.

            "bodyText": "<p>According to most records, Samuel Lindsey’s birth year was around 1862 in Tennessee. Very little about his life is known before his marriage to Nellie DeLoach (daughter of Berry DeLoach or Loach and Emma Campbell) on January 13, 1886 in Jefferson County, Arkansas.<br /> <br /> The Lindseys settled in Section 7, Spring Township of Jefferson County, Arkansas in 1898 or 1899 but filed his Homestead Application #24401 for 52.02 acres on November 19,1900, at the Land Office at Little Rock, Arkansas.<br /> <br /> Over the course of the next six years the Lindseys cleared the timbered plot for about 10 acres of crops and built a three-room house, out house, and fences worth roughly $150. Proof witnesses all mention the family settled and stayed on the land including their children Berry (b. about 1891), John (b. about 1894), Divernia (b. 13 Jan 1865), Maud (b. about 1896), Levi (b. 11 Nov 1899), and Emma (b. 1904). They were later joined by Revida (b. 26 Dec 1906) and Minerva (b. in 1910). Nellie is noted as having had 15 children in the 1910 Census but at that time only these eight were living.<br /> <br /> Samuel formally prove up on the land at the county clerk’s office in Jefferson County on September 6, 1906 and signed the paperwork in his own hand. Close neighbors William Henry Barnes, James G. Mayers, JH Summers, and David Walters were named as witnesses in the announcement for the proceedings, but interviews only exist for Barnes and Mayers.<br /> <br /> The patent #119925 was officially signed on October 15, 1906. Unfortunately, the land was mortgaged by the time of the 1900 Census and multiple mortgages and deeds of trust are on file over the next several years until it becomes clear that Nellie Lindsey is independently controlling the land and appears in chancery court versus lienholders. The last of the land was lost through court proceedings in July of 1920.<br /> <br /> Samuel died sometime in 1919. Nellie died on August 26, 1938, in Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, Arkansas. Nellie is buried at St Luke’s AME Cemetery in Pine Bluff.<br /> <br /> ~ Contributed by Jessica Trotter<br /> <br /> Jessica Trotter is the 2<sup>nd</sup> great granddaughter of Samuel Lindsey through his daughter Divernia (Lindsey) Walters.

Death instantly transformed Attucks from an anonymous sailor into a martyr for a burgeoning revolutionary cause.</p> <p>The life of Crispus Attucks is far less documented than his death. Early coverage and investigations into the details of the Massacre refer to Attucks as Michael Johnson,<sup>2</sup> a name he may have used as an intentional alias. After uncovering his actual name, newspapers published a few details about his life, notably his profession, a sailor; his birth in Framingham, Massachusetts; his current residence of New Providence in the Bahamas; and his ship's destination of North Carolina.<sup>3</sup> His last name, \"Attucks,\" is of Indigenous origin, deriving from the Natick word for \"deer.\"<sup>4</sup> Witness testimony during the Massacre trial interchangeably used \"mulatto\" or \"Indian\" to describe Attucks, indicating his mixed African and Indigenous birth.<sup>5</sup> His first name reflects the trend in the colonial era of enslavers forcing an Ancient Roman name onto their enslaved people.<sup>6</sup> Attucks shares the name \"Crispus\" with the son of Emperor Constantine.<sup>7</sup> He also appears in a 1750 advertisement in the <em>Boston Gazette</em>. William Brown of Framingham placed an advertisement to call for the return of a twenty-seven year old escaped enslaved man named \"Crispas,\" described as a six foot two inch \"mulatto.\"<sup>8</sup> Contemporary sources at the time of his death do not identify Attucks as enslaved or formerly enslaved. How and when he gained his freedom is unknown, but it is possible that Attucks used the name Michael Johnson to protect himself from a return to slavery.</p> <p>On March 5, 1770, witnesses placed Attucks at the head of a group of sailors brandishing clubs and marching toward King Street. A crowd formed around a small group of British soldiers, hurling snowballs, ice balls, and insults at the men. Observers noted Attucks leaned his tall frame on his cordwood club.<sup>9</sup> Amid the chaos, Private Montgomery and the rest of the soldiers fired into the crowd. Two musket balls ripped through Attucks chest, killing him instantly.<sup>10</sup> In the following days, the people of Boston held a funeral procession for the victims of the massacre. Because Attucks and fellow victim and sailor James Caldwell had no family or home in Boston, their bodies lay in state at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/faneuil-hall.htm\">Faneuil Hall</a>.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>Defending the soldiers in the subsequent trial, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/john-adams-1735-1826.htm\">John Adams</a> painted Attucks and the rest of those killed as aggressors to justify the killing. He played to the jury's prejudices about race and class, describing those in the crowd as \"a motley rabble of saucy boys, Negroes, and mulattos, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tars.\"<sup>12</sup> In other words, those in the crowd were young, lower-class, Black, Irish, or sailors from out of town. Adams' argument led to an acquittal for the Captain and all but two of the soldiers.</p> <p>Town officials buried the victims of the Massacre in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/granary-burying-ground.htm\">Granary Burying Ground</a>. Today, they share a headstone facing toward Tremont Street.</p> <p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, abolitionists in Boston, led by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-cooper-nell.htm\">William Cooper Nell</a>, held up the death of Attucks as the first martyr of the American Revolution. Nell’s seminal work, <em>The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution</em>, fought the erasure of Black people from the story of the American Revolution. Nell led this work with the story of Crispus Attucks, highlighting his death as the first in the cause for liberty.<sup>13</sup> Though Black Bostonians have commemorated the anniversary of Attucks' death since at least the 1850s,<sup>14</sup> it took until the early twentieth century when activists, including William Monroe Trotter, pushed the city of Boston to officially recognize March 5 as Crispus Attucks Day,<sup>15</sup> a tradition which continues to the present day.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.revolutionaryspaces.org/exhibits/reflecting-attucks/\">Revolutionary Spaces - Reflecting Attucks Virtual Exhibit</a></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"Boston March 12,\" <em>Pennsylvania Gazette</em>, March 22, 1770, 2.</li> <li>\"Mortuary Notice,\" <em>The Boston News-Letter</em>, March 15, 1770.</li> <li>\"Boston March 12\" <em>Pennsylvania Gazette</em>, March 22, 1770, 2.</li> <li>James Hammond Trumbull, \"Natick Dictionary\" (United States: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1903), 243.</li> <li>William Weems, John Adams, Frederic Kidder, <em>History of the Boston Massacre, March 5, 1770: Consisting of the Narrative of the Town, the Trial of the Soldiers: and a Historical Introduction, Containing Unpublished Documents of John Adams, and Explanatory Notes</em> (United States: J.

            "bodyText": "<p>Mary King Longfellow was the first of five children born to Elizabeth Clapp Porter Longfellow and Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, a brother of the poet <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-king-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, on 6 October 1852 at the family’s farm Highfield in Westbrook, Maine. Named after her mother’s sister, Mary King Porter, she was known to family and friends as “Mamie.” She enjoyed drawing and took up watercolor at an early age.</p> <p>Her family encouraged her artwork and Longfellow pursued lessons. She studied at the Museum of Fine Arts School of Drawing and Painting in 1878, and in 1884 to 1889 took watercolor lessons with Ross Sterling Turner, a Boston painter of the American Impressionist movement. Likely influenced by her instructor, Longfellow’s artwork reflected the principles of two fashionable art movements of the late nineteenth-century, Impressionism and Realism. As a result, she focused on watercolor as a medium and often painted in <em>plein air</em>. Moreover, her primary subjects, the landscape and seascape of coastal Maine were captured moments on paper depicting the world around her in a realistic and seemingly objective manner. Longfellow was active in the art community, both in Boston and Portland (the Portland Sketch Club), and her artwork was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, Boston Art Club, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Academy, and the Portland Society of Art. Although she did not paint for a living, her occupation in the Portland City directory after 1903 is listed as “Artist.” In a 1981 exhibit of <em>Women Pioneers in Maine Art</em>, the Joan Whitney Payson Gallery declared Longfellow “stands as Portland’s best known [nineteenth-century] female painter.”</p> <p>In addition to her career as an artist, Longfellow had a variety of interests, such as photography, sailing, shooting, sewing, writing and collecting poetry, travel and theatre, throughout her life. Longfellow photographed social gatherings, sailing excursions, and staged portraits, and often printed her own film.</p> <p>Among Longfellow’s many interests, traveling was a highlight. She made several extended trips to Europe as well as trips to Mexico and the southeastern United States. Each excursion is documented through diary entries, sketches and watercolors. On her first journey to Europe in 1876, Longfellow was accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/ernest-longfellow.htm\">Ernest Wadsworth Longfellow</a> and his wife Harriet Spelman Longfellow, both artists.</p> <p>Never married, Longfellow remained close to her family and friends. She lived in the family home in Portland at 37 South Street until 1908 when she acquired her first home at 116 State Street. She took up residence on 8 June 1908 and lived there until her death in 1945.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/archives.htm#MKL\">Mary King Longfellow Papers</a> are held in the archives of Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters NHs.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A self-educated economist and inventor, Edward Atkinson dedicated his life to various social and political movements, including abolitionism and anti-imperialism.</p> <p>Born on February 10, 1827, Edward Atkinson grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts with his five siblings. His father, Amos Atkinson, previously served as a lieutenant in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and later became a merchant.<sup>1</sup> As a young boy, Edward Atkinson attended private schools in both Brookline and Boston. He planned to attend Harvard College at the age of sixteen, but his father’s financial difficulties prevented him from enrolling. Instead, Edward Atkinson started working at Read and Chadwick, a dry-goods store in Boston. Here, he gained important business and accounting skills that helped him quickly advance in his career. In the 1850s, Atkinson became treasurer for J.C. Howe and Company, a group that operated cotton mills around New England.<sup>2</sup> In 1855, Atkinson married Mary Caroline Heath. The couple had nine children, though two sadly died in infancy.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the subsequent decades, Atkinson’s broad interests led him to pursue business ventures in other industries. When his cotton mills began to fail in the mid-1870s, he entered the railroad industry. Later in the decade, Atkinson became an insurance broker and worked as president of Boston Manufactures Mutual Insurance Company.<sup>4</sup> According to census records, he held this position until his death.<sup>5</sup> He also gained an interest in home economics, and in 1888, invented the Aladdin Oven, a slow-cooking oven created to help lower the cost of cooking food for working class families.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Although he did not receive a formal college education, Atkinson became a keen pamphleteer. His practical business experience and thirst for knowledge inspired him to write on a variety of topics, including economics, nutrition, imperialism, and slavery.<sup>7</sup> According to an article by abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-w-higginson.htm\">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a>, Atkinson had a “power of accumulating knowledge,” as well as a gift when writing to his specific audiences, stating: “He talks as a miner to miners, a farmer to farmers, a cook to cooks...”<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Despite his ties to the cotton industry, Atkinson considered himself an abolitionist. In his 1861 pamphlet titled <em>Cheap Cotton by Free Labor</em>, Atkinson emphasized the need for the “utter destruction of slavery” and argued its potential economic benefits on the cotton industry.<sup>9</sup> Austin Bearse’s <em>Reminiscences of the Fugitive Slave Law Days in Boston </em>lists Atkinson as a member of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">1850 Boston Vigilance Committee</a>.<sup>10</sup> Atkinson made several donations to help the committee’s efforts in aiding freedom seekers.<sup>11</sup> He also donated money to other abolitionists’ causes, and allegedly helped “furnish <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a> and his companions with rifles” for Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>Atkinson remained active in social and political organizations during and after the Civil War. He held the role of secretary of the 1862 Educational Commission, which aimed to provide education to formerly enslaved people in the South.<sup>13</sup> He served on the board of directors for the 1863 Protective War Claim Association for New England, an organization that helped soldiers or sailors, and their families, receive proper benefits for their service during the Civil War.<sup>14</sup> As a member of the Anti-Imperialist League in the late 1890s, Atkinson opposed the American annexation of the Philippines.<sup>15</sup></p> <p>These various roles eventually led to special appointments and honors later in Atkinson’s life. In 1887, President Grover Cleveland nominated him as a Special Commissioner to compile a report on Europe’s practice of bimetallism, the use of two metals for currency.<sup>16</sup> As treasurer and secretary of the Shaw Monument Fund, Atkinson played a key role in raising the funds for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/shaw.htm\">Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial</a> that commemorates one of the first African American regiments of the Civil War.<sup>17</sup></p> <p>Edward Atkinson died on December 11, 1905 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.<sup>18</sup> An obituary in the <em>Evansville Courier and Press</em> described him as ”a self-educated man, with boundless energy and limitless ambition to benefit his fellow man.”<sup>19</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Thomas Wentworth Higginson, “Edward Atkinson,” <em>Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</em> 42, no. 29 (August 1907): 761, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20022288\">https://www.jstor.org/stable/20022288</a>.</li> <li>Massachusetts Historical Society, “Edward Atkinson Papers: Biographical Sketch,” <a href=\"http://www.masshist.org/collection-guides/view/fa0016\">Masshist.org</a>.</li> <li>Ibid.</li> <li>Alden Whitman, ed., <em>American Reformers: An H.W.

            "bodyText": "<p>According to the membership roster in Austin Bearse's <em>Reminiscences of the Fugitive Slave Law Days in Boston,</em> Erastus Andrews participated as a member of the 1850 Boston Vigilance Committee.</p> <p>Bostonians founded this iteration of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Vigilance Committee</a> in response to the passage of the new Fugitive Slave Law. This controversial law empowered enslavers and their agents to capture and return freedom seekers to bondage with the full backing of the federal government. It also mandated the assistance of local and state officials and the public at large. Members of the Vigilance Committee provided funds, shelter, transportation, medical attention, and other assistance to freedom seekers escaping enslavement on the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>Though three men named Erastus Andrews lived in Massachusetts at this time, it seems likely that Reverend Erastus Andrews of Worcester, Massachusetts participated in the Boston Vigilance Committee.<sup>1</sup> Born in Templeton, Massachusetts in 1805, Reverend Erastus Andrews left very few traces of his life in the written record. However his father, Elisha Andrews, served the region as a well-known minister. During the War of 1812, the elder Andrews broke with the Baptist Church and publicly supported the Federalist Party. Opposed to war and a supporter of peace in America, Elisha Andrews suffered for his stance. Seeing his father stand firm in his beliefs may have influenced Erastus to claim his own social justice cause: the abolition of slavery.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>As Erastus Andrews became an adult, his public stance against slavery grew stronger and stronger. In 1838, he joined other Reverends and Ministers in signing a petition that stated:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>the system of SLAVERY, as it exists in the United States, being unjust to men and offensive to God, is sinful--that it out to be abolished with the least possible delay--and that all lawful and proper measures should be employed for its removal.</em><sup>3</sup></p>   <p>Joining the Free Soil Party in the 1850s, Reverend Andrews served in the state legislature, first in the House from 1851 to 1852 and then in the Senate in 1855 for Franklin County.  The Free Soil Party focused its attention on stopping the expansion of slavery into the western territories of the United States. Andrews’ affiliation with the Free Soil Party strengthens the possibility of his active membership in the Boston Vigilance Committee. The Vigilance Committee represented a diverse cross section of radical abolitionists and more moderate antislavery activists, including those of the Free Soil movement.</p> <p>At least one source suggests Andrews opened his home to those seeking freedom from slavery. Writing in \"The Underground Railroad in Massachusetts,” Wilbur H. Siebert states that Montague, Massachusetts “had at least three uncompromising abolitionists ---Kendall Abbott, Joshua Marsh, and the Rev. Erastus Andrews...In aiding fugitives he found it unnecessary to practice secrecy.” Writing in 1895, Reverend Andrews’ son, E. Benjamin Andrews, stated that his father participated as a conductor on the Underground Railroad for 35 years. As Sunderland, Massachusetts is only 20 miles from the Vermont border, he likely helped freedom seekers on their way north.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>After the Civil War, Reverend Andrews continued to preach at various Baptist Churches in Massachusetts and Connecticut. In 1872, the Christian Watchman carried a news item about the Reverend, stating, “His life has been such as to gain not only the love of his people, but the confidence of the whole community.”<sup>5</sup> Reverend Erastus Andrews passed away just one year later on March 29, 1873 and is buried in the North Sunderland Cemetery in Sunderland, Massachusetts.</p> <p>While Reverend Erastus Andrews of Montague, Massachusetts is a promising candidates for the Erastus Andrews listed in Bearse’s Vigilance Committee roster, we cannot yet confirm this member’s story based on evidence uncovered so far.  If you are a researcher or descendent of Erastus Andrews or can provide any further details of a different Erastus Andrews who participated in the Vigilance Committee, please reach out to us at boaf@nps.gov.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>While it is possible that the Erastus Andrews referred to by the Boston Vigilance Committee could be a different individual than profiled here, it is unlikely. One Erastus Andrews lived in Cheshire, Massachusetts and worked as a laborer. The Reverend Erastus Andrews profiled here also has a 15 year old son named Erastus Andrews. While there is an Erasmus Andrews living in Boston in 1850, it is unlikely that his name was altered that many times in multiple publications.</li> <li>William Buell Sprague, <em>Annals of the American Pulpit: Baptist. 1860.</em> (United States: R.

He continued acquiring sections of land until the family ranch encompassed approximately 72,000 acres of Guadalupe Mountains in Texas. like his father, Jr. had an abiding interest in conservation and harbored similar dreams of seeing the Mountains protected in perpetuity. <br /> <br /> J.C. Hunter, Jr., like his father, was a well-respected civic leader. During the early 1970s he was mayor of Abilene, Texas, for six years. Besides being involved in the family oil business, he served on the boards of Hardin-Simmons University, the Baptist Foundation of Texas, the Independent Petroleum Association, Citizens National Bank of Abilene, and the West Texas Utility Company. Similarly, like his father, he was outgoing and generous and enjoyed sharing the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch with friends and associates. <br /> <br /> Jr. followed the lead of his father and expressed interested in creating a park, but after Wallace Pratt donated his land to the NPS, Pratt helped Hunter Jr. decide the fate of the 72,000 acre Guadalupe Mountain Ranch. Hunter could not donate his land like Pratt, who had become wealthy as a petroleum geologist and high ranking employee of Standard Oil. Following in the footsteps of his father, Hunter Jr. continued to operate his Guadalupe Mountain Ranch as a hunting and recreational site, with a few sheep, goats, and cattle. Hunter kept the land healthy through the careful management of elk, turkey, trout, and other animals that his father had introduced. But as he grew older he worried that his death would leave his family with a large piece of property and large taxes, so he began contemplating ways to sell the Ranch. Hunter knew of his father’s pre-World War II discussions with the Park Service and the state of Texas, so sale to the state or federal government for the purpose of creating a park was familiar to him.<br /> <br /> Congress approved the park six years after J.C. Hunter Jr. decided to sell his ranch, and roughly three years after the first Congressional hearing on the Park.<br /> <br /> During the hearings before the House National Parks Committee, Wallace Pratt complimented the Hunters for their conservation of the Mountains. “I want to commend the remarkable wisdom of my neighbor, Mr. J.C. Hunter Jr., and his father before him, whose persistent efforts have brought under one ownership by far the larger part of the area that will constitute Guadalupe Mountains National Park.”</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Claus (\"Carl\") H. Wriborg grew up in Holland in the 1800s. His dad was a ranking officer in the Dutch Navy. Claus was almost totally deaf. Despite the prevailing societal opinions and labels of \"deaf and dumb\" at the time, he was well-educated and learned English. When his dad died, leaving him without any other family, he moved to America.<br /> <br /> He earned a job as a county clerk in Mayville, New York. When the Civil War broke out, Claus wanted to fight for the Union just like many other young men around him. Unfortunately, total deafness was an exemption from military service. Partial deafness was not. The issue at hand for many medical examiners was there were no clear guidelines as to what was partial versus total deafness. Many deaf men, like Claus, just needed to convince one medical examiner that they could hear enough to participate in the war. Despite not being able to hear any officer's order, Claus passed the exam. When it was suggested he work as a military clerk, Claus responded, \"I was a clerk at home; then I was a clerk at Mayville. I can always be a clerk and get a good pay, but I want to be a soldier and fight for the country of my choice. I will not be a clerk here.\"<br /> <br /> At 28 years old, Claus enlisted in Company D, 72nd New York Infantry. This group supported the Defenses of Washington D.C, Manassas, and Fredericksburg. Then, they were ordered to the Pennisula Campaign in Yorktown and Williamsburg. The Battle of Williamsburg is where Claus met his final resting place.<br /> <br /> Claus was both an immigrant and a person with a disability. This made him a target for a lot of teasing and jokes amongst his company. Despite this he remained very patriotic and focused on the Union's goal. His tent mate, 19 year old David B. Parker, eventually befriended Claus. David later wrote about Claus, \"the hero\", in a New York newspaper, <em>Fredonia Censor</em>. <br /> <br /> Claus was seriously wounded in the leg and head at the Battle of Williamsburg. Despite this, David reports, Claus saved many Union soldiers after he was wounded. Claus played dead behind a log and killed five Confederate soldiers who were chasing after his regiment that day. He used his cartridges, then those of a nearby dead soldier, to shoot the men as they ran passed him. When he was carried to a field hospital, he told David, \"I believe I did my duty.\"<br /> <br /> At the field hospital, Claus refused treatment to his bleeding leg until all other men in worse condition were treated. Unfortunately, by the time the surgeon returned, Claus had lost too much blood and died.<br /> <br /> <br /> References:</p> <ol> <li>Barram, R.

His father, Kakusaburo Korematsu, came to the US in 1905 and his mother Kotsui Korematsu, came to California through <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/u-s-immigration-station-angel-island.htm\">Angel Island</a> in 1914. Fred Korematsu was originally named Toyosaburo, but a teacher suggested he go by Fred instead because it’s “easier”. He used this name for the rest of his life. Korematsu lived with his parents and three brothers who all helped out in the family-owned flower nursery.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{413ee831-7be4-43d5-b88c-1b7458ff3e84}{221}\" paraid=\"583681719\">By 1938, Fred Korematsu was a 19-year-old in love. He was in a relationship with Ida Boitano. On <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/perl/index.htm\">December 7th 1941,</a> “all of a sudden, the music stopped and they announced that Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japanese airplanes... At first, I thought it was a dream. People never did recognize us as Americans even though how much we tried to be American... I said to Ida, ‘We better get back home.\" The next day <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hofr/learn/historyculture/fdr-biography.htm\">President Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> declared war on Japan.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{6db78303-8ee9-489e-8436-8d8cf695b1fe}{22}\" paraid=\"1262193470\"><img alt=\"Fred and family in nursery\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|719|510|0|0|0\" height=\"510\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7000436|0|\" src=\"/goga/images/fred-korematsu-family-crop.jpeg\" title=\"Fred T.

Roosevelt declared all immigrants of Japanese descent over the age of fourteen were “alien enemies”. Reports of disloyalty circulated through the media, however there were no examples of sabotage by any Japanese Americans throughout the war. Despite this, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/historyinternment.htm\">Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/index.htm\">Presidio Army Base</a> made plans and justifications for the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/executive-order-9066.htm\">Executive Order 9066</a>, giving full authority to the War Department to carry out DeWitt’s plan. The order itself did not have language based on race, but granted military authority to declare areas “from which any or all persons may be excluded”.   </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{6db78303-8ee9-489e-8436-8d8cf695b1fe}{68}\" paraid=\"866995820\"><strong>Internment </strong></h4> <p paraeid=\"{6db78303-8ee9-489e-8436-8d8cf695b1fe}{74}\" paraid=\"2091997656\">On March 24, 1942 all individuals of Japanese Ancestry were to report to Assembly Centers where they would be held until the permanent camps were finished. The Korematsu family leased their flower nursery before leaving. Fred had other plans. He said, <strong>“I decided to leave… [a]way from the family because there was so much sadness[…] to be pushed into evacuation, threatened with punishment, because you look like the enemy is wrong… I felt that I was an American citizen and I had as much rights as anyone else. I don’t even have ties with Japan nor have I ever been there. To be accused like this, I just thought it wasn’t fair. It was wrong.”  </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{6db78303-8ee9-489e-8436-8d8cf695b1fe}{118}\" paraid=\"1741853894\">Until he could make plans to leave the West Coast, Korematsu decided to stay in the Bay Area. He went so far as to forge his identification to say his name was Clyde Sarah and got a job as a welder. However, on May 30th, an officer stopped Fred and his girlfriend on the street, arresting him on the spot. After a short time in county jail, Korematsu was transferred to the Presidio Stockade. This is where he would have one of the most important meetings of his life. A guard told him he had a visitor and took him to meet a young man in a grey suit: <strong>Ernest Besig</strong>. Besig was an attorney with the <strong>American Civil Liberties Union</strong> (ACLU) and wanted to support Korematsu in fighting his arrest. He warned Korematsu that his chances of winning were slim but that Besig wanted to take the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Korematsu agreed.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6db78303-8ee9-489e-8436-8d8cf695b1fe}{162}\" paraid=\"105274155\">On June 28th, Fred Korematsu was transferred to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/anthropology74/ce16m.htm\">Tanforan Racetrack</a>, a fairground that incarcerated thousands of individuals, including his family. They were reunited but incredibly upset about his arrest and his choice to fight his case. Fred Korematsu received the same response from others in the camp. He felt incredibly lonely and isolated. He tried to keep in contact with Ida, but he never saw her again.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{be4172b7-e08f-4973-b7e6-4e9931ffce18}{37}\" paraid=\"1881020014\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Fred was transported from Tanforan after charges were filed against him for violating the law by “remain[ing] in that portion of Military Area No.1 covered by Civilian Exclusion Order no.34.” Bail was set at $2,500 and Besig paid the bail immediately. Korematsu and Besig began to walk out of the courthouse towards freedom, but they were stopped by the Military Police (MP). The judge then nullified his right to bail. Once back at the Presidio, Fred Korematsu was taken back to Tanforan.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6db78303-8ee9-489e-8436-8d8cf695b1fe}{241}\" paraid=\"879885122\"><img alt=\"Topaz,Utah\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|1179|944|0|0|0\" height=\"944\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7000442|0|\" src=\"/goga/images/lossy-page1-1200px-Topaz-_Utah_1.jpg\" title=\"Topaz,Utah\" width=\"1179\" /><br /> <sub>In September 1942, Fred Korematsu and his family were transferred to a concentration camp at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/central-utah-relocation-center-site.htm\">Topaz, Utah</a>. “It's terribly dusty here the top soil here is like flour. Just a little wind and the dust rises like fog all over... You can’t see ten feet in front of you.” Panoramic view of Central Utah Relocation Center, 1943. <em>Courtesy of the National Archives and Records Administration </em></sub></p> <h4 paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{18}\" paraid=\"129566258\"><strong>Korematsu vs. The United States </strong></h4> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{24}\" paraid=\"169599990\">Starting in October of 1942, people could apply for leave from the camps if they had evidence of employment and stayed away from the West Coast. A loyalty questionnaire created a more efficient process. The questions centered around loyalty to the United States to which Korematsu answered YES to these questions. By January 1944, Korematsu’s application for indefinite leave from Topaz was approved. By October he had settled in Detroit with his brothers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{48}\" paraid=\"138588099\">Meanwhile the Korematsu court case had made its way through the legal system. With every guilty decision made, Korematsu’s lawyers always appealed until his case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had already heard cases brought by <strong>Gordon Hirabayashi</strong> and <strong>Minoru Yasui</strong> in which they upheld DeWitt’s curfew order. <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-korematsu-v-us\">Korematsu vs. The United States</a> argued that the incarceration of Japanese Americans was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court heard arguments for the Korematsu case on October 11th, 1944. The court also heard arguments for another case that day, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep323283/\">Ex Parte Endo</a>. This case was put forward by <strong>Mitsuye Endo</strong>. She petitioned for habeas corpus: the right of a person under arrest to be brought before a judge to determine if their detention is lawful. By the time the court heard her case she had been confined for three years.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{98}\" paraid=\"789050586\">The Supreme Court gave a ruling for both cases on December 18th, 1944. The court affirmed Korematsu’s conviction and upheld the removal orders. The majority opinion refused to address the racism in the case. However, the Court ruled unanimously in favor of Endo, stating that once a citizen’s loyalty had been established they could no longer be detained. On December 17th, 1944, one day before the court's decisions, the War Department announced that Japanese Americans who had proved their loyalty were allowed to leave the camps in the new year. The Supreme Court had managed to avoid truly addressing the issue, but their silence on the matter spoke volumes. Korematsu said of the decision,<strong> “I received a letter from Mr. Besig and he told me that we lost in the Supreme Court. And I just could not believe it… When I found out that I lost my decision, I thought I lost my country.”  </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{122}\" paraid=\"605908381\">The West Coast reopened to Japanese Americans in December of 1944. Fred Korematsu’s brothers moved back to Oakland to reopen the nursery. The place was in shambles, the green house full of broken windows. Kakusaburo and Kotsui Korematsu left Topaz to join them in May 1945, they had been in camp for over three years. Fred stayed in Detroit where he met his wife, Kathryn Pearson. Time in the camp had taken a toll on his mother. Fred and his wife moved to California to be close to her and raised two children. His children did not learn of Korematsu’s case until they studied it in high school, because Korematsu did not share much. Even though he would have liked to fight his conviction, he decided to move on with his life.  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{158}\" paraid=\"1331258357\"><strong>Supreme Court Appeal </strong></h4> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{166}\" paraid=\"224047376\">In December 1981, Fred Korematsu received a phone call from Peter Irons who was a professor, lawyer, and was writing a book on WWII Supreme Court cases. He had found information that he knew Fred needed to see. When looking through the Korematsu case information at the Department of Justice, Irons had found concrete evidence that the government had falsified the information they shared with the Supreme Court.  When Peter Irons made Korematsu aware of how his case was mishandled, Korematsu asked him to reopen the case. Irons contacted <strong>Dale Minami</strong>, a Japanese American lawyer in the Bay Area, to represent Fred. In the hopes of preventing Korematsu from addressing his conviction, the government offered him a pardon. Korematsu responded: <strong>“I don’t want a pardon. If anything, I should be pardoning the government.”</strong>  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{198}\" paraid=\"721437978\">Forty years earlier, Fred Korematsu fought his conviction without the support of his community. When reopening his case, his community stood firmly in support of him. On November 10th, 1983, Korematsu and his team had their day in court in San Francisco with United States District Court Judge Marilyn Patel. Fred Korematsu stood before the bench and a filled courtroom. Understanding the significance of the case, Judge Patel delivered her verdict from the bench. Patel stated, “[t]he conviction that was handed down in this court and affirmed by the Supreme Court in Korematsu v. United States is… vacated and the underlying indictment dismissed.” Korematsu and his team had achieved their goal in clearing Korematsu’s federal record, and the courtroom erupted in celebration.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{216}\" paraid=\"78963711\">However, Fred understood there was more work to be done. He said, <strong>“Having this conviction cleared, I am very happy. But...I would like to have it completely cleared from the record and that this will never happen again to any American citizen.”  </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{1291a161-8bdf-4346-bebd-d5f71719cd30}{157}\" paraid=\"1966212325\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Only the Supreme Court could overturn their previous decision and to this day that decision stands. Fred Korematsu continued to fight for the civil rights of all Americans. He lobbied in Congress to pass the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/442\">Civil Liberties Act of 1988</a>. This act gave a public apology and compensation to Japanese Americans who were incarcerated. In 1998, Korematsu was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Fred Korematsu passed away on March 30th, 2005 at the age of 86. January 30th, his birthday, is now Fred Korematsu Day in the state of California. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{241}\" paraid=\"896576687\">  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdb145e6-a4a6-4016-ab61-c3d604f05e30}{247}\" paraid=\"1949753992\"><strong>Citation: </strong><br /> Bannai, Lorraine K. ENDURING CONVICTION : Fred Korematsu and His Quest for Justice. Seattle and London, University Of Washington Press, 2015. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b0c4dd25-7dfd-4504-86e9-ffb55818e10c}{12}\" paraid=\"738692707\"> <br />  </p>",

            "bodyText": "The fight for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/introduction-women-s-suffrage.htm\">women’s suffrage</a> in the United States was a long one, and even though it culminated in August of 1920 with the ratification of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">19th Amendment</a> by Tennessee, the efforts of Mabel Lloyd Ridgely meant that it was almost Delaware, not Tennessee, that cast the deciding vote in favor of extending the vote to women across the nation.<br /> <br /> Born Mabel Lloyd Fisher in Washington DC on April 13, 1872, her family had a long history of involvement in Delaware and national politics. In 1893 she married the judge Henry Ridgely, changing her name to Mabel Lloyd Ridgely. Together they had a daughter, Phillipa Lloyd Ridgely.<br /> <br /> Ridgely was active in the political and organizing spheres by the first years of the 1900s. During the First World War she chaired the Delaware chapter of the Woman’s Liberty Loan Committee, helping to fund the American war effort. By 1919 she was the president of the Delaware Equal Suffrage Association, a fateful year as it was then that the United States Congress passed the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, granting women the right to vote across the country.<br /> <br /> However, just because the Amendment was passed by both houses of Congress, that did not mean it went into effect. Being a constitutional Amendment, to become official law, it had to be ratified by three quarters of the states. This meant that out of the then 48 states of the country, 36 of their state legislatures would have to vote “yes” before the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment became law. The political struggle saw both pro- and anti-women’s suffrage forces mobilized across the country. Nevertheless, by the end of 1919, 22 states had ratified the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, and tensions began to grow in those states that had yet to vote.<br /> <br /> In Delaware, Ridgely worked tirelessly with other organizers and activists to convince the state legislature to vote “yes”. By tying the patriotism demonstrated by American women during the First World War, such as highlighting funding efforts already discussed and service within the armed forces in auxiliary organizations, as well as arguments based on equality and freedom, Ridgely and others were making progress within Delaware. Their efforts did not go unopposed however, and many of the most prominent opponents of women’s suffrage were female themselves.<br /> <br /> As the date for the vote neared, both sides held large and numerous rallies in the capital of Dover. Working with one of the founders of the National Women’s Party, Florence Bayard Hilles, Ridgely strove to convince as many powerful and influential politicians as she could to ratify the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment. She and her allies even went so far as to bring Eamon DeValera, the leader of the newly independent Irish Free State, to Dover to argue in favor of women’s suffrage to the large immigrant Irish community in the city. In a somewhat less considered move, they temporarily kidnapped the chairman of a Delaware House Committee to stop him from casting a “no” vote.<br /> <br /> Despite their efforts, and even though the Delaware senate had voted in favor just a few weeks before, on June 5<sup>th</sup> of 1920 the Delaware house adjourned without voting on ratification, leaving the issue effectively defeated in the state. Though the First State had the opportunity to be the final state needed to extend the franchise to women across the country, that honor would instead go to Tennessee, which voted to ratify the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment that August, becoming the 36<sup>th</sup> and thus last state needed to make enact it as law.<br /> <br /> Ridgely continued to serve in the public spotlight for much of the rest of her life. After the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment was ratified Ridgely served as the first president of the Delaware League of Women Voters. Her lifelong passion for historical conservation led to her also serving as president of the Public Archives Commission in Delaware, where she oversaw the preservation both the Old State House and the John Dickinson Plantation, as well as founding the Delaware State Archives. Old Dover Days, an annual festival celebrating Dover and Delaware history that is still celebrated today was founded by Ridgely, and she authored a book about her husband’s ancestors in colonial era Delaware.<br /> <br /> Ridgely died at the age of 89 in 1962, leaving a legacy in both Delaware and national history. Her impact continues to be felt through the organizations she directed, the historical resources she preserved, and the movement she helped to lead. <hr /> <h4>Reflection Questions</h4> <ol> <li>What do you think of Mabel Lloyd Ridgely’s efforts to push for women’s suffrage?

Seven years later, the Marshes received their Homestead Patent Certificate # 2093 on May 10, 1875.<br /> <br /> George W. Marsh was born about 1834 in Virginia. It is not determined yet where in Virginia, but his birthplace is considered close to Jefferson County, Virginia, now West Virginia. It is thought that Marsh was born enslaved, but his descendants do not know when he became free except for when he married, and left Virginia (now West Virginia).<br /> <br /> Per the family bible, Marsh married Mary Catherine Goens/Goings, the daughter of Lawson and Sarah (Hart). Mary was born free in Jefferson County, Virginia, in 1840. They were married on June 19th, 1863, the day before Jefferson County, Virginia became West Virginia on the 20<sup>th</sup> of June. George and Mary had their first child, Nancy “Ardella”, born in Jefferson Co, West Virginia in 1864.<br /> <br /> Right after the Civil War the Marshes left West Virginia and headed east. So far there isn't any indication that they received services from any Freedmen’s Bureau. Their first stop was when their second daughter Sara was born (1867) in Morrow County, Ohio. They only stayed in Ohio for about two years. The rest of the children; Cora, Jesse, Hattie, Clara, Mathew, John K, George Jr., Warren and Frank, were all born in Michigan. <br /> <br /> The Marshes left Morrow County, Ohio, and applied to homestead 160 acres in Manistee Co. Michigan in 1868.  On the trail to Michigan, the Marsh’s met Leonard Reed and family (race noted as white) who were also on the trail to Manistee, Michigan. The Reed family was coming from New York and already laid claim to 160 acres. George and Mary homesteaded next door to the Reed’s. The families remain friends today.<br /> <br /> Homestead records show that George and Mary, along with their six children at the time, made settlement on May 1, 1868. Claimant and witness testimony state the Marshes built a house of logs, board floors, and shingled roof that had two doors and two windows. In addition, by the 1<sup>st</sup> of June, Marsh plowed, fenced, and cultivated 18 acres of land with 4 acres chopped, log barn, 3 fruit trees, 20 currant brush and 1000 strawberry plants.<br /> <br /> The Marsh family continue to be owners of 30 acres of the homestead property. The Reed family descendants are still on their homestead land.<br /> <br /> ~ Contributed by Dr. Shelley Murphy, descendant<br />  </p> <hr /> <p><strong>Family history extras with Dr. Shelley Murphy</strong><br /> <br /> George and Mary's daughter Clara is my great grandmother who died in 1959. Oral history passed down from my great grandmother to her daughter, Irene, and my mother, Verna, said George was enslaved. Also, George’s memory of his father were of the last day he saw him. George, at the age of four or five, remembered his father running through the house followed by his enslaver and a couple of the enslaver's neighbors running behind his father. George recanted hearing gun shots and never seeing his father again. As the story goes, there was a rumor that George’s father was going to run, but oral history says the runaway story was not true.<br /> <br /> Elders of Manistee County shared stories about George and Mary. Mary was known for her pies and had won pie contests at the county fairs. Mary also brought apple seeds to plant from West Virginia. One story says that George was tall and could put his hand on a fence post and just leap over it. Frank, one of the sons always had a dream of being able to leap over a fence like his father. This was told by Bessie (Davis) Marsh, Frank’s wife to my mother back in the 1970s. It was also noted by white neighbors that when George was enslaved in Virginia he was always ready to defend someone that was treated wrong. An example being when George publically intervened to help a woman being mistreated by her husband.<br /> <br /> The Marsh family is believed to be the first people of color to homestead in Manistee County, Michigan. My summers growing up along with my four brothers were spent visiting and working on this family homestead. Family homesteads are special places. This is where I learned (since I was born in a city) how to milk a cow, tend to a garden, and pick apples and berries.<br /> <br /> <strong>About the contributor:</strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{cb73e470-1329-49c5-bf50-5cc44aa087c9}{131}\" paraid=\"684737994\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">An avid genealogist for over 30 years, Dr. Shelley Viola Murphy, aka \"familytreegirl,\" was born and raised in Michigan, now living in central Virginia.

Part of this trade included transporting enslaved individuals. This firsthand experience exposed Austin Bearse to the evils of slavery. As he wrote in his memoir <em>Reminisces of the Fugitive Slave Law Days</em>:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>It used to be my business to pull off the hatches and warn [the enslaved people] that it was time to separate, and the shrieks and cries at these times were enough to make anybody's heart ache…Because I no longer think it right to see these things in silence, I trade no more south of Mason and Dixon's line.</em><sup>1</sup></p> <p>Though it is not clear when Bearse began his anti-slavery activism, he wrote in his memoir that he discovered the <em>Liberator</em> newspaper in 1834, which he \"read with delight.\"<sup>2</sup> Little else is known about his work in the 1830s and 1840s. However, Bearse noted in his memoir his participation in a rescue of a freedom seeker in July, 1847. According to <em>Reminisces</em>, he sailed to Albany, New York, and, upon arrival, met with abolitionists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucretia-mott.htm\">Lucretia</a> and Martha Mott. Once there,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Miss Mott told me they had a slave secreted just out of the city, who was in danger. His name was George Lewis. A writ was out for him, and she wished me to take him to Boston. As soon as I was ready to sail, she brought him to my vessel at night, with his baggage, and I stowed him away.</em><sup>3</sup></p> <p>George Lewis successfully made it to Boston, reunited with his daughter Lizzie, and found employment at a shipyard in East Boston.</p> <p>After the creation of the third Boston Vigilance Committee in 1850, Austin Bearse quickly established himself as a key member. He served as a successful collection's agent for the organization, appearing throughout the donations section of <em>Account Book of Francis Jackson, Treasurer the Vigilance Committee of Boston</em>. In addition to his work as a collection's agent, Vigilance Committee records highlight Bearse's efforts to directly assist freedom seekers on the maritime Underground Railroad. He owned a boat called the <em>Moby Dick</em>, a vessel that could be hired by Bostonians for daylong fishing excursions and harbor cruises. At night though, Bearse sailed the <em>Moby Dick</em> to help stowaways gain their freedom from southern ships.</p> <p>For example, an entry in the <em>Account Book of Francis Jackson</em>, documents the committee reimbursing Bearse $100 for \"services & boat in rescuing Sandy Swan a Fugitive in Boston Harbor in July 1853.\"<sup>4</sup> Described in greater detail in Bearse's memoir, on the morning of July 15 abolitionists learned of a stowaway on the <em>Florence</em>, a ship docked near Fort Independence on Castle Island. Bearse, along with John W. Browne, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-ingersoll-bowditch.htm\">William Bowditch</a>, Henry Kemp, and several unnamed Black men sailed the <em>Moby Dick</em> to the <em>Florence</em>. Bearse boarded the ship and later recalled,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>I went aft and demanded the negro of the mate…I said roughly, to blind the mate, \"I want him, damned quick!\" – and I started for him…. He [Swan] had slipped off his irons and I immediately knocked away the shore that held him and he was ready to come. He afterwards said that God had told him in the night that somebody would set him free in the morning. I told him to follow me, and he jumped into the boat quick.</em><sup>5</sup></p> <p>Because of the efforts of Bearse and the other abolitionists, Sandy Swan successfully escaped to Canada.</p> <p>Austin Bearse continued his work with the Boston Vigilance Committee until the beginning of the American Civil War. Little else is known about Bearse following the war, but according to census records, he lived in Boston until 1880.<sup>6</sup> Described by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-w-higginson.htm\">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a> as \"an intense anti-slavery man [who] possessed much force of character,\"<sup>7</sup> Austin Bearse proved essential to the success of the 1850 Boston Vigilance Committee.</p> <h2>Learn more...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/maritime-underground-railroad-in-boston.htm\">Safe Harbor: The Maritime Underground Railroad in Boston</a></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Austin Bearse, <em>Reminisces of the Fugitive Slave Law Days</em> (Warren Richardson, 1880), 9, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesfu00beargoog/page/n20/mode/2up?q=trade\">Archive.org</a>.</li> <li>Bearse, <em>Reminisces</em>, 10.</li> <li>Bearse, <em>Reminisces</em>, 10.</li> <li><em>Account Book of Francis Jackson, Treasurer The Vigilance Committee of Boston</em>, Dr. Irving H.

Eventually taking over the business, Gilbert established a lucrative career that he maintained for the rest of his life.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In addition to his career as a piano maker, Gilbert dedicated much of his life to the causes of abolitionism and civil rights. An early example of Gilbert's activism occurred in 1836 when he ended his membership at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/charles-street-meeting-house.htm\">Third Baptist Church on Charles Street</a> because of its discriminatory practices. According to the <em>Boston Globe</em>, the Charles Street Baptist Church refused to allow African Americans to attend church service. As described in an 1896 article:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>The deacon [Gilbert] brooded over this for some time, and finally decided to test the \"regulations.\" So he took a colored brother with him one Sunday, and the result was the good deacon decided to sever his connection with that church.</em><sup>3</sup></p> <p>Justin Fulton's memoir of Gilbert provides a different account of this decision to leave Third Baptist, stating, \"His [Gilbert's] relations to the church in Charles Street, though in the main pleasant, induced him to seek a more congenial atmosphere, where me might give expression to his anti-slavery opinions.\"<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Following his departure from Third Baptist, Gilbert helped found the First Free Baptist Church in 1836. Officially recognized in 1839, First Free Baptist, which eventually became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tremont-temple.htm\">Tremont Temple</a>, abolished pew rental fees and declared that \"all who practice slavery or justify it shall be excluded from the church and its communion.\"<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Gilbert's activism extended to assisting freedom seekers on the Underground Railroad. Following the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Gilbert's peers chose him to serve as the president of the Boston Vigilance Committee. He also opened <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/timothy-gilbert-house.htm\">his home</a> to individuals escaping enslavement. As he wrote in a letter, Gilbert offered \"his house as a refuge to any poor, panting fugitive, pursued by the slave-catcher, and warning the pursuer that if he entered behind him, he did so at his peril.\"<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Following through on this promise, in January 1851, Gilbert harbored a freedom seeker named Lewis at his home. While searching for Lewis, one slave catcher wrote,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>We are fully satisfied… that the boy is yet in Boston and in the house of this man Gilbert…He will pay fugitive slaves more for work than any other persons and give them the privileges of his private residence, table, &c.; has private watchers employed for the better security of fugitives…</em><sup>7</sup></p> <p>Gilbert continued to fight for the causes of abolitionism and civil rights until his death in 1865. Honoring his life in his obituary, a correspondent for <em>The Liberator</em> wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Deacon Timothy Gilbert, one of our best known and most useful citizens, died this morning after a long illness…Mr. Gilbert was widely known as a philanthropist, and liberal and constant benefactor of the Temperance and Anti-Slavery causes.</em><sup>8</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Justin D.

She fought to preserve <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm\">Muir Woods National Monument </a>and <a href=\"https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=471\">Mt. Tamalpais State Park</a> as well as many other redwood groves in California. She worked at the California Academy of Sciences for over 50 years. She collected over 300,000 specimens in her lifetime. Alice Eastwood also pioneered botanical research in Colorado and the surrounding area.</strong><br /> <br /> Alice Eastwood was born January 19, 1859 in Toronto, Canada. She lost her mother when she was six and moved around often as a child. She took on many responsibilities such as raising her siblings and earning money for the family. She spent some time living with her uncle. He was an experimental horticulturist and helped to inspire her love of plants. She later lived on a convent where a priest who loved to garden supported her interests. When she was 14 years old Alice Eastwood moved to Colorado to live with her father. She marveled at the diverse ecology of Colorado and the wondrous plant life. Alice Eastwood excelled in school but she dropped out of high school to work and support her family. She worked many jobs and made enough money to return to high school in her senior year. She was valedictorian.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Alice Eastwood spent the next decade or so teaching high school while exploring the mountains of Colorado in her free time. She studied Gray's Manual and Coulter's Manual of Rocky Mountain Botany extensively, teaching herself the necessary skills to be a botanist. She began to make a name for herself in botany and established the only plant collection in Colorado at the time. Alice Eastwood wrote and published the first book on flora in central Colorado, <em>A Popular Flora of Denver, Colorado</em>, in 1893. One of the plant species she discovered and named was collected in Courthouse Wash, now located in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm\">Arches National Park</a>. This plant is commonly known as slender cats eye or yellow cats eye (Oreocarya tenuis.) Alice Eastwood discovered and collected a sample of the plant in 1892 but it took her 11 years to identify and name the plant. She once said of the plant life in the region:</p>   <blockquote> <p><strong><em>“So distinct, so individual are those blossoms that they seem to have souls. They speak a wonderfully enticing language to draw the wandering insects to their honeyed depths…The bands of color on both divisions of the perianth are bewildering, impossible to describe; but more than aught else, they cause each flower to say proudly, with uplifted head, ‘I am myself; there is no other like me.” </em></strong><br />  </p> </blockquote> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-e59bbfe1-7fff-da01-18b2-cd32f607fa08\"><img height=\"423\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uVowAnSj_RJCTQtLAdA65ow8lDQ-egaEgV1dgpbQplwUXlz9LsQhbkMbLPt5c2i6zsKeclv_OyfYEtP1gVqiwYmXWjxMMMNNAphCkJZh_jEutyiB1kAHDXLBn5UKgdjFbg\" width=\"624\" /></b></p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><sub><em>Alice Eastwood in the feild. Biodiversity Heritage Library, California Academy of Sciences Archives. </em></sub><br /> <br /> <br /> In 1893 Alice Eastwood moved to San Francisco to work at the <strong>California Academy of Sciences</strong> as a curator. Over the next decade she would establish a diverse collection of plants and publish many books. When she moved to California she became passionate about redwood conservation. On November 20th, 1904 The San Francisco Call Newspaper reported on a women’s club meeting to save what was then called the Redwood Creek Canyon. This area now consists of <strong>Muir Woods National Monument</strong> and <strong>Mt. Tamalpais State Park</strong>. The article spoke of the enthusiasm of the meeting and hopeful prospect of protecting the ancient redwood groves. Alice Eastwood spoke passionately at this meeting, about protecting the landscape, its incomparable beauty and ecological importance. Her speech inspired the crowd and garnered great support for the cause. She said:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>\"There is only one reason why I wish I had $1,000,000. The only thing I want that amount of money for is to buy Redwood Park and Mount Tamalpais and present them to the State of California for a public reserve.\" </em></strong><br />  </p> </blockquote> <p>On April 18th, 1906 the great <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/1906-earthquake.htm\">San Francisco earthquake</a> shook the city. Alice Eastwood ran into the crumbling California Academy of Sciences building to try to rescue the Academy's collections. She was able to rescue 1,211 plant species of immense value. She also saved many books from her colleges collections. She said of the experience,</p> <blockquote> <p>“Not a book [from my department] was I able to save, nor a single thing of my own, except my favorite lens, without which I should feel helpless... My own destroyed work I do not lament, for it was a joy to me while I did it, and I can still have the same joy in starting it again.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the rest of her career she would rebuild this collect and then some, adding over 340,000 specimen. She also went on to publish over 300 articles, books and scientific papers. Alice Eastwood named 395 plant species and had many species named after her.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Alice Eastwood retired in 1949 at 90 years old after 57 years. The Tamalpais Conservation Club, which she had been a founder and a past president, named a beautiful recreation area after her: <strong>Camp Alice Eastwood</strong>. A trail to the camp is accessible at Muir Woods today.<br /> <br /> At age 94 she wrote, <em>“I count my age by my friends, and I am rich in friends.\"</em> Alice Eastwood passed away in 1953.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Eastwood worked to understand and protect the diverse botany and ecology of California, Colorado and the world at large. She not only dedicated her own life to this work, but inspired others to do the same.</p>",

            "bodyText": "James “Jim” Edwards has been dubbed the greatest black cattle rancher in all the West.<br /> <br /> He was born James Nathaniel Edwards in the state of Ohio on February 14, 1874. In 1900, Edwards headed West in search of work at the coal mines in Newcastle, Wyoming, but was run off by Italian laborers.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Unable to secure work at the coal mine, he walked more than 80 miles south to Lusk and found work as a ranch hand at the Wilson Brothers’ Running Water Ranch. He worked on the ranch herding sheep, cattle, and horses until December 1914.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> During his employment at the ranch, he had become foreman supervising white employees. He was sent to Lost Springs to run cattle for the Wilson Brothers, but Edwards applied for a patent on that land in his own name. This resulted in a lawsuit with the Wilson brothers that he won. By December 1913, he had received a patent for 318.06 acres near Harney Creek.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> James Edwards married Lethel Dawson in 1914 shortly before leaving the Running Water Ranch. Before they married, she had traveled the world singing with a troupe of musician. They soon started a ranching business.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> He regularly rode with his cowhands as far as Mexico and Canada to drive steer to his ranch. He was an early member of the Association of Wyoming Cattle Raisers and co-owned a Southern restaurant in Casper, Wyoming. Edwards was so successful that he was able to thrive during the Great Depression, surviving a $30,000 loss.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> James Edwards was the first person in the area to have hot running water and an indoor shower. His stone house was also the first to have a telephone, radio, and pressurized kerosene cook stove.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Neighbors recounted run-ins related to rustling cows and a perpetual fear of rampages by Edwards’ wild hogs. In Ebony magazine, they characterized Edwards as “close to the movie and pulp magazine version of a cowboy as can be found in American today.” In 1949 he owned 14,000 acre at the Sixteen-Bar-One ranch coving two counties. He is quoted as saying, “Let ‘em know right away that you’re going to fight for what you own. Just because a man’s colored, is no reason for people to think he’s a coward.” The ranch name Sixteen-Bar-One represented the ratio of white to black men in the area.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Despite his success he still faced discrimination. He made sure not to enter homes where a white woman was alone and did not attend social functions with mixed company.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> After Lethel’s death in 1945, Edwards looked for competent black cowhands to take over the ranch. He found the four Furmon brothers in Cold Springs, Wyoming. He was still living on the ranch and supervising them in 1949.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> He sold his property and moved to Scottsbluff, Nebraska. He died on January 6, 1951 at the age of 76 and was buried at Fairview Cemetery located in Scottsbluff. <hr /><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Sources</span> <ul> <li>Clevenger, Samuel. <i>James Edwards (1871-1951)</i>.

In 1877, after his mother died, Farnell moved from Columbia County, Florida to neighboring Suwannee County where his wife's family lived. There, he filed Homestead Application #5637 on September 13, 1877 at the county clerk’s office in Live Oak. Farnell applied for 39.78 acres. He then filed his claim at the land office in Gainesville, Alachua County, Florida. Farnell paid seven dollars for the application filing fee. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8c1336ba-5812-475e-b6e1-76672672d51b}{88}\" paraid=\"2024115251\">Seven years later, on August 18, 1884, Farnell returned to the land office in Gainesville. Here Farnell asserted that he would present final proof to establish his cultivation and residence on his homestead before the Honorable M. M. Blackburn in Live Oak on October 4, 1884. Farnell declared that Elijah Carruthers, Henry McGee, Edward Perry, and Puck Ferguson would provide witness statements. In addition, it was recorded that public notice of the Homestead Application would appear in the Florida Bulletin, published at Live Oak. That notice appeared for thirty days, beginning August 23rd until September 27th, 1884. There was also a posting attested to by L. A. Barnes, Land Office register. Barnes certified that a printed copy of the notice was posted in his office for thirty days, beginning on August 18, 1884.</p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5d608a8c-2b90-4d43-9cd4-f7fb976dd9d2}{162}\" paraid=\"1290832225\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In Farnell's final affidavit (for which he appeared one month before the October 4th date) on September 4th, before Judge Blackburn, Farnell stated that he settled the land on September 12, 1877. However, final testimony of witnesses and Randel Farnell, himself, was given on October 4, 1884. Witness testimony was given by two men. One had been named in the initial application, Henry McGee, while the other, William Evans, was not. Henry McGee’s family and Randel’s family would have long-lasting personal ties, as Henry’s daughter, Addie, eventually married Randel’s brother-in-law, Joseph Jacobs.<br /> <br /> William Evans testified that Randel Farnell was a citizen of the United States, over 21 years of age, the head of a family, and had never made a claim for Homestead property before. Evans went on to say that Farnell had settled the homestead in 1877. He stated there was a “nice log house (dwelling) crib smoke house and stable, about 35 acres in cultivation value $200.” Evans testified that Farnell and his family had resided on the homestead continuously since their first settlement and had not been absent from the property except to “labor” at other places daily, but the family had “self-cultivated” the property. Evans further attested that there was no oil or other minerals and that the land was more valuable as agricultural land than for its mineral potential. He also affirmed that the property had not been mortgaged. Finally, Evans agreed he had no interest in the property.<br /> <br /> Henry McGee’s responses were similar. However, he called the log dwelling, “splendid.” Farnell also had to testify. He stated all the things that Evans and McGee stated. In addition, he was asked about his family. Farnell responded that in addition to himself, there was his wife Sallie (Jacobs) Farnell, a dressmaker, and six children. The word “four” had been crossed out. This was because he had four biological children (Maryland, William, Jackson, and Lela) with his wife and she had two additional children of her own (Anna and Richard). Farnell also noted that about 35 acres had been cultivated, on which he had raised crops for seven seasons.<br /> <br /> The final certificate #4776 was issued on October 29, 1884, for 39.79 acres (.01 acre more than identified in the original application). The family continued to live on the property until about 1900, when they moved into the city of Live Oak, where Farnell had a hauling business (“drayman”). He was also a founding member of Ebenezer A. M. E. Church. Randel Farnelll died in 1928. The Farnell homestead remained in the family until his second wife, Priscilla (Vickers) Farnell, died in 1967. <br /> <br /> ~ Contributed by Margo Lee Williams, descendant</p> <hr /> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5d608a8c-2b90-4d43-9cd4-f7fb976dd9d2}{162}\" paraid=\"1290832225\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><br /> <img alt=\"Headshot of Margo Williams.\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|214|300|0|0|0\" height=\"300\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6914744|0|\" src=\"/people/images/MargoLeeWilliams2021_Headshot.jpg\" title=\"Margo Williams\" width=\"214\" /><br /> Photo of Margo Lee Williams, contributor and descendant.<br /> Photo Credit: Marvin T.

            "bodyText": "<p>Wilella Sibert Cather was born in Virginia on December 7, 1873. She was the first of seven children of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cather. Her life took her across the country, and she would become one of the premiere American authors of the 1900s.<br /> <br /> When she was nine, her father decided to move the family to the Nebraskan prairie. Her father’s parents had already migrated to Nebraska to homestead. So Willa's family followed in their footsteps. Upon arriving, the Cathers settled on their 160-acre homestead just outside the town of <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Red Cloud, Nebraska</a>, which at the time had a population of about 1,000.<br /> <br /> After moving to Nebraska, Cather struggled early to adapt to her new home. The move traded the lush forests and rolling hills of northern Virginia for the brown, almost treeless flatness of the central plains. Her childhood experiences with this landscape and immigrant families crossing it profoundly affected Willa.<br /> <br /> Like many families, the Cathers found homesteading to be a difficult and unrewarding life. They eventually gave up the endeavor before obtaining their 160 acres and moved into the town of Red Cloud. There, Willa worked delivering mail on horseback to many of the remote farms located outside the town.<br /> <br /> Immigrants and landscapes would become the chief characters of Cather’s novels. As a child, she didn’t want to be a writer at all. She once stated, “The fact that I was a girl never damaged my ambitions to be a pope or an emperor.” Indeed, she had early interests in science and medicine, sometimes signing her name as Dr. William Cather, M.D. When she graduated high school and went to college, Willa enrolled to study medicine.<br /> <br /> From Red Cloud she went on to the University of Nebraska. Not long after Cather began school at the university one of her teachers submitted a sample of her writing to the local newspaper. When the piece was published, Cather said the effect of seeing her name in print was hypnotic. Her focus changed from science and medicine to writing and editing. She took positions as editor, author, and critic for three different newspapers and wrote short stories―all at the same time―before she had even graduated from the university.<br /> <br /> She graduated in 1894 and soon moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she was a teacher and journalist. In 1906, Willa Cather moved to New York City to be an associate editor at <em>McClure's</em> magazine. It was there that she also began to write her great novels, many of which were set on the Nebraska prairie she had so loved as a youth.<br /> <br /> Over time, Cather would create 12 novels, numerous essays, four collections of short stories, three non-fiction titles, and one volume of poems. In 1913, she began working on what she called her Prairie Trilogy, reviving her childhood memories of Nebraska. The three books of the trilogy were <em>O Pioneers!</em>, <em>The Song of the Lark</em>, and <em>My Àntonia.</em><br /> <br /> Cather had a special affection for places now preserved in national parks and public lands. In 1912, a trip to visit her brother Douglass in Winslow, Arizona, brought her to the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Grand Canyon</a>, then part of the Kaibab National Forest. A smaller canyon in the Coconino National Forest east of Flagstaff would be renamed Panther Canyon in Cather’s 1914 novel <em>The Song of the Lark</em>. That canyon and its cliff dwellings are preserved today in <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Walnut Canyon National Monument</a>. And in 1915, Willa and her beloved Edith would be some of the first visitors to <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Mesa Verde National Park</a> in Colorado.<br /> <br /> Cather’s career was inspired by women she was close to. Beginning in 1901 she lived and traveled abroad with Isabelle McClung. Their relationship was deeply emotional, and McClung encouraged Cather to write creatively. When McClung died in 1938, Cather said that she had written all her books for Isabelle. Cather also had a lifelong, intimate companionship with Edith Lewis, who helped edit her novels. The two met first in 1903 and shared an apartment in Greenwich Village, New York, from 1912 to 1927. In 1925 they built a home together on an island off the Maine coast, and by 1933 they moved again to a small apartment in New York City.<br /> <br /> Though Cather never used the word “lesbian” to describe herself―the word didn’t become commonly used until after Cather’s death―she called it “manifestly unfair that feminine friendships” were rejected by society in her time. A sample from her letters to Edith describes her as “my darling.” Cather’s relationships, in turn, have inspired LGBTQ+ audiences. Willa and Edith are buried together at the Old Burying Ground in Jaffrey, New Hampshire.<br /> <br /> By the time she died in 1947, Willa Cather was one of the most well known and critically acclaimed novelists of the 20th century. Her life and work have been honored by the National Women’s Hall of Fame, the Nebraska Hall of Fame, Virginia Women in History, the New York Writers’ Hall of Fame, the National Cowboy Museum and Hall of Fame, the U.S. Postal Service, and the U.S. Mint. She also won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1922 World War I novel <em>One of Ours</em>. She was always quick to attribute her success to her formative years on the Nebraska prairie as the daughter of a struggling homesteader. <br /> <br /> Willa Cather was a groundbreaking author. Her work not only demonstrates literary supremacy but shows how the people and places we encounter in our lives can inspire us to accomplish greatness and leave behind a legacy that will encourage future generations.</p> <h3>References</h3> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.willacather.org/about/willa-cather/timeline\">https://www.willacather.org/about/willa-cather/timeline</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://cather.unl.edu/life.longbio.html\">https://cather.unl.edu/life.longbio.html</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/julyaugust/feature/willa-cather-in-the-desert-where-she-learned-what-truly-mattered-\">https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/julyaugust/feature/willa-cather-in-the-desert-where-she-learned-what-truly-mattered-</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://cather.unl.edu/cs005_moseley.html\">https://cather.unl.edu/cs005_moseley.html</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Cather\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Cather</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"http://www.catherletters.org/story-behind-letters/1892-letter-to-louise-pound/\">http://www.catherletters.org/story-behind-letters/1892-letter-to-louise-pound/</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"http://www.catherletters.org/letters/1936-letter-edith-lewis/\">http://www.catherletters.org/letters/1936-letter-edith-lewis/</a></p> </li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Ynes Enriquetta Julietta Mexia</strong> was one of the most successful botanists and female plant collectors of her time and she did not begin her career until she was 55 years old. She was accomplished not only in the number of plants she collected but also in the number of miles she traveled. Mexia spent 13 years traveling the Americas, often alone, collecting thousands of plants on her way. She was a fierce conservationist and was an early pioneer in fighting to preserve the redwood forests of Northern California. She was assertive, brave, and not afraid to challenge racism, sexism, ageism and more in her impressive and amazing career.  <br />  </p> <p>Ynes Mexia was born in 1870 in Washington DC. She had a turbulent childhood and moved often.  An introverted child, she spent much of her time reading, writing and exploring the outdoors. When she finished her schooling she moved to Mexico to help on her father's ranch and took over the management when he died. She lost her first husband soon after their marriage and divorced her second husband after he financially ruined her family ranch.  Mexia spent almost 30 years living in Mexico, but with all the tremendous changes in her life she suffered from mental health challenges. She traveled to San Francisco to seek treatment and to make a new life for herself.  She started her time in San Francisco as a social worker but soon discovered her passion for environmentalism. </p> <p> </p> <p>Ynes Mexia joined the environmental movement. She was an early member of the <strong>Sierra Club</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/getinvolved/strl.htm\">Save the Redwoods League</a>. She joined these clubs and went on many excursions through California and to the redwood forests.  Mexia became incredibly active in efforts to save the redwood trees. She remarked after hearing of the clear cutting of redwood forests across Northern California, <em>\"I have been much distressed to hear cutting has been going on in Montgomery Grove, I am heartily in sympathy of any effort to save these trees.\"</em> She spoke passionately about the preservation of these landscapes and was at the forefront of the national park conservation movement.  Her time in conservation inspired her to pursue the study of botany at UC Berkeley in 1921. Mexia went back to school at age 51, a decision that is uncommon to this day, but even more so at the time, especially for a woman.  Her time studying at UC Berkeley encouraged her to collect and categorize plants and to work in the field of botany. <br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Sauraula Mexiae, Steere Herbarium - NY Botanical Graden\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|1200|1718|0|0|0\" height=\"1718\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6582701|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Sauraula-Mexiae-Steere-Herbarium-NYBotanical-Graden.jpg\" title=\"Sauraula Mexiae, Steere Herbarium - NY Botanical Graden\" width=\"1200\" /><br /> <sub><em>This specimen of Saurauia mexiae in the Steere Herbarium was collected by Mexia and named in her honor. It is a “type specimen,” which is a specimen selected to serve as a reference point when a plant species is first named. NY Botanical Garden.</em></sub></p> <p> </p> <p>In 1925 Ynes Mexia took her first plant collecting trip to Mexico on a group trip with Stanford. She quickly found out that she preferred to work alone. Mexia broke off from the group and began collecting independently.   In this excursion she collected over 1,500 specimens.  One of them, <strong>Mimosa Mexiae</strong>, became the first of many plants named after her.  She got the funding she needed and at 56 years old she started doing expeditions on her own.   Her reputation as the first Mexican American female botanist grew and she began to be sponsored more.  This was the beginning of a 13 year career in botany. She once said: </p> <blockquote> <p><br /> <em><strong>\"My dryers get all filled up and still numbers of plants sit and look at me and announce that they are waiting to be collected. it is terribly trying to a greedy collector like myself.\"  </strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Ynes Mexia traveled all over the Americas, and was the first botanist to collect plants in what is now <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/siteindex.htm\">Denali National Park</a>. She often traveled solo or with a few Indigenous guides. She advocated for Indigenous rights in the areas she collected, valuing their knowledge, perspective, and right to the land. She would spend months in the field, riding horseback and sleeping outdoors, something that shocked many because she was a woman doing this work. She once wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>“A well-known collector and explorer stated very positively that ‘it was impossible for a woman to travel alone in Latin America.' I decided that if I wanted to become better acquainted with the South American Continent the best way would be to make my way right across it.\"</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p>She made many excursions to Ecuador, Peru, and more. Mexia became a prominent botanist as well as a lecturer and writer. She said, <em>\"I have a job where I produce something real and lasting.\"</em> Over her 13 year career she collected over 145,000 specimen. A new genius was named after her along with over 50 species and she <em>\"discovered\"</em> and categorized over 500 plants.  On her last trip to Mexico in 1938 she became ill and was diagnosed with lung cancer. She died shortly after at age 68. She left most of her estate to Save the Redwoods League and the Sierra Club. This generous donation is a part of her legacy today.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Ynes Mexia's contributions to the field of botany and her part in preserving redwoods should not be overlooked or undervalued. Researchers still use her collections to this day, and they can still be seen in many museums and universities.  She was an early member in many important and instrumental conservation organizations in the Bay Area.  Mexia was a pioneer. There was no one like her in her field at the time; a woman of color above 50 traveling the world as a botanist. She increased representation in the fields of conservation and botany, as showing that women should have the freedom to experience the world.  Many people at the time said that a woman could not travel alone. Ynes Mexia said, <em>\"I don't think there is any place in the world where a woman can't venture.\"</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Remembered today simply as 'the Hanging Judge,' Isaac Parker grew up on an Ohio farm. He became a frontier attorney and had a thirty-five-year career in public service. He served as a city attorney, state judge, two-term representative to Congress. For twenty-one years, he was a federal district judge in Fort Smith.</p> <h3>Childhood and Education</h3> <p>Born October 15, 1838, Isaac Charles Parker was the youngest son of Jane and Joseph Parker. He was born and raised outside Barnesville, in Belmont County, Ohio. Still, on the edge of the frontier in the early 1840s, southeastern Ohio was primarily an agricultural area.While raised on a farm, Isaac cared little for working out of doors. His mother, Jane Shannon Parker, was the governor's niece and figured prominently in raising her son. When not required on the farm, he attended the Breeze Hill primary school. He then attended the Barnesville Classical Institute, a private school. It was said that he was \"always a hand to get an education,\" and to pay for his higher education, he taught in a country primary school.At the age of seventeen, Isaac Parker decided to study law. His legal training consisted of a combination of apprenticeship and self-directed study. Isaac read law with a Barnesville attorney, passing his bar exam in 1859.</p> <h3>Parker's Missouri Years</h3> <p>Once he passed the bar, Isaac, at age twenty-one, traveled west by steamboat to Saint Joseph, Missouri. 'St. Joe' was a bustling Missouri River port town and offered many possibilities for a young lawyer. The Ninth Missouri Circuit Court was held there. Isaac Parker's uncle D.E. Shannon operated a legal firm in Saint Joseph with his partner H.B. Banch. In the firm of Shannon and Branch, Isaac began his legal career in earnest.<br /> <br /> By 1861, he was operating on his own, working in the municipal and country criminal courts. The local courts afforded Parker not only experience but community recognition. In April 1861, he won the election to the post of city attorney as a Democrat. Just four days after Parker took office as city attorney, the Civil War began. The war caused Parker to reevaluate his political beliefs - breaking with the Democrats. He enlisted in a home guard unit, the 61st Missouri Emergency Regiment.<br /> <br /> Parker married a Saint Joseph girl, Mary O'Toole, on December 12, 1861. He was re-elected as city attorney in 1862 and 1863.<br /> <br /> In 1864, Isaac Parker formally split from the Democratic party. He ran for county prosecutor of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District as a Republican. In the fall of 1864, he served as a member of the Electoral College, casting his vote for Abraham Lincoln.<br /> <br /> In 1868, Parker sought and won a six-year term as judge of the Twelfth Missouri Circuit. The new judge gained experience and habits in this position that he would put to good use in the years to come.<br /> <br /> Political ambition would catapult Parker from a Missouri judgeship to Congress in 1870.</p> <h3>U.S. Congressman from Missouri</h3> <p>On September 13, 1870, Parker was nominated for the Seventh Congressional District. Backed by the Radical faction of the Republican party, Parker resigned his judgeship and devoted his energy to the campaign.<br /> <br /> The heated campaign ended with Parker's opponent withdrawing from the race two weeks before the election. Parker easily defeated the replacement candidate in the November 8, 1870 election.<br /> <br /> The first session of the Forty-second Congress convened on Saturday, March 4, 1871. His congressional career was a balance of resolving constituent needs and sponsoring legislation. Representative Parker assisted veterans of his district in securing pensions. He lobbied for the construction of a new federal building in Saint Joseph. He sponsored legislation that would have allowed women the right to vote and hold public office in United States territories. On several occasions, Parker sponsored legislation that would have organized the Indian Territory under a formal territorial government.<br /> <br /> Representative Parker handily won a second term in November 1872, one local paper saying of him, \"Missouri had no more trusted or influential representative in ... Congress during the past two years...\" In his second term, Parker gained national attention for supporting the Bureau of Indian Affairs. His second term concentrated on Indian policy and fair treatment of the Tribes residing in the Indian Territory.<br /> <br /> By the fall of 1874, the political tide had shifted in Missouri. As a Republican, Isaac Parker had no chance of reelection to Congress. Like many others, he sought a presidential appointment to public office.</p> <h3>I.C. Parker, U.S. District Judge</h3> <p>As a result of his four years in Congress, Isaac Parker stood a good chance of receiving an appointment to a government office. In early March 1875, President Grant forwarded Parker's nomination as chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Utah Territory. However, Parker had submitted a request for an appointment as the federal district court judge in Fort Smith. On March 18, 1875, the President nominated Parker as a judge for the Western District of Arkansas.<br /> <br /> The federal court for the Western District of Arkansas was initially established in 1851. Presiding over the western counties in Arkansas and all of Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Until 1871, the court was based in Van Buren, Arkansas. In 1871, Judge Parker's predecessor, William Story, was appointed to the bench. The tenure of Judge Story was marred by serious corruption, and in 1874, Judge Story resigned.<br /> <br /> The new judge arrived in Fort Smith on May 4, 1875, traveling aboard the steamboat Ella Hughes. His family stayed behind in Missouri and joined him later. Judge Parker held court for the first time on May 10, 1875. In the first term of court, eight men were found guilty of murder with a mandatory death sentence according to federal law. On September 3, 1875, six men were executed on the Fort Smith gallows. This indicated that the once corrupt court was functioning once again.</p> <h3>Judge Parker: An Able Jurist</h3> <p>The federal court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four separate terms each year: February, May, August, and November. In reality, the court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. To ensure that the court tried as many cases as possible each term, Judge Parker held court six days a week and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress changed the court's jurisdiction. Moving portions of the Indian Territory jurisdiction to federal courts in Texas and Kansas in an attempt to ease the caseload.<br /> <br /> The decreased size of the jurisdiction provided some relief. However, the continued influx of settlers into the Indian Territory contributed to an increased crime rate. During these years, the judge began to play an active role in the community of Fort Smith. In 1884, the government gave most of the 300-acre military reservation to the city to fund the public school system, mainly at the judge's urging. Parker served on the school board. He served as the first board president of the Saint John's hospital (now the Baptist Health Medical Center). The Parker family was involved in the community as well. His wife Mary participated in many social activities. Their two sons Charles and James went to the public schools their father helped to establish.<br /> <br /> As a federal judge, his duties occasionally called him to testify in front of Congress. He also substituted for other federal judges in the area. Besides the capital offenses, several important civil cases were tried by the court in the 1880s. The most famous of these was against David Payne, an Oklahoma Boomer illegally settling on lands in the Indian Territory.<br /> <br /> On February 6, 1889, Congress made a sweeping change to the federal court in Fort Smith. It stripped the court of its concurrent circuit court authority. It also allowed the United States Supreme Court to review all capital crimes. This law went into effect on May 1, 1889 and would drastically impact Judge Parker's final years.</p> <h3>1890 – 1896</h3> <p>In 1889 and 1890, Judge Parker had the opportunity to take different positions within the federal judiciary. Either job would have provided the judge with a reduced caseload. However, Parker had established himself in Fort Smith and removed his name from consideration for the two positions.<br /> <br /> The Courts Act of 1889 established a federal court system in the Indian Territory. This further decreasing the Fort Smith court's jurisdiction.<br /> <br /> The restrictions of the court's once vast jurisdiction were a source of frustration. What bothered Judge Parker the most were the Supreme Court reversals of capital crimes tried in Fort Smith. Two-thirds of the cases appealed to the higher court were reversed. The accused were given new trials. In 1894 Judge Parker gained national attention in a dispute with the Supreme court over the case of Lafayette Hudson.<br /> <br /> In 1895 a new Courts Act was passed. Effective September 1, 1896, this act removed the last remaining Indian Territory jurisdiction of the court. Following the escape attempt of Cherokee Bill in the summer of 1895, which resulted in the death of a jail guard. Judge Parker again came into conflict with his superior when he blamed the Justice Department and the Supreme court for the incident. In 1896, a very public argument was carried on between Judge Parker and the Assistant Attorney General.<br /> <br /> When the August term 1896 began, Judge Parker was at home, too sick to preside over the court. Twenty years of overwork had contributed to a variety of ailments, including Bright's Disease. Judge Parker's final interview was from his bedside. Two months after the jurisdictional change took effect, Judge Isaac C. Parker died on November 17, 1896. With his death, an era came to an end at Fort Smith.<br /> <br /> <em>“The Nation's Distinguished Jurist and Fort Smith's Beloved Citizen is no More.\"</em><br /> - Fort Smith News-Record, November 17, 1896</p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

Northeastern State Teachers' College was founded on the grounds of the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Cherokee Female Seminary</a>, which Mary's great-great-grandfather, Cherokee Chief John Ross, was instrumental in establishing.<br /> <br /> After teaching math and science in Oklahoma, in 1936 she worked as a statistical clerk for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, located in the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Department of the Interior building</a> in Washington, DC. The Bureau reassigned her in 1937 to be an advisor to girls at the Santa Fe Indian School in New Mexico. In 1938, after years of taking summer classes, she completed her Master's degree, also in mathematics, from the Colorado State Teachers College. Mary was fascinated by the stars, and took every astronomy class she could.<br /> <br /> In 1942, Lockheed in California hired her as a mathematician. She was among the many women who got jobs that were traditionally held by men while men were serving in the military during World War II. She worked on desinging fighter jets and large planes. Unlike many other women, who were forced out of their jobs as men returned from the War, Mary continued working for Lockheed. The company sent her the University of California Los Angeles to get her professional certification in engineering -- the first Native American woman to do so.<br /> <br /> In 1952, she was one of the 40 founding members of Lockheed's secret Advanced Development Program, known as the Skunk Works. Much of the work she did there remains classified. Some of the work we do know about includes preliminary design concepts for interplanetary space travel, manned space flight, ballistic missiles, and satillites in orbit above the earth. She also wrote about the feasibility and logistics of space travel to Mars and Venus.<br /> <br /> Mary Ross retired from the Skunk Works in 1973. After retirement, she worked to get more Native Americans into the sciences. She was one of the participants in the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC in September, 2004. She died on April 29, 2008 at the age of 99.<br /> <br /> In 2017, the United States Mint included a design featuring Mary G.

            "bodyText": "Samuel Burris’ life was spent fighting for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/enslavement/index.htm\">abolition of slavery</a>, often putting himself in mortal danger. He was an agent on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/index.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>, helping enslaved people cross from Delaware, where slavery was legal, over into Pennsylvania, which was a free state. In so doing, he was subjected to attack and prosecution, and he came very close to being sold into slavery himself.<br /> <br /> Burris was born in Willow Grove, Delaware in 1813, the youngest of six children born to free Black parents. He was working from an early age, and continued to do so all his life, first as a laborer and farmer, and later, due to his good education, as a teacher. Details about Burris’ early life are sparse, but by the 1840s he had a family of his own, and they had moved to Philadelphia, though Burris continued to teach in Wilmington, Delaware.<br /> <br /> Their move to Philadelphia was prompted by the increasing legal pressure on free Black Americans in Delaware. Delaware was a slave state, and though it had a substantial population of Quakers who had broadly abolitionist views, as well as a large free Black population that dwarfed the population of enslaved people, the rest of the non-Black population was becoming more pro-slavery as the 1800s rolled on. Throughout the first half of the 1800s, the free Black population of Delaware were denied basic rights as the state passed increasingly restrictive laws. Free Black Delawareans were already prohibited from voting, but in 1807 they were denied re-entry to the First State if they had left for more than six years. This period of time was further reduced on several occasions, until by 1863 if a free Black person left Delaware for as little as five days, they would be barred from coming back. In 1832 they were denied the right to assemble or bear arms, direct violations of the First and Second Amendments. In this atmosphere of increasing repression, the Burris family relocated to Philadelphia for safety.<br /> <br /> Burris’ involvement with the Underground Railroad, the secret network of safe houses, abolitionists, and other agents which helped enslaved people escape to free states and territories in the decades before and during the Civil War, started in earnest in the 1840s. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, a major abolitionist group in Philadelphia. He served as a “conductor” (a secret agent) for the group, helping hundreds of enslaved people escape through Delaware and Maryland to the safety of Pennsylvania. He worked closely with two white men on several occasions, John Hunn and Thomas Garret, both of whom would be also be caught up in the case which saw Burris almost sold into slavery.<br /> <br /> In January of 1847, Burris, Hunn, and Garrett had attempted to aid the escape of an enslaved woman named Maria Matthews. They were unsuccessful, caught before they could get Matthews aboard a steamship, and she was re-enslaved. Burris and the others were not initially arrested, but charges were soon brought against all three for violating state laws on assisting escaping enslaved people, as well as violating the federal 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. Though the charges were brought in relation to an earlier attempt to aid escaping enslaved people, the case was ultimately about shutting down the Underground Railroad network through legal intimidation. Hunn and Garret were both financially ruined through the huge fines levied on them by Chief Justice Roger Tanney, an ardently pro-slavery judge. Burris’ sentence was far worse. He was imprisoned for 14 months, had a fine of $500 levied on him, and at the conclusion of his time in the Dover jail, was sentenced to be sold into slavery for at least 14 years.<br /> <br /> His time in a Dover jail cell was not spent idly however, nor was he abandoned by his abolitionist compatriots. Burris and his friends wrote letters to influential figures around the country, pleading his case. Eventually a plan was formed and funds raised to have a Quaker abolitionist agent, Isaac Flint, pose as a buyer during the auction of Burris on the steps of the Old State House in September of 1848. Through good acting, steady nerves, and a few well-placed bribes, Flint was able to win the auction, and then after getting Burris a safe distance away from Dover, told him \"not to fear, you have been purchased with abolitionist gold and I will spirit you away to Philadelphia.\"<br /> <br /> This extremely close call, nor the threat of 60 lashes (a near certain death sentence) should he ever set foot in Delaware again, did not dissuade Burris from continuing his anti-slavery efforts. However, in recognition of the continued danger to his family, he had them move to San Francisco in 1852, and he followed in 1855. There he was a central pillar of the free Black community and was especially interested in promoting education and job training for escaped enslaved people. Burris passed away in 1863, unfortunately not living to see the abolition of slavery in the United States. In 2012 the governor of Delaware officially pardoned Burris posthumously, and his story continues to gain national prominence in recognition of his heroic deeds.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Samuel Burris, contact and visit the <a href=\"https://history.delaware.gov/old-state-house/\">Old State House in Dover, DE</a>.<br />   <hr /> <h4><b>Reflection Questions</b></h4> <ul> <li>What do you find inspiring about Samuel Burris’ life?</li> <li>How can the perseverance he showed fighting for the abolition of slavery inspire modern movements for social justice?</li> <li>Was Burris right in breaking the law to fight slavery?</li> </ul> <hr /> <h4>Sources</h4> <p>“The People: Samuel D.

            "bodyText": "<p>Daniel Freeman was one of the first people to file a claim under the Homestead Act of 1862. Legend has it that Daniel Freeman filed his claim 10 minutes after midnight at the Land Office in Brownville, NE on January 1, 1863, the first day the Homestead Act went into effect.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/daniel-freeman-homestead.htm\">site of his claim</a> is now the site of Homestead National Historical Park. This site commemorates the lives and accomplishments of all pioneers and the changes brought about by the Homestead Act.<br /> <br /> Mr. Freeman came from Illinois to Nebraska alone and began corresponding with Agnes Suiter, a young woman from LeClaire, Iowa. Agnes had been engaged to Daniel's brother James, who died in the Civil War. Daniel proposed marriage through the mail, and in 1865, brought his new bride back to his homestead claim. View transcriptions of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/daniel-freeman-agnes-suiter-love-letters.htm\">Daniel Freeman and Agnes Suiter's letters</a>.They had 8 children over the years. As the children grew, some married and built homes on the old homestead.<br /> <br /> During the tenure of the Freeman family, a variety of structures were built upon the land. A small log cabin was built in the north forty of the claim, as well as traditional farming outbuildings. This cabin was often photographed and later depicted in engravings as the First Homestead Cabin.<br /> <br /> In later years, the family was financially secure enough to build a two-story brick house near the woodland edge of the claim. A barn and other outbuildings were built nearby. Other features of the homestead included an Osage Orange hedgerow, planted and pruned to keep animals out of productive fields. Remains of this hedgerow still exist on the land today. The Freeman family and tenant farmers planted corn, wheat, and oats and orchards of apple and peach trees.<br /> <br /> The brick house burned in 1916, eight years after Daniel Freeman's death in 1908. It was replaced with a small wood frame house near that site for Daniel and Agnes' daughter Agnes Freeman Quackenbush. A similar house was built for Agnes next to the old freight road near the center of the claim. She often cared for grandchildren there, and lived in the home nearly until her death in 1931. None of the Freeman homes exist on the site today.<br /> <br /> One structure well known and used by the Freeman family was the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/freeman-school.htm\">Freeman School</a>, located 1/4 mile west of the homestead claim. It is not known if the school is named for a member of the Freeman family or for Thomas Freeman, a local brickmaker and president of the school board. Daniel and Agnes were both active in the affairs of the school. The Freeman children attended the school, sometimes sharing classroom space with younger nieces and nephews. The Freeman school operated as a place of learning until 1967, and has been restored and is open for visits today.<br /> <br /> Daniel Freeman garnered national attention with his protest against bible-based lessons at the school.

            "bodyText": "<p align=\"justify\">Jessie Coleman “J.C.” Hunter—an energetic, trustworthy, and shrewd businessman—wore many hats in the early 20th century. He first moved to Van Horn in 1911 as the Superintendent of Schools, and then became county treasurer, county judge, and the director and vice president of the Van Horn State Bank. He made his money during the oil and gas boom during the 1920s, and out of his offices in Abilene served as president of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Commission.<br /> <br /> His introduction to the Guadalupe Mountains came in the mid-1910s while living in Van Horn. Like many enterprising Texans, Hunter joined the race for oil and went into partnership with Matt Grisham in the early 1920s. The two scoured the Trans-Pecos, digging exploratory wells and more often than not coming up dry. After these missions, Hunter became enthralled with the Mountains and began purchasing land. Within a few years Hunter had purchased thousands of acres from small landholders, bankrupt homesteaders and ranchers, or the state. Many of these transactions were through the Grisham-Hunter Corporation. This introduced him to the second large landholder in the area, Wallace Pratt, the petroleum geologist who amassed land in what is now McKittrick Canyon. Pratt later recalled that he and Hunter were in a race to purchase sections of McKittrick Canyon during the mid-1920s. Hunter knew more than he, according to Pratt, and Hunter purchased some of the best sections of the Canyon.<br /> <br /> J.C. Hunter bought out numerous failing ranches during the Great Depression. The records of the Texas General Land Office in Austin are littered with foreclosures and sales of land in the Guadalupe region. Many of these properties ended up in the hands of Hunter. But even before the Depression, Hunter and Grisham were buying up sections of the Mountains. He purchased the Dolph Williams property, several sections of the Cox family holdings in Texas, and some in New Mexico. In 1926 the Grisham-Hunter outfit purchased four sections of T&P land near Devil’s Den Canyon on the state border, and one section in and alongside McKittrick Canyon. He also purchased two more sections north of Lost Peak near Dog Canyon from a man named J.R. Bonin in 1928. In 1931 Hunter had purchased much of the McCombs property, including a 683 acre plot in Block 65, between Smith Spring and the state line.<br /> <br /> During one of his transactions with the Cox family he was first introduced to Noel Kincaid, who had married into the family and was managing a lot of the Cox properties. This introduction eventually led to J.C. Hunter hiring Kincaid in 1941 or 1942 to oversee the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch.<br /> <br /> As Kincaid and Hunter began what was by all accounts a well-managed Ranch, Hunter and his associate, Matt Grisham, decided to make an offer to J.T. Smith for his Frijole property. Perhaps under financial duress, Smith agreed, and in the early 1940s the Grisham-Hunter operation made the Smith family home the headquarters for their ranch. In a year or two Hunter bought out his partner and assumed control of the operation. To offset the considerable costs of maintaining the ranch, Hunter diversified his business dealings in three ways. First, he leased sections of the ranch to oil and gas companies who were in a race to find new sources of fuel. Apparently they had little success in finding either. Second, Hunter purchased not only cattle, but sheep and goats, because of they were especially hearty and could withstand the heat and arid landscape. Third, he had already begun transforming his Ranch into a hunting preserve, and in that spirit, imported elk, Merriam Turkey, and various kinds of trout for recreational purposes.<br /> <br /> The Hunter family ran the Guadalupe Mountains Ranch for more than twenty years, even when J.C. served a term as mayor of Abilene. In 1947 the Frijole Ranch<br /> became the home of Noel Kincaid and his family, as Noel served as the foreman for the Hunter property. Kincaid lived there for nearly two decades.<br /> <br /> Although Hunter was a businessman he was also a nascent conservationist. Some historical studies claim that the genesis for the creation of a park in the Guadalupes originated with Wallace C. Pratt, but as far back as the 1920s Hunter had thought that the region deserved protection. As he purchased the majority of land that became the present day park, he protected the land and its resources in the hope that the state would purchase the property and save it as some sort of preserve. Tentative talks with the Texas departments overseeing public land quickly disabused him of that notion, but he continued to hope that the lands could be protected. This was part of his motivation when he ran the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch as a hunting outfit with relatively minimal interest in cattle and goats. Hunting left a lighter footprint on the land and helped Hunter maintain the integrity of the landscape that he so dearly valued.<br /> <br /> When J.C. Hunter died in 1945, his son, J.C. Hunter Jr. inherited the Ranch. “Jr.” followed in his father’s footsteps. He continued acquiring sections of land until the family ranch encompassed approximately 72,000 acres in the immediate vicinity of the Mountains. And, like his father, Jr. had an abiding interest in conservation and harbored similar dreams of seeing the Mountains protected in perpetuity.<br /> <br /> <em>Content adapted from Jeffrey Shepherd's 2012 NPS Historic Resource Study:  \"The Guadalupe Mountains and Environmental History in the West Texas Borderlands.\"</em></p>",

He later moved to Waltham where he appears on an 1818 list of qualified voters. In Waltham, he began a business dealing in \"clothing and woolen goods\" first in partnership with Willard Adams and then on his own.<sup>1</sup> At present we know little more about Allen's early life and when he began his involvement in the anti-slavery movement.</p> <p>The 1840s provide the first documented evidence of Allen's support of the movement. \"Ephraim Allen, Waltham\" appears on a list of donors to the 1841 New England Anti-Slavery Convention.<sup>2</sup> Allen also attended several of the town and county meetings organized by Massachusetts abolitionists to protest the 1842 arrest of freedom seeker George Latimer. The people chose Allen to represent Waltham at the Middlesex County Latimer Convention held in Concord, Massachusetts ten days later.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Allen moved his business, now \"E. Allen & Co., Foreign and Domestic Woolens and Tailor's Trimmings\" to Milk Street, Boston in 1846.<sup>4</sup> He changed his residence to Boston in 1847.<sup>5</sup> In 1850, he joined the Boston Vigilance Committee.<sup>6</sup> Abolitionists formed this third and final iteration of the Vigilance Committee to actively resist the new Fugitive Slave Law. This law empowered slave catchers to arrest and return suspected freedom seekers without due process and with the support of the federal government and other authorities. The <em>Account Book of Francis Jackson, Treasurer of the Boston Vigilance Committee</em> documented Allen's fundraising for the cause. This same year, Allen presided over a mass meeting held on the Boston Common on April 5<sup>th</sup> to \"devise all possible means of preventing the return\" to slavery of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-the-whole-land-is-full-of-blood-the-thomas-sims-case.htm\">Thomas Sims</a> under that law.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Allen may also have been active in other ways. In his <em>Reminiscences of Fugitive Slave-Law Days in Boston</em>, Austin Bearse describes driving a freedom seeker from Boston \"to Concord-- arriving about one o’clock. We drove directly to Mr. Allen's house, by agreement—he being one of the Vigilance Committee.\"<sup>8</sup> We cannot confirm that this \"Mr. Allen\" and our \"Ephraim Allen\" are one and the same – but Ephraim is the only \"Mr. Allen\" documented on surviving Vigilance Committee membership lists. A likely possibility, at least.</p> <p>Allen's anti-slavery views also influenced his politics. In 1848, he became one of the original members of the Massachusetts Free Soil Party, founded to oppose the extension of slavery into new American land.<sup>9</sup> In 1854, he joined the new Republican Party. For more than a decade Allen served both parties, presiding over city and county meetings, representing Boston in state party conventions, and running for election to the state House of Representatives.</p> <p>In one of his last public appearances Allen presided over an 1862 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/faneuil-hall.htm\">Faneuil Hall</a> meeting celebrating the preliminary <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-emancipation-proclamation.htm\">Emancipation Proclamation</a>. He helped lead attendees to declare \"we rejoice, with unspeakable joy, that the cause of the country is now seen to be the cause of universal and impartial freedom; that Liberty and Union are henceforth made one and inseparable by the glorious proclamation of the 22nd of September… God bless <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>!\"<sup>10</sup></p> <p>Ephraim Allen lived long enough to see the anti-slavery movement succeed with the ratification of the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment in 1865. Then, after more than twenty years active devotion to that cause, he died peacefully at his home in the South End on January 15, 1869.<sup>11</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>The list of voters is found in \"Voting List of Waltham in 1818,\" <em>Waltham Sentinel</em>, Waltham Massachussets, August 13, 1858, 1.

            "bodyText": "Henry and Julia were enslaved to Dempsey Kemp Gorman who acquired them, along with their two-year-old daughter Luisa, from his parents David and Rebecca Gorman, on March 25, 1848.<br /> <br /> Henry Gordon and Julia Gorman lived as a couple but due to the laws of the day that prevented enslaved people from marrying, they were not married until several years after their emancipation, on March 29, 1869. A year and a half later, on November 18, 1870, Henry traveled to the Land Office of New Orleans to claim a homestead. Henry applied for 35 acres under the Homestead Act of 1862.<br /> <br /> Henry paid $7.00 for the application fee and signed with his mark because he had never learned to read or write. Four years later, Henry and Julia with the help of their children had cultivated 25 of the 35 acres, building a kitchen, corn crib, and a stable.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, on November 5, 1874, a little more than a year before the homestead claim was to be finalized, Henry died, leaving Julia with young children and the uncertainty of how she was going to pay the balance of the agreement. With what must have been a tremendously difficult time, Julia pressed forward and completed the homestead requirements.<br /> <br /> Dempsey Kemp Gorman, Julia's former enslaver, signed as a witness. Julia paid the final application fee balance of 90 cents to become the rightful owner of 35.92 acres of land on December 21, 1875. Due to the difficulty of traveling to the New Orleans land office, Julia was allowed to sign the final documents at the land office of Greensburg in St. Helena Parish. It was a tremendous accomplishment, but even more amazingly, Julia along with her son Frank and son-in-law Albert Jackson acquired and then sold 130 acres to Dempsey Kemp Gorman in July 1877 for the sum of $1,000.00.<br /> <br /> ~ contributed by Rex A.

            "bodyText": "<p>On December 22, 1865, Isaac Wright made his mark with an “X” on his homestead application #2102 at the land office in Booneville, Missouri. His eighty-acre claim in Newton County, Missouri lay adjacent to his former enslaver William Wright’s farm.<br /> <br /> Born into slavery in Tennessee about 1819, Isaac lived in Newton County, Missouri for most of his life. He was married to Lydia Ferguson, an enslaved woman from North Carolina who lived on a nearby farm.<br /> <br /> Isaac and Lydia had five children, four of whom (Thomas, Sarah, Moses, and William) were also born into slavery. According to the story passed down the generations, Isaac was allowed to spend his Saturday nights and Sundays with her and their children on the farm of Lydia’s enslaver, provided he was back on William Wright’s farm by Monday morning.<br /> <br /> After the Civil War, Isaac and Lydia were officially married on March 18, 1866. Their family lived on and worked their claim together. Seborn Samples and James H. Grinestaff, who were witnesses to the improvements Isaac’s family had made to their homestead, reported that Isaac had built “a comfortable house to live in” that was one story, 14 X 35 feet with three doors and a window. It had plank and puncheon floors and a “good stone chimney”.<br /> <br /> In addition to their home, they had constructed a log smokehouse, two log corn cribs, planted twenty-five fruit trees, and fenced in approximately twenty-eight acres of their land.<br /> <br /> Isaac signed his own name on the final affidavit for his homestead on December 22, 1870. It must have been a proud day. His land patent # 180 was delivered on August 1, 1871. Sadly, his beloved wife Lydia had died in 1868 having enjoyed only a few years of freedom as a married couple. Isaac never remarried. His land was passed down to his children after his death in January 1895.<br /> <br /> Additional facts:Known for being a fair and honest man, Isaac Wright is credited with supporting the women and children on the surrounding farms while their menfolk were gone during the Civil War. In a gesture of gratitude after the war, the community stocked a small goods store for Isaac to run.<br /> <br /> Isaac’s mother is listed as born in Africa on the 1880 U.S. Census, though records of her have are yet to be discovered.<br /> <br /> ~ Contributor Erika Lusco<br /> <br /> Erika Lusco is Isaac Wright’s third great granddaughter whose family history research was born from a love of history and a desire to know more about her ancestors’ places in it. Her goal is to find and document the lives of her ancestors, especially those who were enslaved. She resides near Kansas City, MO where she teaches Spanish to young children. Erika would like to thank Carolin Hixon for obtaining and sharing Isaac Wright’s homestead file from the National Archives.

After graduating high school he helped his brother run the family brick contracting business, worked as a postal worker and became husband to Maggie Lena Walker, President of St. Luke Penny Savings Bank.<br /> <br /> Armstead Walker Jr. was born in December, 1860 in Richmond, Virginia. His family operated a brick contracting business in Richmond and was an upper-middle class family. He attended the segregated Richmond Public Schools, where he graduated from in 1875. He began working for his father's construction business in Richmond, learning the ins-and-outs of brick contracting on such buildings as the Leigh St. Armory while becoming well-connected with the upper class of Black Richmond.<br /> <br /> During this time, Armstead would meet Maggie Mitchell, a teacher for Richmond Public Schools. After a courtship, they married on September 14th, 1886 at the First African Baptist Church. The Walker family grew when Maggie L. Walker gave birth three sons born between 1890 and 1897, though it was not without its hardship as their second son would pass away before his first birthday. Armstead would also have a distantly related niece, Margaret \"Polly\" Anderson come live with his family in the mid-1890s.  <br /> <br /> Armstead and his brother Andrew both continued running the family brick contracting business and Armstead also became a mail carrier in 1901, showing his connections in Richmond because mail carrier positions were given through the patronage system during this era. Armstead would also become a part of several organizations and social clubs throughout Richmond, such as the Richmond Athletic Social Club. <br /> <br /> On June 20th, 1915, Armstead Walker would be unexpectedly killed at the hands of his oldest son Russell. Mistaking him for a burglar, Russell used a pistol to fire through a screen on the back porch killing his father. Though he stood trial for murder, Russell was found not guilty but the consequences of his action and Armstead's death would still be felt for the Walker family and the Jackson Ward community.",

            "bodyText": "Russell E.T. Walker was the oldest son of Maggie Lena Walker and Armstead Walker Jr. He would follow in his mother's footsteps by working for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Independent Order of St. Luke and other Black institutions throughout the country, but would tragically pass away at the age of 32 in 1923.<br /> <br /> Russell Eccles Talmadge Walker was born in Richmond, Virginia on December 9th, 1890 to Maggie Lena Walker and Armstead Walker Jr. Growing up, Russell attended the segregated Richmond Public Schools finishing with Richmond Colored Normal School, the same school both of his parents graduated from. After graduating, he took additional accounting classes and would put his education to work by working for his mother's bank, the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank and her fraternal organization, the Independent Order of St. Luke. Russell would also marry Hattie Naomi Frazier, a family friend's daughter, in 1912 living together at the Walker family home at 110 1/2 E. Leigh Street.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck Russell and the Walker family in 1915 when he accidentally killed his father, Armstead Walker Jr., when he believed he was an intruder on their balcony porch. In the aftermath of the shooting, police arrested Russell and tried him for murder but after a stressful trial the jury declared Russell not guilty. The family would still feel the loss of Armstead, with Russell and Melvin without their father, and Maggie L. Walker without her husband of almost 30 years.<br /> <br /> Joy would be brought into the Walker family by Russell and his wife Hattie N.F. Walker with the birth of their daughter, Maggie Laura Walker, on February 16th, 1918. Russell modernized the insurance tables to change the payments on a better cost-benefit analysis based on age and health, helping to increase the success of the Independent Order of St. Luke's insurance policies.<br /> <br /> Russell left Richmond at the beginning of June 1918 to go to the Officer Training Camp at Fort Wayne in Detroit, Michigan. Russell never saw active combat however, as World War I ended before he deployed. Russell spent over a year away from Richmond working in New York City until July 1920, he accepted a job to work in the auditor's office at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee Alabama. He spent only six months working there until he returned to Richmond to again work for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. He continued working for the St. Luke's on and off for the next few years while also spending time in New York and Philadelphia.  Unfortunately, Russell's health took a turn for the worse in 1923 and he would pass away in Philadelphia on November 23, 1923 at the age of 32.<br /> <br /> While Russell would pass away at a very young age, he would be honored for all of his work with the Independent Order of St. Luke during the 1925 Conference in New York. A eulogy was given in his honor at the event and members passed around a memorial card to sign for his family. Although he only spent a couple of years working for the IOSL and the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, he stands as an example of how someone can leave a lasting impact in a short amount of time.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "The story of this area of Virginia starts in 17<sup>th</sup> century Maryland.<br /> <br /> In the 1640s, Maryland was a rougher place than Virginia. Maryland was small-only a few hundred Englishmen and women lived there, making good money by growing tobacco and trading beaver furs with Native American allies as far away as the Great Lakes. During these years, England suffered a civil war which pitted the King against the Puritan-allied Parliament, and affected colonies on this side of the Atlantic. Virginia remained mostly loyal to King Charles, as did Maryland’s ruling Catholic Calvert family. But the war created a chance for Protestants and other rebels, to attack wealthy Calvert-allied Marylanders. Colonists called this The Plundering Time.<br /> <br /> With the internal troubles that Maryland was facing, it was difficult to maintain commercial or farming ventures. Thus, many Marylanders saw in Virginia lots of open land and the peace and quiet Maryland lacked. By the end of the 1650s, a new English community had begun in Virginia. Some of its members were freed Virginia servants looking for land to farm for themselves. Others were former Marylanders seeking some relief from war and Calvert control. One of those men was English-born Nathaniel Pope.<br /> <br /> Pope was already an influential man in Maryland where his great ambition and drive had made him wealthy. He built a home and set up his business on a bluff in what is now Westmoreland State Park and carried on with his tobacco growing, fur trading, and buying and selling land. Pope quickly became one of the community’s most influential residents.<br /> <br /> It makes sense then, that John Washington, George’s great-grandfather, would find his way to Pope’s doorstep when he arrived in Westmoreland County, Virginia in the winter of 1657. By that time, Washington was already an international trader. His business dealings in beaver furs had taken him to Poland and Denmark before he sailed up the Potomac River. Pope and Washington saw the world in similar ways. Both saw advantages to building a relationship and although Pope had his own sons, he quickly brought Washington into the family fold and fortune.<br /> <br /> Pope also had an unmarried daughter named Anne. Within a year, she and Washington married, linking the debt-laden and landless Washington to the Pope’s family name, holdings, and enterprises. With a 700-acre Mattox Creek plantation as a wedding present, John and Anne settled there and began a family.In 1664, John and Anne bought land overlooking nearby Bridges Creek. Here, they built a typical home where they lived with their two children, English servants, and a small number of enslaved Africans Washington had imported from Caribbean traders.<br /> <br /> Washington quickly became a leader in the community, serving in every office in the county from coroner to military commander. Anne brought land to the marriage, as well as social, political, and economic connections through her locally prestigious family name. John Washington, as husband, had the legal standing and skill to manage the family holdings. Together, this colonial power couple established a dynasty that would ultimately change the course of world history.",

Roosevelt</a>.</p> <p>As a child, Elliott suffered seizures. Despite poor health, he was active and competitive—Theodore’s journals document frequent competitions of physical ability between the two brothers. Elliott was the more academically successful and appeared to be the most promising of the four Roosevelt children, but that would change in time. Throughout his life, Elliott maintained a pleasant, but volatile personality bent on self-destruction. </p> <p>The Roosevelt children were schooled at home, as was customary for families of their position. At the age of nine, the family embarked on a year-long grand tour of Europe. The next year, the family journeyed through Egypt, the Holy Land, and eastern and central Europe. Upon returning home, Elliott’s education resumed both abroad and in the south, before he eventually attended the prestigious St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire. Elliott’s seizures continued. He suffered from severe headaches and dizzy spells. His father believed physical activity and an austere lifestyle would be the best cure, so at the age of sixteen, Elliott was sent to Fort McKavett, the well-known frontier outpost in Texas and home to the famous cavalry troop known as the Buffalo Soldiers. Here, Elliott learned to shoot, ride, and camp. He was entertained with legends of the Mexican War and the frontier. The rugged life suited Elliott. He would become an accomplished polo player, sailor, and adventurer.</p> <p>When Elliott returned to New York, his father became gravely ill. A devoted son, Elliott tended to his father’s daily care. Theodore Sr. died on February 10, 1878. The loss of his father’s love and support, weakened Elliott’s stability. He spent two years out west and then travelled through India and the Himalayas, one of the first Americans to travel extensively throughout those places. His adventures were chronicled in the article “Hunting Trip in India,” excerpted from his diary and published posthumously by his brother Theodore. In India, Elliott was surrounded by New York friends, many of them hard-drinking, dedicated sportsmen accustomed to privilege.</p> <p>When Elliott returned from India, he was expected to settle, find direction, and seek employment. At the age of 23, he met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/anna-hall-roosevelt.htm\">Anna Rebecca Hall</a>, an acknowledged beauty of New York society and descendant of two eminent, wealthy families—the Livingstons and the Ludlows. The couple were married on December 1, 1883. The <i>New York Herald</i> described their wedding as “one of the most brilliant social events of the season.” Anna’s great beauty and Elliott’s tales of his adventures made them a popular couple. They lived a life of exclusive clubs, attending cotillions, the opera, and participating in all rituals of New York society. Elliott and Anna had three children—<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Anna Eleanor</a> (1884), Elliott Bulloch (1889), and Gracie Hall (1891). </p> <p>Soon after his marriage, Elliott secured employment with the Ludlow family’s premier real estate establishment. Elliott’s family hoped that Anna would provide stability. But he was unprepared for adulthood, and despite good intentions, Elliott lived a reckless life. His marriage with Anna showed signs of weakness early on due to his depressive nature and growing drinking problem. After only three years, he resigned his post at the Ludlow firm, and his life became characterized by a series of short-lived fresh beginnings, marked by family trips abroad, or seeking treatment in asylum. Things worsened in 1889, after he broke a leg and became addicted to taking large quantities of morphine and laudanum. After Elliott spent some time in a French asylum, he and Anna separated. He was devastated when Anna died in 1892, soon followed by the death of his son Elliott Jr. in 1893. The succession of traumatic events led him into an even steeper decline. At the age of 34, Elliott attempted suicide by jumping out a window. He survived the fall but suffered a seizure and died on August 14, 1894, leaving his young daughter Eleanor and her brother Hall orphans to be raised by family. <br />  </p> <hr /> <p><b>Sources</b></p> <p>The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project</p> <p>David B.

            "bodyText": "<p>Born into slavery, Hilary and Christina Watson became landowners and prominent members of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-americans-and-education-during-reconstruction-the-tolson-s-chapel-schools.htm\">the African American community in Sharpsburg, Maryland during the era of Reconstruction</a> following the Civil War. Christina was born in 1826 in what later became West Virginia, while Hilary was born in Maryland in 1832. When Hilary was less than a year old, John Otto purchased him and his mother to work on Otto’s sixty-acre farm near Sharpsburg. As Hilary Watson grew older, John Otto, unlike most slaveowners, paid Watson for his work during the harvest. Otto also allowed Watson to keep money that he earned from working for other whites. It is not known how Hilary and Christina met, but they married in 1856 while both were enslaved.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, Hilary Watson was living on the Otto farm, and Christina Watson was working in Sharpsburg. Although the Otto family fled the day before the battle, Hilary Watson remained on the farm. Soldiers from both sides took food, firewood, and animal feed. After a few close calls with exploding shells, Watson finally fled the battlefield. When he returned, he found dead and wounded soldiers along the roadside, in the barn, in the house, and in the fields. <br /> <br /> The Watsons became free in 1864, when Maryland abolished slavery. Hilary Watson continued to work on the Otto farm as a hired laborer. The Union Army soon drafted Watson, but John Otto paid $300 to keep him on the farm and out of the war. For Hilary and Christina Watson, emancipation meant that they were finally free to live together, probably for the first time in their eight years of marriage. In 1870, they lived in a rented house in the countryside near Sharpsburg. A few years later, they bought a lot on East High Street near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tolson-s-chapel.htm\">Tolson’s Chapel</a> and constructed a log house. <br /> <br /> The Watsons worked to build and sustain Tolson’s Chapel, the Methodist church that was an important institution in the African American community in Sharpsburg. They likely joined Tolson’s Chapel when it was organized in 1865, and Hilary Watson served as a church trustee. Christina, also known as “Teany,” participated in the Sunday school and was one of a group of women who organized a festival in 1881 to raise funds for the church. <br /> <br /> Having been denied the chance to attend school while enslaved, the Watsons helped make sure that the next generation had the opportunity to get an education. Hilary Watson was a trustee for the public school that met in Tolson’s Chapel from the early 1870s until 1899. The couple sent their daughter Ida to the school in the late 1870s and 1880s, before the law required children to attend school. In 1899, they sold land to the county for the construction of a new schoolhouse for African Americans. The Watsons’ commitment to the church and school illustrates the importance of these institutions in African American communities during Reconstruction.<br /> <br /> In 1913, Hilary Watson was interviewed by author Clifton Johnson about his experiences during the Battle of Antietam. At that time, he and Christina were living in the house on East High Street, where Hilary worked as a broom maker. Christina Watson died in 1915, and Hilary Watson followed two years later. Both are buried in the Tolson’s Chapel Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Other notable people connected to Tolson's Chapel include <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/david-b-simons.htm\">David B.

            "bodyText": "<p>John J. Carter was one of hundreds of African Americans who left their homes in the North after the end of the Civil War to teach freedpeople in the Southern and border states. Born in Pennsylvania, Carter taught in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-americans-and-education-during-reconstruction-the-tolson-s-chapel-schools.htm\">African American schools in Virginia and Maryland from 1868 </a>until his death in 1888.<br /> <br /> Carter was born in 1843 in Pennsylvania. At age 23, he joined the first freshman class at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania. The school was established in 1854 as the Ashmun Institute for the purpose of educating African American men. In 1866, it changed its name to Lincoln University, in honor of the recently deceased President Abraham Lincoln, and added a collegiate course of study.<br /> <br /> After just one year, Carter was promoted directly from the freshman class to the junior class. In the summer after his junior year, he taught for two months in a freedpeople’s school in the small town of Aylett in eastern Virginia. The Freedmen’s Bureau (the federal Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands) assigned him to the school and paid rent on the church building where he taught.<br /> <br /> Carter graduated from Lincoln University in 1869 and almost immediately accepted another teaching assignment from the Freedmen’s Bureau. With financial support from the Presbyterian Home Mission, Carter traveled to Sharpsburg, Maryland to teach a school located in an African American church known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tolson-s-chapel.htm\">Tolson’s Chapel</a> Soon after arriving in Sharpsburg, Carter expressed disappointment with his assignment, partly because of the small size of the school. In November 1869, the Freedmen’s Bureau re-assigned him to the school in Aylett, Virginia. In both Sharpsburg and Aylett, the Presbyterian Home Mission paid his salary, and the local African American community provided him with room and board.<br /> <br /> The Freedmen’s Bureau ended its support for African American schools at the beginning of 1870, but the Presbyterian Home Mission continued to pay Carter’s salary until July. Later that year, Virginia opened racially segregated public schools. Carter was likely one of the two black male teachers in the public schools for African Americans in his district in the 1870-1871 school year. Lincoln University alumni records show that he earned a maste­r’s degree in 1872, but it is not known where he completed his graduate studies.<br /> <br /> With a job in the public school system, Carter settled in Virginia for good. He married in 1872, and he and his wife, Virginia, had six children. In the summer of 1880, he served as census enumerator, probably as a way of earning money during the break between school years. He died in 1888.<br /> <br /> Other notable people connected to Tolson's Chapel include <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/david-b-simons.htm\">David B.

            "bodyText": "<p>Born enslaved in 1789 in Maryland, Josiah Henson fled to Canada where he founded the Dawn Institute, a settlement house which taught trades to freedom seekers. A Methodist preacher, he traveled throughout the United States and Great Britain lecturing against slavery. With the Underground Railroad he assisted over two hundred enslaved people in their flight to Canada.</p> <p>In 1849, Henson published his autobiography entitled <em>The Life of Josiah Henson: Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself</em>. In his narrative, he recounted childhood memories of the sale and separation from his father, and later his five siblings. While enslaved in Kentucky, Henson became a Methodist preacher. In September 1830, after an attempt to purchase his freedom and expecting to be sold in New Orleans, Henson, his wife Charlotte, and their four children escaped across the Ohio River into Indiana, reaching Canada on October 28, 1830.</p> <p>Closing his 76-page autobiography, Henson noted his \"many journeys into New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine, in all of which States I have found or made some friends to the cause, and, I hope, some personal friends. I have received many liberal gifts, and experienced much kindness of treatment...\" Those \"friends to the cause\" included a number of authors and abolitionists. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-beecher-stowe.htm\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> modeled her Uncle Tom character on Henson. In a journal entry for June 26, 1846, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/longfellow-and-abolition.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> vividly describes Josiah Henson’s visit to the his Cambridge home: “In the evening Mr. Henson, a Negro, once a slave, now a preacher, called to get subscription for the school at Dawn, in Upper Canada, for education of blacks. I had a long talk with him, and he gave me an account of his escape from slavery with his family.” Longfellow’s account books record that he gave money to “Father Henson” many times over the next thirty years.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Martha Bulloch Roosevelt was born on July 8, 1835 to Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha Elliott Bulloch (Nee Stewart) in Hartford, Connecticut. It was in Hartford where the newborn Martha's older brother, James Dunwoodie Bulloch was studying. Soon after, Martha and baby 'Mittie' returned to their home in Savannah, Georgia. Four years later, the Bullochs relocated to Cobb County, Georgia to a village that would become Roswell, Georgia. It was here that Major Bulloch became a partner in a cotton mill and had a mansion built. In 1839 the family moved into 'Bulloch Hall'. By 1850, the Bullochs were recognized as a wealthy planter family who owned as many as 33 slaves, most of whom worked in their cotton fields.</p> <p>On December 22, 1853, Mittie married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/theodorerooseveltsr.htm\">Theodore Roosevelt Sr</a>. at Bulloch Hall in the formal dining room. Soon after, the newlyweds moved into their new home at 28 East 20th Street in New York City. The home was a wedding present from Cornelius Van Schaack Roosevelt. Mittie bore four children: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/annaroosevelt.htm\">Anna </a>(1855), Theodore (1858), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/elliottroosevelt.htm\">Elliott </a>(1860), and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/corinneroosevelt.htm\">Corinne </a>(1861).</p> <p>Mittie was considered a true southern belle who possessed great beauty, charm, and spirit. It is believed that the character of Scarlett O'Hara in Margaret Mitchell's novel 'Gone with the Wind' is partly based on her. Mittie was an unreconstructed confederate until the day she died, and her brothers James and Irvine served for the Confederate forces. Theodore Roosevelt Sr. did his part to support the Union forces as an Allotment Commissioner who met with President Lincoln and lobbied Congress for programs to support the northern troops.</p> <p>In 1872, the Roosevelts acquired a new family home on 6 West 57th Street. This is where Mittie resided until her death due to typhoid fever on February 14, 1884. She was forty eight years old and died on the same day as her son Theodore's first wife, Alice Lee Roosevelt who died of Bright's disease. This resulted as a complication of childbirth with Mittie's granddaughter Alice. Martha Bulloch Roosevelt is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Deftly negotiating between Hispano, Anglo, and American Indian worlds throughout her life, Adelina Isabel Emilia Luna Otero was born on October 23, 1881 on her family’s hacienda near Los Lunas, New Mexico.</p> <p>The Otero family were wealthy and politically powerful in the Rio Abajo (Lower River) region of what is now <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210103000748/https://www.nps.gov/articles/new-mexico-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">New Mexico</a>. The family of her mother, Eloisa Luna Otero, were descended from some of the earliest colonists in New Mexico; the family of her father, Manuel B. Otero, traced his lineage to the Spanish occupation of the area in the 1700s. As a child, she was known as Adelina Otero; as an adult, friends and family called her Nina.</p> <p>Once railroads arrived in the region in 1881, white immigrants (known as Anglos) began traveling west in large numbers, actively displacing the Native American, Spanish, and Mexican populations who were already there (though the Spanish had already displaced many of the Indigenous people of the area). When Nina was not quite two years old, her father was shot and killed by an Anglo squatter who had moved on to the family’s land. A few years later, in 1886, her mother remarried. Alfred Maurice Bergere, who had family roots in Italy, was an Englishman who immigrated to the United States when he was sixteen years old. An Anglo, he was among those who moved west, arriving in New Mexico in 1880. Nina grew up in a household of twelve children, including her two younger brothers and her nine half siblings.</p> <p>All of the Bergere children were educated. Nina attended St. Vincent’s Academy in Albuquerque until she was eleven years old, when she went to St. Louis Missouri to attend Maryville College of the Sacred Heart (now Maryville University) for two more years. She returned home to her family’s hacienda when she was 13. She helped educate her siblings and contributed to the work on the family ranch -- experiences she recorded in her book, Old Spain in Our Southwest.</p> <p>The family moved to Santa Fe in the New Mexico Territory when Nina was sixteen, after Alfred Bergere was hired as a judicial clerk.[1] Nina became a regular fixture in the social life of the Santa Fe elite, described as “a graceful, intelligent young woman with an indomitable disposition,” and “high spirited and independent.” She met her husband, Rawson D. Warren, in 1907. Thirty five years old, he was the commanding officer of the Fifth US Cavalry stationed at Fort Wingate, near Gallup, New Mexico.[2] Nina, who was 26 at the time, married Warren on June 25, 1908 becoming Nina Otero-Warren.  After their Santa Fe wedding, Nina and Rawson moved back to Fort Wingate. Unhappy in her marriage, Nina divorced her husband after only two years, and returned to Santa Fe.</p> <p>Since divorce was strongly frowned upon in both Anglo and Hispano cultures, Nina described herself as a widow, and kept Otero-Warren as her last name. She became active in New Mexico politics, and worked towards women’s suffrage. In 1912 she moved to New York City to keep house for her younger half-brother, Luna Bergere, who was studying at Columbia University. While in New York City, Nina volunteered at a settlement house in the city.[3] When Nina’s mother died in 1914, she -- the eldest daughter -- moved back to Santa Fe, and as was expected of her, took over the household duties, which she took up as well as her activist work. Her suffrage work caught the attention of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210103000748/https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a>, who tapped Nina in 1917 to head the New Mexico chapter of the Congressional Union (precursor to the National Woman’s Party). Paul and other suffragists had realized that the support of Hispano’s in New Mexico was crucial to winning suffrage; Nina was an ideal choice. She insisted that suffrage literature be published in both English and Spanish, in order to reach the widest audience.</p> <p>Nina certainly had enough family money that she did not have to work. And yet, in 1918, while still working for suffrage and taking care of her family, Otero-Warren took the job as Superintendent of Public Schools in Santa Fe County -- a job she held until 1929, working to improve the conditions in rural Hispano and Native American communities. During this time, the federal government was pressuring for assimilation of non-whites, including Native American and Hispano people, into white America. This assimilation meant loss of traditional language, customs, and often family ties. As Superintendent of Public Schools, Nina worked to balance the demands of the federal government and her pride in her Spanish cultural heritage. For example, she argued that both Spanish and English be allowed in schools, despite the federal mandate of English-only. For a few years beginning in 1923, she was also appointed Santa Fe County’s Inspector of Indian Schools. She was angered by what she observed in the schools, and criticized the federal government’s Indian school system for the terrible conditions she observed.<br />  <br /> In 1921, Otero-Warren ran for federal office, campaigning to be the Republican Party nominee for New Mexico to the US House of Representatives. She won the nomination, but lost the election by less than nine percent. She remained politically and socially active, and served as the Chairman of New Mexico’s Board of Health; an executive board member of the American Red Cross; and director of an adult literacy program in New Mexico for the Works Projects Administration.</p> <p>Throughout her life, Nina was known both for her proper, mannered expectations of others and her unconventional personal life. Nina never remarried or had children of her own, but served as “La Nina” or godmother to her siblings, nieces and nephews, and arguably to her community. In the early 1930s, she and her partner Mamie Meadors  -- whom she had met in the 1920s -- homesteaded, establishing a ranch called “Las Dos” (The Two Women) twelve miles outside of Santa Fe. They paid $67.40 for two homestead applications, and agreed to spend an average of five months a year living on their homestead, and to improve the land by building two houses, fencing the property (1,257 acres), cultivating the land, and maintaining the road for five years. Meeting these homesteading requirements, spelled out in the Homesteading Act of 1862, meant that they received title to the land. In 1947, Nina and Mamie established a real estate and insurance company, also called “Las Dos” in Santa Fe. When Mamie died in 1951, Nina continued running the business until her death. Whether their relationship was intimate is unknown, but they lived and worked together for over twenty years. Later in life, Nina was as a “regular annual apparition” at Santa Fe’s Hysterical/Historical parade with openly-gay poet, Witter Bynner.<br />  <br /> It was in the 1930s that Nina took to writing. In May 1931, she wrote “My People” for an issue of Survey Graphic with the theme of “Mexicans in Our Midst: Newest and Oldest Settlers of the Southwest.” Other contributors to this issue included D.H. Lawrence, Ansel Adams, Diego Rivera, and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210103000748/https://www.nps.gov/places/okeeffehomeandstudio.htm\">Georgia O’Keeffe</a>. Her book, Old Spain in Our Southwest was published in 1936.</p> <p>Nina died on January 3, 1965 in the Santa Fe home she grew up in. She had been administering the property after the death of her brother two years’ prior.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> [1] New Mexico did not become a state until 1910. The Alfred M.

            "bodyText": "<p>Theodore, Sr. had a tremendous influence on his son, and in adulthood, the younger Roosevelt wrote about his father in his autobiography: \"[he was]...the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness tenderness and great unselfishness....[he was] a big, powerful man, with a leonine face, and his heart filled with gentleness for those who needed help or protection, with the possibility of much wrath against a bully or an oppressor.\" (p.7,10)</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt Sr. was born on September 22, 1831 in New York City. He was the youngest of Cornelius Van Schaack Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill's five sons. He was a seventh-generation Dutch New Yorker and participant in the Roosevelt family business of plate-glass importing, Roosevelt and Son.<br /> <br /> Theodore Sr. married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/marthabullochroosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Martha Bulloch</span></a> on December 22, 1853 at Bulloch Hall in Roswell, Georgia. The Roosevelts had four children, each of whom had a nickname: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/annaroosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Anna</span></a> (\"Bamie\"), Theodore (\"Teedie\"), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/elliottroosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Elliott</span></a> (\"Ellie\"), and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/corinneroosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Corinne</span></a> (\"Conie\"). Theodore Sr. and Martha were known as 'Thee' and 'Mittie'. Theodore Sr. was also the grandfather of Eleanor Roosevelt, Elliott's daughter.</p> <p>Roosevelt Sr. was a noted New York City philanthropist. involved in a variety of charity work including the Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and a Newsboys Lodging Home. Additionally, he was a founder of the American Museum of Natural History (the charter of which was accepted in Theodore's front parlor at 28 E 20th St.), the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Orthopedic Hospital. President Rutherford B. Hayes nominated Theodore Roosevelt for the position of Collector of Customs in the Port of New York, a job with great political and economic influence at the time and one which controlled thousands of jobs within the Custom House. However, Roosevelt lost the nomination to Chester A. Arthur. Theodore Sr. wrote to his son at Harvard \"a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\"  </p> <p>To combat Teedie's poor physical condition, Theodore Sr. encouraged the young Roosevelt to take up exercise. To deal with bullies, he started boxing lessons. Two trips abroad had a permanent impact: family tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and of the Middle East 1872 to 1873.<br /> <br /> Theodore Sr. was an active supporter of the Union during the Civil War. He was one of the Charter Members of the Union League Club, which was founded to promote the Northern cause. During the war, he and two friends, William E. Dodge, Jr. and Theodore B. Bronson, drew up an Allotment System, which amounted to a soldier's payroll deduction program to support families back home. It was perhaps because of Martha's active support of the Confederate Army that Theodore Sr. hired a substitute (Abraham Graff) to fulfill his draft obligation in the Army of the Potomac.<br /> <br /> He died on February 9, 1878 at the age of 46 from a gastrointestinal tumor which caused him great pain for months, and prevented him from eating. Initially, he kept the extent of his illness from his son, who was away attending Harvard. At the end, however, Theodore Jr. was informed and immediately took a train from Cambridge to New York, where he missed his father's death by a few hours.</p> <p><br />  </p>",

Higginson attended abolitionist meetings at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/faneuil-hall.htm\">Faneuil Hall</a> and wrote abolitionist poems for <em>The Liberator</em> newspaper.<sup>2</sup> A radical abolitionist, Higginson believed that the Union should not be preserved if it meant maintaining slavery,<sup>3</sup> a position he held until the outbreak of the Civil War.<sup>4</sup> This activism took Higginson away from Harvard for over a year, before he returned in 1847 to finish his studies and begin his career as a Unitarian minister.</p> <p>Higginson started preaching in nearby Newburyport. Despite the support of his congregation, the church’s board opposed his radical abolitionism, which led to his resignation only two years later.<sup>5</sup> He continued his work on abolition, temperance, and education in Newburyport for two more years.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>In 1851, Higginson joined the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a> in response to the Fugitive Slave Law, which he described as a \"cruel and unrighteous bill.\"<sup>7</sup> After the arrest of freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-the-whole-land-is-full-of-blood-the-thomas-sims-case.htm\">Thomas Sims</a> in Boston that same year, Higginson gave an impassioned speech at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tremont-temple.htm\">Tremont Temple</a> arguing in favor of storming the courthouse to save the imprisoned man, though an attack did not materialize.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Despite the lack of direct action for Thomas Sims, the arrest of freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a> in 1854 saw Higginson leading a rescue attempt at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-courthouse.htm\">courthouse</a>. A small group, including Higginson and abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a>, waited at the courthouse while a mass meeting occurred at Faneuil Hall. They hoped to use the large crowd to storm and overwhelm the courthouse. Confusion and miscommunication prevented a coordinated attack, but Higginson and those gathered with him proceeded to break down the door to the courthouse. Federal agents inside beat back the crowd with clubs, and Higginson suffered a cut to the face.<sup>9</sup> The attack did not succeed and the court ordered Burns back to slavery, despite a protest of nearly fifty thousand people in Boston. Federal agents arrested Higginson two weeks later for his role in the attack, but soon dropped the charges.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>Higginson continued supporting direct action against slavery by assisting in the protection of freedom seekers in Boston and financially supporting <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a> in his mission to instigate an armed slave revolt in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The small group of influential White abolitionists backing Brown’s mission became known collectively as the Secret Six. Many of those who had supported Brown fled the country upon his arrest, fearing possible retribution.<sup>11</sup> Higginson felt it necessary to remain \"to at least give [Brown] their moral support on the witness stand.\" <sup>12</sup></p> <p>In addition to his radical abolitionism, Higginson also advocated for women’s suffrage. In 1853, Higginson spoke at the Women’s Suffrage Convention in New York City. He developed a strong friendship with suffragist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-stone.htm\">Lucy Stone</a>.<sup>13</sup> He later officiated Stone’s marriage to Henry Blackwell where he read and signed her public letter protesting the lack of property rights for married women.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>During the Civil War, Higginson commanded the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, a regiment comprised entirely of Black soldiers freed from slavery. While the Emancipation Proclamation allowed for Black soldiers to serve, the Army still required White officers to command them. Higginson addressed this in his Civil War memoir, stating:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>We, their officers, did not go there to teach lessons, but to receive them. There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred in all their lives.<sup>15</sup> </em></p> <p>After the War, Higginson continued to advocate for women’s suffrage, temperance, and later labor rights as a writer and preacher until his death in 1911.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Mary Thacher Higginson, <em>Thomas Wentworth Higginson: The Story of His Life</em> (United Kingdom: Houghton Mifflin, 1914), 41.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Thomas Wentworth Higginson</em>, 73.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Thomas Wentworth Higginson</em>, 76.</li> <li>“Circular,” <em>The Liberator</em>, August 21, 1857, 4.</li> <li>Stephen Kantrowitz, <em>More Than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic, 1829-1889</em> (United States: Penguin Publishing Group, 2012), 104-105.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Thomas Wentworth Higginson</em>, 107-108.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Thomas Wentworth Higginson</em>, 111.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Thomas Wentworth Higginson</em>, 112.</li> <li>Thomas Wentworth Higginson, <em>Cheerful Yesterdays</em> (United States: Houghton, Mifflin, 1898), 154.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Cheerful Yesterdays</em>, 166.</li> <li>Kantrowitz, <em>More Than Freedom</em>, 250-251.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Cheerful Yesterdays</em>, 224.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Cheerful Yesterdays</em>, 135.</li> <li>Higginson, <em>Cheerful Yesterdays</em>, 137.</li> <li>Thomas Wentworth Higginson, <em>Army Life in a Black Regiment</em> (United Kingdom: Houghton, Mifflin, 1900), 331.</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Loammi Baldwin Jr.'s extraordinary abilities as an expert civil engineer brought him governmental and corporate projects up and down the East Coast. Local governments funded two trips to Europe during which he explored large-scale engineering projects.<sup>1</sup> Praise from his own era rings down through the years; Baldwin is still seen as \"the Father of Civil Engineering in America.\"<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Loammi Baldwin Jr. grew up in Woburn, Massachusetts, where the Baldwin family had deep roots. The Baldwins were among the first to settle in Woburn, incorporated in 1640, and had social status and political and economic influence.<sup>3</sup> Loammi Baldwin Jr. attended the then-private Westford Academy<sup>4</sup> and graduated from Harvard College in 1800. His studies of mechanical subjects were unusual and were not offered at Harvard. His nuclear family begged to differ with Harvard on the importance of civil engineering. Baldwin Jr., starting at age 14, and his four older brothers worked with their father on the ten-year project of constructing the Middlesex Canal, a 27-mile (44-kilometer) barge canal connecting the Merrimack River with the port of Boston.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>After a three-year stint as a lawyer in Groton and in his own office in Cambridge, Baldwin Jr. returned to engineering. With explorations of England's public works financed by the City of Boston under his belt, in 1807 he opened an engineering office in Charlestown.<sup>6</sup> There, as chief engineer working for the military and with the rank of Colonel, he focused on projects for the U.S. Navy.<sup>7</sup> The U.S. Navy believed Baldwin Jr. could assist with tightening up coastal defense as they prepared for a pending war. The U.S. Navy needed expert civil engineers who could design modern shipbuilding facilities that would make possible modern Naval defense and shipbuilding along the East Coast.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>One of Loammi Baldwin Jr.'s earliest engineering works for the military was Fort Strong (1814). He led the design and construction of this earthwork on Noddle’s Island, one of the strong forts in Boston Harbor for defense against the British Navy during the War of 1812.<sup>9</sup> Boston and other cities invited him to take part in many important engineering projects in the community and elsewhere.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>After the war ended, in July 1816, Baldwin Jr. married Anna Williams of Salem.<sup>11</sup> She joined him at his Charlestown domicile, built on Main St. in 1807.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>If he had not been known to Boston's male leadership networks due to his father's role in the long Middlesex Canal project, by 1825 Loammi Baldwin Jr.'s own performance would have opened the door for him. In that year, he was asked to join the Bunker Hill Monument Association (BHMA), which recognized and praised his contributions to the planning of the Monument's construction.<sup>13</sup> Baldwin Jr.'s skills as a civil engineer were needed to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/building-the-bunker-hill-monument.htm\">plan, design, and execute construction of the Bunker Hill Monument</a>. Straightaway, he recommended an obelisk form, and then supported the concrete design submitted by architect Solomon Willard.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>Besides his involvement in this Bostonian civilian project, in 1827 Loammi Baldwin Jr. accepted an appointment from the United States to design and construct the naval dry docks at Charlestown, as well as at Norfolk, Virginia. Before he accepted the U.S. Navy’s commission to design and construct the dry docks, however, Baldwin Jr. insisted on complete and unrestricted control of the projects, which the Navy granted.<sup>15</sup> His Charlestown Dry Dock 1, built 1827-1833, can be visited at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a>. It is still in use today, albeit enlarged several times since Loammi Baldwin Jr. supervised its construction.<sup>16</sup> As a three-sided basin filled with, then drained of, water, a dry dock is an ingenious solution for the challenge of repairing a ship’s underside. Baldwin engineered an intricate complex of masonry, engines, pumps, reservoir, tunnels, culverts, valves, and gates—in effect a huge well-coordinated machine. The Charlestown and the Norfolk Dry Docks were the first such naval structures in the United States.<sup>17</sup> By 1833, Baldwin Jr.'s engineering skills were in demand; up and down the East Coast, he led all manner of large-scale projects that supported internal improvements the cities and companies were undertaking at that formative period in the United States.<sup>18</sup></p> <p>In 1828, Loammi Baldwin Jr. married Catherine Beckford of Charlestown, his first wife having died in 1821.<sup>19</sup></p> <p>Baldwin Jr. died at Charlestown, Massachusetts on June 30, 1838, at the age of fifty-eight, about a year after he suffered a paralytic stroke. He was buried in his hometown of Woburn.<sup><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">20</span></sup> There, he is a well-remembered local hero. His descendants and the Middlesex Canal Association’s museum keep the community interest alive. The <a href=\"https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/\">USS <em>Constitution</em> Museum</a> has brought his memory back into the national foreground, honoring the feat of his Dry Dock 1 construction in 2015 when the <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/USS-CONSTITUTION/\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a> entered it for repair.<sup>21</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"Woburnites: The Family of Baldwin,\" <a href=\"http://yeoldewoburn.net/Baldwin.htm\">http://yeoldewoburn.net/Baldwin.htm</a> - source: W.R.

            "bodyText": "<p>This is the story of how a dog helped save a small Alaskan town...<br /> <br /> In 1925, diphtheria swept through the small Alaskan town of Nome. Located 2 degrees south of the Arctic Circle, Nome was home to 455 Alaskan Natives and 975 European settlers.  Between November and July, the port into Nome on the southern shore of Seward Peninsula in the Bering sea was icebound and inaccessible by steamship. During this time the only link to the rest of the world, was the Iditarod Trail, which runs 938 miles from the port of Seward to Nome.<br /> Several months before the winter of 1924-1925, Curtis Welch, the only doctor in Nome, ordered more diphtheria antitoxin. Dr. Welch had discovered that the batch at the 25-bed Maynard Columbus Hospital had expired. Unfortunately, the shipment did not arrive before the port closed for the winter. Within days of the last ship leaving the port, Dr. Welch treated a few children for what he first diagnosed as tonsillitis. Over the next few weeks, the cases on tonsillitis grew and four children died. Dr. Welch began to get concerned about the possibility of diphtheria.<br /> <br /> By mid-January, Dr. Welch made the first official diagnosis of diphtheria in a three-year old boy; the child later died two weeks after displaying the first symptoms. The next day a seven-year old girl died.  Realizing that an epidemic was imminent, Dr. Welch called Mayor George Maynard to arrange an emergency meeting. A quarantine was immediately implemented. Despite this, there were over 20 confirmed cases of diphtheria and at least 50 more at risk by the end of the month. Without antitoxin, they believed that the  mortality rate could be close to 100 percent.<br /> <br /> Since no plane or ship could reach the isolated town, a unanimous decision was made to use multiple dogsled teams to transport the medicine across the dangerous land. Though Balto often gets the credit for saving the town of Nome, it was Togo, a Siberian Husky, who led his team across the most dangerous leg of the journey.<br /> <br /> Named after Heihachiro Togo, a Japanese Admiral who fought in the war between Russia and Japan (1904-05), Togo was the lead sled dog of Leonhard Seppala. Seppala was a Norwegian breeder and racer of Siberian huskies from the Chukchi Inuit stock of Siberia. Togo was dark brown with cream, black and grey markings. He had ice blue eyes and weighed about 48 pounds at maturity. As a puppy, Togo developed a painful throat disorder that caused Seppala to lose interest in him. Eventually Seppala gave Togo up for adoption. Togo refused to be parted from Seppala and his teams and later escaped his adoptee's home by jumping through a window. A troublesome and mischievous puppy, Togo harassed Seppala's teams when he was harnessing up a team or whenever they were on a trail. To keep him calm, Seppala harnessed Togo in one of the wheel position directly in front of the sled. Through his journey to take a miner to Dime Creek, Seppala moved Togo up the line until he was sharing the lead position with the lead dog, named Russky. During his first day in the harness, Togo ran over 75 miles, a distance unheard of for an inexperienced young sled dog.<br /> By the time Togo led his team over 261 miles during the Great Race of Mercy to deliver diphtheria anti-toxin, he was 12 years old. Though Balto received the credit for saving the town, to those who know more than the Disney story, Balto is considered the backup dog. Balto ran 55 miles, while Togo's leg of the journey was the longest and most dangerous.<br /> Togo retired in Poland Spring, Maine, where he was euthanized at the age of 16.  Following his death, Seppala had Togo custom mounted. The mounted skin was put on display at the Shelbourne Museum in Vermont. Today, the mounted skin is on display at the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race Headquarters museum in Wasilla, Alaska  following a campaign by Alaskan students to return Togo to Alaska. The Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University houses the skeletal remains in their collection.<br />  <br /> What Makes Togo an American Hero? Despite rough beginnings, Togo saved the lives of thousands of people. In 1960, Seppala said that \"I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty and intelligence could not be improved upon. Togo was the best dog that ever traveled the Alaska trail.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>",

He was born and raised on the north slope of Beacon Hill, a racially diverse neighborhood and a center of the abolitionist movement in the city. From the very start of his public career, he decried the expansion of slavery, openly denouncing both the enslavers of the South and the textile manufacturers of the North who supported the institution. Around this time, Sumner acted as co-counsel in a case, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-sarah-roberts-case.htm\"><em>Roberts v. City of Boston</em></a>, that challenged the segregation of Boston’s public school system. Utilizing the argument that segregation in schools went against the statutes of Massachusetts and that separate could not possibly be equal, the case reached the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Though Sumner’s side lost, the case served as precedent in the landmark trial <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brvb/index.htm\"><em>Brown v. Board of Education</em></a> just over a century later.</p> <p>With the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, Sumner was elected to the U.S Senate on an anti-slavery platform and quickly gained a reputation as a fierce and uncompromising abolitionist champion. His stance became especially apparent in conversations surrounding the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Senator <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/stephen-a-douglas.htm\">Stephen Douglas</a> of Illinois shaped the law around the concept of popular sovereignty: the belief that territories should decide for themselves whether they enter the country as free or slave states. This law quickly led to violence and bloodshed in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, as both pro- and antislavery advocates flocked there to sway the votes. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/bleeding-kansas.htm\">“Bleeding Kansas”</a> conflict prompted Sumner to give his most famous speech: “The Crimes Against Kansas,” which condemned the institution of slavery and some of the senators who participated in it. Two days later, on the floor of the Senate, South Carolina Congressman Preston S. Brooks beat him senseless with a cane in retribution. Sumner never fully recovered. He remained absent from the senate for three years, his empty senate seat serving as a symbol of the brutality of the South.</p> <p>Returning to the Senate in 1859, Sumner once again threw himself into his work. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he forced himself into the inner circle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. He encouraged the President to issue the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-emancipation-proclamation.htm\">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, advocated for the creation of all-Black regiments, and played a key role in the passage of the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment in the Senate.</p> <p>Though abolition constituted his primary crusade, Sumner championed other causes beyond the ending of slavery. In the aftermath of the Civil War, Sumner fought against U.S. imperialistic expansion and anti-immigration policy. He primarily focused, however, on the passage of a comprehensive civil rights bill. The bill guaranteed all citizens, regardless of color, equal access to public accommodations and the right to serve on juries. The bill passed after his death, albeit in a watered-down form. Just a few years later, the Supreme Court struck the law down as unconstitutional, and Congress did not pass a similar version of the bill again until the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.</p> <p>Largely a lifelong bachelor, Sumner maintained deep friendships and was considered a member of the Longfellow family circle. After Sumner’s death at the age of 63, the poet <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> memorialized him with an elegy:</p> <blockquote> <p>His was the troubled life,<br /> The conflict and the pain,<br /> The grief, the bitterness of strife,<br /> The honor without stain.</p> </blockquote>",

It is typical of many of the early ranchers who settled in this part of West Texas. In his rough life Segura worked as a cook, butcher, baker, carpenter, ranch hand, sheep herder, and fence and corral builder. The life of this hard working man is just one story woven into the tapestry that makes up the rich cultural history of Guadalupe Mountains.<br /> <br /> Geronimo Morales was born on September 30, 1880 to Roque Segura and Refugia Morales. His mother, Refugia Morales, was a Mescalero Apache, while his father Roque also claimed Indian Heritage. Roque Segura spent much of his time with the people indigenous to the Texas and Ojinaga, Mexico, border. It was here that he met and married Refugia.<br /> <br /> Roque was a well known story teller and medicine man who made his own herbal remedies from local plants. He was a religious man who taught his family and friends to read the Bible and to live by its teachings. As his son Geronimo was growing up, Roque taught him the art of basket weaving as well as the gathering of agaves and the baking of mescal.<br /> <br /> Geronimo grew up in West Texas in the area around Marfa and Valentine. He worked around the small towns of Marathon, Alpine, Ruidosa, Fort Davis, Kent, and Shafter. In Shafter, Geronimo met and married a Mexican girl named Estanislada Bustamante Duran on February 2, 1902. At the time, Geronimo was 22 years old and Estanislada was 17.<br /> <br /> After getting married, Geronimo went to work for a rancher named Bill Runnels at a canyon deep in the Davis Mountains. He and Estanislada lived in the dugout that Geronimo built in the canyon. Their new home was a mud and rock dwelling with doors and windows covered with canvas, which was later replaced with split logs or pine posts. The couple used burros to travel up and down the canyon. While living in the dugout in the Davis Mountains, Estanislada gave birth to three children; Leon in 1903, Carmelita in 1904, and Refugia “Cuquita” in 1905. All three children died at very young ages.<br /> <br /> In 1906, after the deaths of their three children, Geronimo and Estanislada build a home in Valentine. There Estanislada gave birth to six children; Matilde in 1907, Luisa in 1909, Eusebio in 1910, Sesaria in 1912, Guadalupe in 1914, and Refugia #2 in 1916. The children attended public school in Valentine while Geronimo started up a business. He used his wagon and team of mules to go up into the Davis Mountains to cut, haul, and sell pine timber posts to ranchers to use for fencing.<br /> <br /> In 1918, Geronimo sold the house he had built in Valentine and moved his family to Loving in Eddy County, NM, where he built another dugout at a location known as Rabbit Hill. Geronimo first went to work farming for a grocery store owner named Mr. Pardue. Later he worked for Mr. Snyder, who owned a slaughter house and grocery store. He and Estanislada, who were both excellent cooks, ran a small bakery specializing in home-made pastries, bread, rolls, Indian bread, pumpkin or sweet potato empanadas, and Mexican food. While living in Loving, Estanislada gave birth to three more children: Santiago in 1918, Roberto in 1920, and Rosa in 1922. In 1923, Geronimo and Estanisalda moved to Black River Village, where they lived until 1925. Two more children were born there, Jose Luis in 1924 and Enrique in 1925.<br /> <br /> Geronimo began to grow tired of working other people’s land and dreamed of one day owning his own land. After hearing about land for sale in Fabens, Texas he made a trip south. He only got as far as the XT Ranch, where he found out there was rangeland available for homesteading at Washington Ranch, just a few miles north of the New Mexico State line. In 1929, Geronimo began working for Bill Washington, farming land and planting beans, corn, and cattle feed. On October 28, 1929 Mr. Washington drove Geronimo to Roswell to make a claim with the General Land Office for 158 acres near Washington Ranch. Geronimo immediately set out to build a home on his newly acquired land, while Estanislada gave birth to the couple’s 15<sup>th</sup> child, Lily. The ruins of their two room dwelling can still be seen on the left side of the road leading to Washington Ranch.<br /> <br /> Eventually Bill Washington and Geronimo had a falling out and Bill began to harass Geronimo to give up his land. Several disputes and even a couple of gun fights over land and water rights ensued.<br /> <br /> In 1929, Geronimo Segura went to work for Dolph Williams. Williams was a rancher who owned cattle, horses, and goats on the west side of the Guadalupe Mountains. Geronimo cared for Dolph Williams’ goats by moving them around to better pastures and conducting wool shearing. During this time, Geronimo built a two room dugout at the base of El Capitan near Guadalupe Spring. The remains of this dugout can still be seen today under a huge alligator juniper tree. Geronimo’s oldest children came to the Guadalupe Mountains to help him care for the goats.<br /> <br /> They all lived in the dugout and would periodically travel back to Washington Ranch to check on the rest of the family. During the five years that Geronimo worked for Dolph Williams he acquired over 600 goats.Geronimo taught his children to work for what they needed in life. His oldest daughters, Luisa, Sesaria, Guadalupe, and Refugia, found work at the Pine Springs Café located in Guadalupe Pass. Walter and Bertha Glover operated a small grocery store, gas station, and rental cabins. The girls helped clean the cabins and sold gas. The Segura children all grew up to be hard workers like their parents. Some of the children saved money from their jobs to order clothes from Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs.<br /> <br /> In 1933, Geronimo decided to leave the Guadalupes and head east to Kent, Texas where he started up a goat sheering business. With the help of his older children and his brother-in-law, Casimiro Florez, he moved his goats toward Van Horn and then on to Kent. He had purchased a truck to move the smaller goats, while the adult goats walked the entire way.<br /> <br /> In 1935, the long, hard struggles in his life finally caught up with Geronimo when he caught double pneumonia and died at the age of 55. He Left his family with a rich cultural heritage and an appreciation for work and success in life. Today, the ruins of Geronimo Segura’s dugout still stand as a monument to the resourcefulness and pioneering spirit of the early ranches.",

Later in life he served as American Minister to Spain and Great Britain.</p> <p>Lowell wrote many articles and poems upholding the principles of abolitionism. His poems may have been inspired by his wife, Maria White Lowell, who strongly opposed slavery as well. In 1845 he became a regular editorial writer for the <em>Pennsylvania Freeman</em>, a fortnightly journal devoted to the anti-slavery cause. In spring of 1848 he agreed to contribute either a poem or a prose article each week to the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em> of New York.</p> <p>“Mr. Lowell is one of the most rabid of the Abolition fanatics; and no Southerner who does not wish to be insulted, and at the same time revolted by a bigotry the most obstinately blind and deaf, should ever touch a volume by this author,” wrote Edgar Allan Poe in his 1848 review of Lowell’s <em>The Biglow Papers</em>.</p> <p>His poem called “The Present Crisis,” written in 1844, called on readers to take a stand against slavery:</p> <blockquote> <p>When a deed is done for Freedom, through the broad earth's aching breast<br /> Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on from east to west,<br /> And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels the soul within him climb<br /> To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy sublime<br /> Of a century bursts full-blossomed on the thorny stem of Time.</p> </blockquote> <p>The poem provided inspiration at the time and for years to come: in 1910, the leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chose to call their new publication “The Crisis” after Lowell’s poem.</p>",

Fearful that Americans of Japanese descent would side with the Japanese, President <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/franklin-d-roosevelt.htm\">President Franklin D.

For most of the war, they were incarcerated at a confinement site in Jerome, Arkansas.[1] In her diary, Kochiyama maintained a positive outlook, but also described the anger of other incarcerees and her exposure to racism. Despite her confinement, Kochiyama urged other incarcerees to write letters of support to Japanese American soldiers serving in the U.S. military. <br /> <br /> In 1944, Kochiyama volunteered to work at an all-Japanese, segregated United Service Organizations (USO) Center in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, so that she could get out of the incarceration site in Jerome. The USO Center provided programs and entertainment for active-duty service members at Camp Shelby Army Base. There, she met William “Bill” Kochiyama. Because Bill was Japanese American, he was incarcerated in Topaz, Utah.[2] He enlisted in the U.S. Army 442nd Regimental Combat Team to escape the confinement site and prove his patriotism. Working at the USO in Hattiesburg, Yuri witnessed Jim Crow segregation for the first time. In this new context, she gained a new understanding of race that she did not have in California.</p> <h4 paraeid=\"{6cd5ca9e-48f8-44ac-9a90-9e973001a8ec}{140}\" paraid=\"1315932830\">Early Activism </h4> <p paraeid=\"{6cd5ca9e-48f8-44ac-9a90-9e973001a8ec}{146}\" paraid=\"390451919\">Yuri and Bill Kochiyama married in 1946. During their 47-year marriage, they raised six children and supported several activist causes. The Kochiyamas moved to the Amsterdam Houses near Lincoln Center in New York City. In December 1960, they moved into the Manhattanville Housing Projects in Harlem. Living and working in Harlem exposed them to the Black and Puerto Rican communities’ struggles for freedom, which sparked Kochiyama’s interest in civil rights activism. In 2004, she explained:</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{6cd5ca9e-48f8-44ac-9a90-9e973001a8ec}{146}\" paraid=\"390451919\">“I didn’t wake up and decide to become an activist.

Kochiyama also became well known for her behind-the-scenes work. She made flyers, wrote newsletters, and corresponded with prisoners in the Black freedom struggle and other movements. Knowing how important morale was for a movement, Kochiyama encouraged other activists to send birthday cards and care packages to prisoners, not just demonstrate outside of detention facilities. </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{6d215a77-11f9-4910-bb0d-71d4eeebbad0}{47}\" paraid=\"1795360330\">The Impact of Malcolm X </h4> <p paraeid=\"{6d215a77-11f9-4910-bb0d-71d4eeebbad0}{59}\" paraid=\"844825910\">Meeting <a href=\"http://nps.gov/semo/learn/historyculture/malcolm-x.htm\">Ma</a><a href=\"http://nps.gov/semo/learn/historyculture/malcolm-x.htm\">lcolm X</a> in October 1963 transformed Kochiyama's approach to activism.<a id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_school_boycott#/media/File:New_York_City_school_boycott_flier.jpg\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_school_boycott#/media/File:New_York_City_school_boycott_flier.jpg'\"><img alt=\"A Black child looks out of a glass window with a hole in it under the words School Boycott.\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|200|274|0|0|0\" height=\"274\" id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_school_boycott#/media/File:New_York_City_school_boycott_flier.jpg||CPIMAGE:6922719|0|\" src=\"/people/images/New_York_City_school_boycott_flier.jpg\" style=\"float:right;\" title=\"Flier highlights poor conditions in the schools and calls for a one day school boycott.\" width=\"200\" /></a> She, Bill, and their oldest children had enrolled in the Harlem Freedom School and participated in the 1964 New York City school boycott to protest the segregation of public schools. Their oldest son, Billy, also traveled to the South as a Freedom Rider during the 1960s.[3] But until Kochiyama met Malcolm X, she advocated simply for racial integration. Malcolm X encouraged her to develop an internationalist and anti-imperialist view, linking the freedom struggles of Black people in America with the experiences of people of African and Asian descent all over the world.</p> <p paraeid=\"{6d215a77-11f9-4910-bb0d-71d4eeebbad0}{154}\" paraid=\"346409420\">After attending Malcolm X’s Liberation School and becoming involved with his non-religious Organization of Afro-American Unity, she embraced his viewpoint of \"human rights\" rather than civil rights. In a 1965 interview, Malcolm X explained the difference:</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{6d215a77-11f9-4910-bb0d-71d4eeebbad0}{154}\" paraid=\"346409420\">\"We believe that our problem is one, not of violation of civil rights, but a violation of human rights.

Due to his prominence as a Black nationalist leader, recent departure from the Nation of Islam, and constant attacks in the press, Kochiyama doubted he would come. When Malcolm X arrived, he spoke about his studies in prison, Chinese and Japanese history, and his opposition to the Vietnam War. He explained that the freedom struggles of people of color and third-world people were linked.<br /> <br /> Kochiyama and her 16-year-old son Billy were also present when Malcolm X was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom on February 21, 1965.[4] Even after the assassination, the Kochiyama and Shabazz families remained close. Malcolm X and Dr. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/shabazz.htm\">Betty Shabazz</a>’s eldest daughter Attallah was a frequent guest at the Kochiyama house.  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{6d215a77-11f9-4910-bb0d-71d4eeebbad0}{242}\" paraid=\"1209274347\">Liberation and Self-Determination</h4> <p>Malcolm X’s encouragement to know oneself and one’s history helped to change the way Kochiyama viewed power and racism. Fueled by opposition to the Vietnam War, she became a pioneer of the Asian American movement. In 1969, she and Bill joined the new organization Asian Americans for Action (AAA), which drew inspiration from the Black Power and anti-war movements. Kochiyama became a featured speaker at the AAA’s Hiroshima-Nagasaki Day events. She later championed the development of ethnic studies programs and reparations for former Japanese American incarcerees.  <a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2016.102\"><img alt=\"An Asian American woman holds a picket sign with text Rehire the Workers Immediately\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|239|350|0|5|7.5\" height=\"350\" id=\"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2016.102||CPIMAGE:6922854|0|\" src=\"/people/images/yuri-kochiyama-protest.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:7.5px;margin-right:7.5px;\" title=\"Yuri Kochiyama at rally, 1980. Courtesy National Portrait Gallery.\" width=\"239\" /></a><br /> <br /> During the 1960s and 1970s, Kochiyama advocated for Puerto Rican self-determination. In 1969, she joined the Young Lords’ Party, a civil rights organization committed to Puerto Rican independence. In October 1977, Kochiyama participated in the takeover of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm\">Statue of Liberty</a> by Puerto Rican Nationalists. Thirty demonstrators ocupied the monument, climbed to the top, and hung a Puerto Rican flag from Lady Liberty's crown.<br /> <br /> Throughout this period, Kochiyama remained committed to the Black freedom struggle. She worked with Black Power and Black nationalist organizations including the Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika. This organization advocated for self-determination, reparations for slavery and segregation, and the creation of an independent Black republic in the southeastern United States. She also advocated for the release of Black prisoners, including Mumia Abu-Jamal. Abu-Jamal was a former Black Panther and journalist who was accused of killing a police officer. <br /> <br /> After Bill’s death in 1993, Yuri Kochiyama moved to Oakland, California to live with her daughter. The focus of her work shifted to the war on terror. Kochiyama strongly condemned the rise in Islamophobia after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. At a peace vigil and rally in San Francisco’s Japantown, she drew from her experience with incarceration after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in her speech. She cautioned people not to give into fear and hate and to stand in solidarity with Arabs, Muslims, and South Asian people who were being victimized. She declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>“In war, they say that the first casualty is truth. America forgot that we are American citizens. We Japanese Americans should feel a kinship with the Arab and Muslim people who are the newest targets of racism, hysteria, and jingoism—something that we have experienced too.”</p> </blockquote> <p>After over fifty years of activism to end war, racism, and hatred, Yuri Kochiyama died on June 1, 2014 at the age of 93. </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{2462145a-6928-4ff2-9184-5b6578d0dbfa}{126}\" paraid=\"478269277\">Notes</h4> <p paraeid=\"{2462145a-6928-4ff2-9184-5b6578d0dbfa}{126}\" paraid=\"478269277\">[1] Congress created the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jacs/index.html\">Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program</a> in 2006.

He then opened a store and purchased a house in Raleigh. Because of growing hostility towards free Blacks, in 1840 Lane had to flee to the North, leaving behind his wife and six children, still enslaved. Eventually he earned enough money to purchase their freedom as well.</p> <p>In 1842 Lane wrote an account of his life, comprehensively titled <em>The Narrative of Lunsford Lane, Formerly of Raleigh, N.C. Embracing an Account of His Early Life, the Redemption by Purchase of Himself and Family from Slavery, and His Banishment from the Place of His Birth for the Crime of Wearing a Colored Skin</em>. “Published by Himself” in Boston, it sold many copies in America and England. Lane became an active member of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Founded in Philadelphia in 1833 and led by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, the society considered slavery illegal, not only under the U.S. Constitution but also under natural law.</p> <p>In the mid-1840s, Lunsford and Martha Lane moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where their seventh child was born. Their Cambridge neighbors in the 1850s included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-roberts.htm\">Benjamin F. Roberts</a>, a Black printer, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/though-dwelling-in-a-land-of-freedom.htm\">\"Lewisville\" community</a> established by the Lewis and Vassall families who had been enslaved in colonial Massachusetts. Another famous neighbor, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/longfellow-and-abolition.htm\">Henry Longfellow</a> recorded a visit to his <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longfellow-house-washingtons-headquarters.htm\">Brattle Street mansion</a> on March 22, 1855, where they evidently had a long conversation:</p> <blockquote> <p>Lundy Lane and old Mr. Vassall (born a slave in this house in 1769) came to see me.

            "bodyText": "Josephine Wheelwright Rust was born at the estate named Exeter in Westmoreland County on May 5, 1864. Her family descended from the Washington family. She grew up in the family home, Twiford, which according to oral tradition is what the Memorial House Museum is based on. She married Harry Lee Rust (also a Washington descendent) on November 16, 1892. <br /> <br /> The couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Mrs. Rust began a career of charity work, and showed herself to be an able administrator. Rust was wealthy and well-educated, and influential women of that time used charity work as an acceptable public outlet for their skills and energies to \"better society.\" Mrs. Rust did not confine her efforts to America: with the outbreak of WWI, she began to help the wartime afflicted in Italy by holding fundraising auctions and rallies. After the war's end, the Italian Red Cross presented her with a large silver medal in recognition of her work. The French Government also awarded her a medal.<br /> <br /> Rust was a member of the Society of the Colonial Dames of America, the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Society of Daughters of 1812, the Colonial Dames Club of Washington DC and the Washington Club. All of these groups honored the earliest eras of the American experience and the nation's greatest leaders. Rust used her connections in these groups to save a place important to her heart; the birthplace of George Washington.<br /> <br /> Rust was instrumental in founding the group known as the Wakefield National Memorial Association. The first meeting of the Association was held in her living room on June 11, 1923 and Mrs. Rust became the group's first president. Rust's desire was to build a memorial to Washington that would capture the essence of the man. Her memorial would not be the same as other Washington memorials were. Her desire was to build a house as a memorial on the location of the original birthhouse.<br /> <br /> Since local tradition held that Rust's family home,Twiford, was modeled after the original Washington home, she believed that it should be the model for the Memorial House Museum. Her belief influenced Edward Donn, the architect of the Memorial House Museum, who would build the house to her specifications. In order to locate the house where Rust and others believed the original birthhouse to be, she convinced Congress to contribute funds to remove the obelisk which had marked that location since its installation in 1896. Her conviction to use this location for the Memorial House Museum set her in competition with the National Park Service. When George Washington Birthplace National Monument was signed into existence in January 1930, the Park Service was not convinced the Memorial House Museum was located on the original foundation. Nevertheless, Rust was able to see her dreams become reality; Congress appropriated funds to move the obelisk, the obelisk was moved to its current location at the entrance to the park, and the Memorial House Museum was completed in June, 1931.<br /> <br /> On June 26, 1931, just four days after signing the deed for the Birthplace over to the National Park Service, Rust died. Tributes to her came from all around the nation. In February, 1932, on the bicentennial of George Washington's birthday, Rust was honored in the Memorial House Museum. She was buried at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>\"I never would have been President if it had not been for my experiences in North Dakota.\" -Theodore Roosevelt</em></p> <p>The iconic titles <em>Naturalist, Explorer, Author, Hunter, Cowboy, Family Man, Statesman, Rough Rider, War Hero, and President of the United States</em> must all be invoked to accurately describe the life of Theodore Roosevelt.</p> <p>Born into a wealthy family, as a child Theodore Roosevelt suffered from severe asthma. In attempts to relieve his suffering, his parents provided young \"Teedie\" with the best treatments available including giving him cigar smoke to inhale, black coffee to drink, and racing him down NYC streets in the family buggy to force air into his lungs. Theodore used strenuous physical activity, including exercise, to overcome his health problems.<br /> <br />  As a young child, he was innately curious in the natural world, later stating in his book <em><u>My Life as a Naturalist,</u></em> \"I can no more explain why I like 'natural history' than than why I like California canned peaches;...almost as soon as I began to read at all I began to like to read about the natural history of beasts and birds and the more formidable or interesting reptiles and fishes.\"<br /> <br /> Roosevelt traveled widely throughout his life: Not only did he travel extensively throughout the USA, he also would take a family grand tour of Europe, and a family trip down the Nile River before his 14th birthday. Later in life, Theodore would be the first US president to leave the country, visiting the Panama Canal, and would explore a section of the Amazon River, known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/the-river-of-doubt.htm\">The River of Doubt</a>, after loosing the 1912 presidential election.<br /> <br /> Theodore met his first wife, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-hathaway-lee-roosevelt.htm\">Alice Hathaway Lee</a> while attending Harvard University. Sadly, on February 14, 1884, Theodore would loose Alice and his mother, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/martha-mittie-bulloch-roosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Martha \"Mittie\" Roosevelt</span></a>, within hours of one another. Alice died only two days after giving birth to their first child, also named<span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"> </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-roosevelt-longworth.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Alice</span></a>. Following this tragedy, Roosevelt retreated to the Dakota Territory to grieve and challenge himself by living the cowboy life. There, Roosevelt learned “the value of instant decision”, brought thieves to justice, hunted wild game, and observed the last vestiges of the bison that once dominated the plains.</p> <p>Invigorated by his western experience, Roosevelt returned to his political life in New York City and remarried to a childhood sweetheart,<span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"> </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/edith-carow-roosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Edith Kermit Carow</span></a>. They raised five children (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/theodore-roosevelt-jr.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Theodore \"Ted\" Roosevelt Jr.</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/kermit-roosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Kermit</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ethel-roosevelt-derby.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Ethel</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/archibald-roosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Archibald</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/quentin-roosevelt.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Quentin</span></a>) together as Roosevelt continued his life of public service.</p> <p>In 1898, resigning from Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt organized a volunteer cavalry, the Rough Riders, and led them to legendary victories at the Battle of Santiago in Cuba during <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/tr-rr-spanamwar.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">the Spanish American War</span></a>. Roosevelt went on to hold many public office positions including Governor of New York and Vice President of the United States in the McKinley administration.</p> <p>In September 1901, Roosevelt unexpectedly ascended to the presidency when McKinley was assassinated. He was elected in his own right in 1904. President Roosevelt secured Panamanian rights from Colombia, facilitating continued construction on the Panama Canal, ultimately connecting two oceans.</p> <p>Memories of hunting and ranching in the badlands of Dakota Territory greatly influenced President Theodore Roosevelt’s conservation ethic. At a time when technological advances, booming industries, and growing human demand threatened destruction of vast stretches the North American landscape, Roosevelt enacted <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/trandthenpsystem.htm\">policy to conserve natural resources</a> and designated more than 230 million acres of public lands for enjoyment by all Americans. His legacy of conservation is <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">memorialized in </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro\">Theodore Roosevelt National Park</a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">.</span></p>",

            "bodyText": "Adrienne Lucier was born in late 1824 at Fort Vancouver. Over the course of her long life, she saw the rise and decline of the fur trade in the Pacific Northwest, both from the vantage point of the British Hudson's Bay Company and from the perspective of the settlers who farmed the Willamette Valley. She was a Métis woman, who called upon the traditional knowledge of her Indigenous ancestors to work as a community physician, and predominantly spoke the language of her French Canadian father. Like so many others, Adrienne was a child of the fur trade. In some ways, she was caught between worlds - American and British, British and French Canadian, settler and Indigenous. But in her own way, she was able to carve out a place for herself that allowed her to be remembered as a vital part of her community.<br /> <br /> Adrienne's mother was Josephte Nouite, an Indigenous woman who may have been from the Kwakiutl, or Kwakwaka'wakw, people of British Columbia. She is believed to have been born around 1799. Sometime between 1812 and 1813, Josephte met Adrienne's father, Etienne Lucier.<br /> <br /> Etienne Lucier was a French Canadian fur trapper who joined Wilson Price Hunt's <a href=\"https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/astor_expedition_1810_1812/#.X0RfX-hKg2w\">Astorian Overland Expedition</a> in 1810. This expedition crossed North America with the intention of establishing a trading post for the American Pacific Fur Company at a place that would become known as Astoria, Oregon. The expedition arrived at Astoria in 1812. Etienne spent some time on the Pacific Coast, which may have been when he met Josephte. The Luciers spent the winter of 1813-1814 at one of two trading posts in the Willamette Valley: at the Pacific Fur Company's Wallace House, near present-day Salem, Oregon, or at the North West Company's Willamette Post, near present-day Newburg, Oregon. Their first child, daughter Felicite, was born in the Willamette Valley in 1814.<br /> <br /> Etienne then left the Northwest for the North West Company's Fort William in Eastern Canada, but by 1822, he was back in the Willamette Valley, hoping to settle and farm in the area. Just one year earlier, the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) had merged; the HBC had taken over management of the North West Company's posts (and personnel) in the Pacific Northwest, and begun to make plans to centralize their influence in the region at a new fort: Fort Vancouver. In an interview given in 1919 when she was 94 years old, Adrienne described witnessing \"the coming of Dr. John McLoughlin to Fort Vancouver in 1824,\" the year the fort was founded. Of course, Adrienne was an infant in 1824, but in any case, the Luciers were already becoming established in the Northwest when the McLoughlins - and the Hudson's Bay Company - were just arriving.<br /> <br /> After the establishment of Fort Vancouver, Etienne Lucier was periodically employed by the HBC, both at the fort and on fur trapping expeditions. Ties between the Luciers and the fort were also created when Adrienne's older sister Felicite married one of the fort's clerks, Donald Manson, in 1828. At the Lucier home, another daughter, Pelage, was born in 1827.<br /> <br /> Fort Vancouver's Chief Factor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnmcloughlin.htm\">Dr. John McLoughlin</a> disapproved of Etienne Lucier's attempts to farm in the Willamette Valley as an HBC employee, and the Luciers were forced to travel to Eastern Canada so that he could formally end his employment with the HBC. This attempt failed, and the Luciers returned to the Willamette by 1830. McLoughlin conceded, and sold Lucier the equipment he needed to start his farm. The location the Luciers chose for their farm was an area that would later become the eastern part of the city of Portland, Oregon. Around 1831 or 1832, Lucier relocated to Champoeg, Oregon. In the 1830s, three more children were added to the Lucier family: Louison, b. 1831, Michel, b. 1835, and Joseph, b. 1838.<br /> <br /> Adrienne reported that the Luciers \"returned often to Fort Vancouver to trade, and to visit their friend, Dr. McLoughlin. She says that when she was a little girl she used to sit on the good old doctor's lap, and sing 'Protestant hymns' for him.\" Adrienne spent a considerable amount of her childhood at the fort, and attended the fort's school. The Fort Vancouver school was established in 1832 and was host to several teachers over the years, both visitors to Fort Vancouver and HBC employees. There, students were taught to read and write, and received religious instruction. <br /> <br /> On January 23, 1839, Etienne and Josephte, who had previously been engaged in a \"country marriage\" or marriage à la façon du pays - a common fur trade-era marriage agreement made without church or government involvement - were formally married, likely by Catholic missionaries Modeste Demers and François Norbert Blanchet, who had recently arrived in the Willamette Valley. Not quite a year later, on January 10, 1840, Josephte died. Just eight months after her death, on August 10, Adrienne's father remarried. His second wife, Adrienne's stepmother, was a Chinook woman named Marie Marguerite. Etienne and Marie Marguerite Lucier had two children: Pierre, b. 1842, and Etienne, b. 1844.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the death of her mother and the remarriage of her father, Adrienne Lucier left her family home to be married to André LaChapelle. LaChapelle had worked in the Northwest fur trade since 1817; like his father-in-law Etienne Lucier, he had been in the Northwest since before Fort Vancouver was established and HBC power was consolidated in the region. LaChapelle had held many jobs at Fort Vancouver in the 1820s and 1830s, often working as a blacksmith in the fort's Blacksmith Shop or as a middleman (a term that suggests either working as a rower in a canoe on fur brigades, or engaging in general labor). LaChapelle retired from HBC service in 1841 and moved to the Willamette Valley, hoping to settle and start his own farm. On May 17, 1841, André LaChapelle married Adrienne Lucier at the St. Paul Catholic Church,located in the Willamette Valley's French Prairie. She was seventeen years old (though in her 1919 interview, Adrienne recalled her age at the time of her wedding as \"about 21\"); he was thirty-nine.<br /> <br /> Adrienne and André LaChapelle had a large family - between 1842 and 1865, Adrienne gave birth to sixteen children. The family lived on a farm near Champoeg, Oregon.<br /> <br /> By 1843, the influx of Americans coming to Oregon over the Oregon Trail inspired a proposal to create a provisional government in the territory. Retired HBC employees in Oregon, like LaChapelle and Lucier, were compelled to either vote for the formation of a new government that would favor American interests or vote against it, a statement in favor of the British HBC. While André LaChapelle and the majority of HBC retirees present at the vote at Champoeg on May 2, 1843, voted against the formation of the provisional government, Etienne Lucier supported it. The defection of Lucier and fellow French Canadian François Xavier Matthieu decided the vote at 52-50 in favor of the creation of the provisional government.This was an important step for the Americans who wanted to increase their control over the Oregon Territory while it was still jointly occupied by Great Britain and the United States. In 1919, Adrienne was described as \"very proud of her father's stand at Champoeg on the memorable second day of May, 1843.\"<br /> <br /> For her part, Adrienne remembered the arrival of the American emigrants over the Oregon Trail at least somewhat favorably. The francophone Adrienne was quoted in 1919 as saying, \"Ils me donnaient du café, et je l'aimais\" (\"They gave me coffee and I liked it\").<br /> <br /> As a resident of the Willamette Valley, Adrienne gained a reputation as a healer and physician for the people in her community. Her 1919 profile in The Oregon Daily Journal included the following description: <blockquote> <p>\"...her most valuable knowledge had been obtained from her mother's people, who had entrusted to her the secrets of the medicinal qualities of all the wonderful varieties of herbs and roots. Her skill in preparing and administering these remedies gave her renown far and wide, and her professional services were in demand for miles and miles around. She never refused to go, day or night, rain or shine. For this purpose she always kept a swift, well trained horse, and she was known as an expert horsewoman, as well as swimmer.\"</p> </blockquote> In the same article, Adrienne's mother is described as a \"Chinook princess,\" and it may be that the mother she learned her medical skills from was either Josephte Nouite or her stepmother, Marie Marguerite, who was Chinook, or perhaps both women had an influence on Adrienne's medical knowledge.<br /> <br /> During the 1840s, Adrienne likely came into contact with employees from Fort Vancouver fairly often. Employees from the fort sometimes passed through the area, like Fort Vancouver clerk Thomas Lowe, who visited Etienne Lucier's farm in September 1845 and wrote in his journal that he and his traveling companions from the fort ate many apples from Lucier's orchards.<br /> <br /> In 1858, Adrienne's sister Felicite, having spent the intervening years following her husband's career from HBC post to HBC post, returned to Champoeg. Felicite and now-retired HBC employee Donald Manson lived and farmed near Champoeg. Felicite died in 1867.<br /> <br /> André LaChapelle died in June 1881 in Saint Louis, Oregon. He was buried at the Saint Louis Cemetery in present-day Gervais, Oregon. At the time of his death, Adrienne and André LaChapelle had been living and working on their farm with their three youngest children: son Amadie and his wife, and teenage daughters Marie Adele and Helena. Amadie was also working on the farm.<br /> <br /> For the last 30 years of her life, Adrienne lived with Amadie and his family on their farm in Gervais, Oregon, not far from André LaChapelle's French Prairie farm. She died on June 6, 1919 and was also buried at the Saint Louis Cemetery. The 1919 profile of her in The Oregon Daily Journal, which declared her \"Oregon's oldest woman,\" was published just five days before her death. The article closed with the following lines: <blockquote> <p>\"About a year ago, she was partially paralyzed on one side. But her eyes are still remarkably bright, reflecting a keen, well preserved intellect. Nothing pleases her more than to gather her children's children about her, and to relate to them in her quaint French dialect the thrilling adventures of long ago.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Tracing Her Steps</h2> <br /> At <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/index.htm\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a>, visit the area where Adrienne was born and visited many times over the course of her childhood.

            "bodyText": "<p>Alexander Agassiz died at sea in 1910, but his presence is still felt in Calumet today. At the same time he was leading the Calumet and Hecla mine to international fame, Agassiz was influencing nearly every aspect of life in the community that developed around it. Massive warehouses, tall smokestacks, stately office buildings, and other industrial structures demarcating the former mine site reflect his managerial approach, but Calumet's schools, libraries, and churches also bear his stamp. Less obvious, but perhaps more evocative, are the local traditions, beliefs and attitudes that his policies helped shape. It is impossible to separate this complex, accomplished, and driven man from Calumet's history.</p> <p>Agassiz was born on December 17, 1835 in Neuchatel, Switzerland. His father was the noted naturalist Louis Agassiz. His mother, Cecile Braun Agassiz, also had an interest in natural history. Not surprisingly, the young Agassiz shared their enthusiasm for the outdoor world, and often accompanied his father through the countryside on expeditions. His mother taught him to illustrate the plant and animal specimens he found. She also made music a part of their daily activities.</p> <p>In 1846, Louis Agassiz immigrated to the United States, leaving his wife and children to stay with relatives in Germany. Their family was torn apart once again when Cecile died during the summer of 1848. Agassiz remained in Germany with an uncle, while his two sisters returned to Switzerland to live with their aunts. Agassiz joined them on vacations from school, but in the spring of 1849, Louis — who was by then a professor at Harvard — sent for Alexander to join him. He arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts in mid-summer, after a trans-Atlantic voyage of some forty-five days.</p> <p>On his arrival, Agassiz became part of his father’s eccentric household, which included \"a dear old artist,\" a Harvard student, and \"an old Swiss minister.\" He also shared quarters with \"a bear, some eagles, a crocodile, a few snakes, and sundry other live stock.\" The intellectual stimulation presented by this unconventional environment was supplemented by a more traditional education: he attended Cambridge High School, which was known as one of the best college preparatory schools in the country. When Agassiz's father remarried in the spring of 1850, his daughters rejoined the family. Their stepmother, Elizabeth Cabot Cary, brought a sense of stability to their home; it remained one of Cambridge's intellectual centers, where many of the brightest minds met and ideas flowed freely. Agassiz's intellectual nature was balanced by a solid pragmatism. After graduating from Harvard in 1855 with a degree in science – which he completed while being a member of the rowing team – Agassiz entered the engineering department at the Lawrence Scientific School. He also helped his stepmother establish a school for girls to bolster the family income; he kept the account books, and taught math, chemistry, physics, French, and Latin. Even with these responsibilities, he graduated from Lawrence at the top of his class in 1857. He continued to teach at the Agassiz's school until 1859, when he found work with the Coast Survey in California. He stayed there only briefly, returning to Massachusetts to take a position at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, which his father had established a few years earlier. While there, Agassiz enrolled in the Lawrence Scientific School again, this time studying natural history. Before graduating in 1862, he married Anna Russell, one of his former students and the daughter of a prominent Boston merchant. Though well-suited to his work at the zoology museum, Agassiz's salary could not support both his family and his scientific pursuits. When he was offered the position of president of a Boston-based coal mining company, Agassiz accepted. Although the job came through a social connection, and was Agassiz's first experience in the mining business, he was also well-suited to this work. No mere figurehead, Agassiz immersed himself in the operation of the company's interests in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>In 1866, Agassiz was asked to travel to Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula to investigate the Calumet Mining Company. This was a venture in which Quincy Shaw — married to Agassiz's sister Pauline — was a major investor. The mine sat atop the Calumet conglomerate lode, which, even then, was recognized as being one of the richest copper deposits in the area. Agassiz was so impressed with the mine’s potential that he borrowed money to invest in the company himself. Shaw and the other investors bought more land to the south of their original claim, and incorporated the Hecla Mining Company. Agassiz was named treasurer of both companies.</p> <p>Despite the lode's richness, the two mines were being managed so poorly that investors were approaching ruin. Agassiz was sent to Calumet again in 1867, but this time to take control of mining operations. After a year and a half spent investing in and redesigning support infrastructure — like stamp mills, shafthouses, and railroads — Agassiz was finally able to set things right. Hecla paid its first dividend by December 1869 and Calumet in August 1870. These were the first in a long, unbroken string of payments for the companies, which consolidated in May of 1871 as the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. Quincy Shaw served as the corporation’s first president; he resigned before the end of the year. Agassiz was then named president, and he held the position until the day he died.</p> <p>Clearly, Agassiz was enjoying immense professional success. However, it was not reflected in his personal life. His father died of pneumonia in 1873; Anna, his wife, who had taken care of Louis, also died. Agassiz was severely grief-stricken, and burdened by a depression from which he never fully recovered. He threw himself into his work. He journeyed to South America, Mexico, to the islands of the South Pacific, and India. He visited and studied all the major coral reefs in the world, in the process becoming a leading figure in the emerging field of marine biology. Agassiz scheduled his scientific expeditions around his semi-annual visits to Calumet, which usually took place during the spring and fall of each year. Even at the mine site, Agassiz continued his scientific pursuits, and conducted experiments studying geothermal temperature distribution underground. He also developed a system for the large-scale deployment of carbonic acid for use in extinguishing fires in the mine.</p> <p>Under Agassiz's guidance, Calumet and Hecla grew into a world-renowned mining company. It remained competitive even when it was being eclipsed in the 1880s and 1890s by new copper operations in Arizona and Montana. The rich, deep Calumet conglomerate lode played a role in ensuring the company’s success, as did the mine’s productive employees. Agassiz’s management style was also a factor. During the late 1800s, workers’ demands for safer working conditions – particularly in western mining communities – were gaining in volume. Although small strikes did occur locally, Michigan’s copper district remained relatively quiet, largely because Agassiz did not tolerate any kind of labor unrest. Nor did he like to negotiate: In 1893, strikers seized a hoist-engine house to prevent miners from going underground; after the situation was quelled, the strikers were fired and removed by the county sheriff. The company used a worker’s ethnicity to assign work, and even spied on workers for talk of unionization. Agassiz and his managers exercised great control over the mine site and its employees.</p>   <p>Part of that control may be seen as more benign. The mining company used various benefits to attract and retain workers who would remain loyal. Thus, the community’s development did not escape Agassiz's attention. Benefits included housing, schools, a hospital, and a public library. The company even donated land for churches. Again, much like the company’s approach to labor relations, the great expense undertaken by the company to provide these benefits can be traced to Agassiz’s direct influence. His son noted that:</p> <blockquote dir=\"ltr\"> <p>[t]he spirit of broad humanity with which Agassiz cared for the welfare of some fifty thousand souls clustered about the mine deserves special notice. Ever mindful of the comfort and well-being of his employees, his genuine interest in the community and the intelligent measures he adopted for its prosperity resulted in a model settlement. Agassiz made it his personal interest to see that the men were well paid, well housed, and provided with the best of schools, libraries, hospitals, bath-houses, and churches.</p> </blockquote> <p>The level of Agassiz's influence in Calumet's cultural life is particularly evident in the public library. He was involved in its design and construction from the beginning. He reviewed the rules and regulations before it opened to the public in September 1898, and made suggestions on everything from the library's hours – it was open until 10 pm – to designating a smoking room. He also needed to approve the library's books before they were placed on the shelves.</p> <p>Agassiz died in his sleep on Easter morning, March 27, 1910, aboard the <em>S.S. Adriatic</em>. He was bound for New York, returning home to the U.S. after spending the winter in Egypt. It seemed fitting that he died on the oceans which had fascinated him. On March 30, the <em>Calumet News</em> wrote:</p> <blockquote dir=\"ltr\"> <p>Calumet feels the loss of President Agassiz. As superintendent and president of C&H mine he had the interests of this community at heart and provided contributions for the men in the employ of this company which it would be hard to equal in any mining camp. The numerous public benefits which have been given to the people of Calumet have been greatly appreciated by the citizens and have won their deepest respect. The loss is a personal one for Calumet.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a sign of respect, the Calumet and Hecla mine closed at noon on Saturday, April 2, 1910, and remained closed until Monday morning, idling no less than 10,000 men. The community honored him in other ways as well. A park was commissioned between the mine site and the adjacent village of Red Jacket's commercial district; it was named Agassiz Park. Designed by the renowned Boston landscape architect Warren Manning, the park had as its centerpiece a large bronze sculpture of Agassiz by Paul Wayland Bartlett, a former student of Rodin.</p>   <p>Although he died nearly a century ago, and the mine has been closed for four decades, Agassiz's legacy is still seen in Calumet today. Company-built houses still provide homes for Calumet residents. Students still attend classes in schools built at company expense. The faithful still worship in churches built on company land. Less visible, but just as real, are local attitudes and beliefs about politics, labor and management, and ethnicity. These topics spark conversations in Calumet, both about the past and the present.</p>",

Little is known of his early life until he joined a Spanish regiment and was sent to New Orleans, then a possession of Spain. After his discharge, Vigo entered the fur trade. By 1772, he was established as a merchant and trader in St. Louis in Spanish Upper Louisiana. Later, as a business associate of Spanish Lieutenant Governor Fernando de Leyba, Vigo was quite successful trading among the area's Indians and French settlers.</p> <p>During July 1778, George Rogers Clark and his force of 180 frontiersmen captured British-controlled but French inhabited Kaskaskia and Cahokia across from St. Louis. Vigo, in St. Louis, decided to support Clark and the Americans by furnishing them with supplies from his own stores. In making this decision, Vigo no doubt was influenced by the assistance being given the Americans by Governor de Leyba. Vigo also loaned Clark money to pay the local inhabitants for needed goods. Vigo's visible assistance was noted by the French and further solidified their support behind Clark.</p> <p>During December 1778, Vigo was taken prisoner by the British in Vincennes and was held for several weeks. Vigo was released upon the condition that on his way back to St. Louis, he do nothing that would harm the British cause. Vigo complied with the letter, if not the spirit, of this agreement by first returning to St. Louis before starting out for Kaskaskia to report to Clark. Arriving on January 29, 1779, he provided Clark with valuable detailed information on the situation at Vincennes. Vigo told Clark that the British intended to descend upon the Americans at Kaskaskia in the spring and that they would not expect the Americans to attack them at Vincennes during the winter. Clark later wrote of Vigo: \"in sho[r]t we got Every Information from this Gentn [gentleman] that we could wish for as he had had good opportunities and had taken great pains to inform himself with a design to give intelligence....\"<br /> <br /> Thanks to Vigo's information, Clark's army surprised the British at Vincennes and defeated the redcoats. The fort was surrendered on Feb. 25, 1779.</p>   <p>Vigo's service to the United States continued during the remainder of the Revolution and during the years following. By 1783, Vigo had moved to Vincennes where he spent most of the next 50 years working in the fur trade and serving as a colonel in the militia.</p> <p>Vigo's business affairs eventually suffered setbacks; virtually impoverished, he died at age 88 in 1836. He was buried in Greenlawn Cemetery in Vincennes. Prior to his death, Vigo had specified that a portion of any money received by his estate should be used to purchase a bell for the Vigo County Courthouse in Terre Haute, IN. Finally in 1875, almost a full century after the war, Vigo's estate was paid $8,616 principal and $41,282 in interest for his services both to Clark and to his country.</p> <p>In 1934, sculptor John Angel was commissioned to prepare a suitable statue of Vigo to be placed on the park grounds adjacent to the George Rogers Clark Memorial. On May 4, 1936, the 10-ton granite work was positioned where it overlooks the Wabash River. For the thousands of visitors to the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park, the Vigo statue serves as a fitting tribute to the contributions of this important American patriot.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Born Margareeta Johanna Konttra Niiranen in Tornio, Finland, in 1861, Maggie Walz came to the United States at the age of twenty.<br /> <br /> Like many other homesteaders, she emigrated with almost nothing: \"a mere girl when she arrived...a stranger among strangers, in this cosmopolitan settlement with only $7 in her pocket.\" After arriving in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, she took a job as a domestic servant for the Jacob Ojanpera family in Oskar, near Houghton. Walz had other aspirations, however. She learned to speak English by attending night school after her workday was done. Like many immigrants of the day, Walz changed her name to be more readily accepted in mainstream American society. She then took a job selling sewing machines, pianos and organs door-to-door. Later, she worked as a sales clerk. These experiences helped her master her language skills and taught her the elements of commercial trade.<br />  <br /> Walz set her sights beyond the Finnish immigrant community, but she was also very active within it. She attended the Finnish Apostolic Lutheran Church, and was a founding member of <em>Pohjantahti</em> (Northern Star), a Finnish temperance society established in Hancock in 1885. She also helped the local Finnish community grow: in 1887, she returned to Finland and came back to the United States with fourteen young women immigrants. Walz helped more Finnish women come to the U.S. by underwriting their passage, teaching them English, and helping them find employment. This endeavor led to other business opportunities. She became a ticket agent, a notary public, and opened a currency exchange. She also provided interpretation services for Finnish-speaking immigrants in business, legal, and other transactions for which English was essential.<br />  <br /> During this era in the Copper Country, women did not typically pursue the professions that Walz chose. By establishing herself as an independent businesswoman, she challenged the notions of women's proper role in late 19th century society. She was often described as unladylike, if not downright masculine. \"She may wear skirts, but she’s no lady!\" was an expression commonly quoted in her regard. Others said \"she had a voice like a sea-captain's.\"<br /> <br /> Walz's independent approach to her professional life applied to her personal activities as well. Along with a group of friends, she attempted to establish a women's suffrage organization in 1888; their efforts did not meet with much success. Yet Walz was well-regarded, especially in the Finnish immigrant community. Many people owed her a debt of gratitude for helping them make a start in their adopted country long after they had repaid the financial investment she made in their interest.<br />  <br /> Walz left the Keweenaw to earn a degree in business from Valparaiso College in Indiana. When she returned in 1894, she successfully organized the <em>Calumet Suomen Nais-Yhdistys</em> (Calumet Finnish Women's Society), which was dedicated more broadly to the general advancement of women, rather than to suffrage alone. It later became a national organization. The society published a newspaper – the <em>Naisten Lehti</em> (Women's Paper) – that was eventually distributed nationally. Walz was largely responsible for its publication, serving at various times as business manager, editor, and publisher. At times, Walz produced the paper entirely by herself, and at her own expense. In addition to her work with the <em>Naisten Lehti</em>, Walz was the business manager for another major Finnish-American paper, the <em>Amerikan Suometar</em>, which was also published in Calumet and distributed nationally.</p> <p>In 1902, Walz built a stately, three-story business block on Pine Street, the commercial center of Calumet's Finnish community. Charles K. Shand, the architect who designed the Red Jacket Opera House (now known as the Calumet Theatre) also designed Walz's building. The Walz Block housed businesses in two storefronts and other rooms on the ground floor, including the <em>American Suometar</em> business office, and a clothing store operated by Walz herself. Meeting rooms, offices and apartments occupied the upper floors. The pediment of the building announced itself boldly in a stylized inscription designed to look like Walz's signature, a personalized touch which, though unusual, was perfectly in character for Walz.<br />  <br /> Walz did not limit herself to the Copper Country: in 1903, she filed a claim under the Homestead Act for 160 acres on Drummond Island, a large island in Lake Huron at the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula. She founded a Finnish colony there in 1905, based on the ideals of temperance, cooperative capitalism, and Christianity. In her honor, the community was named Kreetan, a shortened form of Margareeta, similar to \"Maggie\" in English. The island colony was a stunning success. The Detroit Free Press reported that as of November 1911, there were \"five settlements, with a combined population of probably a thousand.\" Education and the creation of community were highly prized and prioritized by any homesteader colony - Kreeton held five stores, a hotel, and the only school attended in the nation attended exclusively by Finnish children. Walz traveled back and forth across the Upper Peninsula for a number of years, maintaining business interests in Calumet as well as on Drummond Island, where she was the postmistress. However, she disassociated herself from the colony when a group of socialists took it over in 1914.<br /> <br /> By that time, attitudes about women's rights were shifting. Instead of describing her as unladylike, a Detroit newspaper declared that Walz was \"a fine type of independent womanhood, about 40 years of age. She has a good physique and possesses a frank, friendly manner, inspiring confidence in her ability. She is actuated by a desire to benefit her countrymen.\" The article goes on to list her many business and social accomplishments. This change in perception indicated the arrival of a more modern age that Walz herself may have helped create.<br />  <br /> Over the next few years, Walz traveled around the United States, establishing branches of Calumet's Suomen Nais-Yhdistys in other areas. She was active in the Michigan Women's Christian Temperance Union, and was the American delegate to the International Women's Christian Temperance Union meeting in Glasgow, Scotland in 1910. She subsequently participated in a women's delegation to the Coolidge administration in Washington, D.C. As she became increasingly well-known around the country, newspapers began profiling her. Sometimes they referred to her (presumably with the best of intentions) as the \"angel of the roundheads,\" as Finnish immigrants were somewhat disparagingly known. She was also called the \"Jane Addams of Northern Michigan\" for her community work.<br /> <br /> Maggie Walz died in 1927 at the age of 65 at Memorial Hospital in Laurium, where she was being treated for pneumonia. Whether people viewed her as an angel or pioneer of social welfare, one thing is certain: Walz determined her own path in life. After making her way to an unfamiliar country, she proceeded to establish herself in the community. She worked to better the lives of her fellow Finnish immigrants and women in Calumet and beyond. She acted locally, nationally, and internationally to advance women's rights, and was a powerful advocate for new American citizens.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Valentino Samuel Dominelli was born September 21, 1922 in Johnsonberg, Pennsylvania to Samuel and Julia Dominelli, immigrants from Italy, who became American citizens.<sup>1 </sup>Coincidentally, this was the same hometown of Earl Tobias Schreiber, the first commander of USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793). Valentino had one brother, Victor, and five sisters: Daisy, Josephine, Bernice, Rose, and Francis.<sup>2</sup> The family moved to Chicago sometime in the 1930s. Valentino graduated from high school.</p> <p>Dominelli worked as a turret lathe operator in an ammunition plant for about a year and a half. A turret lathe works like any other lathe: a piece of metal or wood is rotated rapidly and by applying a sharp edge the material is shaped by peeling back or carving out the wood or metal. What makes a turret lathe different is a carousel of attachments that enable the operator to switch quickly between carving, cutting, and boring bits. This kind of machine work is important for manufacturing interchangeable parts and for consistency in size and quality of the parts made. Dominelli noted on his induction papers that he not only operated this machine but set it up (set up required more skills and a better knowledge of the machine than operation).<sup>3</sup> Ammunition production was critical to the war effort. Employees working in that field were less likely to be drafted than laborers working outside the war industry economy. Dominelli earned $36 a week (significantly more than his starting pay with Navy, which was $50 per month).</p> <p>Dominelli enlisted in the U.S. Navy on July 10, 1943. He volunteered for a two-year appointment, starting as an apprentice seaman. He attended his basic training at the Naval Training Station, Great Lakes located in Illinois on the shores of Lake Michigan, not far from home. He was promoted to fireman 3rd class (F3c) in mid-September and was granted nine days of leave. Firemen were responsible for keeping the fires going that stoked the ship’s boilers and created the steam to turn turbines and propellers. On October 1 he reported to the Naval Training Station, on the Naval Operating Base Norfolk, in Virginia where he continued his training. The following month he moved to California for destroyer training in San Francisco on Treasure Island. This training included firefighting, night lookout, and four weeks of instruction in EPO school, where F3c Dominelli started his training to be a chief petty officer.<sup>4</sup> It is possible that during this training period he started to get to know some of his future shipmates.</p> <p>F3c Dominelli joined the crew of USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) on December 31, 1943, earning him the informal title of “plank owner,\" meaning he was part of the original crew. While serving on <em>Cassin Young</em> he was promoted three times, moving up in class as a fireman (from 3rd, to 2nd and then to 1st class in 1944). Then, on June 1, 1945, he was appointed Watertender 3rd class (Trainee) WT3c(T). This was another step towards becoming a chief petty officer, and a mark of confidence from his commander. A watertender was a crewman aboard a steam-powered ship and was responsible for tending to the fires and boilers in the ship's engine room. For a year and a half, Dominelli shared the experiences of his shipmates as <em>Cassin Young</em> navigated the South Pacific: rescuing survivors from sinking ships, scooping up pilots who had been shot out of the sky, outrunning typhoons, shooting and dodging enemy planes, serving as escort, laying down smoke screens, and working radar picket stations.</p> <p>During the spring of 1945, while serving on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa, <em>Cassin Young</em> was struck by kamikazes on two occasions. The first time was April 12th: a kamikaze struck the mast of <em>Cassin Young</em> and exploded. Shrapnel rained down on the ship, killing one sailor and wounding 59 more. The second hit came on July 30, 1945: the plane crashed through the main deck and into the forward fireroom, causing a significant explosion. WT3c(T) Dominelli was one of 22 sailors killed. He was 22 years old.</p> <p>The Commander of the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, J.W. Ailes III, hand-wrote condolence letters to the relatives of all the deceased sailors. Inevitably, he wrote much the same thing about all the sailors. For this sailor however, he made a few distinctions: firstly, he referred to the sailor as he was known, that is “Dom,” which was rare in the letters; secondly, while some of the sailors were said to have been “liked and admired,” Dom was “greatly liked and admired.” Unlike the files of his shipmates, the copy of the letter Commander Ailes sent to Sam Dominelli (Valentino’s father) is completely legible. We include it here as an example representing all the letters.</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">At sea<br /> 9 August 1945</p> <p>My dear Mr. Dominelli,</p> <p style=\"text-indent: 25px;\">It is with the deepest regret that I write you of your son Valentino’s death. We who were his shipmates grieve with you at his loss. We all consider ourselves better men for having known and served with him.</p> <p style=\"text-indent: 25px;\">Dom, as everyone called him, was killed in action with the enemy on 30 July 1945. He died instantly when hit while on his battle station.</p> <p style=\"text-indent: 25px;\">Dom had served in this ship since its commissioning. He was greatly liked and admired. He truly served his country with distinction.</p> <p style=\"text-indent: 25px;\">On 5 August 1945 we held a memorial service aboard for your son and our other shipmates who gave their lived in the same action. The following day a group of crew and I went ashore to visit [page 2] the graves of those men. We viewed their graves, where they were buried with full military honors, and I can assure you they are well kept and befitting the brave men who rest there.</p> <p style=\"text-indent: 25px;\">The Bureau of Naval Personnel, Navy Department, Washington, DC. Will advise you in regard to the details of settling Valentino’s affairs.</p> <p style=\"text-indent: 25px;\">My deepest sympathy is extended to you at this grevious [sic] time. If there is any manner in which I can aid you in adjusting your late son’s affairs, please do not hesitate to communicate with me.</p> <p>Sincerely yours,<br /> J.W. Ailes, III<br /> Commander, U.S. Navy<br /> Commanding Officer</p> </blockquote> <p>WT3c(T) Valentino Dominelli was survived by his parents and siblings. His body was reinterred in Mount Carmel Cemetery, in Hillside, Illinois (about 12 miles west of Chicago) in 1949.</p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military File of Valentino Dominelli National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St Louis, MO.</li> <li>1930 U.S. Census.

But preceding his truncated presidency, his prolific formative years in Ohio and Indiana as a soldier, statesman, and governor from 1798 to the end of the War of 1812 reflect a personal story and political agenda that run parallel to the physical and ideological development of the Old Northwest.</p> <p>One of Harrison’s most controversial political legacies is the role he played in shifting the government’s policy of land acquisition – from establishing treaties in the Jeffersonian tradition to taking land from American Indians and other nations by force. Harrison’s role as Governor of Indiana was to represent the needs of both new settlers in the Indiana territory, and American Indians already there. The responsibilities of the job, however, were contradictory. It was virtually impossible for Harrison to ensure the rights of American Indians while protecting the interests of the American government and expanding territory. He chose the latter as his focus, seizing millions of acres of land from the American Indians including two million acres along the Wabash River in 1809, claiming land that would become the present states of Indiana and Illinois. This encroachment, paired with the influx of white settlers resulted in increased Indian resentment and violence. Harrison quickly attributed these outbursts of hostilities to British intervention, not recognizing his own influence on exacerbating waning relations with the native people.</p> <p>This conflict between territory and ideology came to a head in 1811, at the Battle of Tippecanoe. Tecumseh, a Shawnee chieftain familiar with white society and convinced of the threat of white cultural amalgamation, preached the idea of an Indian confederation of all nations which would bind them and their lands together against the Americans, establishing a headquarters near the confluence of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers. As Tecumseh assembled a defensive army set to repel any American entering Indian territory, Harrison led an offensive force of 1,000 men to destroy the confederation.</p> <p>The success at the Battle of Tippecanoe later propelled Harrison on to the presidency. With his running mate, John Tyler, he campaigned under the slogan “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.” Although Harrison was born in Virginia, nostalgia for heroes of the frontier, and his populist image as an Indian fighter and military hero resulted in a landslide victory. Harrison’s presidency was short, but symbolic of the continued American obsession with military glory and unabashed westward expansion.</p>",

She and her younger brother Max Eastman, with whom she was close her entire life, lived in the “bohemian” community of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/greenwich-village-historic-district.htm\">Greenwich Village</a> alongside friends and colleagues like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/inez-milholland.htm\">Inez Milholland</a> and Doris Stevens. Eastman and Max would go on to start the socialist magazine <em>The Liberator</em> in 1918. The magazine published essays, art, fiction, and poems by prominent figures including Ernest Hemingway, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/helen-keller.htm\">Helen Keller</a>, and Claude McKay.[1]</p> <h4>Reform Work</h4> <p>After graduating from law school, Eastman found work investigating labor conditions and workplace accidents in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She published a book based on this study, <em>Work Accidents and the Law</em> (1910). Eastman drafted a workers’ compensation law for New York State that required employers to cover costs for injuries endured on the job. The law was the first of its kind in the country. The next year, 146 workers, mostly young women, died in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/triangle-shirtwaist-factory-brown-building.htm\">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory</a> fire in New York City.[2] Their families received almost no compensation. After a public outcry, several states passed workers’ compensation laws based on Eastman’s model.<br /> <br /> Eastman was also active in the suffrage movement. In 1912, she spearheaded a state suffrage campaign in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wisconsin-women-s-history.htm\">Wisconsin</a>. Its failure convinced her that the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)’s state-by-state strategy was too slow. In 1913, she joined <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-burns.htm\">Lucy Burns</a> to found the Congressional Union (later the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/index.htm\">National Woman’s Party</a>) to press for a suffrage amendment to the constitution.<br /> <br /> Eastman was a committed peace activist. She and colleagues <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jane-addams.htm\">Jane Addams</a> and Lillian Wald founded the Woman’s Peace Party (WPP, later the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom) in 1915. The U.S.’s entry into World War I challenged the pacifist commitments of many Progressive reformers. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">Carrie Chapman Catt</a>, another WPP founder and the leader of NAWSA, very reluctantly decided to support the war effort to advance the suffrage cause. Eastman stayed the course and added work founding the National Civil Liberties Bureau, to protect the rights of conscientious objectors to military service. This organization became the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). However, Eastman’s role in its founding was downplayed by the other male leadership, because she was recovering from a difficult pregnancy and childbirth and couldn’t attend early meetings.</p> <h4>“Now We Can Begin”</h4> <p>After the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, Eastman set her sights on achieving full freedom for women. In a classic speech called “Now We Can Begin,” she laid out her vision. Now that the vote was won, women could say “what they are really after; and what they are after, in common with all the rest of the struggling world, is freedom.” Eastman called for equal pay for women workers and an end to employment discrimination. To advance that cause, she co-authored the Equal Rights Amendment with Alice Paul.<br /> <br /> But Eastman didn’t stop there. She argued that women could never be truly equal in the wider world without equality in the home. Men needed to take on their fair share of housekeeping and childcare. Women needed to be able to control if and when they had children. The government and society should recognize and compensate domestic labor as essential work. In her speech, Eastman called for the kinds of changes that would become central to the second-wave feminist movement decades later.<br /> <br /> Crystal Eastman was married twice. Her marriage to Wallace Benedict ended in divorce after Eastman learned of his infidelities. In 1916 she married Walter Fuller. The couple had two children, Jeffrey and Annis. Eastman died on July 28, 1928, from kidney disease. She was 48.</p> <h4><br /> Notes</h4> <p>[1] The Ernest Hemingway House in Key West, Florida was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 24, 1968. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ivy-green-helen-keller-birthplace.htm\">Ivy Green</a>, the birthplace of suffragist and disability activist Helen Keller located in Tuscumbia, Alabama, was designated a National Historic Landmark on August 25, 1970.

            "bodyText": "<p>Eva McDonald Valesh was an investigative journalist and labor activist. She exposed unsafe conditions for women workers in the Twin Cities during the late nineteenth century and became a prominent labor writer and speaker.<br /> <br /> Eva McDonald Valesh was born Mary Eva McDonald in 1866 in Orono, Maine into a working-class family. Her father John, who had grown up in Canada, was a carpenter and bridge-builder. When McDonald was eleven, her family moved to Minnesota, following work in the lumber industry. McDonald graduated from high school in Minneapolis at the age of fifteen. She went on to teacher training school, but found teaching \"dreary.\" She began searching for another way to support herself.</p> <h4>Labor Journalist</h4> <p>McDonald soon got a job writing for a reform newspaper in Minneapolis, the Saturday Evening Spectator. She seized the opportunity to learn typesetting, a lucrative skilled trade, and to hone her skills as a journalist. In 1888, McDonald launched a column series for the St. Paul Globe, reporting on how working people were really living in the Twin Cities. She disguised herself in raggedy clothes and got jobs in flour mills and garment factories. With her slight stature and short haircut, she seemed barely into her teens. “I looked as if I hadn’t eaten a square meal in a long time,” she remembered later. She gained the trust of fellow working women and escaped the scrutiny of factory bosses.<br /> <br /> Her first article, “ ‘Mong Girls Who Toil,” appeared in March of 1888 under the pen name “Eva Gay.” She reported on the poor conditions that women workers suffered. Long hours in crowded workshops with little light or ventilation. Dangerous chemicals and industrial machinery. Sexual harassment from male bosses and coworkers. Paltry wages. Her exposé of conditions at the Shotwell, Clerihew, and Lothmann garment factory on Second Street in Minneapolis prompted women workers there to go on strike. This was the first large women’s strike in the history of the Twin Cities.</p> <h4>Labor Agitator</h4> <p>McDonald became an in-demand speaker for the Knights of Labor, the Farmers’ Alliance, and the Eight-Hour League. She continued to work as a labor journalist, covering the 1889 Twin Cities streetcar strike. She ran (unsuccessfully) for Minneapolis school board, becoming one of the state's first female candidates for political office. After marrying Frank Valesh in 1891, she continued to work. Only a near-death experience in childbirth in 1892 curtailed her public speaking activities.<br /> <br /> In 1896, McDonald Valesh moved to New York City with her son Frank and her sister Blanche. She began working for the American Federation of Labor (AFL), as the “right-hand man” of its president Samuel Gompers, a longtime friend. She also served as editor of the AFL’s journal, the American Federationist. McDonald Valesh was one of the few women in leadership with the AFL. By the early 1900s, it was a conservative advocate for native-born white men in skilled trades. The AFL discouraged the participation of immigrant, Black, and women workers. It would take until the 1920s for the women's organized labor movement to be welcome in the AFL.<br /> <br /> Eva McDonald Valesh remained on the East Coast for the rest of her life. After having a heart attack in 1919, she retired from the world of labor activism and spent the rest of her career as a proofreader for the New York Times. She died in 1956 at the age of ninety.<br />  </p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Cartwright, R.

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Frances Perkins was born in 1880 in Massachusetts. During her childhood, she often spent summers visiting her grandmother at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/frances-perkins-homestead.htm\">Perkins Family Homestead</a> in Newcastle, Maine. She always considered this her \"true home,\" and lived there later in life.<sup>1</sup> Perkins challenged gender norms of the day by attending college. In the late nineteenth century, it was unusual for women to receive advanced education as they were expected to become wives, mothers, and caretakers. At Mount Holyoke College, Perkins learned about the dangers of sweatshop work and child labor, which later influenced her career.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">After college, Perkins moved to Chicago to be a teacher. She also became active at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hull-house.htm\">Hull House</a>, a settlement house co-founded by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jane-addams.htm\">Jane Addams</a>. The Hull House was dedicated to helping poorer residents of the city by providing job training and free child care.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">After spending several years as a social worker, Perkins moved to Greenwich Village in New York City to attend school. At <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/low-memorial-library.htm\">Columbia University</a> where she earned a master's degree from the faculty of political science, Frances also became active in the suffrage movement, attending meetings and street protests. After her graduation in 1910, she got a job advocating for the rights of workers as the leader of the New York Consumers League. In 1911, she was witness to the deaths of 146 people, mostly women, in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/triangle-shirtwaist-factory-brown-building.htm\">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory</a> fire in New York City. Several stairwell doors in the building had been locked to keep workers from taking unauthorized breaks. Many of the fire's victims ended up trapped behind these doors.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Perkins was passionate about her work and former New York state governor Theodore Roosevelt, was impressed by her work ethic. He recommended that she serve as the executive secretary for the Committee on Safety in the City of New York. Spurred by what she saw at the Triangle Fire, in 1912, she left the Consumers League and took the job. Perkins used her position at the Committee on Safety in the City of New York to advocate for legislation to make factories safer for workers, to cap the maximum number of hours women could work in a week, and she supported the creation of a minimum wage.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1913, Frances married Paul Caldwell Wilson. She chose to keep her maiden name, and defended her choice in court. Their daughter, Susanna, was born in December 1916. Shortly after Susanna's birth, Paul began showing signs of mental illness, and would be in and out of institutions for the rest of their marriage. Frances would often live with other women in DC, including Mary Rumsey (founder of the Junior League) and Representative Carolyn O'Day. Her husband remained in New York City.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Frances Perkins held several positions in New York State government, including becoming the first New York State Industrial Commissioner—a job to which the newly elected state governor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, appointed her in 1929. Expanding factory inspections and investigations, she worked to implement unemployment insurance laws, to end child labor, and to continue to improve the safety conditions of factories.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Atop the Golden Gate Bridge: steel crew foreman Grover McClain, Labor Secretary Frances Perkins and welder S.E.

Perkins became the first woman to hold a cabinet position. She worked with President Roosevelt to enact social welfare laws and programs as part of the New Deal, including Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act. She also continued to lead efforts to eliminate child labor and establish a minimum wage. When President Harry Truman took office in 1945, he selected a new Secretary of Labor, and Perkins' tenure ended. She continued in federal service on the United States Civil Service Commission, where she fought against discrimination in federal hiring. She left the Commission when Paul died in 1952.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/frances-perkins-house.htm\">From 1937 to 1940, Frances Perkins lived at 2326 California Street NW in Washington, DC</a> with Representative Carolyn O'Day.

            "bodyText": "The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) rarely commented on activities and commodities that were considered \"in-country.\" In-country were activities or items that did not have either a related expense or profit, and were generally not tracked through the typical HBC accounting systems and reports. <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/articles/000/drmcloughlinsgarden.htm\">Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin's garden at Fort Vancouver</a>, vital as it was to the representation of the HBC's role as a colonial power, and to the nutrition and health of HBC officers and their families, was one of these \"in-country\" endeavors. The bulk of information we have on the garden and its role at Fort Vancouver comes from casual or unofficial observations from visitors and employees. And, like the garden he cared for, William Bruce, the head gardener at Fort Vancouver from about 1833 to 1849, is an enigma.<br /> <br /> William Bruce (usually referred to as Billy) possessed a noble surname, but it appears that he was born into the lower classes, as he was initially contracted to the HBC as a laborer, the lowest level in the HBC hierarchy of positions. Laborers generally did not have a formal education and were illiterate, which was fairly common at the time. It is intriguing that Billy managed the garden, for which some reading, writing, and math skills would have been helpful. Even more intriguing, had Billy gained experience as a gardener before signing on with the HBC?<br /> <br /> Billy was born in Dornoch in the county of Sutherland, which is located in the Scottish Highlands. Dornoch is a seaside town on the north shore of the Dornoch Firth (a firth is an inlet or strait), near the northern tip of Scotland. At the time that Billy lived there, Dornoch was the only market town in the parish and the only royal burgh in the county, meaning it had a royal charter. The charter was awarded by Charles I in 1628 and allowed the town to govern certain affairs on its own. It was also a parliamentary burgh, represented (along with several surrounding towns) by one member in the British House of Commons. A notable feature of the town was the Church of Scotland's Dornoch Cathedral. The population of Dornoch was 3,100 people in 1821, just previous to Billy signing on with the HBC. There were several large states with titled owners in the local area. Agriculture was the primary occupation, with small farmers being replaced by large scale farming in a series of evictions known as the Highland Clearances, which took place from about 1750 to 1860. This shift in land tenure caused many people to leave Scotland just as Billy did, going to Canada, America, and other worldwide locations.<br /> <br /> Billy lived in, or very near, a relatively cosmopolitan town, a seat of both church and state, with extensive alteration of the landscape for estate gardens and lands, and large-scale farming. Billy may well have had access to a limited education through the parish school of the time, and the opportunity to work in these \"corporate\" landscapes. <br /> <br /> Based on the date of his initial contract, June 20, 1825, Billy would have been born no later than 1810. However, George B. Roberts, another employee of the HBC in the Pacific Northwest, referred to Billy as \"old.\" Roberts was born in 1816, so it's likely that Billy was born much earlier than 1810. Also, he had amassed a significant amount of debt before he signed on with the HBC, suggesting that he had been an adult for some time. Because of the opportunities available to him in Dornoch, it is likely he had enough education and professional experience to succeed in the demanding position of a head gardener in the early Victoria Period. Although his contract continued to list him as a laborer, obviously <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnmcloughlin.htm\">Dr. McLoughlin</a> saw enough talent or potential that he placed Billy in the role of head gardener. The two of them would have worked closely together, as was typical of the time for property owners and their gardeners, producing a functional and aesthetically pleasing space that was a collaboration of efforts.<br /> <br /> There are conflicting accounts as to when this horticultural collaboration began. Billy arrived at Fort Vancouver in 1826. According to Eloisa, Dr. McLoughlin's daughter, in 1827 they \"got a good gardener and didn't need an Indian after that,\" obviously indicating that the garden was cared for by local American Indian workers up to that time. The garden referred to by Eloisa was most likely located near the first fort site, on the ridge to the northeast of the fort's final location on the plain. However, personnel records indicate that Billy was primarily working in the storehouses at that time. It wasn't until 1833 that he was officially listed as the gardener.<br /> <br /> Then, in October of 1838, Billy retired from the HBC and returned to England. After arriving there, Billy had a change of heart and begged Dr. McLoughlin, who was in London at the time, for his job back. Records show that Billy started a new contract with the HBC that year. Before returning to Fort Vancouver however, the HBC Directors requested that Bruce be allowed to visit <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/chiswick-house/\">Chiswick House</a> (the Duke of Devonshire's estate outside of London) in order to learn to care for plants that Joseph Paxton, principal gardener for the Duke, had given to the HBC for Fort Vancouver.<br /> <br /> It is interesting that Billy was allowed to visit such a location. Status was extremely important, even in the garden setting. Billy's status as an HBC laborer, the lowest position on the HBC hierarchical scale, should have made it impossible. It was also highly unusual for someone of Billy's social status to be the head gardener for such a prestigious establishment as Fort Vancouver. It is possible that Billy visited the Horticultural Society of London's experimental and educational garden, leased from the Duke of Devonshire, also located at Chiswick and referred to as \"Chiswick.\" Joseph Paxton had been trained at this other \"Chiswick.\" However, the letter asking permission for the garden visit is specifically addressed to the Duke of Devonshire. And, according to a letter written to Paxton by Charles Edmonds, the gardener at the duke's estate of Chiswick House, Billy visited the garden there just previous to November 5, 1838. The fact that Billy was allowed to visit the Duke of Devonshire's garden at Chiswick House speaks not only to the power of the HBC, but also that of the position of head gardener at Fort Vancouver, one of the HBC's North American headquarters.<br /> <br /> Billy seems to have adopted different stances about his visit at Chiswick and his efforts at Fort Vancouver. Some sources indicate that he intended to emulate the garden at Chiswick, mirroring its style, others indicate that he was dismissive of Chiswick, stating that the garden at Fort Vancouver was quite superior. Working at one of the HBC's primary posts provided access to global resources, making the goal of establishing such a garden - on the frontier - realistic. Contemporary accounts from visitors and employees, and archaeological evidence, illustrate a garden that was highly sophisticated in its variety of species. Historical documents also indicate that the garden was a pleasure ground restricted to those invited in by Dr. McLoughlin, though he also shared its ripe bounty with certain individuals and seeds with arriving pioneers.<br /> <br /> William \"Billy\" Bruce's work at the Fort Vancouver garden was essential to the image of the fort and the HBC both in the Northwest and in England. He continued as head gardener at Fort Vancouver until his death on August 25, 1849.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Freedom seeker William Craft notably escaped slavery by acting as the enslaved man of his wife <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ellen-craft.htm\">Ellen Craft</a>, who disguised herself as a sickly, White gentleman.</p> <p>Growing up enslaved in Georgia, Craft experienced the painful separation of his family. He recalled the irony that his enslaver “had the reputation of being a very humane and Christian man,” however, “thought nothing of selling my poor old father, and dear aged mother, at separate times, to different persons, to be dragged off never to behold each other again.<sup>1</sup> After selling Craft’s parents, his enslaver sold three more of William’s siblings. Due to his enslaver’s financial issues, the bank took ownership of William (age 16) and his sister (age 14) and sent them to auction.<sup>2</sup> Having been refused the opportunity to say goodbye to his sister, Craft recalled watching \"tears trickling down her cheeks” as her enslaver took her away.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>While enslaved, William Craft worked as an apprentice to a cabinetmaker, building his craftsmanship skills that would help him later in life. Craft soon met Ellen Smith, an enslaved woman with lighter skin. Despite desiring freedom, they recognized the challenges that came with escaping and instead decided to get married and “settle down in slavery.”<sup>4</sup> Their plans changed in 1848 when William Craft devised a plan to escape. He proposed to his wife that due to her light skin color, she could dress as an ill, young, White planter, and he could play the role of the planter’s enslaved man. While Ellen Craft had her doubts, she agreed to use these disguises to escape to freedom.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>The Crafts began their journey to freedom on December 21, 1848. Upon leaving their home in Macon, Georgia, William Craft said to his wife, “Come my dear, let us make a desperate leap for liberty!”<sup>6</sup> They traveled to Savannah, Georgia, and then made their way up the East Coast, taking various steamers and trains. When William Craft saw Philadelphia in the distance on Christmas morning, he recalled “I... felt that the straps that bound the heavy burden to my back began to pop, and the load to roll off.”<sup>7</sup> They rested a few weeks in Philadelphia at the home of abolitionists before continuing north to Boston.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>William and Ellen Craft joined the Black community in Boston’s Beacon Hill, staying at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-and-harriet-hayden-house.htm\">Lewis and Harriet Hayden’s house</a>. For the next two years, William worked as a cabinet-maker, opening his own <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/william-craft-s-shop.htm\">shop at 51 Cambridge Street</a>.<sup>9</sup> Craft and his wife also participated in anti-slavery meetings, sharing their experiences and their story of their escape. However, the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law threatened the Crafts’ safety. In November of that year, two slave catchers successfully acquired a warrant to take the Crafts back into slavery. While abolitionists took Ellen Craft outside of the city, William Craft armed himself at his shop before going to the Haydens’ house. Years later, Craft notably recalled,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>One night… Lewis Hayden and I had a keg of gunpowder under his house in Phillips Street [formerly Southac Street], with a fuse attached ready to light it should any attempt be made to capture us.</em><sup>10</sup></p> <p>Due to the efforts of the abolitionist community, the slave catchers left Boston. Realizing their freedom remained at risk, the Crafts decided to leave for England. Before their departure, their friend, Reverend Theodore Parker, remarried them \"according to the laws of a free State.\"<sup>11</sup></p> <p>In England, William and Ellen Craft started their family while also continuing to advocate against slavery. They spoke at various events, including at the Great Exhibition in London, and also wrote about their escape in <em>Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or the Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery</em>. During these years in England, newspapers document that William Craft frequently traveled to West Africa to encourage an end to the slave trade by “negotiating a commercial treaty with some of the chiefs on the western shores” as a representative of English merchants.<sup>12</sup> According to <em>The Liberator</em>, in 1863 Craft left England to meet with the West African King of Dahomey to show him “the superior advantages of peaceful and legitimate commerce over the atrocious slave-trade with its concomitant barbarities.”<sup>13</sup></p> <p>After the end of the American Civil War, William Craft and his family returned to Georgia. In 1873, they established the Woodville Co-operative Farm School to help newly emancipated men and women. Although initially successful, the Crafts had to shut down the school in the 1880s due to economic issues. William Craft and his wife lived the remaining years of their lives in Charleston, South Carolina with their daughter’s family.<sup>14</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">\"A Desperate Leap for Liberty\": The Escape of William and Ellen Craft</a></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>William Craft,<em> Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery</em> (337 Strand, London: William Tweedie, 1860), <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/runningthousandm00craf/page/88/mode/2up?q=may\">https://archive.org/details/runningthousandm00craf/page/88/mode/2up?q=may</a>, 9.</li> <li>Craft, <em>Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</em>, 10-11</li> <li>Craft, <em>Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</em>, 12</li> <li>Craft, <em>Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</em>, 29.</li> <li>Craft, <em>Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</em>, 29.</li> <li>Craft,<em> Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</em>, 41.</li> <li>Craft, <em>Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</em>, 79.</li> <li>For more information about the Craft’s escape to freedom, explore the story map: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">\"A Desperate Leap for Liberty\": The Escape of William and Ellen Craft</a>.</li> <li>For more information about William Craft’s shop, see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/william-craft-s-shop.htm\">Site of William Craft’s Shop</a>.</li> <li>Vincent Yardley Bowditch, <em>Life and Correspondence of Henry Ingersoll Bowditch</em> (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1902), <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifecorresponden02bowd/page/n399/mode/2up?q=craft\">https://archive.org/details/lifecorresponden02bowd/page/n399/mode/2up?q=craft</a>, 373.</li> <li>William Still, <em>Still's Underground Rail Road Records: With a Life of the Author.

            "bodyText": "<p>Steadfast in her belief of self and ability to change the world, Lucy Stone stands as a historical titan, her “Unapologetic Life” a model of a revolutionary. Born near West Brookfield, Massachusetts in 1818,<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Stone graduated from Oberlin College in 1847, becoming the first Massachusetts woman to earn her bachelor’s degree. At her graduation ceremony, she met radical abolitionists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, an uncanny foreshadowing of her future work as a lecturer for the abolition and woman’s rights movements.<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p> <p>In 1848, Stone began working as a paid lecturer for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. During that first year, she established herself as an exemplary abolitionist lecturer, a cause she continued to champion throughout her life. She traveled extensively and lectured tirelessly, exerting a gentle but commanding presence each time she stepped on stage to speak. In these early years of lecturing for anti-slavery Stone began to speak also for woman’s rights.</p> <p>Questioned when she dared to speak for the cause of the rights afforded woman at an anti-slavery meeting, Stone replied “I was a woman before I was an abolitionist.”<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> By mid-1851 Stone ended her contract with the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to dedicate herself completely to the woman’s suffrage movement.<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> As a principal organizer of the 1850 Worcester First National Woman’s Rights Convention and publisher of the <i><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-woman-s-journal-office.htm\">Woman’s Journal</a></i>, Stone strove to use her voice as a force for change. In the words of her daughter Alice, “Her adventures during the next few years would fill a volume. No suffrage association was formed till long after this time. She had no cooperation and no backing, and started out absolutely alone.”<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p> <p>Throughout her decades of work, Stone continued to support progress for both women and the enslaved. In 1869, debate erupted within the woman’s rights movement over the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-fifteenth-amendment.htm\">15<sup>th</sup> Amendment</a>, an amendment guaranteeing suffrage for African American men. Though Stone remained true to abolitionist ideals and used her influence to support its passage, a faction opposed the 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment which created a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/why-the-women-s-rights-movement-split-over-the-15th-amendment.htm\">schism within the woman’s rights movement</a>. When the third annual American Equal Rights Association Convention dissolved, a casualty of that faction, Stone founded the American Woman Suffrage Association later that year.<a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> She recognized the value of progress, even when not universal.</p> <p>Stone not only labored for the movement, she upheld it in each of the decisions she made in her personal life. Despite reservations about the institution of marriage, in 1855 Stone married Henry Browne Blackwell. From the outset, their partnership was revolutionary. At the ceremony Stone and Blackwell read a Marriage Protest, a statement the two wrote together denouncing all legal portions of marriage in which a woman became subservient to and property of her husband.<a href=\"#_ftn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Stone retained her maiden name, a decision which often proved controversial and left an ongoing legacy.<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> After the birth of her daughter Alice in 1857, Stone took a brief hiatus from her active role in the woman’s rights movement, returning with all of her previous vigor less than a year later at a time when women rarely worked outside the home. While at home nursing young Alice, in protest to her lack of a vote, Stone refused to pay her city taxes, forcing the town constable to auction off her household items to pay the disputed tax.<a href=\"#_ftn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Stone’s 1858 refusal to pay her taxes preceded an 1873 speech she delivered at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/fh.htm\">Faneuil Hall</a> during a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/boston-womens-tea-party.htm\">Women’s Tea Party</a> in which she decried the ability of the government to tax women without endorsing suffrage. Stone proclaimed “Great Britain never dared to do to the colonies, what Massachusetts does to the women of this State to-day.”<a href=\"#_ftn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Without hesitation, Stone paralleled the plight of the Thirteen Colonies with the disenfranchisement of women in much the same way she often linked the oppression of women with the enslaved in her speeches.</p> <p>The woman who decisively merged her political and private spheres lived to witness the abolition of slavery, but not the ratification of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">19<sup>th</sup> Amendment</a> which guaranteed women’s suffrage. In 1893 as she lay dying of stomach cancer, Stone reflected, “I am glad I was born, and that at a time when the world needed the service I could give.”<a href=\"#_ftn11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Her words remain a statement truly befitting the woman, suffragist, and abolitionist who worked relentlessly to secure freedom for the enslaved and rights for women. With the dying words, “Make the world better,” the indefatigable Lucy Stone departed this world, a bone fide pioneer of her time.</p> <p><em><strong>Contributed by: Amelia Benstead, Park Guide</strong></em></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <div id=\"ftn1\"> <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Joelle Million, <i>Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Woman's Rights Movement</i> (Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2003): 6.<br /> <a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Sally G.

            "bodyText": "<blockquote> <p><em><strong>“Those years at Point Bonita were the happiest in my life.”</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Freda Engel may not have initially believed she would ever speak those words when she first began her life as a lighthouse keeper’s wife. When she was newly wedded to Hermann Engel, he rowed her to their new home in the Oakland Harbor Light. Freda was not pleased to discover that their bed was located just below the lighthouse’s foghorn. But Freda, resilient and tireless, quickly adapted to a life of relative isolation, never-ending adventure, and important duties. Afterall, lighthouse keepers and their families sacrificed a lot to uphold their duty of guiding lost and sea swept lives to safety.</p> <p>In 1901, Freda and her husband were transferred to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/pobo.htm\">Point Bonita Lighthouse</a>. Life at Point Bonita was not easy. Quarters were split between two families, with the Engels’ share being a meager 20 x 15 feet. They received rations from the army commissary, and their only neighbors were other lighthouse keeping families, members of the U.S. Lifesaving Service, and U.S. Army garrisons. Transportation to San Francisco involved walking three miles to the Sausalito ferry. Later, a little pier was built below the quarters of the lighthouse keepers that eliminated the need to trek to Sausalito. The pier led to a rough, steep path up a cliff. A flatbed funicular bore freight up the incline. Although regulations forbade passengers, those who were daring could hitch a ride by sitting on the flatbed or clinging to the lashings. It would take 15 minutes to reach the top or bottom.</p> <p><img alt=\"Freda Engel Cabbage\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|1200|1600|0|0|0\" height=\"1600\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6589602|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Engel-2.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;\" title=\"Freda Engel Cabbage\" width=\"1200\" /><br /> <em><sub>Freda’s cabbage growing near the Point Bonita Lighthouse. Photo credit: Lauren Utykanski NPS.</sub></em><br /> <br /> It was on one such journey to San Francisco that Freda, tired of Army rations, purchased cabbage seeds. Against all odds, she tilled the seeds into the unforgiving Point Bonita soil while five months pregnant, and the garden succeeded. Her legacy on the landscape lives on today, as Freda’s cabbage is now a common sight along the volcanic cliffs of Point Bonita.</p> <p>Freda’s adaptability would be put to the test during the calamitous 1906 earthquake that rumbled Point Bonita and toppled San Francisco. Freda gathered her children and ushered them outside while they watched in shock as their home collapsed into rubble. Hermann Engel, bound to his duty to watch over the lives of those at sea, could not abandon his post to check on the wellbeing of his family. Freda tended to herself and her children on her own. It would be two years until their house was restored.</p> <p>Freda wasn’t the only strong woman to live at or near a lighthouse. In fact, lighthouse keeping was one of the first non-clerical U.S. government jobs to ever be opened to women. These female trailblazers performed the laborious tasks of tending to the light, keeping detailed logs of passing ships and weather patterns, and watching for shipwrecked lives far before they could vote in federal elections. Their grit and gumption are remembered today through historical records and logs, and by the storytellers dedicated to preserving their memory.</p> <p>One such storyteller is Norma Engel, Freda’s daughter. Freda’s story, and the story of the Point Bonita Lighthouse itself, would not be so accurately and descriptively preserved if not for Norma, who wrote a book on her mother’s life titled Three Beams of Light. As a detailed and playful narrator, Norma enabled Point Bonita’s story to live on for future generations. At Point Bonita today, we remember Freda’s courage and dedication, as well as Norma’s fantastic skill for storytelling, through our interpretive and educational programs. These two women enrich Point Bonita’s history, and provide a shining example for us all.</p> <p>What aspects of your life could you write about now that would help future historians better understand the places that you inhabit?</p> <p> </p> <p><sub><strong>Sources: </strong>Three Beams of Light: Chronicles of a Lighthouse Keeper’s Family.

How did you try to understand their point of view?</em></strong><br /> <br /> <br /> In 1909, thousands of garment workers in New York factories went out on strike. Most of these workers were young, immigrant women with roots in Southern and Eastern Europe. They risked arrest and lost wages to demand better hours, <br /> <a id=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014684499/\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014684499/'\"><img alt=\"Two women face the camera wearing picket signs\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|350|257|0|5|5\" height=\"257\" id=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2014684499/||CPIMAGE:6731502|0|\" src=\"/subjects/womenshistory/images/uprising-picketers.jpg\" style=\"float:left;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;\" title=\"Strike pickets, 1910. Library of Congress.\" width=\"350\" /></a>safer conditions, and fairer pay. The strike was soon known as the “Uprising of 20,000.”<br /> <br /> Leaders like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/clara-lemlich-shavelson.htm\">Clara Lemlich</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/rose-schneiderman.htm\">Rose Schneiderman</a>, and Pauline Newman motivated the strikers. They picketed for three months on the wintry city streets. Through an organization called the Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL), they collaborated with wealthier women like suffragist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alva-belmont.htm\">Alva Belmont</a> and reformer Mary Dreier.[1]<br /> <br /> Philanthropists like Anne Morgan, Dorothy Whitney Straight, and Arabella Huntington funded the cause. Morgan was the daughter of financier J. P. Morgan, Whitney Straight belonged to the prominent Whitney family, and Arabella Huntington was at one point known as the richest woman in America.[2] They covered food and rent for picketing workers. They also bailed strikers out of jail. Anne Morgan told the <em>New York Times</em>: </p> <blockquote> <p>“If we come to fully recognize these conditions, we can’t live our own lives without doing something to help them, bringing them at least the support of public opinion.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of these women joined the pickets themselves. Their expensive clothes identified them as members of high society. They were later mockingly termed the \"mink brigade,\" but their presence made a difference. <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/mnwp.274005\"><img alt=\"Full-length portrait of woman in fur-trimmed coat and muff.\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|300|452|0|5|5\" height=\"452\" id=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/mnwp.274005||CPIMAGE:6731512|0|\" src=\"/subjects/womenshistory/images/alva-belmont.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;\" title=\"Alva Belmont, 1911. Library of Congress.\" width=\"300\" /></a>Police were reluctant to beat or mistreat strikers when \"respectable\" women were among them. When they arrested WTUL president Mary Dreier, a public outcry drew sympathy for the striking workers.<br /> <br /> As union leader Rose Schneiderman wrote, the mink brigade \"lent prestige and, more important, an aura of respectability to our demonstrations. This was most important for it helped to weaken the attempts of the unsympathetic to force the women back to work through prison sentences and physical violence.\"</p> <p>The alliance between upper-class and working-class women was not without tension. Union women sometimes felt patronized by their wealthier allies. They argued that wealthy women could not understand what workers' lives were like. They also pointed out the unfairness of a society that was shocked at violence against wealthy women, but unmoved when the victims were workers.<br /> <br /> In 1911, a devastating fire at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/triangle-shirtwaist-factory-brown-building.htm\">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory</a> in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/greenwich-village-historic-district.htm\">Greenwich Village</a> made the stakes of the movement painfully clear.[3] The factory managers had locked the doors to the stairwells to keep workers from taking unauthorized breaks. As a result, scores of them were trapped.<br /> <br /> Of the factory's five hundred employees, one hundred and forty-six died in the conflagration. Sixty-two of them died after falling or jumping from the building's windows, trying to escape the flames. Most of the victims were women and girls, some as young as fourteen years old.</p> <p>Following the fire, Rose Schneiderman gave an impassioned speech to the WTUL. She argued that money and sympathy from wealthy supporters was not enough:</p> <blockquote> <p>“I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting… you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers, and sisters by way of a charity gift. … I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Schneiderman and her allies continued to work to build this movement, but they did not give up on cross-class collaboration. The WTUL worked on protective legislation for women as well as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-necessity-of-other-social-movements-to-the-struggle-for-woman-suffrage.htm\">suffrage</a>.<a id=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007681765/\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007681765/'\"><img alt=\"Logo design featuring a woman with baby shaking hands with an armored woman.\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|200|234|0|5|5\" height=\"234\" id=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007681765/||CPIMAGE:6731519|0|\" src=\"/subjects/womenshistory/images/WTUL-logo.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;\" title=\"WTUL logo, 1908.

She and Schneiderman became <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/eleanor-roosevelt-and-women-s-rights.htm\">close associates</a>. [4] Members of the \"mink brigade\" influenced the labor legislation of the New Deal and beyond.</p> <h4>Notes</h4> <p>[1] Alva Belmont, also a benefactor for the suffrage movement, and Alice Paul, founder of the National Woman’s Party, are the namesakes of what is now the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/index.htm\">Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument</a> in Washington, DC. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and designed a National Historic Landmark in 1974. It became a NPS unit in 2016.<br /> [2] The Elms, a mansion built by the Whitney family in Newport, RI in 1901, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1971. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 19, 1996. <br /> [3] The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory building, now known as the Brown Building, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1991.<br /> [4] Schneiderman became a close friend and associate of Roosevelt and often spent time at Val-Kill, Roosevelt’s home in Hyde Park, NY.

Her reporting introduced readers to the horrors of insane asylums and to international travel. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Born Elizabeth Cochran Seaman, Nellie Bly grew up in Pennsylvania in an area that is now a suburb of Pittsburgh. Her grandfather was an Irish immigrant, and Bly’s father had spent his working life moving up from a mill worker to a merchant and associate justice. After her father’s death, Bly’s mother moved the family into Pittsburgh. In response to an article in the paper that stated that girls were of use for bearing children and keeping house, Bly wrote an anonymous letter to the editor of the <i>Pittsburgh Dispatch. </i>Impressed with her response,<i> </i>the editor published a note inviting the writer to reveal herself and accept a job writing at the newspaper. As a journalist and columnist, she chose her pseudonym: Nellie Bly. She would continue to use this name for much of her professional career. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">After writing about women’s factory conditions in Pittsburgh, Bly moved to Mexico and reported on the government’s unfair imprisonment and censorship of Mexican journalists. When she was threatened with arrest, Bly moved to New York City. There, she worked with Joseph Pulitzer at the <i>New York World</i>. Her first assignment was an undercover investigation of the Women’s Lunatic Asylum on </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/blackwell-s-island-new-york-city.htm\">Blackwell’s Island</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">. The word “lunatic” comes from <i>luna, </i>meaning moon, and the popular misconception that the changing moon could cause people to have fevers or to act irrationally. In Bly’s lifetime, “lunatic” was an umbrella term used to describe any person with a mental illness or behavioral disorder. Tourette's syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, anger or rage disorders, schizophrenia, depression, and many other illnesses were not well-known in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, people with a variety of symptoms could be considered “lunatics” and sent to an asylum. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">After pretending to have amnesia, Bly was committed to the asylum. Inside the asylum, she found other patients who had been committed when they were also healthy. Many of these patients could not speak fluent English, so they could not convince the nurses that they were actually sane. While posing as a patient, Bly documented the abuse and neglect in the asylum: physical and emotional abuse from caretakers, cold showers, filthy living conditions, spoiled food, etc. Bly wrote a book chronicling these experiences at Blackwell’s Island: <i>Ten Days in a Madhouse. </i>This book sparked hospital and asylum reforms across the United States, and it catapulted Bly to fame. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">After her time in the Women’s Lunatic Asylum, Bly set out to travel around the world, inspired by Jules Verne’s novel <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i>. The <i>New York World </i>covered her trip, and readers eagerly followed the journalist’s progress. Bly returned to the United States 72 days after she had departed. She set a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Bly’s journalism career would later include stories about industrialization, coverage of </span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwari/index.htm\">World War I</a><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">, and support for the suffrage movement.

As a boy he traveled the world with his parents and his brother Herbert Jr., seldom staying in the same school for more than a few months at a time.</p> <h2>London</h2> <p>At the age of eight during the First World War, the Allan traveled with his family back to the city of his birth as his father dedicated himself to providing food relief for Belgian people. In his memoirs, Herbert Hoover would remember “furiously” searching the house for his two sons during a Zeppelin raid on the British capital, eventually finding Allan and Herbert Jr. on the roof calmly watching the air battle being fought above the city. </p> <h2>California</h2> <p>Returning to the United States in 1917 and graduating from Palo Alto High School in 1924, Allan Hoover enrolled at his parents’ alma mater, Stanford University. While still a student, he was the only member of the Hoover family present for Herbert’s nomination for presidency at the 1928 Republican convention. After the election, he accompanied his parents on the president-elect’s tour of Latin America, before returning to Stanford to finish his degree. After a stint at Harvard Business School, he headed back to California to found a successful agribusiness enterprise in the San Joaquin Valley. </p> <h2>West Branch</h2> <p>Allan Hoover played an important role in preserving his father’s story for future generations. In 1935, he purchased the birthplace cottage. With his mother, Allan oversaw its restoration for its opening to the public in 1940. He served on the board of Hoover Foundation and the Boys’ Clubs of America, an organization near and dear to his father’s heart. He has been credited with convincing his father to be buried in West Branch and with the idea of an unobstructed view from the cottage to his gravesite. In 1937, Allan married Margaret Copley. The couple had three children, Allan Jr., Andrew, and Lou Henry. Though making his home in California, Allan never forgot his West Branch roots. When he passed away in 1993, he was buried in West Branch Public Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>When Stephen Bishop, an enslaved African American man, arrived at Mammoth Cave in 1838, the cave was a fledgling attraction for tourists, academics, and the curious. When the property was purchased by Franklin Gorin, Bishop was placed at the cave as a guide. But in addition to his duties guiding visitors along the known tourist routes, Bishop also joined in the exploration of new passageways within the cave. <br /> <br /> Bishop started guiding as a teenager, and absorbed information and stories from those whom he would guide inside the cave. Gorin would later recount that Bishop was: </p> <blockquote> <p>“a self-educated man ... He had a fine genius, a great fund of wit and humor, some little knowledge of Latin and Greek, and much knowledge of geology, but his great talent was his knowledge of man…His talents were of the first order. He was trustworthy and reliable; he was companionable; he was a hero and he could be a clown. He knew a gentleman or a lady as if by instinct. He learned whatever he wished to learn without trouble or labor, and professors of geology spoke highly of his knowledge in that department of science.” </p> </blockquote> <p>When the cave property was purchased by Dr. John Croghan in 1839, Bishop was among the guides that were retained to continue tour operations.  <br /> <br /> In the years that followed, Bishop was present for many new discoveries that were made at Mammoth Cave. After he and a visitor successfully crossed an obstacle called the Bottomless Pit, many miles of the cave’s labyrinth became open to further exploration. Popular cave areas such as the Mammoth Dome and the Ruins of Karnak are credited as having been discovered by Bishop. <br /> <br /> In 1842, during a visit to the Croghan estate, Locust Grove, in Louisville, Kentucky, Bishop drew a map from memory of the explored passageways of the cave. The map, which was credited to him, was published in the book <u>Rambles in the Mammoth Cave During the Year 1844, by a Visitor.</u>   <br /> <br /> Bishop’s knowledge and power of memory was recognized by one visitor who stated,  </p> <blockquote> <p>“His vocation has brought him into contact with many intellectual and scientific men and as he has great quickness of perception and a prodigious memory, he has profited much by intercourse with superior minds. He can recollect everybody that ever visited the cave, and all the terms of geology and mineralogy are at his tongue's end.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Bishop was a popular guide and was often requested by tourists who had made the long trek to Mammoth Cave from all over the country. One visitor noted of his notoriety by stating,</p> <p> </p> <blockquote> <p>“Stephen, who has a share in all the principal explorations and discoveries, is almost as widely known as the Cave itself.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Bishop and his wife Charlotte had one son, Thomas, who was born in 1843. He eventually gained his freedom and began working at Mammoth Cave as a paid guide, and in 1856, the Bishop family moved to a 75-acre tract of land near the cave property. By the end of the summer of 1857, though, Stephen Bishop had died from unknown causes.   </p> <p><br /> Bishop was buried in an unmarked grave in a small cemetery that Dr. Croghan had established for some of his deceased consumptive patients. Decades later, James R. Mellon, a visitor from Pittsburgh, provided Bishop with a gravestone that can still be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-guide-s-cemetery.htm\">The Old Guide’s Cemetery</a>—named in honor of many influential and adventurous cave guides who lived at Mammoth Cave. Visitors can reach the cemetery just off of the Heritage Trail near the park’s visitor center. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bishop’s legacy continues at Mammoth Cave through the places that he helped discover, the early adventures in which he was a part, and in his role of helping to expand the knowledge and the reputation of Mammoth Cave. The stories of his life and discoveries are shared with hundreds of thousands of visitors who retrace Bishops footsteps each year inside Mammoth Cave. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Flora Langerman Spiegelberg was a Jewish writer, activist, and educator who travelled the Santa Fe Trail to move to Santa Fe, NM, with her husband. Flora was born in New York City in 1857. After her father died in 1866, Flora moved to Nuremburg, Germany, to finish school. It was there she met her husband Willi Spiegelberg, a successful Santa Fe merchant, who was visiting his homeland. <br /> <br /> Willi was the youngest of five brothers who partnered in business related to the Santa Fe trade. Jacob Solomon, Willi’s oldest brother, established a general merchandise firm called <a href=\"http://www.jmaw.org/spiegelberg-new-mexico/\">Spiegelberg Brothers</a> in 1846. Eventually, all the brothers immigrated to New Mexico to join the business, with Willi arriving in 1861. Their business was highly successful. They operated a storefront on the Santa Fe Plaza, invested in mining, insurance, and construction, and founded the Second National Bank of Santa Fe. <br /> <br /> As newlyweds, Flora and Willie travelled from Germany to Santa Fe in 1875, with the final leg of the journey following the Santa Fe Trail. At the time, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/map-timeline-4.htm\">railroad had replaced the eastern half of the trail</a>, with a terminus in Los Animas, Colorado. They traveled on the trail by coach the remainder of the way. <br /> <br /> Flora and Willie were welcomed in Santa Fe to great fanfare. She wrote of the day they arrived:  “To our great surprise, my husband’s brother Lehman, joined by friends in buggies or horseback and even on burros, had come out to welcome us with a band of Mexican musicians on top of an old stage coach and amid cheers for ‘Don Julian El Bonito and his pretty Tenderfoot Bride’” (Spiegelberg, p. 3). <br /> <br /> Flora became an important socialite as a member of one of the wealthiest families in Santa Fe. She was active in the community and helped her family host prominent community members and visiting dignitaries. The Spiegelberg family hosted President and Mrs. Hayes, Ulysses Grant, Phillip S. Sheridan, and William Tecumseh Sherman.   <br /> <br /> As a member of the small Jewish community in New Mexico, Flora was accepting of people with different religions and backgrounds. Through shared experiences of discrimination, the Spiegelbergs connected with locals who encountered prejudice from Americans. According to Flora, locals expressed a fondness for the Spiegelbergs, noting that, “Los hermanos Jacobus estan la misma gente que nuestro Rentor Jesus Cristos,” (We honor the five Spiegelberg brothers because they are of the same people as our Savior Jesus Christ). <br /> <br /> The Spiegelbergs also connected with the Catholic population in Santa Fe. Flora developed a close friendship with <a href=\"https://newmexicohistory.org/2013/10/28/jean-baptiste-lamy/\">Bishop Jean Baptiste Lamy</a> who made a point to commemorate Jewish holidays by sending gifts to the family. The Spiegelbergs contributed funds for the construction of St. Francis Cathedral. <br /> <br /> Noting the lack of a public school in Santa Fe, Flora organized the first school available to children outside of the Catholic faith. The one-room schoolhouse and its one teacher served Protestant and Jewish children alike. In 1880 after the railroad reached Santa Fe, she helped organize donations to build a larger schoolhouse at the old Fort Marcy grounds. She also helped create the area’s first Children’s Garden where she taught kids how to plant, grow, and tend to plants. <br /> <br /> Flora’s two daughters, Betty and Rose, were born in Santa Fe. In 1889 the family moved to New York City to provide a stronger Jewish community for the girls. Flora maintained a strong community presence in New York as an activist, educator, organizer, and author. <br /> <br /> Flora’s desire to create a better world for working people lead her to campaign for improved sanitation practices in New York City. Garnering her the nickname, “Garbage Can Flora,” she fought for and won rights for sanitation workers. In 1919, her “Ten Commandments for World Peace,” which demanded public input on US decisions to enter war, was published. Flora also helped establish committees and clubs for Jewish women. <br /> <br /> Flora passed away in 1943 in New York City after a rich life of bringing people together, advocating for change, and standing up for marginalized people. </p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Learn more about the Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3> <h4><br /> Sources </h4> <p>Cook, M.J.

He immediately joined his parents in their globetrotting lifestyle, embarking on a voyage to Australia when he was just five weeks old.</p> <h2>Technical Mind</h2> <p>Young Herbert Jr. took a keen interest in amateur radio. A severe attack of influenza in 1918 left Herbert Jr. with impaired hearing, but the scientifically inclined teenager made himself a hearing aid.</p> <p>Guided by these interests in electronics, Herbert Jr. studied engineering at his parents’ alma mater, Stanford University. After graduating in 1925, he went on to Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. His graduate thesis and Guggenheim Fellowship work was on the economic aspects of the new aviation industry. Following his studies, he took a job as a radio technician with Western Air Express, one of the early airlines. He also founded Aeronautical Radio, Inc., which operated ground stations for airlines.</p> <h2>Businessman & Statesman</h2> <p>During President Hoover’s administration, controversy surrounded Western Air Express, which had government contracts. Herbert Jr. resigned and started United Geophysical, a company that used seismography to search for oil. The company boomed throughout the 1930s despite the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover Jr. became one of the internationally best-known men in the oil industry.</p> <p>President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Herbert Jr. as Under Secretary of State in 1954. He remained involved with developing the memorial park around President Hoover’s birthplace in West Branch, Iowa, known today as Herbert Hoover National Historic Site.</p> <p>Herbert Jr. married Margaret Eva Watson in 1925. They had three children together, Margaret Ann “Peggy” Hoover (b. 1926), Herbert “Pete” Hoover III (b. 1927) and Joan Ledlie Hoover (b. 1930). Herbert Jr. died on July 9, 1969 after suffering from a stroke a few days earlier.</p>",

Commonly called “Bird” or “Yardbird” by his fellow musicians, Charlie Parker real name was Charles Parker Jr.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{c3553a94-5bc5-4fa0-bc1c-bd3c2c5978c5}{192}\" paraid=\"251762012\">He was born in Kansas City, Kansas in 1920 and raised on the other side of the river in Kansas City, Missouri. At a young age, he was musically influenced by the jazz music clubs in Kansas City and his father did some work as a pianist, dancer, and signer in the area. The 14-year-old Parker joined the high school band as a saxophone player and admittedly spent more time player the saxophone than studying other subjects, so he dropped out of high school to pursue a career as a saxophonist in 1935. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c3553a94-5bc5-4fa0-bc1c-bd3c2c5978c5}{200}\" paraid=\"1199920211\">He got a chance to play with one of his favorite bands, Count Basie’s Orchestra in 1936 during a jam session but he was kicked off the stage by one of the band members for failing to improvise with the band during the session. For many musicians, they would have quit immediately, but Parker used it as inspiration to practice and was later asked to join a local traveling band.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c3553a94-5bc5-4fa0-bc1c-bd3c2c5978c5}{204}\" paraid=\"1731878805\">Parker, like many jazz musicians, played with numerous bands and eventually travelled to New York in 1939 when he made his breakthrough with the development of a new sound that would become known as bebop. He continued to travel around and work with other jazz greats, such as Dizzy Gillespie and Mills Davis, who helped develop and promote his sound.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{c3553a94-5bc5-4fa0-bc1c-bd3c2c5978c5}{208}\" paraid=\"179996906\">Unfortunately, Charlie Parker’s music career was short-lived due to his addiction to drugs and alcohol when he died in 1955 at the age of 34.   Charlie Parker has been recognized by numerous musician institutes, such as the Grammys, for his influence on jazz and other art forms. There are still music festivals in New York and Kansas City dedicated to Charlie Parker every year. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr. Clyde Wahrhaftig was an American geologist, professor, environmentalist, and LGBTQ+ leader. He worked with many national parks to improve their understanding around the geological features enjoyed by millions of people every year. Dr. Wahrhaftig studied the fascinating geology of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/index.htm\">Golden Gate National Recreation Area</a>. He also worked in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm\">Yosemite National Park</a>, where he studied glacial geology for many years. Though closeted through his career, Dr. Wahrhaftig came out publicly in 1989. Dr. Wahrhaftig pushed for LGBTQ+ representation and inclusion in science. He also worked to create opportunities for people of color in the field of geology. He helped change the way we understand geology and the science community as a whole. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Clyde Wahrhaftig was born in Fresno, California on December 1, 1919. He became familiar with Berkeley when his mother took classes at the University of California. He ended up teaching field work in the very hills where he played as a child. He taught at the University of California, Berkeley for 22 years, from 1960 to 1982, after getting his Ph.D. in geology at Harvard in 1953. He said of his teaching, <em>“If I am a good teacher, it is only in a field situation. As all my students will attest, I am a lousy lecturer, and had to hand out lecture notes to be sure the students understood me.”</em> <sup>(1)</sup> One of his students, famous Bay Area Geologist Doris Sloan, said of his teaching:</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>“... he was one of the best field geologists, I think, in the country, not only in terms of how he looked at the landscapes and the rocks but in how he encouraged his students to ask the right questions, explore the evidence in front of them, and do the science.”</em> <sup>(2)</sup></strong></p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">While teaching was an important part of his life, his career focus was with the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/\">U.S. Geological Survey</a> (USGS). He worked with USGS from 1941 until his death in 1994. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Wahrhaftig conducted fieldwork in Alaska, Yosemite, and the California Coast. He spent much of his career working alongside his partner Dr. Allan Cox. His <a href=\"https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp482\">USGS work</a> took him to Alaska, where he first met Allan while doing field research. Their research on rock glaciers and the resulting publication titled Rock Glaciers in the Alaskan Range <sup>(3)</sup> increased exploration into the subject. Their research in Alaska also led to improved understanding of the state’s coal reserves and prevented landslides from impacting the Alaskan Railroad.<sup>(4)</sup> In Yosemite, Clyde Wahrhaftig spent almost 50 years <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/tiogaglaciers.htm\">mapping and interpreting the area’s past ice ages</a>. He worked to map the extent of Yosemite’s most recent glaciation. Clyde Wahrhaftig knew he would never finish this map, so he left money in his will for others to continue the work. Yosemite’s first park geologist continued his research in 2006 and finished the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3414/sim3414_pamphlet.pdf\">project</a> in 2019.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68ed4465-7fff-ac8c-9b1e-4b72af87574f\"><img height=\"567\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X9ejpF8H-AFTd_rgXR7Y7GfO7nNoLA-lfFJ1VFedl_nJMMPHGyR5uzvzw4sQ2yyi3lK7H-q1W8wNI7GtFo4TsRl2_2wtVSiX_ilC1Ape-k5s-D0dW2XmV_IVhrECxVdIsA\" width=\"450\" /></b><br /> <sub><em>Image Description: Dr. Wahrhaftig hand colored a USGS topographic quadrangle map to show the geography of the Mono Craters and glacial deposits just outside Yosemite National Park, Calif. Image Credit: USGS</em></sub></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GOGA), Clyde studied the complex geology of the Marin Headlands and wrote a summary of the geology of the park for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">National Park Service</a>. He studied theories and the effects that geology has had on the landscape. He compiled a historical assessment of past geological theories of the area. Dr. Wahrhaftig wanted to better understand the ideas of geologists of the past. He wanted to help us to learn from their previous successes and missteps. Clyde Wahrhaftig used his knowledge of geology to create change and influence current environmental challenges. He was an active member of the Marin County Recreation Department. He worked with Marin County and the National Park Service to make <a href=\"https://www.parksconservancy.org/parks/bolinas-lagoon\">Bolinas Lagoon</a> a bird sanctuary and served on study committees for GOGA and the <a href=\"https://ridgetrail.org/\">Bay Area Ridge Trail</a>. In 1971 he was named the chairman of the new Environment and Public Policy Committee of the <a href=\"https://www.geosociety.org/\">Geological Society of America</a> (GSA).  </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Clyde Wahrhaftig used his knowledge to influence California conservation and legislation also. His work in forestry began after conducting research with Allan Cox. To help protect a forest near Dr. Cox’s home, they began researching the effects logging redwoods had on local water supplies. The pair took their findings to the state legislator and Dr. Wahrhaftig said: “The ultimate outcomes … were first, a law permitting a few urban counties to enact stronger timber harvest rules than the state’s; and second a State Supreme Court decision that the then-existing State Forest Practice Act was unconstitutional, because it in effect asked the foxes to look after the chicken coop. A new state law had to be enacted.” <sup>(5)</sup> This realization inspired them to expand the scope of their research. <em>“We spent that Christmas vacation in Humboldt County, lurking through cutover company lands alongside the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/index.htm\">Redwood National and State Parks</a>, comparing erosional phenomena in cutover, and untouched forest, where all other factors were the same, and I presented our testimony at a hearing a month or two later.” </em>Clyde Wahrhaftig later wrote an in-depth study on the subject called <a href=\"https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/tmdl/records/region_1/2003/ref903.pdf\">Statement on Erosion Problems in Redwood Creek</a>. This was an unprecedented angle, as it brought together applicable research and utilized geological perspective. After presenting their testimony, Dr.Wahrhaftig said, <em>“We turned out to have some influence on the resulting legislation…” </em>After this success the Resource Secretary of California at the time, Claire Dedrick, asked Clyde Wahrhaftig to serve on the California Board of Forestry in 1975. He continued to push for sustainable forestry practices. His work on the forestry board utilized an approach to forest management that had impacts far beyond the California border. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Much of his work was shaped by Allan Cox, Dr. Wahrhaftig said years later, <em>“Nearly everything I did professionally after we met was strongly influenced by him… Most of the assignments I accepted - teaching at Berkeley ... The Forestry Board, for example - I did chiefly to keep his good regard.” </em>The inspiration for one of his most influential projects came from a conversation the pair had at breakfast. Dr. Cox was planning a “fun run” for the American Geophysical Union. Dr. Wahrhaftig says of the day:</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>“I told him that that wasn't a very intellectual way for geophysicists to get exercise... I offered instead, for their exercise, to write a walking guide to the outcrops in San Francisco that exemplified Plate Tectonics, that we could call “A Streetcar to Subduction” and he immediately exclaimed “Sold”. So the next six months I spent all my spare time walking around San Francisco, photographing, sketching, and writing about pillow basalt, chert, greywacke, and serpentine.” </em><sup>(6)</sup></strong></p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">A Streetcar to Subduction became his most popular book. It made geological perspectives accessible to the reader, no matter their previous knowledge or experience. The book is still sold in park service bookstores and has been updated as a <a href=\"https://www.agu.org/streetcar2subduction\">digital guide</a>. A guide for seeing the geology of the Bay Area, the routes are designed with public transportation directions only.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">A fierce environmentalist, Dr. Wahrhaftig, followed the early evidence of the warming effects of carbon emissions discovered in the 1960s. When he went to Alaska, he would travel by boat. In Yosemite, he travelled by pack train or walked. In the Bay, he relied only on public transportation: bus, ferry, or train. He did this because he understood the environmental consequences of cars and airplanes, and how their energy and gas emissions would contribute to significant atmospheric change in the future.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68ed4465-7fff-ac8c-9b1e-4b72af87574f\"><img height=\"489\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H1Zeu-YGgeRx9-TiikuYgDu8BjPS-P8YdxfAJQpFiotUhrxxhjmjseMWh5XHIltDeTaqTNqeiLAixIiHbfiUZ0wayawmw8WszotQctjcfqfagQKIlB2-p9jQ8_Om-FLUtA\" width=\"624\" /></b></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><sub><em>Image Description: A young Clyde Wahrhaftig (center front) and friends sit on rocks outdoors. Image Credit: SLAC, courtesy AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives</em></sub></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Clyde Wahrhaftig was also passionate about making geological thinking accessible to everyone and the inclusion of underrepresented  communities in geoscience. He worked with education programs in Hunter’s Point, to lead Black and Chicano students on geological field trips around the Bay Area and Sierra Nevada Mountains. He of course always used public transportation for the trips. In 1971, Wahrhaftig became the first chair of the Minority Participation in the Earth Sciences committee with the GSA. Other committee members included <strong>Randolph Bromery</strong>, the first African American President of the GSA, and <strong>Mack Gipson</strong>, the first African American man to obtain a Ph.D. in Geology. Dr. Wahrhaftig said of his experience, <em>“I think I accomplished the most on the Minority Participation committee… We got the Minority Scholarship program going in AGI (American Geosciences Institute), and we were the inspiration for the USGS Minority Summer Internship program, with which I was connected for several years.”</em> <sup>(7)</sup> In 1972 this committee organized the First National Conference on Minority Participation in Earth Science and Mineral Engineering. The conference organized federal agencies, civil rights leaders, people from academia and from industry to talk about the lack of diversity in geoscience. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The Geological Society of America awarded Dr. Wahrhaftig with the Distinguished Career Award in 1989. Much of Clyde Wahrhaftig's speech was centered around his partner, who had passed away just two years earlier. The pair had never been public about the nature of their relationship. Wahrhaftig ended his speech by saying, </p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>“Receiving this award for longevity has made me realize that my time to do good is running out. So I have decided to use the opportunity you have given me, by gracing my career with the adjective “distinguished”, to do a little good with the accolade. The Committee on Minority Participation in the Earth Sciences recognizes that one of our goals was to create role models, successful Black or Chicano geoscientists who would attract others to follow their paths. I am now going to provide a role model for a minority that has been demanding a modicum of the civil rights the rest of the country possess - a minority that has managed to survive largely because it is invisible. It is a minority to which Allan Cox and I belong. We are both homosexuals, and the force that caused us to do so much for each other, and because of each other, was homosexual love… Allan was the only one of all my field assistants or students who ever had any indication from me that I am homosexual. Now when I say a role model, I don’t mean that I am trying to convince young geologists to become homosexual. That is impossible, for one is either born with one’s sexual orientation or acquires it in infancy. It is nothing one has any choice over whatsoever. And I would not wish on anyone the life of repression, self-doubt, and dissimulation that Allan and I had to go through… The group whose attitudes I wish to affect are those of you who are not homosexual, but who may find yourselves with students, subordinantes or colleagues who are. I ask you to recognize that homosexuals can make as much of a contribution to science and humanity as anyone else. In the last 20 years the homosexual (or gay) community has moved out of the shadows, and there are gay student organizations on almost every campus. So it is likely that some gay students who enter geoscience will not be closeted as Allan and I were. You will have to deal with them as they are. The other group whose attitudes I wish to affect are gay students who would like to become geoscientists, but are afraid to because they think being gay and being a geologist are incompatible. I want my life, and Allan’s and my relationship, to tell them that this is not so. If they are lucky, as we were, their love and their careers will sustain each other. And I hope that by making this revelation here, I contribute in some small way to the creation of a society with a sufficiently intelligent, open and compassionate attitude toward sexuality.” <sup>(8)</sup></strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">After an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/historyculture/upload/35329fa-Clyde-Wahrhaftig-Collection.pdf\">incredible career</a> Dr. Wahrhaftig passed away of heart failure on April 6, 1994 at the age of 74.

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridget Biddy Mason (1818-1891) is an American Hero. Born enslaved, Mason became one of the first prominent citizens and landowners in Los Angeles in the 1850s and 1860s. She also founded the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles in 1872.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Mason was born in Mississippi in 1818. She was given the name Bridget without a surname, and was later nicknamed Biddy. She was owned by slaveholders in Georgia and South Carolina before being returned to Mississippi. Robert Marion Smith, her last owner, was a Mississippi Mormon convert. He decided to follow the call of the church and moved his family and enslaved persons to the West.  There he would help establish a Mormon community in what would become Salt Lake City, Utah. At this time Utah was still a part of Mexico.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1848, Mason, then 30, walked 1,700 miles behind a 300-wagon caravan. The caravan eventually arrived in the Holladay-Cottonwood area of the Salt Lake Valley. Along the route, Mason was responsible for setting up and breaking camp; cooking the meals; herding cattle; and serving as a midwife. She also took care of her three young daughters, aged 10, 4, and a newborn.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1851, Smith moved his family once again. This time a 150-wagon caravan headed for San Bernardino, California. Ignoring Brigham Young’s warning that slavery was illegal in California, Smith brought Mason and other enslaved people to the new Mormon community. Along the way, Mason met Charles H. and Elizabeth Flake Rowan, a free black couple. The Rowan’s, and others, urged her to legally contest her slave status once she reached California.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Fearing that he would lose his enslaved persons, Smith decided to move to Texas, a slave state. They were prevented from leaving by the Owens family. One of Robert Owens’ sons was romantically involved with Mason’s 17 year old daughter. Owens told the L.A. County Sheriff that slaves were being illegally held. The sheriff gathered a posse and apprehended Smith’s wagon train in Cajon Pass, California.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">After spending five years enslaved in California, Mason challenged Smith for her freedom. On January 21, 1856, L.A. District Judge Benjamin Hayes approved Mason’s petition. The ruling freed Mason and thirteen members of her extended family. She took the surname Mason from the middle name of Amason Lyman, who was the mayor of San Bernardino and a Mormon Apostle. Mason moved her family to L.A. where her daughter married had the son of Robert and Minnie Owens. She continued working as a midwife and nurse, saving her money and using it to purchase land in what is now the heart of downtown L.A. There she organized First A.M.E. Church, the oldest African American Church in the city. Mason used her wealth, estimated to be about $3 million, to become a philanthropist to the entire L.A. community. She donated to numerous charities, fed and sheltered the poor, and visited prisoners. Mason was instrumental in founding a traveler’s aid center and an elementary school for black children.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Bridget “Biddy” Mason died in L.A. on January 15, 1891. She was buried in an unmarked grave in Evergreen Cemetery. On March 27, 1988, the mayor of L.A. and members of the church she founded held a ceremony, during which her grave was marked with a tombstone.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Bridget “Biddy” Mason is associated with the Historic Resources Associated with African Americans in Los Angeles Multi-Property Submission (MPS). It was approved and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 2009.</p>",

He served with the 125th Colored Infantry. Following the end of the Civil War, his regiment was sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. During his service he also traveled to New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado.<br /> <br /> After his military service was completed, Anderson travelled to Iowa. He spent time in Tabor, Iowa, working in a local brickyard and then local farmer.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In 1870 he moved to eastern Nebraska, staking a homestead claim in Butler County for 80 acres. Years of drought, low farm prices, and grasshopper plagues forced him to lose his claim in 1881. He spent the next three years as a farmhand in Kansas.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> He headed for western Nebraska in 1884. By 1886 he took up a claim under the provisions of the Timber Culture Act. Anderson had some financial disasters, but was able to add to his holdings. The result was a prosperous ranch in Nebraska on 2,080 acres by 1918. Most of Anderson's land was pasture raising cattle and horses. He had as many as 50 head of horses at a time.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Anderson escaped the racial prejudice of the South, but found he still lived in a society influenced by racist ideas. The county's black population in 1910 was 55, under 1 percent of the population. Many were laborers who had come to the Alliance area as Burlington workers.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Robert Anderson lived near Hemingford, an exclusively white town. The white community around his homestead generally accepted Anderson. He had a good military record and was a successful rancher and farmer. As one man stated, “If there was ever a gentleman — if I've ever known one — it was Robert Anderson.”<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In 1922 in Forrest City, Arkansas, at his brother's home, Anderson met Daisy Graham. He married Daisy on March 19, 1922. She was 21, he 79. Later she said, \"He loved me, but 1 didn't when 1 married him.\" Anderson and his ranch offered a form of security for her she had not found in the South. His wife and her family came to Nebraska with him.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Anderson, his wife, her brother and a friend were in a car accident. Near Union, a small town 40 miles east of Lincoln, the car left the road and overturned in loose gravel. They were returning from a visit with his brother at Forrest City, Arkansas. Daisy was bruised and Ernest Graham, who was driving, escaped unhurt. Robert Anderson died en route to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Lincoln.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/radio-diaries/civil-war-widows\">Interview with Daisy Anderson</a> (widow of Robert Anderson) originally aired on All Things Considered, July 1, 1998.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full-text/NH1983Robt_B_Anderson.pdf\">Robert Ball Anderson Archival Collection at History Nebraska</a><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Born in Beaufort, South Carolina, on October 26, 1830, Stephen Elliott, Jr. was the eldest son of Rev. Stephen Elliott and Ann Hutson Habersham. He was educated at South Carolina College graduating in 1850. He became a planter and a successful fisherman, served in the South Carolina legislature, and was a captain in the Beaufort Volunteer Artillery militia. He married Charlotte Stuart in 1854 and fathered three children.<br />  <br /> He began his service in the Confederate Army at the beginning of the Civil War in 1861 rising from captain to brigadier general. He initially saw action in the Charleston and Port Royal areas. Called to Charleston by General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/pgt-beauregard.htm\">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, then Major Elliott was offered command of Fort Sumter to replace Colonel <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fosu/learn/historyculture/alfred-m-rhett.htm\">Alfred Rhett</a>, who was moved to command the inner fortifications of Charleston. Elliott accepted and assumed command on the night of September 4, 1863.<br />  <br /> At that point, Fort Sumter had been under bombardment by Union heavy Parrott rifles since August 17 firing from Morris Island. Following heavy fighting on the island since July 10, Confederate forces evacuated the island on the night of September 6. Union Rear Admiral <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-a-dahlgren.htm\">John A. Dahlgren</a>, commander of the blockade squadron, wasted no time. The next morning, he sent a message to Fort Sumter demanding its surrender. Elliott, having been in command of the fort only two days, checked with his superior, General Beauregard, and then replied, “Inform Admiral Dahlgren that he may have Fort Sumter when he can take it and hold it.” Upon receiving this reply, Dahlgren immediately ordered an amphibious assault on the fort to take place on the night of September 8.<br /> <br /> At Fort Sumter, Elliott was quite aware of the impending attack, in part by intercepted signals between Union vessels decoded with a signal code book captured by the Confederates back in April unbeknownst to the US Navy. Thus, preparations to meet the attack were thorough and extensive. Inside the fort, Elliott and the Confederates manning the parapet and loopholes watched the Union boats approach holding their fire until the first boats began to land.  A Confederate sentry hailed them loudly but received no reply. A few seconds later, a red signal rocket was fired by Elliott from Sumter, and all hell broke loose.<br /> <br /> As the first few boats landed amidst the debris at the base of the walls, they were met with volleys of rifle fire, hand grenades, and bricks tossed from the debris. At the same time, exploding shells rained down from the Confederate shore batteries. Those who managed to disembark from their boats briefly tried to return fire but soon sought shelter among the debris at the base of the walls. Following boats were unable to land due to the heavy fire and soon turned away, leaving sailors and Marines stranded with no choice but to surrender. The fight was over in 20 minutes. The Union sailors and Marines suffered 127 casualties, the Confederates none. <br /> <br /> Transferred to Petersburg, Virginia, Elliott took over command of fellow South Carolinian, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathan-g-evans.htm\">Nathan G. Evans</a>' former brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia. In his brigade's defense of the Confederate defenses around Petersburg, his men suffered heavy casualties in the fight after a Union mine blew up a portion of the Confederate line. The explosion stirred Elliott from sleep in a bombproof to find chaos around him. He was severely wounded in the Battle of the Crater and after recovering, he saw action at Averasboro and Bentonville, in which he was again badly wounded. His brigade surrendered at Bennett Place when General Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee surrendered to General William Tecumseh Sherman's in April 1865. Elliott had been sent home to convalesce following his wounding at Bentonville. <br /> <br /> After the war, Elliott's plantation had been seized for non-payment of taxes, and the land was distributed amongst the freedmen. In November 1865, he received a full pardon from President Andew Johnson. He succumbed to his war wounds on February 21, 1866. He was only thirty five years old. He is buried at St Helena’s Episcopal Churchyard in Beaufort, South Carolina.</p>",

These journal entries indicate that he experienced freedoms that few enslaved people had, though these freedoms would be revoked upon his return to the Clark plantation.<br /> The journals indicate that York was allowed to hunt, which was notable because African Americans weren’t generally allowed to handle guns. He became the primary caregiver to Charles Floyd, who died during the Expedition from what is believed to have been appendicitis. He risked his life to save Clark, Sacagawea, and her son when they were caught in a flash flood. York is also credited with being the first African American to have a vote equal to that of a white man. In November 1805 the Corps held a vote to decide where to camp for the winter, and both York and </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sacagawea.htm\">Sacagawea</a><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\"> cast votes on that location.<br /> When the Corps of Discovery returned from the Expedition, each member - except York - received double pay and 320 acres of land. York, on the other hand, returned to slavery.

With his freedom, Clark gave York a wagon and team of horses, with which York created a hauling business. By 1832, however, Clark told author Washington Irving that York’s business failed, and that he had contracted cholera and died in Tennessee.

At community meetings about this issue, Clark frequently served as an officer.<sup>7</sup> In the summer of 1849, he submitted a petition to the city's School Committee in support of closing the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/abiel-smith-school.htm\">Abiel Smith School</a>, the segregated school for Black children.<sup>8</sup> Clark, along with the 275 other signers, believed maintaining the school provided unequal education for Black children.</p> <p>As a fervent abolitionist, Clark helped freedom seekers who had fled to Boston.

            "bodyText": "<p>Jordan B. Noble began his life as in slavery, but he died as a revered war hero. Noble was born on a Georgia plantation to African and European parents.  On June 2, 1814, Jordan and his mother, Judith, were sold to Lieutenant John Noble of the 7th Regiment. Jordan joined the forces at the Chalmette Battlefield with Lieutenant Noble as a drummer, coming under the command of Major General Andrew Jackson. Noble was one of nearly 900 enslaved people and free men of color volunteers that added to Jackson’s defenses leading into the British invasion.</p> <p>As the British made landfall on the evening of December 23, 1814, Noble’s ability to keep a steady beat to guide the soldiers was tested as he followed Jackson’s troops to surprise a British vanguard, delaying the enemy’s assault south of the city. His shining moment, however, came on the morning of January 8, 1815, when the British marched to invade New Orleans.</p> <p>Jackson’s army had been camped out a defensive rampart they built near New Orleans, on the sugarcane plantation of Ignacio de Lino de Chalmette. As the British attacked on the morning of January 8, “the rattle of [Noble’s] drum was heard [even] amidst the bin of battle,” “in the hottest hell of fire.” The diverse American army was successful in repelling the British, securing their evacuation from the Gulf Coast, with the end of the war following swiftly.</p> <p>Noble eventually achieved freedom and he maintained his military connections after the War of 1812, participating in the 1836 Seminole War in Florida, in the Mexican War, and with Confederate and Union forces during the Civil War. After his fighting days had passed, Noble held tightly onto his position within the New Orleans free black community and onto his military legacy as the drummer boy of the Battle of New Orleans.</p> <p>“Old Jordan” became a fixture in New Orleans, especially in nostalgic commemorations of the “Glorious Eighth.” In an 1880 certificate from the Grand Army of the Republic, Joseph A. Mower proclaimed Noble to be a “worthy, upright and honest man who has done good service.\" </p>",

She was also the first Black American woman to write and publish a political manifesto. Her calls for Black people to resist slavery, oppression, and exploitation were radical. Stewart’s thinking and speaking style influenced <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sojourner-truth.htm\">Sojourner Truth</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/frances-ellen-watkins-harper-house.htm\">Frances Ellen Watkins Harper</a>.</p> <p>Born free in Hartford, Connecticut in 1803, Maria Miller was orphaned by the age of five. She was “bound out” as an indentured servant to a minister until around the age of fifteen. At some point she moved to Boston and supported herself as a domestic servant. She sought as much education as she could get, mostly through Sunday school classes in reading and religion. In 1826, she married James W. Stewart, a shipping agent and veteran of the War of 1812.</p> <p>The Stewarts became members of the small but vibrant free Black community in Boston’s Beacon Hill area. They attended Boston’s African Baptist Church, located in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/african-meeting-house.htm\">African Meeting House</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/news/walker.htm\">David Walker</a>, a radical abolitionist whose pamphlet <em>David Walker’s Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World</em> called for Black people to fight against enslavement and oppression, knew the couple and influenced Maria Stewart’s thinking. When Walker and his wife moved out of their former home at what is now <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/walkstew.htm\">81 Joy Street</a>, the Stewarts moved in. Just three years after their marriage, James Stewart died.</p> <p>Stewart’s deepening religious faith and the racism and segregation she experienced in Boston pressed her to speak her mind publicly. In 1831, she delivered a manuscript to the offices of White abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>’s new newspaper <em>The Liberator</em>. That summer, she published her essay,<em> Religion and the Pure Principles of Morality, the Sure Foundation on Which We Must Build</em>. The success of the piece led to a short but significant public speaking career for Stewart. She gave four recorded public lectures between 1831 and 1833.</p> <p>Stewart used Biblical language and imagery to condemn slavery and White racism. She argued that it was God’s will for Black people to struggle against oppression, using force if necessary. She exhorted Black audiences, especially women, to pursue education and to demand political rights, but not to forget who oppressed them. “Sue for your rights and privileges,” she wrote in 1831. “Know the reason that you cannot attain them.” She reminded white readers that “our souls are fired with the same love of liberty and independence with which your souls are fired…we are not afraid of them that kill the body and after that can do no more.”</p> <p>Stewart’s speech in September 1832 at Franklin Hall is one of the first recorded instances of an American woman—of any race—speaking in public. It was extremely rare for women to give public addresses in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, especially in front of a “promiscuous audience”—one that contained both men and women. Many people considered it improper and even immoral. By daring to do so, Stewart embodied the equality she called for in her speeches. She staked a claim for Black women as leaders of the resistance to oppression she believed God demanded of them.</p> <p>In 1834, Stewart left Boston and moved to New York, where she joined a Black “Female Literary Society” and began teaching. She spent her later years in Baltimore and then in Washington, D.C. In Washington, she was appointed Matron of the Freedmen’s Hospital.<sup>1</sup> In 1878, a new law made Stewart eligible to collect a pension from her husband’s military service in the War of 1812. She used the money to publish a new edition of her speeches and writings. Stewart died in the Freedmen’s Hospital in 1879.<sup>2</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Freedmen’s Hospital is now Howard University Hospital.

Nelson perceived the need for a center dedicated to preservation research technology early in his career. Back in 1962, at a preservation meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Nelson and a number of NPS architects, engineers, and exhibit specialists discussed their desire for a center of this type. Nelson understood and endorsed the need for technology to be used as a tool in a preservation context. He worked for many years to help establish a center for this purpose.<br /> <br /> Nelson received the National Park Service’s highest awards, the Meritorious Service Award and the Distinguished Service Award.

Her arrival coincided with the peak of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/learn/historyculture/california-gold-rush.htm\">gold fever</a> in California. Some wise investing increased her nest egg, and she used it to open laundries and boardinghouses (staffed by mostly Black individuals). She owned properties in San Francisco and neighboring Oakland; she eventually bought property in Canada, as well. </p> <p>Yet despite her considerable wealth, she worked as a housekeeper for some of San Francisco’s most prominent merchants. These jobs provided her with free investment advice gleaned from conversations between rich and powerful people. Although she was secretive about her exact financial details, she was a prolific investor in real estate and mining stock—two boom industries in mid-19<sup>th</sup> century San Francisco. In the 1890 census, she listed her profession as “capitalist.” </p> <p>Pleasant’s wealth allowed her to give generously to her community. She contributed to the Athenaeum Building, a library and meeting place for the city’s Black population; she also supported the Black press and the <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackpast.org%2Fafrican-american-history%2Fafrican-methodist-episcopal-zion-amez-church-1821%2F&data=04%7C01%7CEmily_Hoerner%40nps.gov%7C7e2e0a72105d4ae3b5e508d8c88cfb83%7C0693b5ba4b184d7b9341f32f400a5494%7C0%7C0%7C637479855124783948%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=12U8Zg%2B8va9Da5oS%2FDzacfVqt6j40qRtedrVEv91tIc%3D&reserved=0\">American Methodist Episcopal Zion Church</a>. She was not afraid to bring attention to injustice. After a streetcar driver refused to stop for her—even though there was room in the car and she already possessed tickets—she sued the streetcar company for denying service to Black citizens. The case went all the way to the California Supreme Court, which declared segregation on streetcars to be unconstitutional (the court did, however, reverse the $500 worth of damages that a lower court had awarded to Pleasant). One historian has asserted that Pleasant’s financial and political influence led to the repeal of a law that banned Black testimony in California courts. </p> <p>Pleasant was also an ardent abolitionist, but she left few records of this part of her life.

Once there, he went to the office of the Bureau of Land Management in Anchorage and inquired about homesteading lands. He eventually settled on an 50-acre claim on the Stony River in the southwestern part of the state.<br /> <br /> Like the lives of countless 19th century homesteaders, the life of a 20th century homesteader was difficult. No roads came anywhere near his homestead, so Deardorff had to charter a plane, take his boat, or walk if he wished to go anywhere. Mail often came only once a month or so, and even picking that up required a long journey to another village. To supplement his income while homesteading, Deardorff opened a small general store on his property that catered to those traveling the Stony River. He also hunted and trapped furs to help make his homestead successful.<br /> <br /> Ken Deardorff fulfilled all legal requirements of the Homestead Act in 1979. However, for reasons still unknown, it took nine years for him to receive the patent to the land he worked so hard for so long. Finally, in May 1988, the title arrived from the U.S. government. By then, the Homestead Act had been repealed for twelve years in the lower 48 states and two years in Alaska. Through meticulous research, it was determined in 2001 that Kenneth Deardorff was indeed the very last person to obtain the title to homesteaded property.<br /> <br /> Like his 19th and early 20th century predecessors, Deardorff worked long and hard to make his homestead a success. He is without question as much a pioneer as those that came before him.</p>",

            "bodyText": "During the 1830s, Osceola, a Seminole warrior, led members of his tribe in Florida in a valiant attempt to resist the US Army’s efforts to forcibly deport them to a reservation west of the Mississippi River. After being captured under a false flag of truce, Osceola died a prisoner of the US Army at Fort Moultrie in January 1838. He is buried outside of the fort’s sallyport.<br /> <br /> Osceola’s early life is largely unknown. Historians believe he was born in Alabama in 1804 to a Creek mother and a Scottish father. As a child, Osceola went by the name Billy Powell, but later he fully embraced the identity of his adopted tribe, the Seminoles of Florida. Osceola and his mother were one of many Creek families displaced after the Creek War of 1813-1814. They moved from Mississippi Territory to Spanish-held Florida, beginning his transition from Billy Powell to Osceola, Seminole warrior. The Seminoles also welcomed runaway enslaved people from the plantations of Georgia, South Carolina, and later Florida into their tribe, which drew the attention and hostility of American slaveholders and the US Army. <br /> <br /> He acquired the name Osceola in young adulthood. Osceola means black drink singer. During purification rites, a Seminole warrior drinks a black purgative liquid brewed from yaupon holly leaves. Unfortunately for Osceola, Florida proved to be a short-lived safe haven from American expansion and armed conflict. Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819 in the Adams-Onis Treaty, following the First Seminole War, in which General Andrew Jackson invaded Spanish Florida.<br /> <br /> By the Treaty of Moultrie Creek of 1823, the Seminoles agreed to give up their claims to land in Florida Territory in return for a reservation in central Florida, as well as certain payments and supplies to be provided by the US government. The land, however, was unsuitable for agriculture and located away from the coastline so that Seminoles could no longer trade with Cubans and others for arms, ammunition, etc.<br /> <br /> The Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed by President Andrew Jackson, posed the greatest threat to Osceola's desire for Seminole autonomy. Between 1832 and 1838, this federal legislation directed the deportation of the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. The 1832 Treaty of Payne’s Landing called for the Seminoles to move west of the Mississippi and settle on the Creek reservation. Seminoles, especially refugees from the Creek War and Black Seminoles, who feared re-enslavement, feared the move and resisted inclusion with the Creeks. Many Seminole chiefs refused to sign the treaty, leading to the outbreak of the Second Seminole War and Osceola’s fame.<br /> <br /> The Second Seminole War, fought from 1835-42, was the longest and most costly war between Native Americans and the United States. For every four Seminoles deported, the US Army killed one Seminole, lost three US Army soldiers, and spent $32,000. In today's dollars, for every Seminole person shipped west, the government spent the equivalent of $8.5 million. <br /> <br /> Osceola quickly proved to be a talented tactician and capable leader. He defeated General Duncan Clinch at the Battle of Withlacoochee in December 1835. He directed a successful ambush, taking advantage of the army’s river crossing. Osceola managed to lead his followers, including noncombatants, from safe haven to ambush site to safe haven, while eluding multiple armies. The army was unable to defeat Osceola in the field, so General Thomas Jesup used other means to capture him.<br /> <br /> In October 1837, while negotiating under a white flag of truce near St. Augustine, Florida, Osceola was taken prisoner. While Osceola’s capture relieved many anxious white Floridians, there was also public outcry at the dishonorable ploy employed by Jesup. Osceola was imprisoned at Fort Marion under the guardianship of Captain Pitcairn Morrison of the 4th US Infantry. In December 1837, about twenty Seminole warriors escaped from their cell in Fort Marion. Osceola, suffering from failing health, was too weak to scale the walls of the cell and escape with his fellow warriors. As a result of the escape, Osceola and 237 of his people were transferred to Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, far from their homes in Florida.<br /> <br /> Osceola, suffering from poor health, spent his final month at Fort Moultrie as a prisoner of the US Army. George Catlin, the famous artist who focused on Native American culture, visited and painted Osceola in his full Seminole attire: ostrich plumes, turban, war dress, and gorget. Osceola, surrounded by his two wives and children, died the evening of January 30, 1838. Known for his resistance to the United States and its military, Osceola’s final resting place outside of the sallyport of Fort Moultrie is surrounded by visual reminders of the army and is a place to reflect on his legacy.<br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> Porter, Kenneth. <em>The Black Seminoles: History of a Freedom-Seeking People</em>.

Born during a time of increasingly strained relationships between Native Americans and white settlers, Mistanta is credited with nourishing peace on the Colorado plains.<br /> <br /> Mistanta was born around 1810. She was the eldest daughter of a powerful Cheyenne tribal leader known as the “Keeper of the Arrows.” This gave her special status within the tribe. Her social status made her an attractive prospective bride for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-bent.htm\">William Bent</a>, a Santa Fe Trail trader and the founder of Bent’s Fort.<br /> <br /> William Bent had developed a strong relationship with the Cheyenne throughout his early years. It was the Cheyenne who advised him to build a fort along the Arkansas River and the Santa Fe Trail in what is now southeastern Colorado. Bent’s Fort was completed in 1833. Soon after, Bent sought to strengthen his relationship with the Cheyenne (and Arapaho) through marriage. From the perspective of Mistanta’s father, Bent’s position as the owner of the largest trading post on the Colorado plains likely made him an attractive match for Mistanta as well.<br /> <br /> In the mid-1830s, Mistanta and Bent were married at Bent’s Fort. Together, they had four children – Mary, Robert, George, and Julia. Mistanta’s arrival greatly benefited Bent and the fort. She provided interpretation and invaluable insight into the customs of the Southern Cheyenne. It is said she even nursed Bent back to health from a serious illness in the 1840s. Quite the innovator, she is thought to have blown broth into Bent’s swollen throat using a hollow quill. She is most remembered for her talent and skill as a mediator between Native Americans and white traders and soldiers.<br /> <br /> Mistanta died around 1847 likely due to complications of childbirth, but the patches of peace she nurtured amidst a world of division are still remembered today.</p> <h4>Learn More</h4> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail </a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/beol/index.htm\">Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site</a></h3>",

His federal career began in 1890 when he was appointed U.S. Solicitor General by President Benjamin Harrison. In the 1890s he served as a judge on the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Taft's political career essentially began when he was appointed Governor General of the Philippines by President William McKinley in 1900. At the conclusion of his tenure in the Philippines, he returned home to serve as President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War in 1904.  (Roosevelt took over the Presidency after McKinley's assassination in 1901).<br /> <br /> After being annointed by Roosevelt to succeed him, Taft ran for and easily won the Presidential election in 1908. During Taft's presidency, he would alienate many over his policies, including his mentor Roosevelt. This would result in Roosevelt re-entering politics to oppose Taft. Unsuccessful in his attempt to win the 1912 Republican nomination, Roosevelt broke away from the Republican party to form his own party. The 1912 election saw three parties competing for the presidency. Due to Roosevelt and Taft splitting the Republican votes (Roosevelt won 27% of the popular vote and Taft won 23%), the election was essentially handed to the Democratic challenger Woodrow Wilson who won 82% of the Electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote. After failing to win re-election in a bitter and devisive election, Taft returned to his alma mater, Yale University, and taught law. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding called upon Taft for one final appointment, the position that Taft had always dreamt about, Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court. He wrote of his coveted appointment as Chief Justice; <em>\"I don't remember that I ever was President.\"</em> Taft would hold this position from 1921 until his death in 1930.  </p> <p>William Howard Taft has the distinction of being the only person in history to have been President and Chief Justice of the United States. After his death, his funeral was the first presidential funeral to be broadcast over the radio. He is also the first President to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from the city where he reached the pinnacle of the judiciary and executive branches.</p> <p>Learn more about how William Howard Taft followed in his <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/like-father-like-son.htm\">father's footprints</a></strong>.</p> <p>Visit the William Howard Taft National Historic Site <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wiho/index.htm\">website</a></strong> for additional facts and information on William Howard Taft and to plan your visit to the site.</p>",

Due to the remoteness of his upbringing and lack of available public education, Lincoln was mostly self-educated. In 1836, after years of study, he qualified as a lawyer and went to work in a law practice in Springfield, Illinois. He sat in the Illinois state legislature from 1834 to 1842, and in 1846 was elected to Congress, representing the Whig Party for a two-year term. In 1856, he joined the new Republican Party, and in 1858 he ran as their candidate for the US Senate. Though he lost the election, his series of debates with Stephen A. Douglas thrust him into the national spotlight, and in 1860 he was nominated as the Republican candidate for president.<br /> <br /> In the presidential campaign, Lincoln made his opposition to the expansion of slavery very clear. His victory provoked a crisis for the southern states, with many fearing that he would attempt to abolish slavery. Seven southern states left the Union to form the Confederate States of America before Lincoln's inauguration. After the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteer to put down the rebellion and four more states joined the Confederacy. Lincoln vowed to preserve the Union even if it meant war.<br /> <br /> The first year of war was not promising for the Union, and with their defeat in 1862 at the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run) it seemed like the second year of war would not be much better. Riding momentum from this victory, Lee and the Confederates staged an offensive with the Maryland Campaign. However the Union victory at the bloody Battle of Antietam pushed the Confederates back across the Potomac and provided Lincoln with an opportunity he had been waiting for to announce his plans regarding slavery.<br /> <br /> In the early months of the war, Lincoln maintained that the war was a struggle only to save the Union. After the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln announced the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Officially on January 1, 1863 all enslaved people in the Confederate States of America were freed, signifying the Union's war aims had changed to include the abolition of slavery.<br /> <br /> In the effort to win the war, Lincoln assumed more power than any president before him, declaring martial law and suspending legal rights. He had difficulty finding effective generals to lead the Union armies until the appointment of Ulysses S. Grant as overall commander in 1864.<br /> <br /> By the beginning of his second term in March 1865, the war was clearly in its final days, and in his inaugural address Lincoln summed up the policy he would follow in rebuilding the Union: \"With malice towards none, with charity for all.\" Soon thereafter, on April 9, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered the Confederate armies in Virginia, effectively ending the Civil War. Less than a week later, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a pro-Confederate sympathizer, while attending a performance at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., and died the next morning, April 15, 1865. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "Jule was an enslaved woman who accompanied Julia Dent Grant for most of the American Civil War. In early 1864, she liberated herself by running away while in Louisville, Kentucky. <br /> <br /> According to Julia Dent Grant, Jule (who was sometimes referred to as \"Black Julia\" or \"Julia\") was \"a slave born and brought up at my Missouri home,\" White Haven. When Julia married Ulysses S. Grant in August 1848, her father, Frederick F. Dent, informally \"gifted\" four enslaved laborers to her: Dan, John, Eliza, and Jule. While Julia Grant never held legal ownership of these enslaved people, she greatly benefitted from their labors and oversaw their daily activities. Jule was specifically noted by Julia Grant as \"my nurse and maid.\" Througout the 1850s Jule's duties may have included nursing the Grant family's four children, cleaning the family's clothes by hand, and serving food and drinks to the Dent and Grant families. <br /> <br /> When the Grant family left St. Louis for Galena, Illinois, in early 1860, they \"hired out\" Dan, John, Eliza, and Jule \"to persons [in St. Louis] whom we knew and who promised to be kind to them.\" However, after the American Civil War broke out, Julia Grant returned to St. Louis to visit her father in November 1861 and regained possession of Jule. She claimed in her <em>Personal Memoirs</em> that \"Eliza, Dan, Julia, and John belonged to me up to the time of President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\" Technically this was a mistaken remembrance since Missouri was exempt from the Emancipation Proclamation when it was issued in 1863, but Julia Grant spent much time with her husband in Mississippi during the Vicksburg campaign and may have believed that these enslaved individuals were now free. In any case, Julia remarked that \"when I visited the General during the war, I nearly always had Julia with me as nurse,\" even after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. <br /> <br /> In early 1864, the Grants oldest son Fred became deatly ill with typohid fever and dysentery in St. Louis. Anixous to get back to White Haven, Julia Grant traveled with Jule and her youngest son Jesse back to St. Louis from Nashville, Tennessee. They arrived in Louisville, Kentucky, to meet a military escort on January 20, and around this time Jule ran away. \"I suppose she feared losing her freedom if she returned to Missouri,\" Julia Grant speculated. \"I regretted this as she was always a favorite of mine.\" While Julia Grant implies that Jule may have already received her freedom, it is clear that Jule was ready to start a new life for herself away from Julia Grant, without advanced notice or a goodbye of any sort. <br /> <br /> Julia Grant recalled that Jule \"married soon afterwards,\" but little else is known about her life in freedom. The contradiction of Julia Grant's possession of Jule during the American Civil War while her husband fought to end slavery raises interesting questions about Julia Grant's relationship with slavery, and Jule's motivations for running away during the war.  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Acadia had long been a destination for geologists, but Florence Bascom was the first professional female geologist to survey Mount Desert Island, publishing “The Geology of Mount Desert Island” in 1919.</p> <p>The youngest of five children, Bascom was encouraged by her father (a philosphy professor) and her mother (an activist in the suffrage movement) to pursue science. She was born in Massachusetts and grew up in Wisconsin. After earning several degrees at the University of Wisconsin and selecting geology as her preferred course of study, Bascom applied to Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>The president of Johns Hopkins, Daniel C. Gilman, who was also a Northeast Harbor summer resident, opposed the co-education of women. But Bascom persisted, successfully petitioning for admission with support from her Wisconsin professors.</p> <p>As was customary at the time, she was required to sit behind a screen in the corner of the classroom so as to not distract the male students. But she also finally had the chance to get outside and conduct fieldwork, studying the rocks of the Piedmont region of Maryland and Pennsylvania, work for which she became best known.</p> <p>Newspapers around the region and nation carried word of Bascom’s graduation as the first woman to receive a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1893. President Gilman sent her a letter from Mount Desert, “You have won your honors, as you must have wished to win them, without any favoritism, - just as all other candidates among us have won their diplomas, by talents, patience, and exertion...”</p> <p>After briefly working at Ohio State, she took a position at Bryn Mawr College, then a women’s college, and began building a program in geology. Bascom emphasized field work for her students, a practice which often brought her into conflict with Bryn Mawr president M. Carey Thomas. In a letter to Bascom, who wanted her students to get physical education credit for geology field work, Thomas demands that the women wear appropriate apparel for the outdoors.</p> <p>“We have talked over the possibility of asking the Self Government to alter the rule about not wearing atheletic skirts off the campus and we do not think this would be wise but every student ought to have a walking skirt and as soon as the members of your class are willing to provide themselves with such skirts the Health Committee will be willing to count the geological excursions of two hours as a substitute for the third hour of fixed exercise. “</p> <p>Teaching was not enough. In order to be successful as a geologist, Bascom had to participate in the professional organizations and conduct mapping and survey work like a ‘regular fellow.’</p> <p>In 1894, she became the second woman elected to the Geological Society of America, and in 1896 was the first woman to work for the U.S. Geological Survey. She conducted field work in the summer, while returning to Bryn Mawr the rest of the year for teaching, writing reports, and analyzing samples. She loved to work outdoors. “This is the life,” she wrote, “to plunge into the welcome isolation of the field…”</p> <p>While the exact timeline of her visits to Maine remains to be reconstructed (did Gilman invite her to Northeast Harbor?) she likely began visiting Maine on behalf of the USGS shortly after her appointment as assistant geology. She visited the Damariscotta region around 1898, and corresponded with William Crosby, who previously studied the geology of Frenchman Bay.</p> <p>Her report on Mount Desert was published in 1919, and reprinted by the Joint Path Committee of the Village Improvement Societies. It contains photographs by William C. Alden taken in 1907.</p> <p>Bascom was a mentor to many, including <em>Wildflowers of Mount Desert Island </em>author Edgar Theodore Wherry, who was her assistant at USGS. She trained numerous female geologists to think critically and communicate their findings.</p> <p>“When any woman manifests an interest in the science [of geology] I am always glad to tell her of its possibilities and she makes her own choice. Not only must a girl have the mental aptitude for scientific research, but also physical strength and great physical courage. Then too she must be strong in the conviction that it is the work she really wants to do,” wrote Bascom.</p> <p>Florence Bascom did not cook, or iron. She was restless and independent. She loved horses and dogs. She retired in 1928 to the Berkshires in western Massachusetts.</p> <p>She was also, apparently, a poet. This verse is contained in the collection of Florence Bascom Papers at Smith College.</p> <p>The Hut<br /> A hut and a tree<br /> And a hill for me!<br /> A dog, a horse, and upland meadows,<br /> And I’ll ask no thing<br /> Of man or king<br /> Save to clear away their shadows.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Florence Bascom Papers, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, MA.</p> <p>Bascom, F. 1899.

Edloe with his mother and four siblings. Unlike Edloe's other enslaved men and women, Randolph could read and write. His literacy proved instrumental in securing his and their freedom.</p> <p>Edloe's will directed his estate to first pay his debts, and then \"to raise a sufficient sum to pay for the transportation of my Slaves to any Free State or Colony which they may prefer.\"<sup>1</sup> However, upon Edloe's death the executor of his will kept Randolph and the 79 others enslaved. When Randolph learned of the will and read it for himself, he helped obtain a lawyer to plead their case. After over three years of being unjustly kept in slavery, a magistrate successfully secured Randolph and the others their free papers and passage to Boston.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>On September 5, 1847, Randolph and sixty-six newly emancipated men, women, and children from Edloe's plantation boarded a ship to Boston.<sup>3</sup> They arrived on September 15, and Randolph wrote about this day:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>It was soon noised abroad through the city, that a cargo of emancipated slaves had landed at Long Wharf. A large number of citizens came to the wharf to see the strangers, and to congratulate them on their new birth to freedom. Prominent among these were, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, John A. Andrew, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/wendell-phillips.htm\">Wendell Phillips</a>, and Samuel May... Need I say, we were made welcome to our new home, when we met such distinguished visitors.</em><sup>4</sup></p> <p>These men and members of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-anti-slavery-society-office.htm\">Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society</a> assisted Randolph and the other freed people with settling in the city and greater Boston.</p> <p>Randolph joined the Beacon Hill neighborhood, specifically its religious and activist communities. He initially worshipped at the Belknap Street Church with a small group led by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/leonard-grimes.htm\">Leonard Grimes</a>. This group later established the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/twelfth-baptist-church.htm\">Twelfth Baptist Church</a> with Grimes as its preacher and Randolph as one of the Church's original members.<sup>5</sup> Randolph became a licensed preacher at this church.</p> <p>His involvement with the community expanded into supporting anti-slavery causes. In 1854, <em>The Liberator</em> records Randolph's donation to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. During this same year, the <em>Account Book of Francis Jackson, Treasurer The Vigilance Committee of Boston</em> documents Randolph’s assistance to freedom seekers. The Vigilance Committee reimbursed Randolph for boarding freedom seekers \"Jn'o R Jones,\" Alexander Perkins, and Richard Howard.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Listening to the leaders of the Anti-Slavery society, Randolph saw a missing element to their argument: \"I saw at once what was the difficulty: the thing needed was more definite knowledge in regard to the masters and their slaves. This I felt I could supply from my experience in the South as a slave.\"<sup>7</sup> In 1855, he published <em>The Sketch of a Slave life, or, an illustration of the peculiar institution</em> to prove \" 'that slaves, when liberated, can take care of themselves, and need no master or overseer to drive them to their toil.' \"<sup>8</sup></p> <p>As a Baptist preacher in the 1850s, he spoke at various churches in the Greater Boston area, as well as led churches in Boston; New Haven, Connecticut; and Newburgh, New York.<sup>9</sup> With the encouragement of Reverend Leonard Grimes, Randolph moved south to help the newly emancipated people in Virginia after the Civil War. Settling in Richmond, Randolph saw both the joy of the newly emancipated people, as well as their struggles. He began preaching at the Ebenezer Baptist Church and soon became its permanent pastor.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>After serving in Virginia for over four years, Peter Randolph returned to Boston. Noticing the large number of Black southerners who had moved to Boston and did not have an organized place to worship, Randolph founded the Ebenezer Baptist Church in 1871 in Boston’s South End.<sup>11</sup> In the last years of his life, Peter Randolph shared his life story in his autobiography <em>From Slave Cabin to the Pulpit. The Autobiography of Rev. Peter Randolph: the Southern Question Illustrated and Sketches of Slave Life.</em></p> <p>Many parishioners, clergymen, and former abolitionists attended his funeral, attesting to the profound influence Randolph had on his community. According to his obituary, Reverend Peter Randolph \"had the record of founding and preaching over more Baptist churches than any other Baptist clergyman in New England.\"<sup>12</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Peter Randolph, <em>From Slave Cabin to the Pulpit.

            "bodyText": "In the late 1920s, Solomon ‘Sod’ Collier and his family crammed into a Ford pickup truck and left Kentucky to seek a new life and new opportunities in the Ozarks. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, the family obtained some of the least sought-after property along the Buffalo River in northern Arkansas. Many earlier settlers had claimed more desirable land by the river, leaving only less fertile ridgetops behind.<br /> <br /> While the land may not have been desirable, the Colliers got to work. Throughout the Great Depression, the Collier family demonstrated the self-sufficiency needed in tough times. Sod built their home by hewing logs and putting clay mud between them to seal the spaces. The Colliers also collected rainwater from the roof into a cistern in the front of the house. This prevented a walk to the spring each day.<br /> <br /> The tasks were many to improve the land under the Homestead Act—and to survive. Besides building the home, land was cultivated. A smokehouse and barns were erected. The family grew corn, oats, peaches, various vegetables, pumpkins, apples, and beans to enjoy and preserve for the winter. Sod’s wife, Ida, gardened on the property and foraged medicinal plants. Sod raised hogs and cattle for meat, and also hunted and fished along the Buffalo.<br /> <br /> Buffalo River farmers like the Colliers were dedicated. Their endless hard work and practicality created a life and legacy in the Arkansas Ozarks. The Colliers fulfilled the requirements of the Homestead Act, and the land became theirs in 1937. The Colliers lived at the property until 1961, with no water or electricity. You can still visit the cabin today at Tyler Bend and imagine what the simpler life was like during trying times.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Robert Thomas Hickman was born an enslaved man near Boone, Missouri in 1831. With permission of his enslaver, Hickman learned to read and write. This allowed him to preach to fellow enslaved people on several plantations becoming a leader to them. Thus he led a group of Black men and women to freedom in 1863 via the Mississippi River.</p> <h3><b>The Emancipation Proclamation, January 1863 </b></h3> <p>Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 because the Confederate States who had seceded from the United States refused to return to the Union. This proclamation declared free all the people who were enslaved in the Confederate States. As outlined in the Emancipation Proclamation, the proclamation did not extend to include border states because they accepted Lincoln as president. This meant that enslaved people in border states, such as Missouri, would not be granted legal freedom from their enslavers under the Emancipation Proclamation.</p> <h3><b>The Journey, May 1863</b></h3> <p>Robert Hickman and a group of about 75 Black men and women decided to seek freedom from their enslavers by their own accord after the Emancipation Proclamation did not extend to include them. They wanted to work as free people in the northern states. Due to the dangerous nature of Confederates, Hickman and his group from Boone County decided to travel on a simple raft up the Mississippi River during the night in May of 1863. The raft, however, floated on the water and did not get them as far as they hoped because they did not have any tools to help them paddle the waters of the Mississippi River.           <br /> <br /> As noted in <i>The Children of Lincoln: White Paternalism and the Limits of Black Opportunity in Minnesota</i> by William D. Green, in May of 1863 a steamboat called <i>Northerner</i> was on its way to Saint Paul, Minnesota to forcefully transport Dakota people out of Minnesota by orders of the United States government. On its way north, the <i>Northerner </i>came upon Hickman and the rest of the group on the raft in the middle of the Mississippi River near Jefferson, Missouri. Hickman and the rest of the people on the raft were towed to Lowertown Saint Paul, Minnesota by the <i>Northerner</i>.<br /> <br /> Minnesota had suffered a labor shortage in the 1860s because many laborers had gone into the military service during the Civil and Dakota Wars. A lot of jobs had opened up, especially in the agricultural sector. This made farmers seek Black labor, “contrabands,” to work their fields because “hired negro labor is, on the whole, more efficient, because more tractable and more docile, than the class of white labor which is usually available for such purposes,” reported the <i>Saint Paul Press</i> in May of 1863.<br /> <br /> When the <i>Northerner </i>approached the levee in Lowertown Saint Paul, Minnesota, a mob at the dock, which was largely composed of Irish laborers, began to verbally and physically assault the newly arrived free Black men and women. The <i>Saint Paul Press </i>reported, “It was impossible for an impartial spectator who witnessed the scenes at the levee on those occasions, not to assign the negro to a higher type of civilization than the white barbarians who howled around them as if, like beasts of prey, they thirsted for their blood.” This dangerous reception prompted the captain of the <i>Northerner</i> to instead direct his steamboat to Fort Snelling located a few miles upriver from Lowertown. U.S. Army officials at Fort Selling took in the Black men and women in efforts to alleviate soldiers' workload and to help with the labor shortage in the state.<br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to Hickman and his people, Fort Snelling was the site of the concentration camp for Dakota women, children and elders in 1862 to 1863. As Hickman and his people set foot onto solid land they witnessed the Dakota people “file mournfully past the very site of their sorrow to board the same steamer that had brought Hickman and his group from Missouri to this wretched spot and now would take the Dakota dependent to whatever fate awaited them” (Green 76). Hickman and his people witnessed more forceful removals of the Ho-Chunk and Dakota people via steamboats traveling south on the Mississippi River. Hickman and the rest of the group spent the summer and fall at Fort Snelling, and eventually some, including Hickman, settled into Saint Paul, Minnesota.<br /> <br /> Hickman went on to hold services for Black men, women and families calling themselves the “Pilgrims.” In 1866, Hickman led a “baptismal service on the Mississippi River” in Saint Paul and Pilgrim Baptist Church -- the church Hickman had established -- was formally chartered (Wilson). It was not until 1874 that Hickman, because he was a Black man, was legally ordained in the state of Minnesota and remained the congregation’s minister until 1886. Additionally, in 1869 Hickman would be among one of the first Black men to ever serve on a jury in Minnesota. On February 6, 1900, Hickman died a free man, a licensed minister, and a part of Minnesota history.<br /> <br /> Kristy Ornelas<br /> AmeriCorps VISTA Servicemember <br /> Mississippi Park Connection<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> <br /> Adams, Jim. \"A Voyage of Remembrance: Pilgrim Baptist Church Members Rode a Riverboat to Fort Snelling, as their Founders did in 1863.” <i>Star Tribune</i>, Oct 10, 2010.<br /> <br /> “The Emancipation Proclamation.” <i>National Archives and Records Administration</i>, National Archives and Records Administration, 17 Apr. 2019, www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation.<br /> <br /> “The First Negro Jurymen.” <i>The Minneapolis Daily Tribune</i>, March 25, 1869.<br /> <br /> Green, William D.. <i>The Children of Lincoln : White Paternalism and the Limits of Black Opportunity in Minnesota, 1860-1876</i>, University of Minnesota Press, 2018.<i> </i><br /> <br /> Jones, Haru. “The Emancipation Proclamation: The Civil War in Four Minntes.” <i>American Battlefield Trust</i>, <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/videos/emancipation-proclamation\">https://www.battlefields.org/learn/videos/emancipation-proclamation</a>.<br /> <br /> “Memory Map.” <i>Bdote Memory Map</i>, bdotememorymap.org/memory-map/.<br /> <br /> Wilson, Cynthia. “Robert T.

The first 9 African Americans arrived on September 4th. They were met with a group of angry whites. Governor Orval Faubus opposed integration. He responded by sending the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the students from entering the school. Despite the animosity, the students continued on. Bates’ home served as the headquarters for the battle for integration. She served as a personal advocate and supporter to the students. On September 24, 1957 the nine students left her home to attend their first day of school. As they faced harassment and intimidation, Bates continued to support them.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4e26ce34-17f5-1b1c-e7a9-a37caef3415a\">T</b>he newspaper Bates and her husband worked on was closed in 1959 because of low advertising revenue.  In 1960, Bates published her account of the school integration as <em>The Long Shadow of Little Rock</em>.

Mr. Roosevelt called me in and asked me how I would like to go to his home in Oyster Bay and take charge of it during the summer. And so I soon found myself at the Roosevelt home on Long Island, where I was to spend so many very happy years.”</i> James E. Amos, in his book <i>Theodore Roosevelt: A Hero to His Valet.</i><br /> <br /> James Amos was one of several African Americans to work at Sagamore Hill. He served as the Roosevelt family’s butler and Theodore Roosevelt’s personal valet both during and after the presidency. Highly regarded by Theodore, Edith, and the Roosevelt children, Amos was called on by the family to attend to TR in his final days. Roosevelt’s final words – “James, will you please put out the light,” were directed at Amos who was keeping watch over the sickly former president in Sagamore Hill’s gate room.<br /> <br /> Amos was first employed at the White House after an encounter between his father, a Washington police officer, and the President at Rock Creek Park, in which Amos’ father asked about possible employment for his son at the executive mansion. Amos’ first duties were to keep an eye on the young and sometimes rowdy Roosevelt children, a task he excelled at where others had often failed. Amos was soon asked to work as a butler for the president and continued to serve as a personal attendant during travel, as well as working with the household staff at Sagamore Hill during summers, residing at the Gray Cottage with his wife Annie.<br /> <br /> Seeking a higher wage, Amos asked TR for a letter of reference and left Sagamore Hill in 1913, soon becoming employed by the William J. Burns detective agency as a private detective. He occasionally returned to work as TR’s personal attendant at the family’s request. In 1921, Amos was sworn in as a Special Agent with the Bureau of Investigation (eventually, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI), one of only a few African American agents in the early days of the bureau, and served at that post until retiring at the age of 74 in 1953. He would die of a heart attack only two months after retirement.",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>Earl Douglass was a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1909, he found eight dinosaur tailbones protruding from a sandstone hill in the Utah desert. This discovery was the beginning of a dinosaur quarry that achieved worldwide fame. In 1915, Dinosaur National Monument was established to protect and conserve that dinosaur quarry.</em></p> <p>In the summer of 1909, Earl Douglass traveled to Utah to search for dinosaur skeletons. A few years earlier, the Carnegie Museum had collected a nearly complete <em>Diplodocus</em> skeleton in Wyoming. The huge skeleton had been mounted and displayed in the museum's new Dinosaur Hall and it enthralled the public. The Carnegie Museum was eager to find more dinosaur skeletons to populate their Dinosaur Hall.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Early Life</strong><br /> Earl Douglass was born in 1862 in Medford, Minnesota. Although Douglass did not begin collecting fossils in earnest until in his early 30s, his interest in the sciences, especially geology, dated to his boyhood. As a young man, he spent several years teaching at schools in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Montana. Between 1893 and 1902, he earned a bachelor's and master's degree and began work on a Ph.D. In 1902, Douglass joined the paleontology department at the Carnegie Museum.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Fossil Prospecting in Utah</strong><br /> Douglass arrived in Utah in late July 1909 and began his fossil search along the Duchesne River. Less than two weeks later, he received a letter from W.J. Holland, director of the Carnegie Museum, instructing him to \"dig up dinosaur bones east of Vernal.\"</p> <p>The year before, while passing through the area east of Vernal, Douglass and Holland had found a <em>Diplodocus</em> femur. The fossil was too large and heavy for them to move, but it was promising. Holland described the find as \"proof positive that in that general region search for dinosaurian remains would probably be successful.\"</p> <p>Arriving at the dinosaur beds near Vernal, Douglass was not encouraged by what he found. On August 10, his first day there, he discovered that \"someone had taken the best of the bones that were exposed.\" His August 12 diary entry lamented that he had \"[f]ound dinosaur bones but nothing good.\" On August 13: \"The layer contains fragments of bones but nothing especially promising.\" On August 16: \"The bones were terribly broken up and it seemed as if they had been churned up…Felt rather discouraged.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>The Discovery</strong><br /> On August 17, however, Douglass moved his search to a new area-\"the gulch this side of the one we had last examined\"-an area with thick, hard sandstone beds. There he found what he was looking for: \"At last, in the top of the ledge where the softer overlying beds form a divide, a kind of saddle, I saw eight of the tail bones of [an <em>Apatosaurus</em>] in exact position. It was a beautiful sight.\"</p> <p>Douglass began to excavate the bones. As he worked, he found fossils from other dinosaurs mixed with the <em>Apatosaurus</em> skeleton. This was the beginning of the Carnegie Quarry.</p> <p>With the discovery of the <em>Apatosaurus</em>, Douglass was no longer on a brief summer-long fossil collecting expedition. The fossils he had found were now his full-time job and the Utah desert his new workplace. His wife, Pearl, and year-old son, Gawin, joined Douglass in Utah in September of 1909. The family eventually established a ranch not far from the quarry, where they lived until 1923.<br /> <br /> The bones Douglass found that summer day turned out to be part of the most complete <em>Apatosaurus</em> skeleton ever discovered. Over the next several years, the fossilized skeleton was extracted from the Utah desert and shipped by train to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By 1915, the <em>Apatosaurus</em> skeleton-having been excavated, shipped, prepared and mounted-stood in the Dinosaur Hall at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The <em>Apatosaurus</em> is still displayed at the museum today.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>After the Discovery</strong><br /> Between 1909 and 1924, Douglass managed the work at the quarry. For 13 years, the Carnegie Museum funded the excavations and, as the ancient bones were unearthed, Douglass and his crew shipped them east to Pittsburgh. During that period, more than 700,000 tons of material was sent from Utah to Pittsburgh. In 1922, the Carnegie Museum determined that it had obtained sufficient fossil material and relinquished its claim to operate the quarry.</p> <p>Douglass, however, remained at the quarry and in the employ of the Carnegie Museum. In 1923 and 1924, he worked with the National Museum-part of the Smithsonian Institution-and with the University of Utah in their quests to obtain dinosaur fossils at the famous quarry.</p> <p>In 1924, all excavation at the quarry ended and Douglass resigned from the Carnegie Museum. He joined the staff of the University of Utah where he spent two years preparing fossils from the quarry for mounting. His final years were spent as a geologist, specializing in the Uintah Basin.</p> <p>Earl Douglass, who died in 1931, played a central role in one of the most important fossil finds in North America. The \"beautiful sight\" Douglass saw on August 17, 1909, turned out to be one of the most productive Jurassic era quarries ever found.</p> <hr /> <p>The quotes and excerpts from Earl Douglass's diaries used on this page are taken from <em>Speak to the Earth and It Will Teach You, The Life and Times of Earl Douglass, 1862-1931</em> by G.E Douglass.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Julia Archibald Holmes was born February 15, 1838 in Nova Scotia. Her family moved to the eastern US in 1848, settling in Worcester County, Massachusetts. Julia’s parents were staunch abolitionists who relocated their family to “Bleeding Kansas” amidst conflict over slavery in the region. The <a href=\"https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas-nebraska-act/15159\">Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854</a> mandated that voters in Kansas would determine if slavery was legal in the state, fueling emigration from anti-slavery and pro-slavery groups in an attempt to influence the vote.  <br /> <br /> The Archibalds settled on the Wakarusa River and their property became a stop on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/what-is-the-underground-railroad.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>. They helped found Lawrence, Kansas—a community of abolitionists. During their time in Kansas, the Archibalds spent time with other activists including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a> who introduced Julia to her husband, James Henry Holmes. <br /> <br /> In 1857, Julia married Holmes (who went by Henry), seeing his involvement with John Brown’s abolitionist militia as a sign that they were well matched. As newlyweds, Julia and Henry moved to Emporia, Kansas to farm but that lifestyle did not suit them. Joining Julia’s brother on a trip down the Santa Fe Trail in 1858, Julia and Henry set out to have an adventure. <br /> <br /> The wagon party was composed of around 50 people—only two of whom were women. Julia traveled in what was known as a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bloomers-on-the-trail.htm\">“Bloomer Costume”</a>, comprised of a calf-length skirt with puffy pantaloons underneath. The controversial outfit was a feminist statement, but it was a practical choice for life on the trail—during which Julia walked (instead of rode) to prepare for an ascent of Pikes Peak.<br /> <br /> Joining the <a href=\"https://www.kshs.org/p/gold-fever-in-kansas-territory/13233\">Lawrence Party</a>, a group of gold-seekers headed for Colorado, Julia and Henry set their sights on reaching the summit of <a href=\"https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/pikes-peak#:~:text=Standing%2014%2C115%20feet%2C%20Pikes%20Peak,is%20not%20considered%20a%20volcano.\">Pikes Peak</a>. Julia wanted to show women that they could do anything men could do—and she did just that. Upon reaching the top in 1858, Julia became the first recorded European-American woman to climb the famous mountain. She shared her story with publications in the East including the feminist journal <i>Sybil</i> and the <i>Whig Press</i>. Her writings gained attention and she was later offered a correspondent gig with the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. <br /> <br /> After reaching Pikes Peak, Julia and Henry traveled to New Mexico, eventually arriving in Santa Fe in 1860 with their newborn son. Shortly afterward, they travelled to Washington, DC, to seek a territorial government position for Henry. With fellow Republican abolitionist Abraham Lincoln in office, Henry was appointed as the Secretary of the Territory of New Mexico. The family travelled back to New Mexico on the Santa Fe Trail with the US mail wagon train. <br /> <br /> The Holmes’ abolitionist views were not wholly welcomed by the other New Mexico territorial appointees of the time. A power struggle ensued, exacerbated by Henry’s choice to help his family operate a weekly newspaper called the <i>Santa Fe Republican</i>. Positions published in the paper led to Henry’s arrest for sedition and the family’s exit from New Mexico. <br /> <br /> After the Civil War, Julia divorced Henry and moved to Washington, DC, with her children. There, she became the first female member of the United States Board of Education and was a secretary for the <a href=\"http://www.crusadeforthevote.org/nwsa-organize\">National Woman Suffrage Association</a>. Her hard work for the U.S. Department of the Interior was rewarded with pay equal to her male counterparts (which was unusual at the time). <br /> <br /> While in DC, Julia was extremely active in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/us-suffrage-timeline-1648-to-2016.htm\">suffragist movement</a>.  In 1869, she participated as a delegate at the National Woman Suffrage Association convention. She helped foster suffrage associations and helped organize female clerks with her sister. Along with a growing number of suffragists, she attempted to register to vote in 1871. Although Julia died in 1887 before women received the right to vote, her commitment to women’s suffrage helped pave the way for women’s rights and her abolitionist work helped forward anti-slavery sentiment in New Mexico. <b> </b></p> <h4>Sources</h4> <p>Birney, A.

Shortly after, his parents, John and Aphus, moved the family to Laclede County in Central Missouri. By 1940, the family was living in New Cambria, in Macon County, Missouri, where both Taylor and his father worked as farm laborers.</p> <p>On April 7, 1942, Taylor enlisted in the Navy in St. Louis and was immediately shipped out for basic training in San Diego that would last until May 23. He then reported for duty, on July 26, in Honolulu aboard the training ship USS <em>Elliot</em> (DMS 4), where he would earn the rating of watertender 2nd class.</p> <img alt=\"Robert Samuel Taylor signature\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|773|270|0|4|4\" height=\"270\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6554397|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Taylor-Signature.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:4px;margin-left:4px;margin-right:4px;\" title=\"Robert Samuel Taylor signature\" width=\"773\" /> <p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Robert Samuel Taylor Personnel File, National Archives </em></p> <p>In October 1943, Taylor entered the Destroyer Training Program at the Naval Training Station, Treasure Island Naval Station in San Francisco, where he received training in chemical warfare, firefighting, and gunnery. A little over two months later, on December 31, 1943, Taylor was one of the crew who commissioned to the USS <em>Cassin Young </em>(DD-793). His short but eventful Navy career occurred entirely aboard that ship throughout the Pacific.</p> <p>Following at-sea training, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> participated in raids of some Japanese naval and air installations in the Caroline Islands between April 29 and May 1, 1944. Between June and August of that year, the ship was part of operations that recaptured Guam and seized Saipan before moving onto the Liberation of the Philippines. In addition to assisting the invasions of Leyte and Luzon, the ship also participated in numerous raids on enemy positions in the China Sea.</p> <p>After completing operations that assisted the attack and capture of Iwo Jima between February 15 and March 16, 1945, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> then moved with the fleet to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa</a>, where operations commenced on April 1. This campaign is remembered for its brutality. The Japanese military fought to the death on land and took to the skies in suicide missions in which kamikaze pilots attempted to fly their bomb-laden aircraft into Allied shipping. As part of the radar picket, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was regularly rotated to positions on the perimeter of the fleet to serve as early warning and defense against Japanese aircraft.</p> <p>On April 12, 1945, during a massed air attack of kamikaze planes, a Japanese plane clipped the ship’s mast, killing one and injuring 59 crew members. Although the Allied forces secured Okinawa two months later, on June 22, the Japanese military continued to launch attacks on warships off the island’s coast. On July 30, 1945, a Japanese kamikaze pilot crashed his plane into the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>. The aircraft and the bomb it carried exploded on the deck above the ship’s forward fireroom, where it ruptured super-heated steam lines. Along with his entire watch, Taylor was killed instantly. He was 25.</p> <p>Taylor was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Navy Unit Commendation Medal. His body was later repatriated from Island Grove Cemetery on Okinawa for burial in New Cambria, Missouri.<br />  </p> <hr />",

            "bodyText": "<p>Walter Budd Wimley was a skilled mechanic from Wildwood, New Jersey, a small beach town not far from the US Naval Air Station in Cape May. He enlisted in the Navy on September 11, 1942 in Philadelphia, PA. At age 29 he had a little more life experience than many new enlistees: he completed the 10th grade, he was a widower, he had dredging experience off the Cape May coast, he had been an instructor for the Civilian Conservation Corp, and for some reason he was missing the top of his left index finger. Due to his mechanical skills he enlists, not as an apprentice seaman but as a machinist mate 2nd class (MM2c).<sup>1</sup></p> <p>US Naval Air Station Cape May, NJ is where he completed his basic training and reported to his first duty station. He was working in the Operations Department, but it wasn’t long before the Transportation Department scooped him up and had him keeping all the trucks running. He wanted to work on airplanes. In January 1943 he reported to the US Destroyer Base in San Diego, CA with a letter of introduction from M.R. Brownell, Jr. Personnel Officer US Naval Air Station, Cape May, NJ which outlined Wimley’s value and interest. It reads in part:</p> <blockquote>2. Upon reporting he had expressed interest in carrying on in aviation in which he had some experience in civilian life, shortly thereafter Wimley had to be drafted for the Transportation Department to take charge of the repair of station trucks.<br /> 3. During the time Wimley was attached to Operations he demonstrated not only a marked interest in aviation mechanics but also a strong aptitude for the work. <sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>1943 was a good year for MM2c Walter Wimley. In May he was transfered to the Naval Air Station in San Diego, CA and started working in the Emergency Repair Division of the A&R Department. He got his wish; he was working and training on aircraft engine work. On July 16th he married Mae Kathryn Ardito and was granted three days leave for a honeymoon. On November 2 he was promoted to machinist mate 1st class (MM1c).</p> <p>By March of 1944 it was time for a new assignment. He had a new letter of recommendation from G.L. Sprague, Jr. Training Supervisor Emergency Repair Division, U.S. Naval Air Station, San Diego, CA. The letter outlined the skills he worked hard to cultivate.</p> <blockquote>… He has done outstanding work, on all types of Naval Aircraft and has very good knowledge of the following operations:<br /> 1. General aircraft repairs<br /> 2. Aircraft engine repairs, replacements, testing, tune-up, preserving and servicing.<br /> 3. Hydraulic repairs, adjustments, replacements, etc.<br /> 4. Rigging on all types of flight controls<br /> 5. Landing gear repair, replacement, adjustment, etc He has taken 265 hours of specialized training on Aircraft engine work and 385 hours on General Aircraft Mechanics<br /> He has shown excellent ability in adapting himself to the job at hand, a keen interest in both self improvement and the work to be done, initiative in organizing his work and a ready willingness to do whatever work had to be accomplished. We have come to place great faith in Wimley and will deeply regret losing his services.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>So, the Navy assigned him to a destroyer. Machinist Mate Wimley was received aboard USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) on March 6, 1944. On April 23, 1944 he crossed the equator with his shipmates on their way to the South Pacific. He worked in the Engineering Department helping to keep the ship’s boilers and engines running.</p> <figure class=\"-auto-width\"><img alt=\"Black and White photograph of a man with a long beard wearing Navy dungarees holding a mop head.\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/person/nri/20200722/people/B36C60DB-DFCA-C1B3-6278B6BE7F8BBC85/B36C60DB-DFCA-C1B3-6278B6BE7F8BBC85-small.jpg\" /> <figcaption>Walt Wimley from the album of USS <em>Cassin Young</em> physician, Dr. Eugene Sevensma</figcaption> </figure> <p>Wimley was not so lucky in 1945. April 12, while on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa the ship was strafed by enemy aircraft and a kamikaze struck the radar mast of <em>Cassin Young</em> and exploded. Shrapnel rained down on the ship. One sailor was killed, and 59 sailors were wounded. Wimley sustained a leg wound, but he got a favorable prognosis and returned to duty. He was awarded a Purple Heart.</p> <p>After repairing the radar equipment and mast, <em>Cassin Young</em> was again assigned to picket duty off the coast of Okinawa. On July 30, (five days after his 32nd birthday) the ship was hit a second time by a kamikaze. This time the plane crashed through the main deck and caused an explosion in the forward fireroom. This time 22 sailors died while 45 sailors were wounded. MM1c Walter Wimley was killed instantly.</p> <p>The only personal space a sailor had on board was a small footlocker. Everyone stored their uniforms in the locker so sailors limited personal items to what they valued most: photographs and letters from home, a bible, or souvenirs. Wimley filled his locker with 15 handkerchiefs, a mix of wrenches, feeler gauge (used to measure the gap width or clearance between two parts) and thread gauge, three jackknives, but only one fountain pen. A box of shells may have reminded him of his home in Wildwood. It was a material collection reflecting the man he was; a skilled mechanic from a small beach town in New Jersey.</p> <p>Lieut. (jg) R.C. Tanner described Walter Wimley as:</p> <blockquote>[…] He is industrious, reliable, and an excellent mechanic. He shows great interest in his work and spends a great deal of his time studying to advance himself. He is honest and straightforward and of excellent character.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Walter Budd Wimley, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Letter from M.R.

Accounts vary, but many think that Kamehameha (originally named Pai'ea) was born into a royal family in North Kohala sometime between 1753 and 1761, possibly in November 1758. Kamehameha's mother was Kekuiapoiwa, daughter of a Kona chief. His father was probably Keoua, chief of Kohala. Legends link his birth to storms and strange lights, activities thought by Hawaiians to herald the birth of a great chief. Because of prognostications at his birth and threats from warring clans, Kamehameha was taken away and hidden immediately after his birth. He spent his early years secluded in Waipio, returning to Kailua at the age of five. He lived there with his parents until his father's death, then continued to receive special training from King Kalani'opu'u, his uncle. This training included skills in games, warfare, oral history, navigation, religious ceremonies, and other information necessary to become an <em>ali'i-'ai-moku</em> (a district chief).</p> <p>By the time of Cook's arrival, Kamehameha had become a superb warrior who already carried the scars of a number of political and physical encounters. The young warrior Kamehameha was described as a tall, strong, and physically fearless man who \"moved in an aura of violence.\" Kamehameha accompanied his uncle (King Kalani'opu'u) aboard the <em>Discovery</em>, and history records that he conducted himself with valor during the battle in which Cook was killed. For his part in the battle at Kealakekua he achieved a certain level of notoriety, which he paraded \"with an imperiousness that matched and even exceeded his rank as a high chief.\" Kamehameha might never have become king except for a twist of fate. Within a year after Cook's death, the elderly <em>ali'i</em> Kalani'opu'u, crippled by age and disease, called together his retainers and divided his Hawaiian domain. His son Kiwala'o became his political heir. To his nephew Kamehameha, the elderly <em>ali'i</em> entrusted the war god Kuka'ilimoku. Although this pattern of dividing the succession of the chiefdom and the protectorate of the god Ku was legendary, some authors suggest it was also uncommon.</p> <p>As the eldest son, a chief of high rank, and the designated heir, the claim of Kiawala'o to the island of Hawai'i was \"clear and irrefutible.\" However, although Kamehameha was of lower rank, and only a nephew of the late king, his possession of the war god was a powerful incentive to political ambition. Thus the old chief's legacy had effectively \"split the political decision-making power between individuals of unequal rank\" and set the stage for civil war among the chiefs of the island of Hawai'i. Although Kiwala'o was senior to Kamehameha, the latter soon began to challenge his authority. During the funeral for one of Kalani'opu'u's chiefs, Kamehameha stepped in and performed one of the rituals specifically reserved for Kiwala'o, an act that constituted a great insult.</p> <p>After Kalani'opu'u died, in 1782, Kiwala'o took his bones to the royal burial house, Hale o Keawe, at Honaunau on the west coast of Hawai'i Island. Kamehameha and other western coast chiefs gathered nearby to drink and mourn his death. There are different versions of the events that followed. Some say that the old king had already divided the lands of the island of Hawai'i, giving his son Kiwala'o the districts of Ka'u, Puna, and Hilo. Kamehameha was to inherit the districts of Kona, Kohala, and Hamakua. It is not clear whether the landing of Kiwala'o's at Honaunau was to deify the bones of Kalani'opu'u or to attempt seizure of the district of Kona. Some suggest that Kamehameha and the other chiefs had gathered at Honaunau to await the redistribution of land, which usually occurred on the death of a chief, and to make hasty alliances. When it appeared that Kamehameha and his allies were not to receive what they considered their fair share, the battle for power and property began.</p> <p>Over the next four years, numerous battles took place as well as a great deal of jockeying for position and privilege. Alliances were made and broken, but no one was able to gain a decisive advantage. The rulers of Hawai'i had reached a stalemate. Kamehameha's superior forces had several times won out over those of other warriors. He took the daughter of Kiwala'o, Keopuolani, captive and made her one of his wives; he also took the child Ka'ahumanu (once mentioned as a wife for Kiwala'o) and \"betrothed her to himself.\" He thus firmly established himself as an equal contender for control over the Hawaiian lands formerly ruled by Kalani'opu'u. Eventually Kiwala'o was killed in battle, but control of the Island of Hawai'i remained divided.</p> <p>By 1786 the old chief Kahekili, king of Maui, had become the most powerful <em>ali'i</em> in the islands, ruling O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i, and Lana'i, and controlling Kaua'i and Ni'ihau through an agreement with his half-brother Ka'eokulani. In 1790 Kamehameha and his army, aided by Isaac Davis and John Young, invaded Maui. The great chief Kahekili was on O'ahu, attempting to stem a revolt there. Using cannon salvaged from the ship, the Fair American, Kamehameha's warriors forced the Maui army into retreat, killing such a large number that the bodies dammed up a stream. However, Kamehameha's victory was short-lived, for one of his enemies, his cousin Keoua, chief of Puna and Ka'u, took advantage of Kamehameha's absence from Hawai'i to pillage and destroy villages on Hawai'i Island's west coast. Returning to Hawai'i, Kamehameha fought Keoua in two fierce battles. Kamehameha then retired to the west coast of the island, while Keoua and his army moved southward, losing some of their group in a volcanic steam blast. This civil war, which ended in 1790, was the last Hawaiian military campaign to be fought with traditional weapons. In future battles Kamehameha adopted Western technology, a factor that probably accounted for much of his success.</p> <p>Because of Kamehameha's presence at Kealakekua Bay during the 1790s, many of the foreign trading ships stopped there. Thus he was able to amass large quantities of firearms to use in battle against other leaders. However, the new weapons were expensive and contributed to large increases in the cost of warfare. After almost a decade of fighting, Kamehameha had still not conquered all his enemies. So he heeded the advice of a seer on Kaua'i and erected a great new heiau at Pu'ukohola in Kawaihae for worship and for sacrifices to Kamehameha's war god Ku. Kamehameha hoped to thereby gain the spiritual power that would enable him to conquer the island. Some say that the rival chief Keoua was invited to Pu'ukohola to negotiate peace, but instead was killed and sacrificed on the heiau's altar. Others suggest that he was dispirited by the battles and was \"induced to surrender himself at Kawaihae\" before being killed. His death made Kamehameha ruler of the entire island of Hawai'i. Meanwhile, Kahekili decided to take the advantage while Kamehameha was preoccupied with Keoua and assembled an army — including a foreign gunner, trained dogs, and a special group of ferociously tattooed men known as <em>pahupu'u</em>. They raided villages and defiled graves along the coasts of Hawai'i until challenged by Kamehameha. The ensuing sea battle (Battle of the Red-Mouthed Gun) was indecisive, and Kahekili withdrew safely to O'ahu. Shortly thereafter, the English merchant William Brown, captain of the thirty-gun frigate <em>Butterworth</em>, discovered the harbor at Honolulu. Brown quickly made an agreement with Kahekili. The chief \"ceded\" the island of O'ahu (and perhaps Kaua'i) to Brown in return for military aid. Kamehameha also recognized the efficacy of foreign aid and sought assistance from Captain George Vancouver. Vancouver, a dedicated \"man of empire,\" convinced Kamehameha to cede the Island of Hawai'i to the British who would then help protect it.</p> <p>Kamehameha spent the next three years rebuilding the island's economy and learning warfare from visiting foreigners. Upon Kahekili's death in 1794, the island of O'ahu went to his son Kalanikupule. His half-brother Ka'eokulani ruled over Kaua'i, Maui, Lana'i, and Moloka'i. The two went to war, each seeking to control all the islands. After a series of battles on O'ahu and heavy bombardment from Brown's ships, Ka'eokulani and most of his men were killed. Encouraged by the victory over his enemies, Kalanikupule decided to acquire English ships and military hardware to aid in his attack on Kamehameha. Kalanikupule killed Brown and abducted the remainder of his crew, but the British seamen were able to regain control and unceremoniously shipped Kalanikupule and his followers ashore in canoes. Recognizing his enemy's vulnerability, Kamehameha used his strong army and his fleet of canoes and small ships to liberate Maui and Molaka'i from Kalanikupule's control.</p> <p>Kamehameha's next target was O'ahu. As he prepared for war, one of his former allies, a chief named Kaiana, turned on him and joined forces with Kalanikupule. Nevertheless, Kamehameha's warriors overran O'ahu, killing both rival chiefs. Kamehameha could now lay claim to the rich farmland and fishponds of O'ahu, which would help support his final assault on Kaua'i. By mid-1796, Kamehameha's English carpenters had built a forty-ton ship for him at Honolulu, and once again he equipped his warriors for battle and advanced on Kaua'i. However bad weather forced him to give up his plans for invasion. Meanwhile yet another challenger — Namakeha, Kaiana's brother — led a bloody revolt on Hawai'i, depopulating the area and forcing Kamehameha to return to Hawai'i to crush the uprising. Kamehameha used the next few years of peace to build a great armada of new war canoes and schooners armed with cannons; he also equipped his well-trained soldiers with muskets. He sailed this armada to Maui where he spent the next year in psychological warfare, sending threats to Ka'umu'ali'i, Kaua'i's ruler. This proved unsuccessful, so early in 1804 Kamehameha moved his fleet to O'ahu and prepared for combat. There his preparations for war were swiftly undone by an epidemic, perhaps cholera or typhoid fever, that killed many of his men. For several more years he remained at O'ahu, recovering from this defeat and, perhaps, pondering conquest of Kaua'i. Expecting an attack from Kamehameha, Ka'umu'ali'i sought the help of a Russian agent, Dr. Georg Schaffer, in building a fort at the mouth of the Waimea River and exchanged Kaua'i's sandalwood for guns. However, the anticipated battle never came because an American trader convinced Kamehameha to reach a compromise with Ka'umu'ali'i. Kamehameha was acknowledged as sovereign while Ka'umu'ali'i continued to rule Kaua'i, with his son as hostage in Honolulu.</p> <p>After nine years at O'ahu, Kamehameha made a lengthy tour of his kingdom and finally settled at Kailua-Kona, where he lived for the next seven years. His rise to power had been based on invasion, on the use of superior force, and upon political machinations. His successful conquests, fueled by \"compelling forces operating within Hawaiian society,\" were also influenced by foreign interests represented by men like Captain Vancouver.</p> <p>Kamehameha died in May of 1819. He had accomplished what no man in the history of the Hawaiian people had ever done. By uniting the Hawaiian Islands into a viable and recognized political entity, Kamehameha secured his people from a quickly changing world.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Robert Francis Kennedy was the seventh child in the closely knit and competitive family of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. He attended Milton Academy and, after wartime service in the Navy, received his degree in government from Harvard University in 1948. He earned his law degree from the University of Virginia Law School three years later. On June 17, 1950, Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skakel. Robert and Ethel Kennedy later had eleven children. In 1952, he made his political debut as manager of his older brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts. The following year, he served briefly on the staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Disturbed by McCarthy's controversial tactics, Kennedy resigned from the staff after six months.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1960 he was the tireless and effective manager of John's presidential campaign. After the election, he was appointed Attorney General in President Kennedy's Cabinet. While Attorney General he won respect for his diligent, effective and nonpartisan administration of the Department of Justice. Attorney General Kennedy became increasingly committed to the rights of African Americans to vote, receive an equal education, and use public accommodations. He was not only President Kennedy's Attorney General, he was also his closest advisor and confidant. As a result of this unique relationship, the Attorney General played a key role in several critical foreign policy decisions.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Soon after President Kennedy's death, Robert Kennedy resigned as Attorney General and, in 1964, ran successfully for the United States Senate from New York. Kennedy waged an effective statewide campaign and, aided by President Lyndon Johnson's landslide, won the November election by 719,000 votes. As Senator, Kennedy helped initiate programs that were part of a larger effort to address the needs of the dispossessed and powerless in America - the poor, the young, racial minorities and Native Americans. He sought to bring the facts about poverty to the conscience of the American people, journeying into urban ghettos, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta and migrant workers' camps. Kennedy was also committed to the advancement of human rights abroad, and was also absorbed during his Senate years by a quest to end the war in Vietnam.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">On March 18, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. In this campaign he challenged the complacent in American society and sought to bridge the great divides in American life - between the races, between the poor and the more affluent, between young and old, between order and dissent. He won critical primaries in Indiana and Nebraska and spoke to enthusiastic crowds across the nation.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Robert Francis Kennedy was shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California shortly after claiming victory in that state's crucial Democratic primary. He died in the early hours of June 6, 1968 at the age of 42.</p> <br /> <br />  ",

One day Little Heart approached the fort on horseback at full gallup. It's unclear what he wanted, whether to speak to the Indian Agent, or to demand the annuities. Whatever the reason, the sentries called on him to stop but he didn't understand them and kept coming. One of the sentries shot him in the head, killing him.<br /> <br /> The other Cheyenne decided that since the Army had killed him it was the Army’s responsibility to bury him. Although buried in the post cemetery, prejudices of the day prompted the Army to clearly mark his grave with a fence so there would be no mistaking his body with that of the soldiers and civilians.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Francis Gary Powers was born August 17, 1929, in Jenkins, Kentucky. His family eventually moved to Pound, Virginia.</p> <p>Upon graduating from Milligan College in June 1950, powers enlisted in the Air Force in October. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force in December 1952 after completing his advanced training. Powers was then assigned to Turner Air Force Base, Georgia, as an F-84 Thunderjet pilot.</p> <p>In January 1956 he was recruited by the CIA. His training was complete by August 1956 and his unit, the Second Weather Observational Squadron, was deployed to Turkey. By 1960, Powers was already a veteran of many covert aerial reconnaissance missions.<br />  </p> <h4>The U-2 Incident</h4> <p>Powers was discharged from the Air Force in 1956. He then joined the CIA's U-2 program; U-2 pilots flew espionage missions at altitudes above 70,000 feet, above the reach of Soviet air defenses. The U-2 was equipped with a state-of-the-art camera designed to take high-resolution photos from the edge of the stratosphere over hostile countries, including the Soviet Union. U-2 missions systematically photographed military installations and other important sites.</p>   <p>The 1960 U-2 incident occurred on 1 May 1960, during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, when a United States U-2 spy plane, flown by Central Intelligence Agency pilot Francis Gary Powers, was shot down while in Soviet airspace. The aircraft was performing photographic aerial reconnaissance when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile and crashed near Sverdlovsk. Powers parachuted safely and was captured.</p> <p>Initially the United States government tried to cover up the plane's purpose and mission, but was forced to admit its military nature when the Soviet government came forward with the captured pilot and remains of the U-2 including spying technology that had survived the crash as well as photos of military bases in the Soviet Union taken by the aircraft. Coming roughly two weeks before the scheduled opening of an east–west summit in Paris, the incident was a great embarrassment to the United States and prompted a marked deterioration in its relations with the Soviet Union. Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to three years of imprisonment plus seven years of hard labor but would be released two years later on 10 February 1962 during a prisoner exchange for Soviet officer Rudolf Abel.<br />  </p> <h4>Was Francis Gary Powers a POW?</h4> <p>At the time Powers was shot down, the United States was not engaged in armed conflict with the U.S.S.R, and pilot Powers was working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). But in 1998, newly released classified documents showed that his flight was a joint mission of the CIA and the U.S. Air Force. In 2000—forty years after his capture—the U.S. Armed Forces officially recognized Powers with the Prisoner of War Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the National Defense Service Medal. Sadly, Powers himself never saw his medals: He died in 1977 in an air crash while piloting a TV news helicopter in Los Angeles.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Gretchen Heefner is an associate professor of history at Northeastern University. She teaches and researches the history of the U.S. in the world, with a focus on the Cold War, militarization and the surprisingly intimate relations between national security regimes and the everyday. Professor Heefner teaches courses in 20th Century U.S. and world history, including courses on the Cold War, Dissent, Americans Abroad, and U.S. Conservatism. Her first book, <u>The Missile Next Door: The Minuteman in the American Heartland</u> (Harvard University Press, 2012), traces the deployment of nuclear missiles across the American heartland in the late 1950s and 1960s, focusing on the Minuteman missile field in South Dakota. The book argues for the importance of viewing both military and foreign policy history not as stand-alone subjects, but as crucial aspects of the social and political history of the United States.</p> <p>Dr Heefner was interviewed for the park film project in 2015. Below are excerpts from her interview.</p> <hr /> <h4>Can you speak a little bit about the South Dakota ranchers viewed the landscape and how they would have viewed the construction of the missile field in the early 1960s? </h4> <p>. . . as a historian I hate to generalize about people too much. But, from my research, in this particular moment when the missiles were deployed, to particularly the western South Dakota, and Montana, and North Dakota, and Wyoming, and in Missouri, um. In general, I would say it’s a group of people who had, really put down deep roots in this area, so it was a lot of families that had been there for generations, you know? Whose maybe grandparents had originally homesteaded the property that the family was living on. So, these were family ranches, and homesteads, where people had really deep connection to a particular place, and really, to a few hundred acres, right, um, and deep community ties. And so, you know I think in the 21st century it’s hard for us to remember that there was a time in the sort of mid-20th century when people still lived in agrarian communities, and had local towns, local sort of community centers, local American Legion halls, where they all knew each other, and they all got together for certain events. Where they celebrated with each other, and mourned with each other, and knew each other pretty intimately, and then also had these really strong family units that often had multiple generations living in the same house. And so, I think the attachment to the land is something that we really have to think about, when we think about how people responded to having weapons planted, and sort of buried in their midst.<br />  </p> <h4>How well did a missile field fit into the prairie landscape?</h4> <p>. . . the landscape of, what became the missile fields, was almost made for hiding missiles, right? It was very hidden, so you didn’t really notice uh the missiles, the minuteman missiles once they were buried there. It was, again I sort of described this as these sort of rolling hills and landscapes, sparse trees, sort of gnarled sparse trees when they existed, a lot of fences, you’ll see. There’s not a whole lot of, there’s not a whole lot to describe, [laughs], in a sense, when you go out there. So, people didn’t tend to notice sort of two acre plots of land, and missiles that were buried underground, so you wouldn’t even had seen them above the ground. So in a sense, it was the perfect place to hide nuclear weapons.<br /> <br /> . . . if you were to be driving by these missile fields, even today, it was particularly in the 1960s and the 1970s, you wouldn’t have noticed they were there. The only way you would have known, is if you had had the information that, certain people sort of published and started putting out there in the 70s and 80s, as they started looking at some of these sites and protesting them, um-. And they, a group of, a group called “Nuke Watch” actually started mapping these missile sites, and they gave people signs of what you would look for. And what you would look for, and this is what I had to do when I went out there, was triple phase power transformers, which don’t usually exist out in this part of the rural west. And if you’d see these sights, you’d know there was something going on. Because, there was a special site that needed this kind of power, right. You could look for these two acre plots of land, surrounded in a chain link fence, but again that fence wouldn’t look much different from fences you might see that ranchers would have, to store equipment or materials. So you can start to see sort of these, these small signs of what to look for. But most of these missile sites were not off of the interstate. They weren’t right off of main freeways, they were off of roads, and the Air Force did this quite purposefully. But, they really blended in, pretty remarkably, to the landscape and to the natural environment.<br />  </p> <h4>Can you speak to the philosophy of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and its legacy?</h4> <p>MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction, was this sort of preeminent American deterrent; a nuclear deterrent policy, particularly under the Eisenhower administration and Kennedy administration. The name switches on various occasions, but ultimately this is the policy: that you will amass enough nuclear weapons, or enough firepower, to deter your opponent from every doing anything stupid, from ever attacking.<br /> <br /> In a sense, right, this worked because there was never nuclear war. Neither side was ever going to attack each other. The United States and the Soviets never fought directly during the Cold War. The fought a lot of proxy wars with enormously devastating consequences for people around the world, but they never fought each other. A nuclear war did not happen. MAD, in a sense, worked the way it was supposed to. I think in the missile fields you see some of the consequences of that, but ultimately it worked.<br /> <br /> . . . there’s a cost to any system like this. I think you see . . . today you can drive around the missile fields and see some of these old sites, abandoned sites, you know, people lost property. They lost these homesteads they had grown up on. For some people, they lost a sense of security. Other people gained a sense of security. There are stories to be told in all of these sites. Just because MAD worked, doesn’t mean that we should ignore all of the stuff that went into making it happen.<br /> <br />  </p>",

            "bodyText": "Born a Russian peasant in 1894, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev would rise from the most austere circumstances to take a leading role in some of the most transformational events in modern history. Though he is often best remembered in the West for his eccentric and often profane outbursts, it was his innate political cunning that allowed him to rise to such lofty heights. <br /> <br /> In his youth, Nikita Khrushchev worked as a manual laborer, and only received a total of four years of formal schooling. After the start of the Russian Civil War, Khrushchev joined the Bolsheviks and served in the Red Army as a commissar in charge of political indoctrination. He worked his way into the inner circles of the Party, and was one of the few to survive Joseph Stalin’s bloody political purges. During World War II, a failed offensive at Kharkov proposed by Khrushchev nearly cost him his life, but he was instead sent to Stalingrad, where the historic Russian victory helped redeem his reputation.<br /> <br /> After the war, Khrushchev managed the Soviet reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine. When Stalin died suddenly in 1953, Khrushchev was among the few high ranking officials in a position to seize power. He did so in September, and quickly organized the execution of his political rivals. Denouncing Stalin’s reign as a “cult of personality,” Khrushchev worked to reform some of the draconian policies of Stalinism and liberalize Soviet domestic affairs and foreign relations. <br /> <br /> The death of Stalin and Khrushchev’s rise to political power roughly coincided with the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. The Eisenhower administration was staunchly anti-communist, however it was unwilling to intervene militarily when the Kremlin crushed a popular uprising in Hungary in 1956. Similarly, Khrushchev was unwilling to risk open warfare with the West, proposing that the Soviet Union and other noncommunist nations could “peacefully coexist.” In July 1959, US Vice President Richard Nixon visited Moscow where, at an exhibition of Western technology and consumer products, he engaged in the famous “kitchen debate” with the Soviet premier, defending the merits of American capitalism. After this exchange, it was decided on by both the Eisenhower administration and the Kremlin that Nikita Khrushchev would visit the United States. <br /> <br /> Khrushchev’s visit was unprecedented; he was the first Soviet dictator to visit the United States, and his arrival sparked a media circus. Traveling the country for eleven days, Khrushchev met with influential people, toured American farms and factories, but was enraged when he discovered that he was not allowed to visit Disneyland. Khrushchev’s visit culminated in a summit with President Eisenhower at Camp David, where negotiations were held on nuclear disarmament. At an impasse in the debate, President Eisenhower invited Khrushchev to visit his family farm, located just 18 miles from Camp David in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where the premier walked the historic grounds, saw Ike's cattle operation, and met the president’s grandchildren. <br /> <br /> Though the negotiations ended in stalemate, President Eisenhower was nonetheless invited to conduct a similar tour of the Soviet Union the following year. This visit never happened; in May of 1960, an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union, and its pilot captured alive, thus revealing the spying operation that the United States had been conducting. Relations between East and West soured. After sending Sputnik, the first satellite, into space, the Soviet Union had developed a ballistic missile program. In 1962, the world nearly plunged into nuclear war when some of these missiles were transported to Cuba, 90 miles off the American coastline. <br /> <br /> In part due to the collapse of relations between the Soviet Union and Communist China and the failure of his proposed agricultural reforms, Khrushchev was forced out of power in October of 1964, spending his remaining years as an outcast in Moscow and at his summer home.<br /> <br /> Though he faded into obscurity, Nikita Khrushchev’s legacy extends far past his own times. He fought his way up from the humblest of circumstances to the highest level of Soviet leadership by interminable guile and determination, only to be pushed out of the very party that he had helped to establish. He died in 1971, but the political reformations he led would set the stage for subsequent generations of Russian reformers as the age of the Soviet Union came to a close.",

Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm,and his decision is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies that could have resulted in large-scale nuclear war.<br /> <br /> The result of Petrov’s decision for humanity was that life as we know it went on unabated. The result of Petrov’s decision on his military career was quite different.  His decision had brought to light problems in the Soviet early warning system and embarrassed his superiors.  He was denied promotions, reassigned and took early retirement.  The story was not even known outside the secretive world of the Soviet military until the late 1990s.<br />  <br /> In May of 2007, while in the United States for the filming of a documentary, Mr. Petrov spent two days at Minuteman Missile National Historic Site, remarking that “he would never have imagined being able to visit one of the enemy’s securest sites.”  ",

As a college student he enrolled in the university’s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program and was the highest-ranking officer, cadet colonel, during his senior year. He was designated a distinguished military graduate and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Air Force when he graduated. Reed began active duty with the Air Force in November 1956, serving until 1959 as technical project officer for the Minuteman reentry vehicle system with the Air Force’s Ballistic Missile Division.<br /> <br /> In 1959 Reed was assigned to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California, where he engaged in thermonuclear weapons physics. When he was released from Air Force active duty in May 1961, he rejoined the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory as a civilian.<br /> <br /> Reed was also active in the political world. He was an organizer for Ronald Reagan's first campaign for governor of California in 1966. He helped finance Governor Reagan's first unsuccessful run for the presidency in 1968. Reed established a national network of political operatives and hired F. Clifton White, the noted political strategist, to guide the effort. Reagan lost to Richard Nixon. Reed managed Reagan's successful gubernatorial re-election campaign in 1970. In 1972, Reed performed as a national operative for the Nixon presidential re-election drive.<br /> <br /> Reed joined the Department of Defense as an assistant to the secretary and deputy secretary of defense in 1973, and was appointed director of Telecommunications and Command and Control Systems in February 1974. In 1976-77, Reed served as the 11th Secretary of the Air Force under Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>In 2016, Secretary Reed was interviewed for Minuteman Missile National Historic Site’s oral history collection. When discussing nuclear weapons development, he remembered witnessing a nuclear weapons test:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It isn’t a flash. It’s as though the sun has come to earth. You’re wearing all these dark glasses and you stand out there and it falls out of the airplane and there’s a count down and suddenly this bright orange. But it’s not a flash of white. It’s a psychedelic color that all the Haight Ashbury crowd would love because there’s these purple things going through it and oranges and reds and you think you wait for a minute or so for the shock wave to arrive and then you take the glasses off and the sun has come to earth. It doesn’t go away. The sun has come to the earth, and it is, the explosion is over, but it has heated all the sea water and all this air and everything else. So, it is a huge luminous cloud with these strange colors running through it that just stays there. But that is a huge amount of energy. And it starts getting warmer. You’re standing out there. You fire at dawn because you want to shoot when it’s dark so you can get the photography because the first microsecond of the explosion, you can see things happen and yet you want the airplanes to be able to fly through the cloud to collect the stuff so you shoot at dawn. So, we’re out there and we’re cold and its warming up. It gets warmer, and warmer, and warmer. You come to realize the amount of energy that’s been released is just amazing, and you stand there for maybe five minutes. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

Listed on some maps as Townsend Point (7,580’/2,310m), this peak is named in honor of Everett Townsend and his determination to preserve this place for all Texans, and all Americans, to enjoy. While many people participated in the decade-long struggle to create Big Bend National Park, Everett Ewing Townsend stands out for the level of dedication and tenacity he displayed in making a lifelong goal into a reality. He is remembered today as the \"Father\" of Big Bend National Park.</p> <p>Born in Colorado County, Texas on October 20, 1871, Townsend was raised into the nascent Texas cattle ranching industry. When Townsend was ten, he and his family moved to Wharton, Texas, and later Eagle Pass. At Eagle Pass, young Everett attended school until the age of thirteen, when his father's poor health made it necessary for him to support his family. In 1891 Townsend lied about his age and joined the Company E, Frontier Battalion of the Texas Rangers. Townsend became a Deputy U.S. Marshal in 1893 and one year later he came to the Big Bend area as a mounted inspector for U.S. Customs in Presidio County. It was in his role as customs inspector that Townsend experienced the beauty of the Big Bend firsthand.</p> <p>On August 31, 1894, Townsend ventured into the Chisos Mountains, which form the heart of the present-day national park, tracking mules stolen from a Mexican citizen. The panoramic view from the South Rim made a real impression on the young man—decades later he recalled that the sight made him \"see God as he had never seen Him before and so overpoweringly impressed him that he made note of its awesomeness…\" Inspired by the expansive vista he had seen, Townsend vowed to preserve the region in some fashion.</p> <p>From 1900 to 1918, Townsend managed the E. L. Ranch; in 1918 he was elected to serve as sheriff of Brewster County. Following three terms as sheriff of Brewster County, Townsend was elected to serve as state Representative in 1932. It was in this role, the next year, that Townsend would be given the chance to make his dream come true.</p> <p>In the spring of 1933, Townsend was approached by Representative Robert Wagstaff of Abilene, who had read of stunning beauty of the Big Bend, and was interested in establishing a park there. Townsend confirmed the description of the area, but demurred when Wagstaff attempted to list him as the author of the bill establishing a state park there. Townsend felt that a bill sponsored by a frontier representative would get lost. When the bill establishing Texas Canyons State Park in the Big Bend was passed in March 1933, Townsend was indeed credited as the co-author. Later that year he assisted in expanding the scope of the new park and renamed it Big Bend State Park.</p> <p>Townsend was instrumental in the establishment of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the Chisos Mountains. Following the establishment of the state park, the next step was to bring in a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp to develop the new park; this proved a difficult task. The US Army, responsible for overseeing operation of the CCC camps repeatedly objected to potential camp locations in the Big Bend due to lack or roads or sufficient water. In April of 1934, Townsend led a locally financed expedition of six men into the Chisos Mountains to locate water. All other desirable locations had not had sufficient water. Expressing his concern over the matter, Townsend told his group “Boys, we've got to have water and quick.” When a sufficient water supply was found, it was named “Agua Pronto [quick water],” in commemoration of the need. One month and two days later, a CCC camp was established in the Chisos Basin, to begin the work of developing the new park.</p> <p>Establishing the state park was only the beginning. Writing about the region to a U.S. Army officer, Townsend provided both a physical description of the area he wanted to preserve as well as a bold statement of his ultimate goal, \"I wish you would take a map of the State showing the counties, put your pencil point on the Rio Grande, just where the Brewster and Presidio County line hit that stream; then draw a line due East and at a distance of sixty miles it will again strike the River. My dream is to make the area South of this line into a park and I shall live to see it done.\"</p> <p>Townsend's tenacity in support of the national park idea seemed nearly limitless. He tirelessly promoted both the idea of a national park and international park status for the region, writing National Park Service officials, and politicians of two countries. When the Texas legislature allocated $1.5 million to acquire the land for the park in 1942, Everett Townsend's local expertise was utilized to appraise land values and arrange for the purchase of much of the private land needed to establish the park. In a ceremony handing the land deeds to the Department of the Interior in 1943, Townsend was the one individual singled out in recognition of his efforts to see his decades-old dream realized.</p> <p>Townsend would live to see his dream fulfilled; following the establishment of the National Park in 1944, he was appointed U. S. Commissioner for the park. Townsend died in 1948 at the age of seventy-seven. In 1954, on the tenth anniversary of the park’s establishment, Superintendent Lon Garrison presented the Townsend family with a posthumous honorary park ranger commission for the man remembered as \"the father of Big Bend National Park.\"</p> <p>Decades later, the second highest point in the Chisos Mountains is named Townsend Point in honor of Everett Townsend. Listed only on a few maps, Townsend Point is a fittingly quiet tribute to the young Texan who once stood on the South Rim and had the dream of preserving what he saw for the future.</p> <hr /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">To Learn More:</span> <ul> <li>Hilton, David Edmond. <u>The \"Father\" of Big Bend National Park</u>.

            "bodyText": "<p>Father Pierre Gibault has earned a place in history as the \"Patriot Priest\" for his great contributions to the American cause during the Revolutionary War in the West. He also ministered to the spiritual needs of his widely scattered parishioners on this wild and far-flung frontier for more than three decades.</p> <p>His early years are unknown, he was baptized April 7, 1737 in Montreal, Quebec. It is probable that he attended the Jesuit College at Quebec and perhaps briefly worked in the fur trade before being ordained into the priesthood at the age of 31. He immediately was sent to the Illinois country as the only active missionary priest serving an area which extended from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River and from the Great Lakes to New Orleans. Selecting Kaskaskia, near the Mississippi River, as his headquarters, Gibault traveled by foot, horseback, and canoe through much of this vast region to serve his scattered congregation. He also took an active part in the social life of Kaskaskia, including sports and games. According to one observer, he enjoyed proving his \"skill, agility and strength,\" physical traits that served him well in his strenuous life on the frontier.</p> <p>Kaskaskia of the 1770s was a British-controlled, but French-populated town. As such Father Gibault's parishioners became caught up in the war raging between Great Britain and its colonies.</p> <p>On July 4, 1778, American Col. George Rogers Clark and his frontiersmen surprised the Kaskaskians who initially were fearful of their fate. But the inhabitants of Kaskaskia and of Cahokia (approximately 50 miles north of Kaskaskia) soon joined the American cause. A major influence in their decision was Clark's assurance of religious and political freedom. In his Nov. 19, 1779 letter to his friend George Mason, Clark stated, \"... the scene of mourning and distress was turned to an excess of joy. . . (the residents began adorning the streets with flowers and pavilions with different colors, completing their happiness by singing, etc.</p> <p>Having obtained such great success with the French of the Mississippi River towns, Clark's thoughts turned toward the French-inhabited village of Vincennes along the Wabash River. \"Post Vincenes never being out of my mind and from some things that I had learnt (I) had some Reason to suspect that Mr Jebault (Gibault) the Priest was inclined to the American Interest previous to our arrival in the Cuntrey . . . (he had) great Influance over the people at this period St Vincent also being under his Jurisdiction (.) I made no doubt of his Integrity to us (.)\" Father Gibault volunteered to travel to Vincennes where he convinced the town's inhabitants to embrace the American cause. After remaining a few days in Vincennes, he returned to Kaskaskia to resume his priestly duties.</p> <p>After the Revolution, Father Gibault lived for a time in Vincennes. Later he moved across the Mississippi River to New Madrid in the present state of Missouri and continued his labors for his church and his God. He died at the age of 65 in 1802.</p> <p>During his lifetime, Father Gibault never received appropriate recognition for his crucial aid to George Rogers Clark and to the American cause in the West. In an effort to remedy this oversight, a bronze statue of Gibault by Albin Polasek was erected during the summer of 1935 on the park grounds in front of the Old Cathedral.</p>",

The Jordans were like many along the Maine coast in the 1800s; their lives were filled with hardship, sorrows, and severe setbacks mixed with happiness, laughter, and small successes. Such were the sketches of their lives before an influx of visitors and the era of Acadia National Park changed the face and future of Mount Desert Island.   </p> <h3>Meet the Jordans, circa 1837</h3> <p>George and John Jordan were brothers from a family of 15 children, living on the banks of the Union River in the early 1800s. Their childhood farm was nestled near the end of Beechland Road between what is now Trenton and Ellsworth, Maine. In the mid 1600s, Rev. Robert Jordan was called from England to serve communion to fishermen in the Falmouth (Portland) area. His great, great grandson, Nathaniel Jordan, came to the Union River area in the late 1700s.</p> <h3>Sawmill Business</h3> <p>George and John, child number eight and thirteen, bought and sold land in Hancock County as did their father. By 1839, they had purchased several plots of land. The 2,960-acre parcel on the southeastern side of Mount Desert Island extended from the low water mark at Seal Harbor, encompassing several mountains and a lake unnamed on maps of that era. In 1840, after the land purchase, they set up a logging camp along the newly charted \"pond,\" so named due to a statute dating from 1647<sup>1</sup>. A small mill used the lake's outflow as stimulus for most likely a water-wheel-powered reciprocating saw. A second mill, located further down Jordan stream, added to the output<sup>2</sup>. John and George cleared timber and got it to their mills using oxen and horses. Winter was the best time, as fishing slowed on the island and sleds carrying goods moved fairly easily through the snow. As masts, planks, posts, shingles, shakes and stakes came out of the mill, oxcarts, sleds and wagons carried the materials to the Seal Harbor shoreline, where the Jordans could get a fair price from buyers along the coastline and nearby islands. They finished building the house on the hill in 1847 (see right). There George, twice widowed, now recently married again, would raise a new family.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Historic photograph of a farmhouse\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|300|427|0|5|5\" height=\"427\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6656901|0|\" src=\"/acad/learn/historyculture/images/Original-Farmhouse-JP_Courtesy-NEHarborLibraryArchives.jpg\" style=\"margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;border-style:solid;\" title=\"Original farmhouse built by the Jordan brothers\" width=\"300\" /><br /> Image courtesy of Northeast Harbor Library Archives</p> <h3>Tragedy, War, and Debt</h3> <p>George and John plied their trade for twenty-five years before tragedy struck, In 1863, George died in a mill accident. Then in 1864, a fire ravaged the southern slopes of their timber lot with such ferocity that even the soil was burned sterile<sup>3</sup>. However, the lake’s sawmill, home and buildings were spared. John and Alden, George’s oldest son, tried to keep things afloat, but Alden was drafted in 1865 to serve in Maine’s Civil War regiment. Even though the war ended before he was deployed, illnesses and debts would force the sale of the property.</p> <h3>Legacy Continues</h3> <p>Mr. Melvin Tibbets of Exeter, Maine operated a small business there which offered modest meals, stables, and boat rentals. By the late 1880’s the land was in the hands of Charles How, a realtor from Boston who leased and eventually sold the house to Thomas McIntire and his wife. The McIntires opened a teahouse. Mr. How brought friends and associates there to enjoy the scenery and perhaps encourage their interest in some of his real estate. This was the beginning of the tradition for which the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/jordan-pond.htm\">Jordan Pond House</a> is famous today.   <br /> <br /> Thus this article ends where it began. Yet an interesting crumb of detail remains: although the restaurant and the pond are named for the brothers, George and John Jordan never knew a thing about popovers. </p> <h3>References</h3> <p>1. Wikipedia contributors.

            "bodyText": "<p>Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt was Theodore Roosevelt’s first wife and mother to their only child together, Alice Lee Roosevelt.<br /> <br /> Alice Hathaway Lee was a beautiful and dainty woman from a wealthy Bostonian family. She was known as “sunshine” to her friends and family due to her bright personality. She was tall, thin, and athletic, especially skilled in tennis and archery. She also played piano and was an avid boater.<br /> <br /> Alice met Theodore through her cousin, Richard Saltonstall, when she was seventeen. Both Theodore and Robert were attending Harvard at the time. Immediately after seeing her, Theodore fell in love and proceeded to court her. They were wed on his twenty second birthday, October 27, 1880.<br /> <br /> The newlyweds honeymooned at Theodore’s family’s estate in Oyster Bay, named Tranquility. That same year, Theodore purchased 155 acres of land near Tranquility to serve as the site for their future summer home. Yet, in the meantime, Theodore and Alice moved into the Roosevelt family’s New York City brownstone at 28 East 20<sup>th</sup> Street with Theodore’s mother, Martha \"Mittie\" Roosevelt, and oldest sister, Anna “Bamie” Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> During this time, Theodore started writing his first book <i>The Naval War of 1812</i>, attended but did not finish Columbia law school, and was elected as a New York state assemblyman. Before moving to Albany together in 1882, Alice and Theodore had toured Europe for five months in 1881.<br /> <br /> In 1883, Alice became pregnant and plans were drawn to construct the summer house in Oyster Bay for their expanding family. Theodore planned to name it the Leeholm, after Alice.<br /> <br /> On February 12, 1884, Alice gave birth to a daughter whom she named Alice. Theodore received a telegram announcing the healthy birth while he was serving in Albany. Yet, a second telegram was received a day later informing him that his wife Alice’s health was declining.  He was at her bedside when she died February 14, 1884 of Bright’s disease. On that day, he wrote in his journal a large X and underneath “the light has gone out of my life.”<br /> <br /> After her death, Theodore spent much of his time tending to his ranches in the Dakota Territory and left his new baby daughter and the construction of his Oyster Bay house in the capable hands of his oldest sister, Bamie.</p> <p>By the time Theodore moved into the Oyster Bay house in 1886, it was renamed Sagamore Hill and his daughter Alice was two years old.</p> <p><br /> Alice Lee Hathaway Roosevelt is buried in the Roosevelt family plot in Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Eugene Addison Renner was born in Louisville, Ohio, September 9, 1924 to Robert W. and Elva Z. Renner. At some point the family moved to Highland Park, Illinois. That town sits on the banks of Lake Michigan about halfway between the city of Chicago and the Navy’s Great Lakes training station. Eugene went as far as 10<sup>th</sup> grade and then enlisted in the Navy at the young age of 17, on January 16, 1942. He enlisted as an apprentice seaman (AS) and signed up for two years’ service; he wanted to “[l]earn a trade”. His father, Robert, signed his consent for his underage son to enlist.<sup>1</sup></p> <img alt=\"Eugene Addison Renner Signature\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|1273|186|0|4|4\" height=\"186\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6554559|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Renner-Signature.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:4px;margin-left:4px;margin-right:4px;border-style:solid;\" title=\"Eugene Addison Renner Signature\" width=\"1273\" /> <p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Eugene Addison Renner Personnel File, National Archives </em></p> <p>As Renner started his basic training the following month in U.S. Naval Training Station, Great Lakes, Illinois. By the end of February, he reported to duty in Washington, first in Bremerton and then in the Net Depot on Indian Island in Puget Sound. He served three months at the net depot, where huge metal nets were made to protect Navy harbors from submarines and torpedoes.<sup>2</sup> It was here that Renner picked up a detail as a messmate. This included working on the serving line, in the scullery, and cleaning up the mess (dining area). It was a lousy, hot duty with long hours and no appreciation. But Renner did earn an extra $5 a month. An apprentice seaman earned a base pay of $40 per month, so that was a significant bonus. In May Renner was promoted to seaman second class (S2c). In June he moved to San Francisco (ending his messmate detail and compensation). He was transported on the USS <em>Henderson </em>to Pearl Harbor, Territory Hawaii, and reported to his new ship, USS <em>Elliot </em>(DMS 4) on July 4, 1942.<sup>3</sup></p> <img alt=\"USS Elliot out at sea\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|740|620|0|4|4\" height=\"620\" href=\"http://www.navsource.org/archives/11/0904.htm\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6607367|0|\" src=\"/people/images/USS-Elliot-DMS4-1942-11090404.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:4px;margin-left:4px;margin-right:4px;border-style:solid;\" title=\"USS Elliot (DMS4) 1942 11090404\" width=\"740\" /> <p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>USS Elliot, October 29, 1942, U.S. Navy Photos</em></p> <p>S2c Renner served on the <em>Elliot </em>until September 18, 1943. The ship had three different forms, starting as a Wickes class destroyer and ended as Miscellaneous Auxiliary (Hull number AG 104) vessel used for training. But during Renner’s time on board, it was a fast-moving mine sweeper. The <em>Elliot</em> traversed the Pacific Ocean from the Hawaiian Islands to the Aleutian Islands. The crew performed a mixture of patrolling for submarines, escort duty and mine sweeping. As a part of task group 8.6 <em>Elliot </em>participated in the bombardment of Kiska on August 7, 1942. In May of 1943 <em>Elliot</em> swept for mines before and during the invasion of Attu.<sup>4</sup> The Aleutian Islands were a place where wind, fog and cold was just as deadly as the enemy.<sup>5</sup> Renner was promoted twice while serving on <em>Elliot</em> in order “to fill vacancy”: first to fireman 3rd class and then fireman 2nd class (F2c). Firemen were responsible for keeping the fires going that stoked the ship’s boilers and created the steam to turn turbines and propellers. The <em>Elliot </em>relocated to California and worked for about a year as a training vessel, using its speed and agility to tow targets. This duty most likely did not require a full complement of crew; in September F2c Renner left the ship and started preparing for his next assignment.</p> <p>September through December 1943 he spent training; attending classes in firefighting, gunnery, chemical warfare, and four weeks learning how to be a petty officer in E.P.O. School, on Treasure Island, California.<sup>6</sup> It is during this training period that he probably started to get to know some of his future shipmates.</p> <p>December 31, 1943 F2c Renner was received aboard USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD793), earning him the informal title of “plank owner”, meaning he was part of the original crew. Two weeks later (January 15, 1944) F2c Renner extended his enlistment. For the next year and a half, he shared the experiences of his shipmates as <em>Cassin Young</em> navigated the South Pacific: rescuing survivors from sinking ships, scooping up pilots who had been shot out of the sky, outrunning typhoons, shooting and dodging enemy planes, serving as escort, laying down smoke screens, and working radar picket stations. January 1945 was a big month for Renner: he was promoted to fireman 1st class (F1c), he started earning “longevity pay” (a financial acknowledgement of reaching three years of service in the Navy), and for a second time he took a detail as a messmate.</p> <p>Things took a turn for the worse during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa campaign</a> in the spring of 1945. <em>Cassin Young</em> was struck twice by kamikazes. While on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa, April 12, 1945, a kamikaze struck the mast of <em>Cassin Young</em> and exploded. Shrapnel rained down on the ship, killing one sailor and wounding 59 more. On July 30, 1945, USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was struck by a kamikaze a second time. This time the plane crashed through the main deck and into the forward fireroom, causing a significant explosion. F1c Renner was one of 22 sailors killed. He was burned severely by the steam from the ships exploded boiler, and later that day aboard USS <em>Cascade </em>(AD-16) he died of shock. He was 20 years old.</p> <p>His parents were sent the telegram every military family lives in fear of receiving. Robert wrote to the Navy asking questions, appearing to not believe the telegram informing him of his son’s death.</p> <blockquote>… Will you kindly advise at your earliest convenience what happened? How he was wounded and if he is dead or seriously wounded? Also as to his Burial if he dead, and if conscious before dieing. If he was fanceed [sic] still living but seriously wounded I hope he will recover. Any other information will be greatly appreciated.<sup>7</sup></blockquote> <p>F1c Renner was survived by his parents and two siblings. After the war his remains were reinterned in Olivewood Cemetery in Riverside, California. The Purple Heart and World War II Victory Medal that F1c Eugene Addison Renner earned were sent to his parent.<sup>8</sup></p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Eugene Addison Renner, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>For a short video on about the Net Depot see <a href=\"https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/local/2018/04/09/metal-nets-and-homesteaders-all-part-indian-islands-history/489832002/\">www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/local/2018/04/09/metal-nets-and-homesteaders-all-part-indian-islands-history/489832002/</a></li> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Eugene Addison Renner, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Naval History and Heritage Command web page, <a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/e/elliot.html\">https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/e/elliot.html</a></li> <li>To learn more about the Aleutian campaign during World War II see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/index.htm\">Battle for the Aleutians</a>.</li> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Eugene Addison Renner, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li><em>Ibid.</em></li> <li><em>Ibid.</em></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Horace Bertram Wimer Watertender 1st Class 2/26/13 (32)</p> <p>Horace Wimer was born in Grafton, West Virginia on February 23, 1913. In the 1930s, his family moved to Pittsburgh, where he enlisted at the naval recruitment station on January 4, 1942. Four days later, Wimer reported to the naval receiving station at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he underwent training for several months.</p> <p>Having served as a ship's fireman in the Merchant Marine prior to World War II, Wimer was assigned to serve aboard the fleet minelayer USS <em>Terror</em> (CM-5) as Watertender. Following the ship’s commissioning on July 15, 1942, the crew underwent training and then joined the North African invasion fleet as part of Operation Torch. Upon the USS <em>Terror</em>’s return to the United States in December, the vessel was overhauled and subsequently homeported in Yorktown, Virginia. During this time, Wimer lived in Richmond, Virginia with his wife, Beatrice, and stepdaughter Pearl.</p> <p>The year 1943 brought many changes to Wimer’s life. In the late summer, he was transferred from the USS <em>Terror</em> to study at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Lab, part of the Naval Training School in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. He also attended the Naval Training School at Norfolk, Virginia for duty in the Destroyer Training Program. In November, Wimer headed off to the West Coast, where he served on the naval receiving ship in San Francisco before being transferred to the naval receiving station at Terminal Island in San Pedro, California. On December 31, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) was commissioned and Wimer stepped aboard to serve as Watertender in the forward fireroom.</p> <p>After several months of training in Hawaiian waters, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> participated in numerous naval actions in the Central and Southwest Pacific, including the Battle of Cape Engano and the Liberation of the Philippines. By March 1945, the ship was part of the fleet engaged in the capture of both Iwo Jima and Okinawa as the United States Navy and its Allies moved closer to the Japanese Home Islands. In desperation, the Japanese military launched several mass kamikaze attacks on the Allied fleet surrounding Okinawa.</p> <p>One of the most devastating attacks occurred April 12, 1945, when a Japanese aircraft exploded above the ship, killing one sailor and injuring 59. After steam lines ruptured in the ship’s forward boiler room, Wimer sprang into action to minimize the damage. For his heroic actions, he received a personal commendation letter signed by Admiral Chester Nimitz. The letter, which makes clear the extent of Wimer’s bravery, reads in part:</p> <blockquote>“After a plane and its bomb hit the foremast and exploded in the air above the forward fireroom holing the stacks, uptakes, and decks and piercing many pipes and electrical leads, he remained at his post in the fireroom as it filled with steam and gasses and assisted in securing the boilers and cutting off damaged lines and equipment and then assisted other personnel to safety before he himself left the fireroom. His courage and devotion to duty were at all times in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.”</blockquote> <p>Okinawa was declared secure on June 22, 1945, but the Pacific fleet remained under threat of airborne attacks. The USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was one of several destroyers and other smaller combatants that served as radar pickets and an outer ring of defense for the fleet’s capital ships. On July 30, 1945, a kamikaze plane carrying a one-hundred pound bomb managed to evade a curtain of anti-aircraft fire and struck the ship. The plane exploded on the deck directly above Wimer’s station in the forward fireroom, killing him and seven other sailors in the compartment. In total, 22 crew lost their lives in this attack and another 45 were wounded.</p> <p>On August 9, 1945, Captain John Ailes, the ship's commanding officer, sent a handwritten letter to Wimer's widow, Beatrice. He wrote:</p> <blockquote>“We, who were his shipmates, grieve with you at his loss. We all consider ourselves better men for having known him and served with him... He was well-liked and admired by all. He truly served his country with distinction.” Wimer was posthumously issued the Navy Unit Commendation Medal and Purple Heart with Bronze Star. His final resting place is in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.\"</blockquote> <hr />",

            "bodyText": "<p>Jasper Clarence McCartney was born on February 10, 1910 in the landlocked town of Mangham, Louisiana. He would go on to spend much of his life at sea, in service to the U.S. Navy.</p> <p>Jasper enlisted on December 16, 1930 and a little over six months later he was a member of the crew of the battleship USS <em>West Virginia</em> (BB-48), on which he served until November 30, 1936. McCartney first worked in one of the ship’s firerooms as a fireman and later earned the rating of watertender.</p> <p>His next assignment, aboard the destroyer USS <em>Peary</em> (DD-226), lasted from May 1937 to November 1939. McCartney then immediately moved to another destroyer, the USS <em>Rogers</em> (DD-254), where he assisted with the ship’s reactivation and overhaul until she was transferred to the Royal Navy on June 30, 1940.</p> <p>On November 16, 1940, McCartney boarded the battleship USS <em>Arkansas</em> (BB-33) on which he would serve until March 1943, leaving with a promotion to chief watertender. On August 2, he entered the Naval Training School at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and graduated from the Naval Boiler and Turbine Lab on November 8. Three days later he was assigned to USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) to assist in readying the ship for her commissioning on December 31, 1943. He would serve as the chief watertender in the ships forward fireroom.</p> <p>After several weeks of at sea training, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> departed Pearl Harbor to participate in raids on several Japanese held islands in the Pacific between April 29 and May 1, 1944. The ship then moved on to the Mariana's Islands and assisted in the capture of Saipan, Guam and Tinian between June 11 and August 10, 1944. Shortly after, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> took part in the offensive off the Western Caroline Islands and in the capture and occupation of the Southern Palau Islands.</p> <p>With these missions successfully completed, the ship moved with the fleet towards the Philippine Sea in preparation of the liberation of the Philippine Islands. The ship would see heavy action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, fighting against Japanese forces off Cape Engano as American forces invaded Leyte in October 1944. A month later, on November 26, McCartney reenlisted for the fourth time, aboard ship. For the remainder of 1944 and into the New Year, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> proceeded to strike at enemy positions throughout the East China and Philippine Seas.</p> <p>On February 19 and March 16, 1945, the <em>Cassin Young</em> would participate in operations supporting the Iwo Jima campaign.</p> <p>From April 1 through June 22, the ship took part in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa Campaign</a> providing escort, shore bombardment or serving as radar picket. It was off Okinawa on April 12, that a kamikaze plane struck the ships mast and exploded above the main deck, killing one sailor and injuring 45. The explosion ruptured pipes in the forward fireroom releasing steam, smoke, oil and water into that compartment. McCartney directed the securing and abandonment of the fireroom, and would be the last crew member to leave. Shortly after, while the ship was still under attack, he reentered the steam and smoke-filled fireroom to free a stuck valve, during which he suffered first and second degree burns on his face and arms. He would be awarded the Silver Star* and Purple Heart for his unselfish act of heroism.</p> <p>Before dawn on July 30, 1945, while the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was serving as radar picket off Okinawa, a Japanese kamikaze flew into the ship’s starboard side. The aircraft and the bomb it carried exploded directly above the forward fireroom where McCartney was standing watch. He suffered third degree burns over his entire body and was killed instantly.</p> <p>The tragic news of his death was relayed by telegram to McCartney's parents, then living in Olla, Louisiana, and his wife, Selma, and their two sons, Leonard and Leland, in Bellflower, California on August 4. On August 9, 1945, Captain John Ailes, commander of the USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, sent McCartney's widow a letter in which he wrote: “He was one of the real leaders on board.

            "bodyText": "<p>John James Takacs was born November 11<sup>th</sup>; his Navy file says 1923 and his headstone says 1924. There certainly were young men who lied about their age to enlist in the military in every generation. (An action for which the Navy could and would dismiss you.) But there was no need for John to lie about his age. Starting in November of 1942 you could be drafted if you were between the ages of 18 and 37.<sup>1</sup> John enlisted on April 12, 1943, so if he was born in 1924 he would have been 18 years old. The one-year difference possibly was due to clerical error or simply bad handwriting.</p> <p>John was one of six children (three boys and three girls) of Stephen and Elizabeth Takacs, who immigrated from Hungary. John grew up in a Bridgeport, Connecticut. There were a few families of the same name living nearby, indicating a tight extended family community. He had cousins living just down the street. His two brothers served in the Army, both were stationed at the short-lived Stuttgart Army Air Field in Arkansas: Ernest was a corporal, Steven was a sergeant.<sup>2</sup></p> <figure class=\"-auto-width\"><img alt=\"Black and white news clipping with title \" armed=\"\" brothers=\"\" height=\"631\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6556207|0|\" in=\"\" services.=\"\" src=\"/bost/learn/historyculture/images/JJ-Takacs-with-Brothers-2.jpg\" three=\"\" width=\"960\" /> <figcaption>John Takacs (right) and his two brothers Ernest (left) and Stephen (Center) all entered the armed forces during World War II.<br /> Bridgeport <em>Post</em> October 15, 1944</figcaption> </figure> <p>John graduated from high school and attended trade school for five months. He worked as a machinist at the Central Machine Works, operating lathes and other machines for about two and a half years. He earned $60 a week.<sup>3</sup> So enlisting as an apprentice seaman (AS) would be a significant drop in pay, down to $50 per month.</p> <p>AS John J. Takacs attended basic training at the US Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island, between April 19 and July 6, 1943. Upon graduating he became a fireman 3rd class (F3c); skipping over seaman completely must have been an acknowledgement of his mechanical skills. Firemen don’t put out fires, instead they work on ships boilers and engines; it was a term carried over from the age of steam, when the person who ran the boilers had to keep a fire going.</p> <p>In July, 1943 F3c Takacs came to Boston, Massachusetts, where he attended the Navy Training School at the Wentworth Institute. There were a handful of schools in the Boston area that worked with Navy to share information and to educate Navy personnel. The program at Wentworth Institute was designed to train machinist mates. He completed the 16-week course 24<sup>th</sup> in his class of 228. He earned excellent grades including a 95 in both Drawing and Power Plant. Completion of the course promoted him to fireman 2<sup>nd</sup> class (machinist’s mate). He then attended a week of training on the maintenance of steam generating equipment at Consolidated Edison in New York City, and then returned to Wentworth for another month of instruction.</p> <p>In mid-December he arrived in California and on December 31, 1943, he joined the crew of USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-973),<sup>4</sup> becoming an original member of the crew, or in Navy jargon, a \"plank owner.\" While serving on <em>Cassin Young</em> Takacs would share many experiences with his shipmates: seven campaigns, outrunning typhoons, rescuing sailors from sinking ships, and pilots after being shot out of the sky. Destroyers are built for speed and agility, so they were often assigned to escort slower ships, or to transfer people and mail around the fleet. Personally, Takacs continued to train and became a water tender 3rd class in May, 1944, and was appointed water tender 2nd Class (trainee) (WT2c (T)) the following November.</p> <p>The most dangerous duty <em>Cassin Young</em> performed was serving on picket duty. Destroyers would be stationed to surround the fleet or an island the way a picket fence surrounds a yard. The ship’s radar would scan the air, while the sonar scanned below the ocean surface. Ships on picket duty would relay any pertinent information back to the fleet. Ideally fighter planes would then launch from aircraft carriers and airfields within the protected fleet area to engage the enemy.</p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa campaign</a> the most dangerous picket stations were 1, 2 and 3, which lay between Okinawa and the main islands of Japan. By that point in the war the Japanese were using kamikaze tactics, sending planes heavily loaded with explosives to crash into allied ships. On April 12, 1945, in the late morning, while <em>Cassin Young</em> was assigned to picket station 1, three planes were detected and fought off. A few hours later another four planes attacked. One plane, carrying a large bomb, struck the radar mast and exploded. The fragmented plane rained down onto the main deck. One sailor was killed and 59 were wounded. WT2c(T) John Takacs was wounded in his left leg. He was given treatment and returned to duty.</p> <p><em>Cassin Young</em> was hit by a second kamikaze on July 30, 1945. The second hit was much more severe. The old wooden plane crashed through the main deck behind the forward smokestack causing a massive explosion in the fire room below. Forty-five sailors were wounded and 22 were killed. WT2c(T) John Takacs was one of them. After the war ended, John’s body was brought home for burial in St. Michael’s Cemetery, in Bridgeport, Connecticut</p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>FDR Timeline, <a href=\"https://www.fdrlibrary.org/timeline\">https://www.fdrlibrary.org/timeline</a>.

By 1940 (Census) Joseph was a blender in a local distillery and had moved to Yocum Street in Ellwood Park, about five miles from the central city. He enlisted in the Navy on September 23, 1942 as an Apprentice Seaman (AS). At the time, he and his wife Eva were living in Colwyn, Pennsylvania. Barnes trained in Newport, Rhode Island, and then at the Service School, Great Lakes, Illinois, where he studied to be a machinist. He earned good grades in Machine Tools (92%) and Mechanical Drawing (86%). He graduated as a fireman 2nd class.</p> <p>From April 15 to September 9, 1943 Fireman Barnes served on the USS <em>California</em> (BB-44), while the ship was being repaired in Puget Sound Navy Yard. <em>California</em> had been greatly damaged during the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. Barnes contributed his mechanical skills to repairing and modernizing the ship.</p> <p>After a short trip home, Barnes reported for destroyer training in San Francisco, November 1943. He became a plank owner on USS <em>Cassin Young </em>(DD-793) December 31, 1943 (meaning he was part of the original crew). With the crew of <em>Cassin Young</em> Barnes crossed the equator on April 23, 1943. He traveled through much of the South Pacific. His ship supported the Marianas Operation (Saipan, Guam and Tinian Islands), Philippine Liberation and the Iwo Jima landing by providing picket duty, screening and rescuing pilots and sailors from the ocean. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa Campaign</a>, <em>Cassin Young</em> was damaged by a kamikaze April 12, 1945; one shipmate was killed and 59 were wounded.</p> <p>All the while, Barnes was working his way up the ranks; June 1, 1945 he was promoted to machinist mate 3rd class (training) (MM3c (T)). After a second, and more severe, kamikaze hit on July 30, 1945, MM3c(T) Joseph Barnes was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>His wife, mother and sister were all sent telegrams informing them that Joseph was missing. In December, Mrs. Eva Barnes was sent a letter explaining a little more. It reads in part:</p> <blockquote>“Information has now been received in this Bureau that your husband lost his life on 30 July 1945 while serving aboard USS <em>Cassin Young</em>. Early in the morning of that date, the <em>Cassin Young</em>, while acting as a screening ship outside the entrance to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, was attacked by one or two enemy suicide planes. At 3:25 a.m., one plane succeeded in eluding the ship’s anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the right side, at the main deck level, causing extensive damage. Your husband was observed coming down the ladder from the searchlight platform, a few seconds before the suicide plane struck. The ship’s structure in the vicinity of the ladder was subjected to extreme blast damage, and your husband’s Commanding Officer considers chances of survival under those conditions highly improbable. A thorough search of the area was conducted until daylight of 30 July 1945 and a life jacket was found in a condition which indicated it had been blown overboard, but no trace of your husband could be found.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote> <p>MM3c(T) Joseph Barnes is commemorated on the list of those Missing in Action in the National Cemetery in Honolulu, Hawaii. Among personal effects sent back to the states, which consisted of mostly his uniform and a pipe, were found three pieces of shrapnel. Perhaps they were from the April 12 kamikaze hit.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>One of the more heart-breaking stories involving the consequences of the attack was that Joseph’s brother Albert George Barnes, who enlisted in the Navy three weeks after Pearl Harbor, was hoping to meet up with him at Okinawa. In early June, machinist mate Albert had come aboard the USS <em>Vestal</em>, the same ship that Commander Cassin Young saved at Pearl Harbor. <em>Vestal</em> was moored at Buckner Bay after having repaired destroyers in the area for weeks. The reunion, of course, never happened.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Joseph James Barnes, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li><em>Ibid.</em></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>On November 17, 1942, Robert Dean Moore and his mom, Vera Little, signed an “Age Certificate” swearing it was Robert’s 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, and he was old enough to enlist in the Navy. Robert was six feet tall, and had the bulk to support this claim, though he added 17 months to his age.</p> <p>Apprentice Seaman Moore attended 16 weeks of Basic Torpedo School, in San Diego, California. His strongest grade was in English. He followed that up with an additional 12 weeks of Advanced Torpedo School in Keyport, Washington. This certified him for the Mark 8, 13, 14 and 15 torpedoes. USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) carried ten Mark 15 torpedoes, so that training was useful. He worked his way up the ranks through seaman to torpedoman’s mate 3rd class (trainee) (TM3c(T)).</p> <p>Moore reported to USS <em>Cassin Young</em> December 31, 1943, making him a plank owner. On the way to the South Pacific he crossed the equator April 23, 1944. That is a long way from Enid, Oklahoma, Robert’s hometown!<sup>1</sup></p> <p>As part of the <em>Cassin Young</em> crew, Robert endured typhoon like seas, experienced several campaigns including the massive Battle of Leyte Gulf, rescued sailors from the USS <em>Princeton</em> (CVL-23) and USS <em>Birmingham</em> (CL-62), as well as pilots who had been shot down.</p> <p>In the spring of 1945, <em>Cassin Young</em>, alongside other destroyers, served on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa. They formed a line of defense surrounding larger slower ships and used their radar and sonar to provide early warning in the event of enemy attack. On April 12, 1945 the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was hit by a kamikaze 50 miles north of Okinawa, destroying the conning tower mast. TM3c(T) Moore was killed by shrapnel, and 59 shipmates were wounded.</p> <p>The <em>USS</em> Cassin Young <em>War Diary</em> logged the action:</p> <blockquote>A fourth Val was taken under fire at 1344 at 5000 yards, position angle 20 as he dove at the ship in a low angle dive on the starboard beam. The rudder was thrown hard right and the plane crashed into and carried away the port yardarm and upper section of the foremast with SG, SC, and numerous radio antennae and exploded mid air 50 feet from the ship. A broken salt water line short circuited the main board cutting out all power to the main battery director. A ruptured stream line and loss of ventilation in the forward fireroom and engine room necessitated their evacuation.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>Shipmate Ralph Sam Rhoads recorded the attack in his own words:</p> <blockquote>Lady Luck kinda walked out on us today. This afternoon we were attacked by [Japanese] planes and they were out to get us. One hit our mast and exploded, two more dived on us but missed by a few ft. […] There were about 17 cans hit but only one sunk. We got about 110 of the [Japanese] planes, our ships and fighters combined. The <em>Cassin Young</em> got six today before they temporarily put us out of commission. The number is 13 all-together. We were the 13th can to get hit on the day before Friday the 13th.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>April 12 was the same day that President Franklin Roosevelt died in Warm Springs, Georgia. A mere teenager, Robert was known by good friends as “Donald Duck,” for he was able to mimic the new Walt Disney animated star.</p> <p>Vera Little was sent Robert’s Purple Heart. She asked the Navy if she could wear her son’s Purple Heart. The Navy denied her request.<sup>4</sup> (In 1947 a new pin combing the purple heart and gold star was designed for family members to wear.)</p> <p>TM3c(T) Robert Dean Moore was buried in the American Military Cemetery on Zamami Shima, Ryuko Rhetto, an island off Okinawa. In 1949 he was reinterred in Golden Gate National Cemetery in California. He is in Section O, Site 1212. His military headstone has two “errors.” It includes his pretend date of birth and marks “Alaska” as his state because his mother was working there in 1949.</p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Robert Dean Moore, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li><em>USS</em> Cassin Young <em>(DD-793) War Diary</em>.

Houston has been called “The Man who Killed Jim Crow” for his work in helping to end segregation.<br /> <br /> While obtaining his law degree from Harvard School of Law, Houston became the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review. In 1929, Houston became the dean of Howard University Law School, and a mentor to so many civil rights attorneys, including Oliver Hill and Thurgood Marshall, both of whom worked on Brown v. Board of Education. Houston was responsible for making Howard University the facility to train civil rights lawyers.<br /> <br /> In the 1930’s, Houston became the first special counsel for the NAACP. At this time, Houston and Marshall traveled through the rural south together to gather evidence to demonstrate unfair conditions that faced African Americans. With a handheld camera, they documented walls crumbling down, and other unsafe, unsanitary, and unfair educational conditions. Houston developed a strategy to start with the law schools and higher education, and integrate schools from the top down. He was approached by Gardner Bishop to help a group of students in Washington, D.C., obtain an equal educational experience. Houston became ill before Bolling v. Sharpe was filed. This case, along with four others, would come to the U.S. Supreme Court at the same time and become known as Brown v. Board of Education. While Houston was not directly involved with the Brown decision, he did help to lay the groundwork for the landmark decision and worked on many civil rights cases before his death in 1950.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Born to a prominent slave-holding Richmond family with Northern roots, Elizabeth Van Lew attended a Quaker school in Philadelphia, where she developed a strong attachment to the antislavery cause. Unlike other Southern Unionists, Van Lew did not get swept up in the initial tide of Confederate patriotism following Virginia's secession in April 1861. She joined with other Richmond Unionists to create an underground network to hinder the Confederate war effort and give aid and comfort to captured Union soldiers. The infamous Libby Prison, which held scores of Union officers in deplorable conditions, was located only blocks from Van Lew's home.<br /> <br /> As the war ground on her aid mission to Union prisoners evolved into a full-fledged intelligence gathering operation. From Union prisoners Van Lew gathered information on Confederate troop strength and movements, which she passed on via couriers to Gen. Grant and his intelligence officer, Col. George H. Sharpe. Both officers later acknowledged both the quantity and quality of the information she provided to them. Van Lew also successfully operated a spy ring, which included clerks in the Confederate War and Navy Departments.<br /> <br /> Four years after the war ended, President Grant appointed Van Lew postmaster of Richmond, a position she held until 1877. She was largely ostracized by Richmond society for her beliefs, including her involvement in Republican politics, women's suffrage and African American rights. In her remaining years Van Lew relied on the largesse of her friends; she had spent the bulk of her inheritance on caring for her family's former slaves and her espionage activities during the war. Dying penniless, the cost of her funeral was paid by the family of a Union officer she assisted. For her work on behalf of the Union army Van Lew was inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Thurgood Marshall led a life in the pursuit of equality, and was on a path destined to lead him to the U.S. Supreme Court.  As chief council for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), he helped to lay the groundwork that led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision.  As a U.S. Supreme Court justice he devoted his life to obtaining equal rights for all.   <br /> <br /> When Marshall enrolled at Howard University Law School in Washington D.C., his life forever changed.  This is where he met Charles Hamilton Houston, the assistant dean of the law school and his mentor.  Students were being groomed in civil rights law, and many would go on to be leaders in the field.  As a top student, Marshall was able to work in the law library, giving him an opportunity to do more research, and to work personally with Houston.  This would not be the last time that Marshall would work with and learn from Charles Hamilton Houston.  <br /> <br /> In 1949, Marshall, as a representative of the NAACP, met with black residents of Clarendon County, South Carolina, and determined that if enough plaintiffs could be found, they would use this as a test case for ending segregation in schools.  While it would have been easy to say that the schools were not equal, this was one of the first cases that used the NAACP’s new strategy to attack the segregation itself.  By using social sciences, they were going to demonstrate that segregation had a detrimental effect on the students.  Separate facilities cannot be equal.  Marhsall once said “Equal means getting the same thing, at the same time and in the same place.”  This is what Marshall was hoping to achieve.  In the courtroom, he took the offensive, and had a sense of control while arguing the Briggs case.  On May 17, 1954 the unamimous U.S. Supreme Court decision was read that ended legal segregation in public schools. <br /> <br /> Although Marshall gained fame through the Brown decision, his career was far from over.  On October 2, 1967, Thurgood Marshall climbed the stairs to the highest court in our country, put on the majestic black robe, and walked into the court room to become the first African-American justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. During his 23 years on the court, he continued to speak for the rights of every American by looking at constitutional rights for all citizens.",

Her father, J.B. Bottineau, was a lawyer who worked as an advocate for the Ojibwa/Chippewa Nation in Minnesota and North Dakota. While a teenager, her family lived in Minneapolis, and Marie attended school there as well as in nearby St. Paul. She spent some time across the border at St. John’s Ladies College in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Canada), and returned to Minneapolis to work as a clerk in her father’s law office. She and her father moved to Washington, DC in the early 1890s to defend the treaty rights of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Nation. There, they became part of an established community of professional Native Americans who lived and worked in the capital. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Marie as a clerk in the Office of Indian Affairs (OIA), an agency within the Department of the Interior.[1, 2] She was hired at $900 per year, and received a raise to $1,000 before she had served a full year in the position. While this pay was low compared to what other clerks were making ($1,000 to $1,800 per year), she was the agency’s highest paid Indigenous woman. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Early in her career, Marie believed that Native Americans needed to assimilate into European-American society to survive. Over time, as she became involved with the suffrage movement and the Society for American Indians (SAI), her views began to change. Instead of assimilation, Marie emphasized the value of traditional Native cultures while asserting her own (and therefore others’) place in the modern world as an Indian woman.<br /> <br /> This shift is evident in a ca. 1911 photo of Marie. Taken for her government personnel file, she chose to wear Native dress and to braid her hair. This was a radical act as a federal employee working for the OIA. At the time, was pushing for Native Americans to assimilate into white American culture-- and using Indian employees as examples of assimilation. And yet, her choice went unremarked at the time -- except by journalists, who often paired her federal service photo with one of her dressed in “</span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2014697069/\">modern American dress</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">.” <br /> <br /> In 1911, Marie’s father died. His death proved a turning point in her life. That year, she gave a speech at the first meeting of the Society of American Indians, and became increasingly involved in their work to celebrate and advocate for Native identity. She became nationally known as a spokesperson for modern Indian women, testifying in front of Congress, meeting with women from across the country, and was a member of the contingent who met with President Woodrow Wilson in the </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whho/index.htm\">Oval Office</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"> in 1914. While at the SAI, she was colleagues with </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zitkala-sa.htm\">Zitkala-Sa</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">, another Native American woman who worked towards Indian suffrage.<br /> <br /> In 1912, at the age of 49, she enrolled at the Washington College of Law. Two years later, after taking night classes while still working, she graduated as an attorney.

            "bodyText": "<p>Billy Joe Boegen was a tall, blue-eyed Texan, with an infectious smile, who served on USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) during World War II.</p> <p>Billy Joe was just a kid when he enlisted in the Navy as an Apprentice Seaman (AS) on October 27, 1941. (Notice this was six weeks before Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese on December 7.) After his training in San Diego, California, Billy Joe’s early assignments in Pearl Harbor included the flying boat squadron, Air Battle Force, and a detailed as a Messmate; where his outgoing personality was an asset.</p> <p>Long before he joined USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, Boegen saw a lot of intense action. AS Billy Joe Boegen was stationed on USS <em>Yorktown</em> (VC-5) during the battles of the Coral Sea (May 4-8, 1942) and Midway Island (June 4-7, 1942) where his ship was sunk. Shortly after, Billy Joe was promoted to Seaman first class (S1c). He spent nine months on USS <em>West Virginia</em> (BB-48). February 23, 1943, he was received on USS <em>Salt Lake City</em> (CA-25). As part of task Group 16.6 <em>Salt Lake City</em>, Boegen served with distinction during the surface engagement off the Komandorski Islands (March 26, 1943). This earned praise from Admiral Nimitz: \"At two to one odds you have delayed the enemy mission and inflicted telling damage. Well done. Your courageous action approved in every respect. Nimitz\".<sup>1</sup> <em>Salt Lake City</em> received damaged from three Japanese cruisers.</p> <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt is credited with saying “a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.” And Boegen had his share of rough seas. It came out during judicial actions that he misinformed the Navy about his age; Billy Joe was actually 16 years old when he enlisted. The Navy did not take kindly to this fib and considered discharging him. But looking at his long, arduous and distinguished record, he was sentenced to confinement and reduced in rank instead.</p> <p>On January 17, 1945, AS Boegen reported aboard USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) for the first time. He was a part of the 40 mm gun crew. When <em>Cassin Young</em> was strafed by enemy planes and hit by a kamikaze on April 12, 1945, Billy Joe took multiple gunshot wounds, earning a Purple Heart, which he received while recovering. He was also awarded a Silver Star</p> <blockquote>… for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Director Operator for a forty millimeter mount on board the Destroyer U.S.S. CASSIN YOUNG (DD-793), during operations against the enemy in the vicinity of Okinawa on 12 April 1945. After he had assisted in the control of guns which destroyed two planes, his ship was struck by another plane, seriously wounding him and damaging his [gun] director. Despite his injuries, he courageously remained at his station and aided in directing the gun battery in shooting down another plane attacking his ship. His courage and disregard for personal safety were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>The second time <em>Cassin Young</em> was struck by a kamikaze, July 30, 1945, Billy Joe did not fare so well. He received multiple wounds from shrapnel in his legs and a severe head wound. The following day he died aboard USS <em>Hamul</em> (AD-20). He had served in the Navy for almost four years; he was 20 years old when he died, not yet old enough to vote.</p> <p>Originally buried among shipmates in an American Military Cemetery on Zamami Shima, Ryuku Retto, Billy Joe was moved to Grove Hill Memorial Park in Dallas, Texas. His mother, who lived to be 99, had a beautiful headstone for Billy Joe and baby brother Robert, who only lived 39 days. Billy Joe’s half includes the inscription, “He Died That Others Might Live.”</p> <p>Shipmate James O’Hara wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Nobody enjoyed a good time on the beach (ashore) [more] than Billy Joe. In his lighter moments, he would often call me \"O’Harry.\" When he would use that phrase, or name, I knew we would have a lot of fun. His usual expression was \"O Harry, let’s stay on the Sunny Side of the Street.\" Translation – let’s avoid trouble. Billy Joe was the perfect liberty partner.</p> <p>1. He was very good looking. He had a head full of black, curly hair and always wore a smile. A Big Texan Smile.</p> <p>2. He always made me think of what a Texan would look like. Tall, about 6' 2\" or so, broad shoulders and narrow waist. Very friendly with those around him. Particularly girls.</p> <p>He always seemed to have a knack for knowing were the interesting places to were located.<sup>3</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>More than 50 years after his death, during a reunion in Boston, Massachusetts, his shipmates remembered the skills, the antics and the smile of Billy Joe Boegen.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Billy Joe Boegen, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Military Times Hall of Valor <a href=\"https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/307338\">https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/307338</a></li> <li>Letter from James O’Hara to Debbie Christie Rogers, dated November 24, 1999.

            "bodyText": "<p>Byron Smith was born into a large family in Holcomb, Missouri, on May 17, 1925. The Depression was hard on large rural families and the Smiths moved several times. Byron attended formal school through only the fifth grade.</p> <p>At age 18, Byron Smith was living in Grand Haven, Michigan. He worked at the Campbell, Wyant and Cannon Foundry Co. as a coremaker, earning $40 per week.<sup>1</sup> The company expanded and diversified production during the war, making crankshafts for submarines, tank treads and tracks, and brake drums for B-29 bombers.<sup>2</sup> This work would have been critical to war production, so the chances of Byron getting drafted were thought to be low.</p> <p>He married Winifred Ruth Sheehy July 24, 1943. A month later he voluntarily enlisted in the US Navy as an apprentice seaman (AS), signing up to serve for two years. Apprentice seamen had a base pay of $50 per month, so this was a significant cut in pay for AS Byron Smith. He chose to have about half of his pay deducted and sent to his wife in Springfield, Michigan.</p> <p>From September 3 to November 13, 1943, AS Smith attended the Farragut Navy Training Station in Idaho, the Navy’s only land locked training station. Upon completing his training, Smith was promoted to seaman second class (S2c). He was then sent to California for a little more training: two days of firefighting, three weeks Deck Petty Officer School, and six days of gunnery.</p> <p>On December 31, 1943, S2c Smith was received aboard on USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793), making him an original member of the crew, commonly known as a plank owner. He spent the next year and a half on <em>Cassin Young</em>, sharing boredom, laughter and danger with his shipmates as they served in the South Pacific. On March 1, 1945, Smith was promoted to seaman 1st class (S1c), and on March 18, 1945 he crossed the equator for the first time earning the coveted status of a “trusty shellback.” Despite stamping Smith’s induction papers “Illiterate,” the Navy invested in him with training, multiple promotions, and responsibility.</p> <p>The crew of <em>Cassin Young</em> used the ship’s radar and sonar to protect the fleet while on picket duty. The ship’s agility and speed were used to rescue sailors and pilots from the ocean, deliver mail, and occasionally outrun a typhoon. They laid a smoke screen to mask maneuvers of landing attack vessels. The <em>Cassin Young</em> crew experienced many campaigns: Western Caroline Islands Operations, Leyte Gulf Operation, Luzon Operation, Iwo Jima, Marianas Operation, and the Philippines Liberation. It was during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-from-the-sky-uss-cassin-young-and-the-okinawa-campaign.htm\">Okinawa campaign</a> that the ship was hit on two occasions by kamikaze attacks. On April 12, 1945, the first hit killed one shipmate and injured 59 others. On July 30, the second hit wounded 45 and killed 22 crew members, including S1c Smith. He was 20 years old. He was buried with his shipmates on Okinawa. Commander John Ailes described the scene to Byron’s wife Winifred in a letter:</p> <blockquote>I did have the opportunity to visit the cemetery where your husband is interred and would like to give you some of the details. The cemetery is a Naval Cemetery on the Island of Okinawa located just above the Hagushi beaches where our troops first landed on Easter Sunday. It is a lovely spot overlooking the ocean and surrounded by low rolling hills. The graves are neatly marked and are well taken care of. I am enclosing a picture of the cemetery to show you what it is like.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Byron’s older brother Woodrow Alex Smith also served in the Navy in the Pacific theater (died 1992). Byron Smith’s final resting place is in the National Cemetery in Honolulu, Hawaii. Among Smith’s personal effects were letters from home, and stamps yet to be used.<sup>4</sup><br />  </p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Byron “A” Smith, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Paula Holmes-Greely, “Forging Ahead” (Michigan Live Webpage: mlive.com/chronicle/2008).</li> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Byron “A” Smith, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li><em>Ibid.</em></li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Alfred Harral Hopkins was an American architect, an \"estate architect\" who specialized in country houses and especially in model farms in an invented \"vernacular\" style suited to the American elite. He was a member of the American Institute of Architects.</p> <p>Hopkins was born in Saratoga Springs, New York. His parents were Alfred Hopkins (1836-1884), a captain in the United States Navy, and Mary Elizabeth Penfield (1837-1898). They soon moved to Ohio where his parents gave birth to his brother Walter (b. 1879). Hopkins married Adelaide Spenlove (1894-1865) on June 30, 1915 in London, England. Following their marriage, Hopkins and his bride settled in New York City and had two sons—Alfred Spenlove Hopkins (1916-1995) and Peter Harrel Theodore Hopkins (1918-2004).</p> <p>Hopkins studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris followed by several years in Rome completing his knowledge architecture, presumably in the early 1890s. By 1898, he returned to New York City and was practicing as an architect.</p> <p>Early in his career, Hopkins specialized in the design of farming complexes for the American capitalist during the Gilded Age. By 1900, he was designing a new farm group for Frederick W. Vanderbilt in Hyde Park, New York in association with Edward Burnett (1849-1925), an agricultural specialist who earlier developed and managed the farming operations for other members of the Vanderbilt family. Hopkins and Burnett maintained an office at 11 East 24th Street in New York City. Together they designed some of the country's most extraordinary farms, including Foxhollow, the Tracy Dows estate in Rhinebeck, New York, and a farm for Harry J. Fisher in Greenwich, Connecticut. Their collaboration, though not firmly documented during this time, probably resulted in several other farm projects associated with Hopkins in New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Their work, particularly Hopkins’ architectural style, established the standard for farm architecture and influenced an entire generation of architects.</p> <p>Hopkins severed his association with Burnett in 1913 and established himself as Alfred Hopkins & Associates, located in the Architects Building at 101 Park Avenue in New York City. Hopkins continued specializing in gentlemen's farms, quickly establishing himself as the \"dean of farm group architecture,\" due in no small part to the success of his <i>Modern Farm Buildings</i>, first published in 1913 (dedicated to Edward Burnett) and two subsequent editions (with the Burnett dedication omitted). Hopkins farm groups appeared in Westchester County, New York, the Hudson River Valley, northern New Jersey, and Illinois. He designed no fewer than fifteen farm groups on Long Island, including the farm at Laurelton Hall for Louis Comfort Tiffany. An article on farm groupings published in <i>Architectural Record</i> in 1915 notes that Hopkins was often called upon to design the farm groups on estates where the residences were the work of other architects, such as McKim, Mead & White, Bertram Goodhue, John Russell Pope and Charles A. Platt.</p> <p>Hopkins was among the contributors to <i>Stables and Farm Buildings: A Special Number of the Architectural Review</i> produced by the staff of <i>Architectural Review</i> in 1902. His <i>Modern Farm Buildings</i> served to publicize his practical and picturesque esthetic, and in common with all architects' publications since the sixteenth century, to attract clients. Hopkins' book went into a third edition.</p> <p>Hopkins laid out his farm buildings around paved courts or grassed paddocks, keeping rooflines and eaves low to blend with the landscape, and carefully separating the necessary farming functions. He preferred to remove hay storage from its traditional loft over the stables to eliminate dust infiltration and ammonia pollution. Open-sided sheds housed farm vehicles. The spatial routes of cows and horses were kept separate. Farmhands' quarters were integrated with the buildings. An outstanding late survival of Hopkins' Cotswolds-inspired vernacular manner is the stable court at Hartwood, near Pittsburgh (1929). The same year he published a brochure distributed among architects, <i>Two Cotswolds Villages</i>, describing the vernacular architecture and stone-tiled roofs of two picturesque English villages: Bibury, Gloucestershire and Castle Combe, Wiltshire.</p> <p>Hopkins is less known for his <i>Prisons and Prison Building</i> (New York: Architectural Book Publishing 1930), where rational planning met other ends, in a progressive and humane program based on the classification of prisoners and their segregation by groups in small units; proposals that argued against walled prisons and for the uplifting effect of good architecture. His practical experience was founded on his work at Westchester County Penitentiary, Berks County Prison, and his proposed designs for a federal prison to be built at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, completed in 1934.</p> <p>Hopkins was also among the architects who published plans for inexpensive carpenter-built housing in <i>Carpentry and Building</i> and his small book <i>Planning for sunshine and fresh air: Being sundry discourses & excursions in the pleasant art of building homes, set forth in a manner and upon a theory ... how best to effect their proper economies</i> (1931).He also published <i>The Fundamentals of Good Bank Building</i> (1929).</p> <p>After an interim following his death, an architectural firm was founded in 1954 by six associates from his office, as La Pierre, Litchfield & Partners.</p>",

In 1866 the Lane family moved to a modest Victorian house on a farm near Charles City, Iowa.[1] Carrie Lane graduated from the Charles City High School in 1877 and immediately enrolled in the Iowa State College in Ames.[2] Her father, who was reluctant to have his daughter attend college, contributed only part of her expenses. To cover the rest of her expenses, Catt worked as a dishwasher, in the school library, and as a rural school teacher. Catt's activist personality was evident in college. While there, she started an all girls' debate club and advocated for women's participation in military drills. She graduated on November 10, 1880 with a Bachelor of Science degree -- the only woman in her graduating class.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <h4>Early Career and Activism</h4> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">After graduation, Catt worked as a law clerk and a teacher. In 1885, she was hired as superintendent of schools in Mason City, Iowa, the first woman to hold that position in the district. That year, she married Leo Chapman, a newspaper editor, and moved with him to San Francisco. He died in August 1886 of typhoid fever. Carrie moved back to Charles City, Iowa in 1887 and became involved in the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association.<br /> <br /> In 1890, she married fellow Iowa State alum, George Catt. A wealthy engineer, he and Carrie agreed that she would spend at least four months each year on women’s suffrage efforts. From 1890 to 1892, she held office in the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association, and became involved in the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), under its president, Susan B. Anthony. She spoke at the NAWSA convention in Washington, DC in 1890, and in 1892, addressed Congress on the proposed woman's suffrage amendment, at the invitation of Susan B. Anthony.<br /> <br /> In 1900, Catt succeeded Anthony as president of NAWSA, serving until 1904 when she resigned to care for her ailing husband. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/anna-howard-shaw.htm\">Rev.

Anthony in 1906, Catt again became involved in women’s suffrage and was re-elected president of NAWSA in 1915. She created the “Winning Plan,” a campaign to encourage each state to give women the right to vote and to urge Congress to pass an amendment to this effect.

Early in her career, Catt espoused nativist beliefs. In 1894, for example, she warned that the United States was \"menaced with great danger...in the votes posessed by the males in the slums of the cities and the ignorant foreign vote.\" Her solution was to \"cut off the vote of the slums and give [it] to woman.\"[3] Like other white suffragists, Catt was frustrated by what she saw as hypocrisy: \"ignorant\" men allowed to vote while educated women could not.<br /> <br /> Over time, Catt and other white suffrage leaders became experts in making their case for suffrage to the various groups of men they needed to win over. In 1917, Catt edited a manual for suffrage workers with details about arguments against suffrage and advice on how to refute them. In it, she noted that Southern white supremacists often opposed the federal suffrage amendment by arguing that it would enfranchise Black women and thus threaten white supremacy. Catt pointed out that in most Southern states, there were more white women than Black women; and that in those states with a larger Black population, Jim Crow voting restrictions would apply to women as well as men. She wrote that \"white supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by woman suffrage.\"[4] While Catt herself was not a champion of white supremacy, she and many other white suffragists still used this argument to persuade white Southerners whose goal was to uphold it.</span></span></span></span></span><br />  </p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">At other times, Catt made inclusive statements about voting rights. For example, that same year she contributed an article to <em>The Crisis, </em>the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). \"</span></span></span></span></span>Just as the world war is no white man's war, but every man's war, so is the struggle for woman suffrage no white woman's struggle, but every woman's struggle,\" she wrote. \"Everybody counts in applying democracy. And there will never be a true democracy until every law-abiding adult in it, without regard to race, sex, color or creed has his or her own inalienable and unpurchaseable voice in government.\"[5]</p> <h4>Later Career and Life</h4> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">In 1919, just after the 19th Amendment began its long ratification process, Catt bought </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/juniper-ledge-the-carrie-chapman-catt-house.htm\"><span style=\"color:null;\">Juniper Ledge</span></a><span style=\"color:null;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"> in New Castle, New York. The rural home was, in Catt's description, a place to rest her \"tired nerves.\" While living in this home with her partner of 20 years, Mary \"Mollie\" Garrett Hay (an active New York State suffragist), Catt began working on an idea for an organization called the League of Women Voters. She was also active in promoting the 19th Amendment; in the fall of 1919, she toured 13 states advocating for its ratification. In May of 1920, the amendment was passed by Congress and a cablegram from President Wilson congratulating her read, “Glory Hallelujah!”<br /> <br /> After the passage of the 19th Amendment, Catt continued her work. From 1920-1922, Catt worked for suffrage in Europe and South America. In 1923 she started the organization called the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. She met Mussolini in Rome and made a strong, challenging suffrage speech directly to him. In the mid-1920s, Catt returned to her pre-war interest in peace, and in 1925 she founded the Committee for the Cause and Cure of War.<br /> <br /> In 1928, Catt sold Juniper Ledge and she and her partner, Mary Garrett Hay (a New York State suffragist) moved to a colonial revival house in New Rochelle, New York. Hay died shortly after the move. From her New Rochelle home, Catt continued her activism with the help of her live-in assistant and companion, Alda Wilson. In 1933, Catt organized the Protest Committee of Non-Jewish Women Against the Persecution of Jews in Germany, which sent a 9,000-signature petition to Hitler condemning violence and restrictive laws against German Jews. Catt and the organization also pressured the federal government to ease immigration laws to make it easier for Jews to find refuge in the United States.[6] For her work, she was the first woman to receive the American Hebrew Medal.<br /> <br /> Catt died of a heart attack in her home on March 8, 1947. She was buried, at her request, in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, beside Mary Hay, who had been her partner for decades.[7] </span></span></span></span></span><br />  </p> <h4><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><strong>Notes</strong></span></span></span></span></h4> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">[1] The Carrie Chapman Catt Childhood Home (officially known as the Lucius and Maria Clinton Lane House and also as the Carrie Lane Chapman Family Home) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 25, 1998.<br /> <br /> [2] The Farm House (Knapp-Wilson House) is the oldest building on the campus of Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.

            "bodyText": "<p>Queen Alliquippa was a prominent leader of the Seneca nation, likely born circa 1679. She enters the historical record when British and French colonists start writing about their journeys in the Ohio River Valley. By this time, she was considered to be “old” and was said to reign “with great authority.”  She and her people inhabited villages located around the Forks of the Ohio (present day Pittsburgh, PA), and interacted favorably with several major British leaders during her lifetime.  <br /> <br /> Alliquippa was a strong British ally. During George Washington’s return to Virginia after his unsuccessful expedition in 1753 to diplomatically urge the French out of the Ohio River Valley, he met with the queen. He recorded, “I went up about 3 miles to the Mouth of Yaughyaughgane to visit Queen Aliquippa, who had express’d great Concern that we pass’d her in going to the [French] Fort.  I made her a Present of a Match Coat; & a Bottle of rum, which was thought much the best Present of the two.”  <br /> <br /> In April 1754, after the fall of the British Fort Trent at the Forks of the Ohio and the establishment of the French Fort Duquesne in its place, Alliquippa and her people moved. <br /> <br /> Alliquippa and Washington’s paths crossed again in 1754. In early June, Washington was visited by a number of his American Indian allies. Alliquippa had brought her entire village to the Great Meadows. The warriors were asked to stay and help fight the French, but all the American Indians left before the July 3 Battle of Fort Necessity. After the British defeat, Alliquippa and her people moved to a trading post, Augswick, in central Pennsylvania. She died sometime before December 23, 1754. <br />  <br /> Queen Alliquippa was one of a few strong allies on the side of the British in the early stages of the French and Indian War. She exhibited powerful female leadership and exercised her authority in interactions with prominent male European leaders, including William Penn and George Washington. <br /> <br /> Author: Catarina Hurtado<br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> Sipe, C.

            "bodyText": "<p>Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville came from a military family with six sons. He began as a cadet in the colonial regulars and rose to the rank of second ensign. He gained military experience in conflicts against opposing European powers and American Indian nations.<br /> <br /> In the mid-eighteenth century, relations were tense between France and Britain in the Ohio River Valley territory. In 1753, the French had built two forts, Fort Presque Isle and Fort LeBoeuf.  Attempts by the British to compel the French to retire in 1753, and to build a British fort at the Forks of the Ohio in the winter of 1754, were both unsuccessful. That spring, the French seized the British fort and established Fort Duquesne in its place. <br /> <br /> In April and May of 1754, young George Washington was leading a group of Virginia soldiers to support the British presence at the Forks of the Ohio, cutting a road along their way. Meanwhile, on May 23rd, 1754, Jumonville and thirty-three men had left Fort Duquesne with a mission to discover the British forces trespassing on French territory, to send an informant back to the French, and then to present the offending British with an official summons. While Washington and his men were encamped at the Great Meadows, he was informed that a hostile French force was approaching. These rumored aggressors were none other than Jumonville and his men. <br /> <br /> Washington responded by leading a group of forty men to meet their American Indian allies near the site of the French encampment. This miserable six-mile trek took most of the night of May 27th. By the morning of May 28th, Washington’s party was able to join with their American Indian allies to devise and execute a plan to surround the unsuspecting French. The skirmish at Jumonville Glen ensued, with the exchange of gunfire lasting only fifteen minutes. At the end of the encounter, thirteen French soldiers and one British soldier were dead. Additionally, the British had gained twenty-one French prisoners. Importantly, among the French dead was Jumonville himself. <br /> <br /> Accounts of the skirmish at Jumonville Glen vary greatly, with both the British and the French putting their sides’ view onto their accounts. However, reports from both sides agree on how Jumonville died. Jumonville was wounded during the skirmish.  Then, when the fighting ceased, one of Washington’s allies, the Seneca leader named the Half-King killed the French ensign with a tomahawk to the skull. According to the account of a British deserter, the Half-King approached Jumonville and said “Thou are not yet dead, my father” before striking with his weapon.  A soldier with Washington testified that the Half-King “took out [Jumonville’s] Brains and washed his Hands with them and then scalped him.”  The Half-King himself verified his role in the murder, calling it an act of revenge for the French having “killed, boiled, and eaten his father.”  <br /> <br /> Despite uncertainty about the true sequence of events in this highly political skirmish, the French considered the death of Jumonville to be an assassination of their envoy and an affront to their diplomatic mission. The encounter constituted the opening shots of the French and Indian War and according to historian Horace Walpole “set the world on fire.”  Five weeks later, Jumonville’s older brother, Louis Coulon de Villiers, avenged his death on July 3rd, 1754 in the Battle of Fort Necessity.<br /> <br /> Author:Catarina Hurtado<br /> <strong>Sources:</strong> <br /> Alberts, Robert C.

            "bodyText": "Adella Hunt Logan was born free in Sparta, Georgia in 1863 to Maria Hunt, a black and Creek Native American, and a white planter. She attended Atlanta University in 1879 and received a master’s degree from there in 1905. In 1883 Adella became the second woman to join the faculty of Tuskegee University, then known as Tuskegee Normal School for Teachers, when she accepted Booker T. Washington’s invitation to come to the Institute and teach English and Social Sciences. She would later become Tuskegee Institute’s first librarian. In 1888 Adella married Warren Logan, Tuskegee Institute’s treasurer and a close friend of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/btwash.htm\">Booker T. Washington</a>.<br /> <br /> In 1895 Adella became a founding member of Tuskegee Women’s Club (TWC), which was formed by female faculty and the wives of male faculty at Tuskegee. TWC held bi-weekly mothers’ meetings and worked on social issues such as temperance, prison reform, and women’s suffrage. In July 1895 TWC would unite with 35 clubs in twelve states to create the National Federation of Afro-American Women, with Margaret Murray Washington serving as president. In 1895 the National Federation of Afro-American Women would unite with the League to become the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC). Their motto was “Lifting As We Climb.”<br /> <br /> For several years Adella served as head of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-american-women-and-the-nineteenth-amendment.htm\">NACWC’s suffrage department</a>, and in Tuskegee she led monthly discussions on the women’s suffrage movement and amassed a large library of reading materials about suffrage. During the early 1900s Adella lectured widely at regional and national conventions on suffrage issues and in 1901 she became Alabama’s first and only life member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Under the moniker A.H.L. and L.H.A. she wrote articles about NACWC activities for the NAWSA newspaper, <i>The Woman’s Journal</i>. For a number of years, <i>The Woman’s Journal</i> had only seven subscribers in Alabama, three of whom were associated with Tuskegee Institute.<br /> <br /> Adella also wrote several articles on the topic of suffrage. Her two most well-known articles were “Women Suffrage,” which was first published in <i>The Colored American Magazine</i> in 1905; and “Colored Women as Voters,” which Adella wrote in September 1912 as part of a group of essays titled “A Woman’s Suffrage Symposium” for <i>Crisis Magazine</i>. In 1912 Adella organized a women’s suffrage march through Tuskegee Institute. For the march she wrote a poem set to the tune of “Coming Through The Rye” entitled, “Just As Well As He”.<br /> <br /> Like many African American suffragists of her time, Adella supported universal suffrage and firmly believed that gaining the right to vote would help end the racist, discriminatory, and violent practices that were often inflicted on African Americans. At the top of many African American suffragists lists was police violence and sexual exploitation. “If white American women,” she wrote in <i>The Colored American Magazine</i>, “with all their natural and acquired advantages need the ballot, that right protective of all other rights, if Anglo-Saxons have been helped by it - and they have - how much more do black Americans, male and female, need the strong defense of a vote to secure their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?”  In her article entitled “Colored Women as Voters” Adella wrote, “They [African Americans] know too, that officers, as a rule, recognize few obligations to voteless citizens.”<br /> <br /> On December 12,1915 Adella Hunt Logan passed away in Tuskegee, Alabama at the age of 52. She did not get the chance to see her daughters vote, as she often times expressed great hope and interest in seeing. Five years after her death, on August 18, 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Subsequently, as a result of the higher turnout of African American women than white women to register and cast votes, many cities and towns passed laws that kept African Americans, both male and female, from voting. In 1960, forty-five years after the passing of Adella, Charles G. Gomillion, a Tuskegee Institute professor, sued the city of Tuskegee after the city changed the electoral map to exclude Tuskegee Institute and the majority of African American citizens in the city. The case reached the Supreme Court and served as a precedent for other cases that sought to challenge political and electoral systems that diluted voting and deprived citizens of their right to elect a candidate. Fifty years after Adella’s passing and forty-five years after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. African Americans could now cast their ballots in towns and cities where they had once been denied this right. Adella’s dream of the United States having a “government of the people, for the people, and by the people - even including the colored people” - was finally a reality.<br /> <br /> <strong>Just As Well As He</strong><br /> Lyrics by Adella Hunt Logan<br /> To the tune of “Catcher in the Rye”<br /> <br /> If a body pays the taxes,<br /> Surely you'll agree<<br /> That a body earns the franchise<br /> Whether he or she...<br /> <br /> Every man now has the ballot;<br /> None you know have we,<br /> But we have brains and we can use them<br /> Just as well as he.<br /> <br /> If a home that has a father<br /> Needs a mother too,<br /> Then every state has men voters<br /> Needs its women too. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Alfred Brunson Wallace was born in Gulfport, Mississippi. He had one brother, Thomas, who was also a Naval officer. Alfred graduated from high school and completed one year at Georgetown University. He was granted enrollment in the Naval Academy as a midshipman in June, 1935. Aside from normal duties and studies, he was a boxer and played football. He was nicknamed “Mike” by his fellow midshipmen and graduated with the class of 1939. Now Ensign Wallace, he reported to the USS <em>Tennessee</em> (BB-43) June 24, 1939, and was detached May 27, 1940.</p> <p>In August, 1940, Ensign Wallace was off to Washington to join the USS <em>Charles F. Hughes</em> (DD-428). This would be the first of five destroyers on which Wallace would serve. Fitting out was underway in the Navy Yard of Puget Sound, Washington. The ship was commissioned September 5, 1940, making Wallace a plank owner (Navy jargon for a member of the original crew).<sup>1</sup> The first thing <em>Charles F. Hughes</em> did was travel through the Panama Canal and conduct training exercises in the Caribbean. Then the destroyer reported for convoy duty in the Atlantic, with a home port in Newport, Rhode Island. Once the United States joined the Allies to fight in World War II, troop transports were added to the convoys. On two occasions the crew picked up survivors from sunken ships; including Red Cross nurses.<sup>2</sup> During the two years Wallace served on <em>Charles F. Hughes,</em> he earned much experience and three promotions. On June 1, 1941, he married Jeanne Mary Gifford, of Portland, Maine.</p> <p>Lieutenant (T) Wallace reported November 30, 1942, to the USS <em>Hilary Herbert</em> (DD-160) as the Executive Officer. The ship was old (commissioned in 1919) but overhauled and updated in 1940. <em>Herbert</em> served as a convoy escort during the Battle of the Atlantic, protecting merchant ships from German submarines while they carried stores of war supplies to our allies in Britain. The range of escorts spanned from Key West to Halifax, Canada and as far north as Iceland.<sup>3</sup> The home port for <em>Hilary Herbert</em> was Boston, Massachusetts.<sup>4</sup> Wallace detached April 23, 1943, shortly after being commissioned as a regular lieutenant.</p> <p>In May of 1943, Lieutenant Wallace went to Orange, Texas, where the USS <em>Lucien Young</em> (DD-580) was being built by the Consolidated Steel Corporation. It was commissioned July 31, 1943, so again Wallace was a plank owner and again he was the Executive Officer. Charleston, South Carolina was the home for the <em>Lucien Young</em> until December 1943, when it became part of the Pacific Fleet. In March of 1944 Wallace detached from the ship, attended training and was promoted to lieutenant commander (temporary) (Lt. Cmdr (T)).</p> <p>In the fall, Lt. Commander Wallace reported to the USS <em>Gwin</em> (DD-772) which was being fitted out in Bethlehem Steel Co., in San Pedro, California. Again, he was a plank owner and the new ship’s Executive Officer. He would serve on the <em>Gwin</em> from September 30, 1944 to July 2, 1945. (After the war, his wife Jeanne would be sent the Navy Unit Commendation earned by USS <em>Gwin</em>.)<sup>5</sup> On Independence Day 1945 Lt. Comdr. (T) Alfred Wallace would start training to become a commanding officer of his own ship. In a letter of endorsement A. M. Townsend, Commander Mine Squadron Three, wrote:</p> <blockquote>…Lieutenant Commander A. B. Wallace has been under my close observation. His performance of duty as navigator and chief evaluator in the Combat Information Center has left nothing to be desired. He has been of unestimable value to me as Staff Navigator.<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Lieutenant Commander (T) Wallace reported aboard USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) July 27, 1945. He would shadow Commander John W. Ailes for a short period and then take over command of a ship for the first time. Three days later <em>Cassin Young</em> was stuck by a kamikaze. The ship was on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa when it was attacked by multiple planes. One plane crashed through the main deck just behind the forward smokestack causing the boilers in the forward fireroom below to explode. Wallace never got to take command of his own ship; he was killed by shrapnel fragments. In a coincidence made possible by wartime circumstances, his widow Jeanne was married post-war to his best friend from the Academy.</p> <p>In 1949 Lt. Cmdr. Wallace was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Gulfport, Mississippi, in the plot where his parents would later be interred. In 1994 his brother Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Lyon Wallace was buried in Biloxi National Cemetery about 10 miles east.</p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Alfred Brunson Wallace, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>\"Haze Gray and Underway,\" accessed July 2020, <a href=\"http://hazegray.org/\">hazegray.org</a>, and <em>The Tin Can Sailor</em> (July 1997)</li> <li>Naval History and Heritage Command, (February 2016)</li> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Alfred Brunson Wallace, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Ibid.</li> <li>Ibid.</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "Anna “Bamie” Roosevelt Cowles was born on January 18, 1855. She was the oldest child of Theodore and Martha “Mittie” Bulloch Roosevelt, and sister to Theodore Roosevelt.<br /> <br /> Anna went by many names including “Bamie” (short for bambina) given to her by her mother, and Bye which she was called by her siblings and many nieces and nephews. As a young woman, Anna dutifully helped her parents entertain and was a role model for her family, even though she was only four years older than her closest sibling Theodore. She was classified as an adult in her siblings’ eyes and in his childhood diary Theodore wrote, “when I put ‘big people’ I mean Papa Mama and Bamie.” Anna suffered from a spine condition which limited her physically, but she had a quick wit and welcoming personality. In her youth, she attended Marie Souvestre’s school in France and then tutored her siblings in French. As an adult, she continued to entertain in the Roosevelt house and acted as a confidante for her siblings, especially for Theodore.<br /> <br /> Throughout her entire life, Anna provided support to her family. Beginning in 1878, when her father died, she took on many of his roles. She traveled with her mother and entertained in their house. She also wrote letters to her siblings advising them when they faced hardships.<br /> <br /> In 1884, when Theodore’s first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee passed away, Anna managed his Sagamore Hill estate and raised his baby daughter Alice while he tended to his ranch in the Dakota Territory. Anna oversaw the construction of Sagamore Hill as well as furnished the home. After Theodore remarried Edith Carow in 1886, Alice was placed in their care, but Anna and Alice stayed close. Since Anna had shared a special bond with her own father, she wanted the same for Alice, even though it broke her heart to be away from her.<br /> <br /> Anna also supported her cousin James Roosevelt “Rosy” Roosevelt. When James’ first wife Helen Astor died in 1893 Anna moved to London, where James was living, to take care of him and his two teenaged children. During her stay with James, she met Rear Admiral William Cowles and they were married in 1895. Together, they had one son, Sheffield. Yet, even with her own family, Anna remained a mainstay in the lives of her siblings, nieces, and nephews. In Alice Lee Roosevelt Longworth’s later years, she called Anna, “her greatest influence.”<br /> <br /> Throughout Theodore’s career and especially during his White House years, Anna entertained highly respected residents of Washington D.C. on her brother’s behalf in her own home in the capitol city. During this time her home was considered “the other White House” as it was used often for special meetings and parties. In 1904, Anna advised him when two battleships, Illinois and Missouri collided. Wanting another opinion on the situation, Theodore asked Anna to look over the reports and share her thoughts. She wrote him back saying that the decisions made in the reports were rational and suggested to proceed as usual. Considering Anna’s diplomatic personality and efficiency, Alice Roosevelt Longworth once said, “If Auntie Bye [Anna] had been a man, she would have been president.”<br /> <br /> Anna Roosevelt Cowles was an incredibly smart, supportive, and welcoming woman. Her entire life she had been devoted and dedicated to helping her family, and many of her accomplishments are seen in her family’s successes.<br /> <br /> She died on August 25, 1931 in Farmington, CT at the age of 76. She is buried at Riverside Cementry in Farmington, CT.",

Though much more subdued, Archie was closest with his younger brother Quentin. Archie attended both the Force School and Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. He followed his older brothers Kermit and Theodore Jr. to the Groton School but transferred and graduated from the Phillips Academy. Also like his father and siblings before him, Archie enrolled at Harvard University and graduated with the class of 1917.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Archie married Grace Lockwood in April of 1917 and they had four children together, Archibald, Theodora, Nancy, and Edith.

During his time in the Army during World War II, Archie was seriously wounded again in the same leg, this time by an enemy grenade. He was awarded second and third oak leaf clusters for his Silver Star from World War I and was once again given a full disability discharge from the Army.

            "bodyText": "<p>Christopher Gist was trained as a surveyor, but he put his skills and spirit to broader use during his lifetime, also serving as a frontier explorer, Indian agent, military scout, and guide.<br /> <br /> Gist’s exploration of the west and relationship with George Washington can both be traced back to the Ohio Company. This private company hired him in 1750 to explore territory in the Ohio Valley, where they hoped to acquire suitable land and encourage settlement and expansion. Gist’s explorations took him through areas of the west previously unseen by English colonist, such as Kentucky. He also produced prolific written records in the form of his journals. These journals are useful to historians today in understanding the British westward expansion that contributed to the French and Indian War. <br /> <br /> After scouting for the Ohio Company, Gist was engaged to go with Washington on the 1753 expedition to deliver a message to the French at Fort LeBoeuf.  The British message demanded the French to leave the Ohio River Valley. The French replied that they were not going to leave and Washington and Gist hurried back to deliver the news.  The return journey was dangerous.  When the pair was traveling with an American Indian who claimed to be their friend, he suddenly turned and shot at them.  Fortunately, the musket misfired and didn’t go off.  They were able to capture the American Indian, disarm him and send him away.  They walked day and night to get to the Allegheny River, where they built a raft to cross the ice clogged river.  Unfortunately, Washington fell into the frigid water and the pair could not maneuver the raft to either shore.  They needed to spend the night on an island.  It was so cold that night Gist got frostbite, but the cold also saved them.  The river froze and the pair walked across the ice to shore.  <br /> <br /> Gist encountered Washington in a different campaign in 1754, when he reported on May 27th that a French force was en route to Washington’s location at the Great Meadows. Washington had already heard from an American Indian ally, the Half-King, that an aggressive French force was on its way.  Together, these reports helped shape Washington’s belief that the approaching French were hostile, priming him for the ensuing skirmish at Jumonville Glen. Gist was also present for the Battle of Fort Necessity that followed the skirmish. Finally, Gist’s skills were also engaged a year later, in General Braddock’s 1755 expedition against Fort Duquesne. <br /> <br /> Mid-1756, Gist joined the southern Cherokee nation, seeking allies for the British in the evolving French and Indian War. It was during this assignment that Gist died, in South Carolina or Georgia, in 1759. <br /> <br /> Gist's skill and frontier expertise may have saved both his and Washington's life on the dangerous return journey from Fort LeBoeuf. Gist was instrumental in helping the British colonies explore and claim the frontier.  <br /> <br /> Author: Catarina Hurtado<br /> <br /> <strong>Sources:</strong><br /> Clary, David A. <em>George Washington’s First War: His Early Military Adventures.</em> New York: Simon & Schuster, 2011.<br /> Darlington, William M. <em>Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical, and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries</em>.

Once Theodore remarried and moved back to Oyster Bay, Alice moved in with him and his new wife, Edith Kermit Carow, at Sagamore Hill. Two years later, she was joined by Edith and Theodore’s first child, Theodore Jr. She was then referred to as “Sister” by her father and all of her siblings. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">When her father became president in 1901, Alice delighted in the spotlight. Washington, D.C. papers consistently wrote about her adventures and antics. Theodore Roosevelt was quoted as saying, “I can do one of two things. I can be President of the United States or I can control Alice Roosevelt. I cannot possibly do both.” While her father and stepmother disagreed with her behavior, the American public fell in love with her. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">In 1906, Alice married Republican Representative Nicholas Longworth of Ohio. They lived in Washington, D.C. Alice took a front row seat to politics and became close with many of the Republicans and other politicians. She frequently voiced her political opinion and in the 1930s spoke out against her cousins Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Because of her strong opinions and colorful personality, she came to be known as “the other Washington Monument.”</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Alice had one child, Paulina Longworth, and wrote a memoir titled Crowded Hours. Throughout her life she continued to meet powerful men and women, hosted meetings, and wrote newspaper columns out of her Washington, D.C. home. She was remembered by many for her acerbic wit and humor. She died on February 20, 1980 at the age of 96.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">She is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Robert Lester Mundschenk was born on June 6, 1924, in Boone County, Nebraska, specifically in rural Albion. The Mundschenks were blessed with nine children. Robert completed 10th grade then “worked out” on neighboring farms and ranches, like his older brothers. The five oldest bothers served in the war, and the two sisters moved to California to work in war production.</p> <p>During the Depression the family moved to Keeline, Wyoming, a rather arid part of the state. From Robert’s brother Harold, we learned the family worked about 180 of the 640-acre farm. There was no electricity or indoor plumbing and the water was brought up from below ground by a windmill-powered pump. Horses were used to work the land. The family raised about 200 chickens and had dairy cows while outdoor cats and working dogs completed the menagerie. Potatoes and a vegetable garden were grown for family consumption, and they also produced a few grain crops to sell: wheat, corn, and oats. Modern amenities consisted of a Model A Ford sedan, and a hand-cranked radio on which dad, George, would listen to the news from a Denver station.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Robert traveled south about 140 miles to Cheyenne to enlist. But he was only 18 years old, so he was not old enough to enlist without parental consent. His dad gave his consent and confirmed his date of birth in a telegram. On August 28, 1942, Robert signed up for four years of service, starting as an apprentice seaman (AS).</p> <p>AS Mundschenk attended the U.S. Naval Training Station in San Diego, California for both his basic training and specialized training in the Machinist School. Upon graduating on February 5, 1943, he was promoted to fireman first class (F1c) and was granted leave for a quick trip home to visit his parents and two younger brothers.</p> <p>F1c Mundschenk crossed the equator for the first time aboard the troop transport ship SS <em>Mormacwren</em> on March 13, 1943, earning the coveted status of a “trusty shellback.” He was on his way to Pearl Harbor to join the crew of the USS <em>Nashville</em> and served aboard that ship from April 15 to September 27, 1943.</p> <p>On September 30, 1943, he boarded USS <em>Portland</em> and headed back to California for destroyer training on Terminal Island. On December 31, 1943, F1c Mundschenk was received onboard the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793), making him an original crewmember—a plank owner. He spent the next year and a half on <em>Cassin Young</em>, sharing boredom, laughter and danger with his shipmates as they served all over the South Pacific. Robert was promoted twice: February 1, 1944, to water tender third class, and November 1 to water tender second class (trainee) (WT2c(T)).</p> <p>While on picket duty April 12, 1945, Cassin Young was hit by a kamikaze. WT2c(T) Mundschenk was one of the 59 men wounded. In addition to a scar on his neck, WT2c(T) Mundschenk received a letter of commendation signed by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz. The citation reads:</p> <blockquote>“For meritorious service in connection with operations against the enemy while serving as Water tender in the forward fireroom of a United States Destroyer under heavy aerial attack by enemy forces on 12 April 1945 in the vicinity of Okinawa. After a plane and its bomb hit the foremast and exploded in the air above the forward fireroom holing stacks, uptakes, and decks and piercing many pipes and electric leads, he remained at his post in the fireroom as it filled with steam and gasses and assisted in securing the boilers and cutting off damaged lines and equipment and then assisted other personnel to safety before he himself left the fireroom. His courage and devotion to duty were at all times in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\"<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was back on picket duty when it was hit again by a kamikaze attack on July 30, 1945. This attack took the life of 22 sailors, one of them a 21-year-old Wyoming farmer, WT2c (T) Robert Mundschenk.</p> <p>In a letter addressed to Robert’s sister Wilma Mundschenk, Earnest Coyt Russell, whom Robert worked for on <em>Cassin Young</em>, described Robert’s actions during the first kamikaze hit:</p> <blockquote>“…Shrapnel from the bomb penetrated the main deck and into the fire-room and a piece of shrapnel grazed Robert’s neck. He was not seriously injured and did not go to the Doctor for treatment until he had assisted in remedying damage to his station. Robert was that way always, never a murmur no matter how rough the situation.”<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>First buried in an American Military Cemetery in Okinawa, Robert was brought home in 1949 to be buried in Fort McPherson National Cemetery. His six brothers were pallbearers; all but the two youngest were in uniform.</p> <p>Harold Mundschenk wants his brother Robert remembered as “a hard-working sailor.” Harold and his son Kent agree that WT2c (T) Robert Mundschenk was a dedicated sailor who cared about others first.<sup>4</sup></p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Family history gathered May 2020 from Harold and Kent Mundschenk, bother and nephew of Robert.</li> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Robert Lester Mundschenk, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Quote from Russell letter: On behalf of the Mundschenk/Lull family in memory of Robert Mundschenk.</li> <li>Family history gathered May, 2020 from Harold and Kent Mundschenk, bother and nephew of Robert.</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Frank Leon Miller was born in Missoula, Montana, as the youngest of three siblings. At 20 years old he was working in the family run Miller’s Garage as a mechanic’s helper in Cathlamet, Washington, a trade he learned at the side of his father Frank T. Miller and his older brother Gratian.</p> <p>In August of 1942 Frank traveled to Portland, Oregon, and enlisted in the US Navy, starting an apprentice seaman. At the U.S. Naval Training Station in San Diego, California, he completed his basic training. He then continued in the Service School expanding his mechanical expertise while working his way up in rank from apprentice seaman, to seaman 2nd class, and fireman 1st class (F1c). After s short trip home, he reported to the cruiser USS <em>Nashville</em> (CL-43) April 15, 1943. On May 12, 1943, while shelling Vila airfield on Kolombangara, <em>Nashville</em> had a powder charge explode in one of her turrets which killed 18 men and wounded another 17. Shortly after the ship returned stateside for repairs and by August the <em>Nashville</em> was busy again in the Pacific.</p> <p>In early October F1c Miller was back in California. The following month he started a round of training to prepare him for working on a destroyer (firefighting, gunnery, night lookout, and learning how to be a petty officer in E.P.O. School). On December 31, 1943, he joined the crew (plank owners) of USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793). Frank continued to work his way up the ranks as a water tender (WT3c in February of 1944, WT2c February of 1945). He qualified to stand watch in the fireroom.</p> <p>While on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa, April 12, 1945, a kamikaze struck the mast of <em>Cassin Young</em> and exploded. Shrapnel rained down on the ship, killing one sailor and wounding 59 more. Miller was wounded in the leg and awarded a purple heart.<sup>1</sup> <em>Cassin Young</em> went to Ulithi Atoll where the radar and mast were repaired, and then returned to picket duty. In The Two-Ocean War historian Samuel Eliot Morrison writes, “Radar picket duty could be as suicidal for the picketing sailors as for the attacking Japanese.”<sup>2</sup></p> <p>On July 30, 1945, USS Cassin Young was struck by a kamikaze a second time. This time the plane crashed through the main deck and into the forward fireroom, causing a significant explosion. WT2c Miller was one of 22 sailors killed, passing later that day aboard USS <em>Cascade</em> (AD-16). He was 23 years old.</p> <p>In 1949 Frank Miller’s final resting place became the Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of Cathlamet, Washington.</p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Clyde Milton Reasoner, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Ralph Samuel Rhoads, <em>USS Cassin Young (DD-793) A Sailor’s War Diary</em> (2017), entry for May 15, 1945</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>David Stewart Johnson, Torpedoman's Mate 1<sup>st</sup> Class, 3/17/24 (21)</p> <p>David Johnson was born in Quincy, Massachusetts on March 17, 1921. While he was still an infant, his parents, Arthur and Beatrice, moved to the village of Byfield in the town of Newbury, Massachusetts. Johnson attended the prestigious Governor Dummer Academy in Newbury and then entered Middlebury College in Vermont.</p> <p>On “Navy Day,” October 28, 1942, Johnson traveled from Middlebury to Springfield, Massachusetts to enlist and then spent several months in boot camp at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in Lake County, Illinois. In January 1943, Johnson transferred to the Naval Service School, also at Great Lakes, for a 16-week program to qualify as a Torpedoman. On May 3, he was rated as a torpedoman’s mate 3<sup>rd</sup> class and transferred to the Destroyer Base Fleet Service School at San Diego, California. Johnson began his course in Advanced Torpedo Training later that month and finished it on July 16, graduating third in his class.</p> <p>Johnson was serving on the Fleet School Staff by the autumn of 1943 and eventually achieved a rating of torpedoman’s mate 1<sup>st</sup> class. He was transferred to the Navy's Receiving Station in San Pedro, California on February 28, 1944 and boarded the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793) the following day. On April 14 of that year, the ship sailed on her first operation to conduct raids on targets in Micronesia. From June through July, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was involved in the Marianas Campaign and the capture of Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. By October, the invasion of the Philippines commenced, and the ship saw heavy action off Cape Engaño, Luzon. For the rest of 1944 and into January 1945, the ship participated in strikes on enemy targets throughout the South China and Philippine Seas. Between February and March 1945, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> assisted in conducting diversionary raids on Japanese targets in support of the invasion of Iwo Jima.</p> <p>Between April and July 1945, the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> performed various tasks off Okinawa, providing shore bombardment, escorting troop transports, and serving as a radar picket for the fleet. On July 30, 1945, Johnson was at his battle station on the ship’s forward torpedo turret when a kamikaze crashed into the main deck below him. The plane, along with the 100-pound bomb it carried, exploded with a massive concussion and sprayed shrapnel everywhere. Johnson sustained a traumatic brain injury and multiple wounds from bomb fragments to his neck, forehead, right eye, right arm, both wrists, right thigh and knee. He was quickly transferred to the Destroyer Tender USS <em>Hamul</em> (AD-20) for treatment but he succumbed to his injuries later that day.</p> <p>Johnson was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. His body was later repatriated and laid to rest in the South Byfield Cemetery in Newbury, Massachusetts.<br />  </p> <hr />",

            "bodyText": "<p>J.V. “Dale” Cleveland grew up on a farm in Fulton, Mississippi with seven siblings. According to the 1940 census, his parents, Cora and Dolphis Armstrong (who went by D.A.), owned the farm. (The other seven families on the census page were all renters.)<sup>1</sup> We learned from J.V.’s younger brother James that the farm was 360 acres. The Cleveland’s grew and canned corn and tomatoes, they also grew beans, okra, watermelon, and what they called “Irish” potatoes (to distinguish them from sweet potatoes). They kept horses, cows and pigs and had a smoke house for curing the meat.<sup>2</sup> They were self-sufficient.</p> <p>J.V. graduated from Fulton Agricultural High School and worked in farming. He enlisted in the US Navy in May, 1943 as an apprentice seaman (AS), and attended basic training in San Diego, California.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>When JV was home on leave, he helped a neighbor dig a well. They set up a wooden A-frame with a windlass, and lowered J.V. into the well. He shoveled dirt into a bucket and the bucket was cranked up to be emptied. Younger brother LeRoy let go of the bucket, and it went speeding down the well. J.V. managed to avoid getting hit with the bucket but when they pulled him out of the well, he was “grey faced.” Brother James was about five years old when J.V. enlisted. He remembers following J.V. around when he was home on leave. J.V. taught James how to tie knots like a sailor. James remembers J.V. whistled when he was happy but also when he was very depressed. He also remembered J.V. did not want go back to the Navy, but knew he had to.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>He returned to California. J.V. built up his skill set and moved up in ranks through seaman 2nd class to seaman 1st class (S1c). In the fall of 1943, he started Destroyer Training and attended three weeks of Deck Petty Officer School. On December 31, 1943 he became a plank owner on the newly commissioned USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793). (Plank owner is a nickname for someone who is an original member of a ship’s crew.) He crossed the equator for the first time on April 23, 1944, earning to coveted title of shellback. USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was on the way to the South Pacific. S1c Cleveland and the crew would take part in many operations: Marianas, Western Caroline Islands Operation, Leyte and Luzon just to name a few. While on board he continued his training and on May 1, 1945, J.V. was appointed Signal Man 2nd class (trainee) (SM2c(T))<sup>5</sup></p> <p>During the Okinawa campaign USS <em>Cassin Young</em> was assigned to picket duty. Destroyers and destroyer escorts would create a protective ring around slower, larger ships, they would use their radar and sonar to detect any enemy action in the air, on, or below the ocean surface. They would communicate back to the rest of the fleet any oncoming dangers. April 12, 1945, <em>Cassin Young</em> was attacked by Japanese planes. One struck the ship’s radar mast and exploded. Fragments of the plane rained down on the ship wounding 59 sailors and killing one. Without radar, the ship was not able to serve on picket duty, so the ship went to Ulithi Atoll for repairs. In July they were back on picket duty off the southern coast of Okinawa. On July 30, <em>Cassin Young</em> was struck a second time by a kamikaze. The plane crashed through the main deck just behind the first smokestack and caused an explosion in the forward fire room. Twenty-two sailors were killed and another 45 were wounded. SM2c(T) Cleveland was hit by flying fragments in the face and chest and died instantly. He was buried with his shipmates. In a letter to SM2c(T) Cleveland’s parents, Commander John W. Ailes III describes the area, it reads in part:</p> <blockquote>I did have an opportunity to visit the cemetery where your son is interred and would like to give you some of the details. The cemetery is a Naval Cemetery on the island of Okinawa located just above the Hagushi beachhead where our troops first landed on Easter Sunday. It is a lovely spot overlooking the ocean and surrounded by low rolling hills. The graves are neatly marked and are well taken care of.<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Among J.V.’s effects there were a few books reflecting his faith. The Baptist faith and community were important to the Cleveland family. Younger brother Doyle was a deacon, and the family regularly attended an annual week long revival in the summer. James holds dearly the bible issued to his brother J.V. by the Navy.<sup>7</sup></p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes:</h3> <ol> <li>US Census, 1940</li> <li>Conversation with James Cleveland, younger brother of J.V.

She was born at the Presidio of Janos to Antonio Bezerra Nieto, the presidial captain, and Gregoria Catalina Gómez de Silva. Literally nothing is known of her childhood beyond the fact that she lived at one of Spain's most dangerous norther frontier outposts.<br /> <br /> In 1722, she married a young widower, Juan Bautista de Anza and became stepmother to his two daughters. The two would have four more children, including well-known Juan Bautista de Anza II, who led the expedition to found San Francisco in 1776.<br /> <br /> Rosa would be left a widow and single mother in 1740. She cared for not only the six children, but the family's ranch and mine holdings. This she performed with resolve, determination, and a keen business acumen. She hired numerous Yaqui, O'odham and Ópata vaqueros and maintained foremen at several distant properties.<br /> <br /> By the end, she ran the largest ranching enterprise in the Pima Alta, all without attending a single day of school or knowing how to read or write.<br /> <br /> Doña Rosa now rests at Tumacácori National Historical Park, beneath the steps to the sanctuary at the Guevavi Mission.<br /> <br /> To download the poster of Doña Rosa, click <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/upload/rosa-maría-bezerra-nieto-508.pdf\">here</a> (or on the image).<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/upload/rosa-maría-bezerra-nieto-508.pdf\"><img alt=\"image of a poster of Rosa Maria Bezerra Nieto\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|1200|1553|0|0|0\" height=\"1553\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=6554511||CPIMAGE:6554508|0|\" src=\"/articles/images/rosa-maría-bezerra-nieto-508.jpg\" title=\"rosa maría bezerra nieto 508\" width=\"1200\" /></a><br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Daniel-Hyacinthe-Marie Lienard de Beaujeu was a Canadian military officer in the colonial regular troops. His military career began at an early age. With experience and successes, he rose to the position of captain. He was made commander of Fort Niagara in 1749 and Fort Duquesne in 1755, although he was killed in the Battle of Monongahela before he assumed command of the latter. <br /> <br /> During his time as the commanding officer at Fort Niagara, Beaujeu came to understand the value of good relationships with the local American Indians. Military and trade concerns were forever at the forefront of French and English interests in the Ohio River Valley. Like Céloron de Blainville, Beaujeu recognized that the British traders who had recently moved into the area, and who were offering lower prices on trade goods, were detrimental to New France’s trade relations with American Indians. <br /> <br /> Beaujeu arrived at Fort Duquesne in late June of 1755 to assume his commanding position after an eventful journey. By this time, however, the officers at Fort Duquesne were aware that a formidable British force under General Edward Braddock was enroute. Braddock’s campaign constituted a determined effort on the part of the British to push the French out of the Ohio River Valley.  The British were particularly incensed by the recent defeat of a their force led by George Washington in the Great Meadows in 1754. <br /> <br /> Beaujeu led the French response to Braddock’s threatening approach. He needed the assistance of his American Indian allies who were unwilling to engage the overwhelming British force. But, Beaujeu knew how to convince them. His speech roused them to action, displaying his leadership skills: “I am determined to confront the enemy. What – would you let your father go alone? I am certain to defeat them!\" Beaujeu departed Fort Duquesne on the morning of July 9th with 637 American Indian warriors, 146 Canadian militiamen, and 108 colonial regulars.</p> <p>That same day, Beaujeu's French, Canadian, and American Indian force confronted General Braddock’s men in the bloody Battle of Monongahela. The encounter was rather unexpected for both sides. Beaujeu was killed early in the fighting by Braddock’s artillery. But he had succeeded in bringing a French army into battle, and they went on to win a stunning victory. </p> <p>Although the French won the battle, it was the beginning of the end of French influence in North America. <br /> <br /> Author:Catarina Hurtado<br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> Clary, David A. <em>George Washington’s First War: His Early Military Adventures</em>.

Her father was a civil rights advocate and owner of<i> La Crónica, </i>a newspaper which offered information to Hispanics and exposed the discrimination they experienced.

Resultingly, she organized a group of women called La Liga Femenil Mexicanista (Mexican Feminist League). They taught low-income students and adults literacy skills. They also opened new schools and taught bilingual curricula.<br /> <br /> Eventually, Idár inherited her father’s owned and edited newspaper.</span></span></span></span><i> </i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">Idár disguised her identity when she published her editorials.

The paper also supported the Mexican Revolution in Mexico that broke out in 1910.

She also publicly criticized the 28<sup>th</sup> president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, for sending soldiers to the U.S./ Mexico border and did not flinch after the Texas Rangers attempted to shut her newspaper down. Idár and her family established the First Mexican Congress to unify Mexicans across the border to fight injustice.

            "bodyText": "Ellen Wrenshall \"Nellie\" Grant was the third child and only daughter of Ulysses and Julia Grant. She was married twice and raise four children, three of whom lived to adulthood. <br /> <br /> Nellie was born on July 4, 1855 at her Grandfather's White Haven estate in St. Louis, Missouri. Julia Dent Grant recalled in her memoirs that Nellie was the light of her father's life. \"She was a great pet at school, as she was at home, and so gentle and pretty. She was her father's favorite, who always called her 'my little daughter'.\" Of her father, Nellie recalled later in life that \"my father took great interest in our schools and was anxious his children should apply themselves diligently to their studies . . . my father loved peace and hated war, but he loved this country and was devoted to its high purposes.\" As a young girl, Nellie was often told that the fireworks she saw on the 4th of July were for her birthday. In addition to attending grade school during the Civil War, Nellie volunteered to portray \"The Old Woman in the Shoe\" for the Western Sanitary Fair, which took place in St. Louis from May 17 to June 18, 1864. The fair aimed to raise funds to provide food, clothing, and health care for Union soldiers. By the end of the Western Sanitary Fair, upwards of $550,000 had been raised. Nellie's portrait was sold throughout the fair's duration, and word of this portraint eventually made its way to her father, who was fighting Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Virginia during the Overland campaign. General Grant praised his daughter for her hard work, writing in a letter to Julia that he enjoyed seeing the photo and that Nellie \"looks cunning dressed as an old woman.\"<br /> <br /> Nellie was still a teenager when her father was elected President of the United States in 1868. She traveled to Europe in the summer of 1872, and on the way home from this trip she met Algernon Edward Sartoris, son of a British Member of Parliament and nephew of the famous actor Fanny Kemble. The two fell in love and began a courtship. Julia Grant stated that \"When Nellie came back to me, she was no longer a nestling, but a young woman equipped and ready, ah, too ready, for the battle of life.\" Both Ulysses and Julia Grant were skeptical of the courtship, believing that Nellie was too young to make such a commitment and that Sartoris was a questionable partner. Julia once asked, \"Nellie, is it possible you are willing to leave your father and me, who have loved and cherished you all of your life, and go with this stranger for always?\" According to Julia, Nellie's clever response was \"Why, yes, mamma. I am sure that is just want you did when you married papa and left grandpa.\" The Grants relented and allowed the marriage to take place at the White House on May 21, 1874. Nellie was 18 years old at the time of her marriage. <br /> <br /> Nellie and Algernon Sartoris moved to Southampton, England after the wedding. Their firstborn child, Grant Grenville Edward Sartoris, was born on July 11, 1875, and was Ulysses and Julia Grant's first grandchild. Tragically, he died in infancy a year later. Three more children--Algernon, Jr., Vivian, and Rosemary--were born between 1877 and 1880. Despite the joys of family, the Sartoris marriage was a troubled one. Algernon was allegedly an emotionally abusive husband who often drank excessively and abandoned Nellie and the children for extended periods of time. The two separated in 1890, and upon Algernon's death in 1893 Nellie moved her family back to the United States. A provision in U.S. law at the time stipulated that a woman who married a non-citizen lost her own U.S. citizenship. To this end, a special act of Congress reinstating Nellie's citizenship was passed in 1898.<br /> <br /> Upon her return to the United States, Nellie Grant lived in Washington, D.C. to be close to her mother until her death in 1902. The following year she resided in St. Louis and was appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board of Lady Managers in preparation for the 1904 World's Fair. In 1912 Nellie married Frank Jones, a lawyer and former Assistant Postmaster under President Grover Cleveland. The two resided in Chicago, but shortly after the marriage Nellie suffered a debilitating stroke that kept her paralyzed the rest of her life. She died on August 30, 1922 at the age of 67 and is buried with her second husband at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.   ",

            "bodyText": "Jesse Root Grant II was the fourth and youngest child of Ulysses and Julia Grant. He was an accomplished mining engineer and lawyer who lived much of his adult life in California. He also attempted to run for President of the United States in 1908. <br /> <br /> Named after his paternal grandfather, Jesse Root Grant II was born on his maternal grandfather's White Haven estate in St. Louis, Missouri on February 6, 1858. While Grant claimed later in life that he was born on his father's Hardscrabble log cabin on the White Haven property, he was most likely born at the main White Haven home, which is where the Grant family was living in 1858. Julia Dent Grant recalled in her memoirs that as the youngest child, Jesse was both spoiled and an adventurous troublemaker. \"Jesse was the most important member of our household,\" Julia recalled. \"He was first waited on at table. His smallest word was listened to by all of us, and, if there was the least hint of a jest, he had an appreciative audience. At two years old, he aspired to wearing his father's boots . . . and with much difficulty inserted each little leg in a boot and started downstairs. The result was dreadful. His neck was not broken, but his four front teeth were broken squarely off, and he lay quivering and fainting in my arms.\" <br /> <br /> Grant's childhood experiences were quite different from his other siblings. During the Civil War, young Jesse remained by his mother's side throughout the duration of the war. His schooling was limited during this time due to his young age, but on numerous occasions he was able to visit his father at his headquarters during the war. He was ten years old when his father was elected to the presidency and spent his teenage years living at the White House. He also accompanied his parents for much of their two and a half year world tour (1877-1879). <br /> <br /> Jesse received an elite education, obtaining a degree in mining engineering from Cornell University and a law degree from Columbia Law School. He married Elizabeth Chapman in 1880 with whom he raised two children, Chapman and Nellie. In the mid-1880s he worked in New York City as a banker, but later moved his family to San Diego, California. He engaged in speculative mining operations, including one in Nome, Alaska that allowed Grant to enjoy \"a comfortable fortune,\" according to the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> in 1902. He also worked as an engineer on various projects to develop the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and helped manage his brother Ulysses' hotel--the U.S. Grant Hotel--in San Diego. Grant also unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 1908. In contrast to his father, Jesse was a member of the Democratic Party and hoped to secure the party's nomination over perennial candidate William Jennings Bryan. \"The Democratic Party has always been known as the party of the people,\" he argued while visiting St. Louis in 1907. <br /> <br /> Grant remained in California the rest of his life. He filed divorce from his wife Elizabeth in 1913 and later remarried Lillian Burns Wilkins. In 1925 he wrote a semi-autobiographical book entitled <em>In the Days of My Father</em>. On June 8, 1934, Jesse Root Grant II died at the age of 76 in Los Altos, California, and is buried at the Presidio of San Francisco.   ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Denmark Vesey, a carpenter and formerly enslaved person, allegedly planned an enslaved insurrection to coincide with Bastille Day in Charleston, South Carolina in 1822. Vesey modeled his rebellion after the successful 1791 slave revolution in Haiti. His plans called for his followers to execute the white enslavers, liberate the city of Charleston, and then sail to Haiti before the white power structure could retaliate. Two of the slaves involved leaked details of the plot before it could be implemented. On receiving word of the plot, Charleston authorities mobilized quickly and arrested Vesey and his men. Out of 131 men arrested and charged with conspiracy, 67 were convicted and 35 were hanged, including Vesey.<br /> <br /> Vesey's date and place of birth are unknown, but while probably in his mid-teens he was sold to Carolina-based slaver named Joseph Vesey in 1781. Following the British evacuation in 1783, Vesey's owner settled in Charleston with young Denmark. Vesey eventually fathered three children by at least two wives. After winning a $1,500 lottery in 1799, Vesey purchased his freedom and set up a carpentry shop in Charleston, where he prospered. Vesey and several of his co-conspirators worshiped at the African Church, the AME congregation which became Mother Emanuel after the Civil War. Along with white abolitionists in the North, Vesey referenced the Bible in his attacks on the institution of slavery. In the aftermath of the execution, white Charlestonians tore down the church and supported new efforts to control the black majority. Funds were appropriated to support a Municipal Guard of 150 men and the construction of \"a Citadel\" to house them and weapons. In 1843, the structure became home to the cadets of the South Carolina Military Academy.<br /> <br /> Additionally, as Vesey's rebellion relied on assistance from free black sailors, South Carolina passed legislation known as the Negro Seamen Acts. The act called for the incarceration of visiting free black sailors in local jails while their vessel remained in Charleston to eliminate contact between free black sailors from outside of South Carolina and black Charlestonians. Despite protests from northern states and British consuls, South Carolina stubbornly insisted on its right to police its population in this way.<br /> <br /> Denmark Vesey was later held up as a hero among abolitionists, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, during the Civil War. Douglass used Vesey's name as a rallying cry in recruiting and inspiring African American troops, including the 54th Massachusetts Infantry. Vesey's son, Robert, attended the April 14, 1865 ceremony at Fort Sumter. Henry Ward Beecher discussed the meaning of the war and argued against the evils of slavery after brevet Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-anderson.htm\">Robert Anderson</a> raised the 33 star US flag that flew over the fort before the cruel rebellion began. </p>",

I admit there has been blame. I admit also I may have had my share. God knows there is enough for us all. - Sir Henry Clinton</p> </blockquote> General Henry Clinton famously arrived with Generals William Howe and John Burgoyne aboard the <em>Cerberus</em> in British occupied Boston in 1776. This triumvirate of British Army generals had an incredible impact on the course of the American Revolution. General Howe soon replaced General Thomas Gage as the British commander in chief. Howe's early tenure in the position suffered strategically as he bizarrely also served as a peace commissioner. Sir Henry Clinton replaced Sir William Howe as commander in chief of the British army in 1778. With France's entry in the war and her alliance with the United States of America, Clinton faced an increasingly global, imperial war and had fewer men left to face the rebellious Americans. Ultimately, Clinton, despite having early successes in the southern campaign, oversaw the British defeat in America and was replaced in 1782 by Sir <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/guy-carleton.htm\">Guy Carleton</a>. <br />   <h4>Military Pedigree</h4> Clinton possessed significant military experience before the start of the American Revolution. He grew up partially in America, where his father was the royal governor of New York. Through his father's family, Clinton was related to the seat of the Earls of Lincoln, opening the doors to an illustrious military career. His military career spanned fifty years. He joined the army at fifteen, and, at the age of twenty-one, he received an officer's commission into the elite infantry regiment of the Coldstream Guards. Clinton served in Canada during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 - 48). In the Seven Years' War, he served with his regiment in Germany under General John Manners, the marquess of Granby, who commanded British forces sent to reinforce the prince of Brunswick. Clinton was seriously wounded at the Battle of Freiberg on October 29, 1762, causing him pain thereafter. Together with Howe and George Germain, later the Secretary of State for America in Lord North's cabinet during the American Revolution, he became a protégé of Field Marshal Sir John Louis Ligonier, a man credited for being the mastermind of British victory in the Seven Years' War. <br /> <br /> In 1772, Clinton was promoted to the rank of major general. The death of his wife that year likely triggered his decision to travel. In 1774, he crossed Europe to Vienna and the Balkans to observe the Russo-Turkish War in Bulgaria. At the time of his appointment as third in command in America in 1775, he was an experienced officer and a veteran of warfare, who had studied under some of the greatest military commanders of the era. His personality, however, proved to be a barrier to effective relationships with fellow senior officers in the American war. Clinton's long list of character faults included hypersensitivity, shyness, jealousy, and anger. On the other hand, he was the most intellecutal of the British generals in America. He read widely on military history. He was a cautious commander, preferring to gain victories at the cost of few casualties. As a subordinate commander, he favored flanking maneuvers over frontal assaults. This preference can be seen in his attempt to alter Gage's proposed plan of attack at Bunker Hill and his successful flanking march on the American army on Long Island. Following the removal of General Gage in September 1775, Clinton became second in command to Howe. Their relations were quickly strained, leading Howe to send Clinton on separate missions, starting with an expedition to the south with a fleet under Commodore <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-parker.htm\">Sir Peter Parker</a>. <br />   <h4>Southern Expedition 1776</h4> The expedition proved an abject failure. Its original goal was to join and support the loyalists of North Carolina, where Clinton would be reinforced by troops from Ireland, commanded by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-cornwallis.htm\">Charles Lord Cornwallis</a>. Upon the fleet's arrival in North Carolina, they learned of the defeat of loyalists at Moores Creek Bridge. Debating on a new target, Clinton favored establishing a naval base along the coast of Virginia to disrupt American supply lines. Admiral Parker favored attacking Charleston, South Carolina and establishing a base on Sullivan's Island. Admiral Parker had his way, and the fleet sailed south. The expedition failed for a variety of reasons. General Clinton, very susceptible to sea-sickness, landed with over 2,000 soldiers on an island adjacent to Sullivan's Island. His refusal to lodge aboard the <em>Bristol</em>, Parker's flagship, prevented close coordination and added communication difficulties to an already poor working relationship. The British believed Breach Inlet, the body of water between Sullivan's Island and Long Island where Clinton placed his army, to be eighteen inches deep. In fact, it was several feet deep, which prevented the infantry from assisting Parker's fleet in capturing the South Carolinians' palmetto-log fortification. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan's Island</a>, fought on June 28, 1776, ended in American victory, embarassing the might of the Royal Navy. Clinton and Parker blamed each other for the defeat. It was the last major British offensive in the south for another three years.<br />   <h4>New York & Rhode Island Campaigns</h4> On returning to join Howe in August 1776, Clinton burnished his reputation by distinguishing himself in the conquest of New York. At the battle of Long Island (August 27, 1776), Howe followed his suggested plan of attack, resulting in one of the great British victories of the war. Clinton personally led the encirclement of the left wing of the Continental Army. It was the only time Howe adopted a proposed plan of action from Clinton. Clinton's advice on the pursuit of Washington's army and not to spread British garrisons too thinly across New Jersey were all ignored. In December 1776, Clinton captured Newport, Rhode Island, a desirable harbor for the Royal Navy's operations along the American coast. <br /> <br /> Following his success at Newport, Clinton asked and received permission to return to England. While in England, he defended his actions at Charleston and sought to resign from serving under Howe. King George III refused Clinton permission to resign and ordered him to return and serve under Howe while also awarding Clinton a knighthood and membership in the Order of Bath. Sir Henry Clinton was unhappy at his return to America but hoped that he might replace Burgoyne when the two armies united at Albany, severing the rebellious colonies along the Hudson River.<br />   <h4>Commander in Chief, North America 1778 - 82</h4> This dream was never realized as Clinton was left to command in New York as Howe took the majority of his army on a campaign to capture Philadelphia, which did not serve British strategic interests as an advance along the Hudson River to join Burgoyen's army would have. After Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga, Howe's days as commander in chief were numbered. After a winter occupying Philadelphia, the British army returned to New York. Clinton assumed the role as commander in chief after Lord North's cabinet recalled Howe as there were few alternative candidates and Clinton was already in America. Lord North advised against appointing Clinton, arguing that it was inadvisable to employ a general who wanted to resign and who complained continually. <br /> <br /> As commander in chief, Clinton was a gifted strategist who grasped the realities of the war and understood the difficulties facing the British. Clinton presciently feared a scenario in which the British would lack naval superiority and become vulnerable to the French. He also voiced concerns that without winning the hearts and minds of the Americans British military efforts would be in vain. He saw little value in taking territory only to abandon it and dissapoint local loyalists and leave them exposed to reprisals. Clinton mourned the loss of thousands of his troops, over 5,000 troops sent to serve in the Caribbean. He doubted whether Great Britain would ever have the resources to replace them.<br /> <br /> Despite the significant drop in manpower, Clinton received orders from Lord North's cabinet to wage a new campaign in the southern colonies upon the theory that loyalist support would augment the fewer regular soldiers available. In December 1778, Clinton complied by sending one thousand troops to attack Georgia. Under the command of Lt. Col. Archibald Campbell, the army captured Savannah where Campbell boasted that he had \"ripped one star and one stripe from the rebel flag of America.\" The success caused Clinton's superiors in Great Britain to favor expanding the campaign and target South Carolina. Clinton recognized that concentrated efforts to the south would diminish his hopes to defeat Washington's army around New York. The year of 1779 in the northern theater would be marked by probing attacks and counter-attacks in the Hudson River valley to no great effect. General Washington hoped for the arrival of a French naval fleet to allow his army to attack the British in New York City in 1779, but the fleet did not arrive. <br />   <h4>British Southern Campaign & Arnold's Treason</h4> After the British successfully defended Savannah against a combined Franco-American siege in the fall of 1779, Clinton felt able to begin a major offensive against South Carolina. In late December 1779, Clinton embarked for Charleston. His force consisted of 8,700 soliders and 5,000 sailors, together with ninety transports and ten warships under the command of Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot. A stormy voyage delayed the arrival of Clinton's force to the shores of South Carolina. Landing first at Simmons Island, known today as Seabrook Island, the British approached Charleston over land from the south. The Royal Navy sailed up into the Cooper and Ashley Rivers, contributing their naval artillery fire to the siege. The British bottled up the patriot army, commanded by Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-lincoln.htm\">Benjamin Lincoln</a>, on the peninsula of Charleston. Rather than evacuating the city and keeping the army intact to oppose the British, Lincoln felt pressured by civilian authorities to defend the city. After a three-month siege and the city subject to increasing British artillery fire, the Continental Army surrendered on May 12, 1780. Ultimately, it was a tremendous victory for Clinton, particularly given his failed attack on Sullivan's Island in 1776. It was the largest loss suffered by the patriots during the Revolution, with over 3,000 soldiers taken prisoner. <br /> <br /> Clinton moved to pacify the rest of South Carolina, following his success at Charleston. His proclamations backfired and served to ignite patriot resistance. On June 3, he issued a proclamation that required Americans to take a declaration of loyalty and be willing to take up arms in support of Britain. This proclamation contradicted earlier guarantees of pardons and paroles for prisoners of war. Partisan militia bands under leaders like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-sumter.htm\">Thomas Sumter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/francis-marion.htm\">Francis Marion</a> proliferated in response to this proclamation, leaving the Carolinas a hornet's nest as Clinton left to return to New York. He left Lord Cornwallis in command of British forces in the south. Their relationship, previously friendly and cooperative, did not recover after the fall of Charleston as Clinton's resignation request was finally accepted by Lord George Germain. Cornwallis expected to be Clinton's successor. Clinton, however, declined to resign, having just achieved a great victory. Unfortunately for Clinton and Cornwallis, they later oversaw the failure of British arms in America. <br /> <br /> Upon Clinton's return to New York, he received bad news. His plan to surprise Washington's army in their encampment at Morristown, New Jersey had been ruined by the premature attack launched by General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, a Hessian officer left in command of New York. British hopes to end the war in a single decisive battle proved elusive. While despairing for additional reinforcements, Clinton worked on a secret plan in 1780. The American general, Benedict Arnold, was ready to betray the patriot cause. The betrayal and British plan to break the deadlock revolved around capturing West Point. Clinton's adjutant general, Major John André, supervised the British intelligence and spy network. Captured after meeting with Arnold with plans of West Point in his boot and wearing civilian attire, André was tried, convicted, and hanged as a spy. Clinton, saddened by the loss of André, kept his promise to Arnold and commissioned him a brigadier general in a loyalist regiment. His hopes that Arnold's treason would spur others to betray the American cause were never realized; in the words of one historian, \"Arnold as traitor helped fix a powerful new image of the United States in the minds of its people.\"<br /> <br /> With the collapse of his plans to capture West Point, Clinton spent the remainder of the war in Cornwallis' shadow. Unable to ignore government orders, Clinton reluctantly accepted the shift of the focus of the war to the south. He continued to send reinforcments to Cornwallis. Clinton, however, grew incredibly frustrated at the support shown for Cornwallis by the home government. The two generals had very different conceptions of strategy. Clinton thought it an error to advance until all resistance had been eliminated in Georgia and South Carolina while Cornwallis believed it was necessary to advance northward to defeat enemy forces and cut off the source of supplies for patriots further south. Given the geographic distance and length of time between correspondence, Cornwallis acted fairly independently of Clinton and fatefully invaded North Carolina and later Virginia. His forces, already suffering from the attrition of long campaigns, were stretched thin and vulnerable to the arrival of a French fleet. Yorktown, Virginia proved to be the location of the climactic battle of the American Revolution. Clinton defended his actions as commander in chief and attempted to shift the blame for British defeat in the war to Lord Cornwallis during his postwar years. <h4><br /> Postwar Life</h4> Clinton's military career essentially ended with the American Revolution. While his rivals received significant promotions and honors, Clinton was only offered an Irish peerage, an unattractive title as it did not confer the right to sit in the House of Lords. Clinton tried to secure a parliamentary inquiry to clear his name, but he failed. Clinton advocated for the interests of loyalists after the war and supported their claims for compensation. In his retirement, Clinton traveled throughout Europe and spent time with his children. In his later years, Clinton's career had new life. In 1790, he returned to Parliament as member for Launceston, and he was promoted to full general the next year. In 1794, he received the governorship of Gibraltar, but he was too ill to ever accept the offer. Clinton died in London in 1795. ",

            "bodyText": "Alexander Leslie served as an officer in the British Army during the American Revolution. He commanded the southern theater after <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-cornwallis.htm\">Charles Lord Cornwallis</a>' surrender at Yorktown and directed the British evacuations of Savannah, Georiga and Charleston, South Carolina in 1782 under orders from Sir <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/guy-carleton.htm\">Guy Carleton</a>. <br /> <br /> Leslie was the second son of Alexander, fifth Earl of Leven and a Scottish peer. He was also the namesake of a seventeenth century general. Born in 1731, Leslie pursued a military career, joining the army in his early twenties, and received steady promotions. In 1760, he married Rebecca Tullidelph, the daughter of an Antiguan planter. Together they had one child, Mary Ann Leslie, before Rebecca's death a year after childbirth. In the years before the American Revolution, Leslie served in Boston, Massachusetts and Halifax, Nova Scotia as a regimental commander and lieutenant colonel.<br /> <br /> In February 1775, General Thomas Gage, the military governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony, ordered Lt. Col. Leslie and 250 men of the 64th Regiment of Foot to travel by ship to Marblehead and then march on Salem where they would seize cannon and powder from rebel militia. Leslie's mission failed when he encountered a large, abusive crowd of residents and militia, who had raised the drawbridge over the North River. The tense standoff ended when the milita agreed to lower the drawbridge and allow Leslie's men to cross it. Having crossed it, Leslie marched his men back to Marblehead. The event, remembered as Leslie's Retreat, occurred just two months before the opening shots of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord. <br /> <br /> In 1776, Leslie rose to the rank of brigadier general and participated in the New York campaign, fighting in the Battle of Long Island, the landing at Kip's Bay, the Battle of Harlem Heights, and the Battle of White Plains. In 1777, Leslie failed to detect General George Washington's small Contintental Army en route to attack the garrison at Princeton, New Jersey. At the Batte of Princeton, Leslie's nephew, Captain William Leslie of the 17th Foot, was mortally wounded and later buried with military honors by the Continental Army in Pluckemin, New Jersey because of William Leslie's friendship with Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independece and physician. For the next two years, Leslie commanded British troops on Staten Island. His service was again rewarded with a promotion to major general in 1779.<br /> <br /> For the remainder of the American Revolution, Leslie served in the southern theater with time spent in New York between assignments. He participated in the successful <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">siege of Charleston</a>, South Carolina in 1780. Later in 1780, he led over two thousand British soldiers on raids in Virginia, targeting the economy and supply lines supporting the Continental Army. In January 1781, Leslie returned to the Carolinas with reinforcements, arriving too late to assist British troops in their defeat at the Battle of Cowpens. At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, Leslie commanded the British right wing in their costly victory over Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanael-greene.htm\">Nathanael Greene</a>'s well positioned army of militia and Continentals. Leslie's health worsened, and he returned to New York to recuperate until he received orders in late 1781 from General Sir <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-clinton.htm\">Henry Clinton</a>, the British commander in chief, to hold Charleston, South Carolina at all costs. Leslie, however, begged Clinton for permission to return home, citing his long service in the war, his failing health, and his wish to return to his family. He pleaded also with Clinton's successor as commander in chief, Sir Guy Carleton, that his \"country has got her full share out of me.\" <br /> <br /> In May 1782, secret orders arrived from Carleton, directing Leslie to oversee the evacuation of British forces from the southern colonies. The task of arranging transport for the British forces and also thousands of loyalist refugees proved burdensome. He had been responsible for feeding over 15,000 people in the garrison of Charleston for months, which required foraging in the countryside and armed clashes with Continentals and rebel militia. Leslie's negotiations with Greene for a peaceful British evacuation and American occupation of the city of Charleston succeeded. On December 14, the final British forces loaded onto ships at Gadsden's Wharf, leaving Charleston to the Continental Army and native South Carolinians. Loyalist refugees, whose safety concerned Carleton and Leslie during the evacuations, were free to settle anywhere in the empire. Many settled in British North America, increasing the population of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and leading to the creation of Upper Canada. <br /> <br /> Leslie returned to Scotland in 1783, becoming second in command of the British army there. He celebrated the wedding of his daughter, Mary Anne, in 1787 to John Rutherfurd. In the final days of Leslie's life, he had leaders of a mutiny arrested. Shortly after the quelled mutiny, Leslie died of an unknown illness in Edinburgh. ",

            "bodyText": "Andrew Gordon Magrath, a South Carolina jurist, famously resigned his seat as a federal judge in November 1860, following the election of Abraham Lincoln. Many considered this as the first overt step towards secession in South Carolina. Magrath sat in South Carolina's secession convention and later held minor roles in the Confederate States government. He was the last governor of South Carolina during the American Civil War under the Confederate States of America from December 20, 1864 to May 25, 1865. <br /> <br /> Magrath was born in Charleston, South Carolina in February 1813, the son of an Irish merchant, John Magrath, and Maria Gordon. After his graduation from South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) in 1831, Magrath briefly attended Harvard Law School, but he acquired most of his legal training in Charleston from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/james-l-petigru.htm\">James L. Petigru</a>, a respected jurist. Magrath was admitted to the bar in 1835. From 1838 to 1841, he represented the city parishes of St. Philip's and St. Michael's in the state House of Representatives. On March 8, 1843 he married Emma D. Mikell of Charleston. They had five children together. In 1865, Magrath married Mary Eliza McCord of Columbia, South Carolina. <br /> <br /> In 1856, President Franklin Pierce nominated Magrath for a seat on the US District Court of South Carolina, which brought him national attention and controversy. His tenure coincided with increasing calls from some southern nationalists to reopen the African slave trade. Although personally opposed, Magrath handed proponents of the African slave trade a victory in 1860. In a decision associated with the cases surrounding the <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-echo.htm\">Echo</a></em> and the <em>Wanderer</em>, ships sezied for illegally transporting African captives, Magrath stated that the 1820 federal statute on piracy did not apply to the slave trade. \"The African slave trade is not piracy,\" he declared. In rejecting the piracy statute, proslavery and states' rights adovocates in the south praised Magrath. <br /> <br /> Immediately following the election of Abraham Lincoln, Magrath resigned his judgeship on November 7, 1860. He told a crowded courtroom that \"the department of Government, which I believe has best maintained its integrity and preserved its purity, has been suspended. So far as I am concerned, the Temple of Justice, raised under the Constitution of the United States, is now closed. If it shall be never again opened, I thank God that its doors have been closed before its altar has been desecrated with sacrifices to tyranny.\" Magrath then participated in South Carolina's Secession Convention and briefly served as the South Carolina secretary of state. In 1862, he was appointed as a Confederate district judge. His decisions generally opposed the centralization of power and President Jefferson Davis' administration. <br /> <br /> In December 1864, Magrath was elected governor of South Carolina. During his time as governor, he continued his criticism of the Confederate government in Richmond, Virginia. Following the collapse of the Confederacy, Magrath was arrested in May 1865 and imprisoned at Fort Pulaski, Georgia. Released in December, Magrath returned to Charleston. He rebuilt his law practice and focused on his career as a lawyer until his death in 1893. ",

Forten was educated by private tutors as her father did not want her to attend a public school. This was a privilege only wealthier families could afford. Later Forten moved to Salem, Massachusetts where she joined the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society. In 1856, she entered Salem Normal School to receive instruction in teaching.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s Forten became increasingly involved in the abolitionist movement. She published several poems in anti-slavery publications such as The Liberator and The Evangelist. She also called for black women's participation in the abolitionist crusade. She joined circles of significant abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Lydia Maria Child. <br /> <br /> In 1861, after Union troops occupied parts of the coastal Carolinas, Federal authorities recruited Forten and others to teach emancipated African Americans on the Sea Islands of South Carolina.<br /> <br /> Her role in the community reached beyond education. She was also a song leader, storyteller, nurse, Sunday school teacher and companion to the elderly. She was one of the few northern black teachers to chronicle her time on the islands. The Atlantic Monthly published her work, \"Life on the Sea Islands,\" in May and June of 1864.<br /> <br /> After the war, Forten taught in Boston, MA and Charleston, SC. In 1872, she moved to Washington, DC, where she taught at a preparatory school later known as Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. One year later she became a clerk in the Treasury Department.<br /> <br /> At 41 years old, she married the Reverend Francis J. Grimké, a former slave and minister of DC's Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church. They had one child who died in infancy. From 1881 to 1886, the couple resided in Dupont Circle, Washington, DC.  <br /> <br /> In 1896, Forten helped found the National Association of Colored Women. Throughout the 1890s, she published poems about DC, including “At the Home of Frederick Douglass” and “The Corcoran Art Gallery.” Forten remained active in the civil rights movement until her death on July 23, 1914.<br /> <br /> <br /> Sources: <br /> Stevenson, Brenda, ed. The Journals of Charlotte Forten Grimké. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988. <br /> <br /> Turkel, Stanley. Heroes of the American Reconstruction: Profiles of Sixteen Educators, Politicians and Activists. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland and Company, Inc., 2005. <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Christopher Gustavus Memminger was a lawyer and South Carolina state legislator, who for twenty years headed the state's Finance Committee. Although a critic of South Carolina's attempt to nullify Federal laws in the 1830s, he joined the secessionist movement after Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States. Memminger was selected to write the legal justification for South Carolina's secession in the \"Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union.\" This document clearly outlined the primacy of fears over the institution of slavery in South Carolina's decision to leave the Union. He then became a South Carolina delegate to the Provisional Congress of Confederate States where he chaired the committee, which drafted the Confederate Constitution.<br /> <br /> In 1861, Jefferson Davis appointed Memminger Secretary of Treasury. As the war progressed, Memminger managed the steady decline of Confederate finances as various schemes to introduce direct taxation, control inflation, and preserve Confederate credit lines were tried and failed. He was driven from office in 1864 after the complete collapse of the Confederate currency. After the war, Memminger resumed his law practice, as well as his long-time involvement in efforts to improve public education in South Carolina.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Nicknamed \"Bloody Ban\" for his ruthlessness, Banastre Tarleton, a British army officer, was hated and feared by patriots in the southern states during the American Revolution. His conduct illustrated and exacerbated the problems the British faced in pacifying the population of South Carolina. As the commander of a cavalry and mounted infantry unit, his unit became the eyes and ears of Lord <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-cornwallis.htm\">Charles Cornwallis</a>'s southern army, winning battlefield glories until a decisive day at Cowpens on January 17, 1781.<br /> <br /> Banastre Tarleton was born into a middle class family in Liverpool, England. Tarleton attended Oxford and briefly studied law at the Middle Temple before his mother purchased him a cornet's commission in the 1st Dragoon Guards. He participated in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">first British attack on Charleston in 1776</a> and eventually transferred to the 16th Light Dragoons. During the American army's flight from New York, Tarleton and his troop of dragoons captured Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-lee.htm\">Charles Lee</a>, second in command of the Continental Army, at a tavern in New Jersey. Tarleton made his way up the ranks through merit and by the spring of 1780, at the young age of 26, had taken command of the British Legion, a unit comprised of loyalist recruits from the middle colonies. <br />  </p> <h4>Southern Campaign</h4> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">Siege of Charleston</a>, Tarleton's British Legion scored a decisive victory over patriot cavalry at Monck's Corner on April 14, 1780, granting the British control of the area north and east of Charleston. At the Waxhaws in South Carolina on May 29, Tarleton exhibited the courage and energy that were to be his hallmark while pursuing the sole remnants of the Continental Army after the fall of Charleston. Tarleton and his British Legion caught up with Col. Abraham Buford's troops at the Waxhaws, just south of the border with North Carolina. After sending a flag of truce with an offer to surrender, Tarleton's men attacked, killing 113 Americans and wounding another 150 out of a total force of 300-350 soldiers. </p>   <p>\"Tarleton's Quarter\" became a rallying cry for southern patriots after the massacre. After the British victory at Camden, Cornwallis tasked Tarleton with the intimidation of the countryside, which brought momentary gains, including defeating <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-sumter.htm\">Thomas Sumter</a>'s partisans at Fishing Creek. Despite the humane image of Cornwallis, some of his chief subordinates like Tarleton and Lord Francis Rawdon were advocates of brutal repression. Tarleton thought Cornwallis too lenient, and claimed that his moderation \"did not reconcile enemies, but...discouraged friends.\" <br /> <br /> Tarleton had been charged with covering the Carolina upcountry against Patriot guerillas. Specifically, he was to seek out and destroy a threat to his rear, a wing of the American Southern Army, commanded by General Daniel Morgan. By January 12, 1781, he was closing in on Morgan, pushing his men on, fording the rain-swollen Enoree, Tyger, and Pacolet Rivers. Morgan, on the other hand, suddenly halted a desperate retreat, was joined by more militia, and parlayed the fear and hatred of Tarleton into victory at Cowpens.<br /> <br /> At Cowpens, January 17, 1781, Morgan lured Tarleton's men into an elaborate trap. His collapsing lines of skirmishers, militia, and Continentals (each about 150 yards behind one another on a slope) brought the tired but confident British in prematurely, exposing them to heavy fire. As the Continentals pinned the British down, a mounted attack would assault the British flank. A mistaken command to retreat drew the British in even more, and, when the retreat was stopped, the Continental line turned and fired with devastating results. In the ensuing panic, the American cavalry, already engaged in battle, flanked the British left, leading to a successful double envelopment, a decisive victory, and a turning point in the war in the South. At battle's end, patriot cavalry commander, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-washington.htm\">William Washington</a>, in mad pursuit of Tarleton, engaged Tarleton in a dramatic hand-to-hand encounter, in which Washington barely escaped with his life. With the approach of American riflemen, Tarleton, with fifty-four of his supporters, abandoned the battle and fled east toward the British camp, never to be caught. <br /> <br /> On the field at Cowpens, Tarleton left eighty-six percent of his force dead, wounded, or captured: 110 killed and 712 prisoners, of whom 200 were wounded. In his memoir, Tarleton explained his defeat, crediting American bravery while citing total misbehavior of his troops. He refused to take any of the blame for the defeat. In the aftermath of his defeat at Cowpens, Tarleton and his surviving troops fled to rejoin Cornwallis's army. An American prisoner, Samuel McJunkin, related that as Tarleton reported, Cornwallis placed the tip of his sword against the sword and leaned into the hilt, harder and harder, until the blade snapped. Tarleton, in the wake of his defeat, wrote Cornwallis, asking permission to retire and for a court martial to determine responsiblity. Cornwallis refused, and Tarleton continued in service. <br /> <br /> In the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, Tarleton's men were held in reserve. Late in the battle, Tarleton rode to the support of a Hessian regiment, routing Virginia riflemen under Colonel William Campbell. The British won a Pyrrhic victory, driving Gen. Nathanael Greene's army from the field, at the cost of the effectiveness of their army. They suffered over twenty-seven percent casualties, ruining the army. Tarleton lost two fingers on his right hand, suffering a wound in the battle. After having marched across the Carolinas and chasing Green's Continentals to little purpose, Cornwallis moved his army to Wilmington, North Carolina where he later made the momentous decision to march into Virginia.<br /> <br /> When Cornwallis marched his army into Virginia, he loosed Tarleton and the Legion on sweeping raids into the interior. At Monticello, Tarleton nearly captured Governor Thomas Jefferson, who fled just in time. In the Siege of Yorktown, Tarleton served across the river at Gloucester. On October 4, 1781 a French Hussar regiment skirmished with Tarleton's British Legion. In this skirmish, Tarleton was unhorsed and wounded, saved by his men from a French lancer. After the British surrendered at Yorktown, there was a dinner party for military officers. The Americans invited all British officers, except for Tarleton. His past conduct could not be overlooked.<br />  </p> <h4>Postwar Career</h4> <p>Tarleton returned to England a hero in 1782. Sir Joshua Reynolds painted his portrait. From 1790 until 1812, with the exception of one year, he represented Liverpool in the House of Commons, where he was noted for his defense of the slave trade. Tarleton received promotions, but he never again led troops in battle, despite his interest and lobbying for a command in the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1815, he was made a baronet and in 1820 a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath, a British order of chivalry created by King George I.  </p>",

            "bodyText": "Charles Lee, a veteran of the Seven Years' War and former British army officer, offered his services to the Patriots in their war for independence. His initially stellar reputation was later damaged by arguments with other Continental Army officers, most notably the Commander-in-Chief General Washington, and failures on the battlefield.<br /> <br /> Born in Cheshire, England in 1732 and later educated in Switzerland, Lee joined the British army in 1744. He later served in foreign armies, including Russia, Poland, and Portugal. In 1773, Lee settled in Virginia. When hostilities between Britain and the American colonies erupted in 1775, Lee chose the revolutionary cause. As second in command of the Continental Army, Lee was appointed head of the Southern Department, which consisted of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia.<br /> <br /> Upon Lee’s arrival in Charleston, South Carolina he went to tour the palmetto log and sand fort under construction on Sullivan’s Island. There he met Colonel <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-moultrie.htm\">William Moultrie</a> and appraised the work being done to defend Charleston Harbor. Lee called the fort a “slaughter pen” and encouraged the construction of a bridge from Mount Pleasant across the marsh to Sullivan’s Island for the inevitable evacuation of a post he deemed vulnerable. Lee as the sole representative of the Continental Army in the state found himself overruled by President <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-rutledge.htm\">John Rutledge</a> of South Carolina who urged Moultrie to remain at Sullivan’s Island and defend the fort. In the days leading up to the British attack, Lee still stressed the importance of finishing the bridge and also removed substantial quantities of gunpowder from the fort, preventing the patriots from turning a victory into a rout of the British.<br /> <br /> Lee garnered substantial praise and admiration for his defense of Charleston in 1776. Though the victory was largely accomplished through the leadership of Col. William Moultrie, Lee received credit and accolades. Ironically, Lee wanted to replace Moultrie with Col. Francis Nash of the North Carolina Continentals on the morning of the fateful victory because of Moultrie’s failure to act in compliance with Lee’s orders to evacuate the fort he considered indefensible.<br /> <br /> <em>“I have the happiness to congratulate You on a very signal success (if I may not call it a victory) which We have gain'd over the Mercennary Instruments of the British Tyrant - I shall not trouble you with a detail of their manouvres or delays - but defer it to another time when I have more leisure to write and you to attend - let it suffice that having lost an opportunity (such as I hope will never again present itself) of taking the Town which on my arrival was utterly defenceless, the Commodore thought proper on Friday last with his whole Squadron consisting of two fifty's six Frigates and a Bomb (the rates of which You will see in the inclosd list) to attack our Fort on Sullivan's Island.”</em> - Lee to Washington on July 1, 1776<br /> <br /> He joined Washington in New York and began criticizing his superior in written correspondence. Longing for Washington’s job and exploiting the recent defeats in New York, Lee penned a Congressman, “Had I the powers, I could do you much good.” Lee’s efforts to undermine General Washington were disrupted when he was captured by the British at a tavern in Basking Ridge, New Jersey in December 1776. Lee was a notable prize for the enemy, and his release finally came in 1778 after the British loss at Saratoga.<br /> <br /> In May 1778, Lee had returned to the Continental Army in time for the Battle of Monmouth. The decisive battle took place on June 28 as the Continental Army shadowed the British through New Jersey after their evacuation from Philadelphia. Washington hoped for a limited engagement that would test his army and inflict a defeat on the British. The Battle of Monmouth occurred when a limited engagement evolved into a full clash of a portion of the Continental Army under Maj. Gen. Lee and the British army. Lee ordered a retreat, resulting in a famous exchange of words between himself and His Excellency George Washington. Washington's presence and the solidity of other Continental regiments turned a potential rout into a battle in which the Americans won the field, allowing the British to escape to New York. The battle resulted in the disgrace of Lee and his court martial. It also intensified the political intrigue Lee orchestrated against General Washington. <br /> <br /> Lee’s critiques of Washington finally reached a boiling point for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-laurens.htm\">John Laurens</a>, a member of Washington’s military family, who challenged Lee to a duel and shot him in the side, wounding the disgraced officer. In 1780, Lee formally resigned from the Continental Army and retired to his estate in Virginia. He died from a fever while visiting Philadelphia in 1782.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The third son of John, third Lord Balfour, Nisbet Balfour was born in Dunbog in County Fife, Scotland in 1743. He entered the service of the British Army as an ensign in 1761, rising to lieutenant in 1765, and a captain in 1770. His first combat experience came at the Battle of Bunker's Hill where he was seriously wounded. He also distinguished himself at the battles at Long Island and Brooklyn. In August 1776 his service in the capture of New York was honored with the assignment to return to Great Britain with the dispatches announcing the success, and was promoted major by brevet. He soon returned to America, and struck up a warm friendship with many fellow officers, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-cornwallis.htm\">Charles Lord Cornwallis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/francis-rawdon.htm\">Francis Lord Rawdon</a>. He was present at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown, and, after being appointed lieutenant colonel of the 23rd regiment in 1778, accompanied Cornwallis to Charleston. <br /> <br /> As the British occupation of South Carolina’s interior began, he was placed in command of the garrison at Ninety Six but did not remain there for long. He assisted Major Patrick Ferguson in the recruitment of loyalist militia. Cornwallis then appointed Balfour Commandant of Charleston in place of Brig. Gen. James Paterson. Arriving in Charleston at the beginning of August, Balfour applied himself efficiently to the job, which involved managing the complex civil affairs of the town and country but also military support of British forces in the area. <br /> <br /> Balfour soon began to draw the anger of revolutionary Charlestonians. For his part Brig. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-moultrie.htm\">William Moultrie</a>, who represented the American POWs, accused Balfour of “violent and arbitrary administration,” asserting that “Balfour, a proud, haughty Scot, carried his authority with a very high hand. His tyrannical, insolent disposition treated the people as the most abject slaves.” As British commandant, Balfour was unyielding toward the revolutionaries. He carried out the commands of his superiors in regard to policies in Charleston and wisely deferred to the Board of Police in civil matters. Balfour's depiction as the villain of the occupation of Charleston can be credited to the writings and memories of Americans like Ramsay and Moultrie as well as his actions. Balfour promoted the transportation of leading patriots to St. Augustine and confirmed the sentence of death on Col. Isaac Hayne for espionage and treason. His indifferent and cruel treatment of closely confining Continental and militia captives on prison ships led many POWs to die of smallpox or fevers. <br /> <br /> After the war, Balfour was promoted to full colonel and appointed as an aide-de-camp to King George III. He became a member of Parliament and saw service as a major general in Flanders. Unmarried, he died a full general at Dunbog in 1823.</p>",

Clinton became a mentor to Rawdon, sharing his wisdom and promoting his advancement. After capturing Forts Clinton and Montgomery, Rawdon arrived in Philadelphia to deliver the good news to General Howe in October 1777.<br /> <br /> By 1778, Rawdon’s mentor Clinton became commander-in-chief of the British North American forces. Rawdon reaped the benefits of his relationship with Clinton when he received an appointment to command the Volunteers of Ireland as a colonel. Rawdon’s role as aide-de-camp to Clinton was also reaffirmed but shortly after, in June, he was appointed Adjutant General while achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. He commanded his regiment at the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778 as British forces evacuated Philadelphia and marched across New Jersey. By June 1779, relations between Clinton and Rawdon had soured on the basis of Clinton’s criticisms of Rawdon’s Irish volunteers. Rawdon resigned from his position of Adjutant General in irritation.<br /> <br /> As efforts turned toward the south, Rawdon joined the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/siege-of-charleston-1780.htm\">Siege of Charleston</a> in the spring of 1780. During the British victory at the Battle of Camden in August, Rawdon commanded <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-cornwallis.htm\">Charles Lord Cornwallis</a>' left wing. After the British defeat at Cowpens, Cornwallis moved the bulk of his army north, leaving Rawdon behind to defend both Georgia and South Carolina with a force too small for the task. Rawdon capably commmanded and resisted Maj. Gen. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nathanael-greene.htm\">Nathanael Greene</a>'s efforts to eliminate British posts in the interior. On April 25, 1781 Rawdon defeated Greene's army of Continentals and militia with a smaller force at the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill, near Camden. Despite the victory, Rawdon withdrew his men to the safety of Monck's Corner. Greene's strategy of pushing the British back to the safety of Charleston proved effective despite suffering battlefield defeats. In June 1781, Rawdon marched from Charleston with 2,000 soldiers to the assistance of the loyalist outpost at Ninety Six, thereby lifting Greene's siege. Given the vulnerability of the garrison, Rawdon evacuated Ninety Six and withdrew to Charleston with the combined force.<br /> <br /> In July 1781, Rawdon was aboard a ship heading to England when the vessel was captured by French belligerents. The ship became part of the French fleet under Admiral Comte de Grasse, and Rawdon became a prisoner. He was eventually exchanged and returned to England in early 1782. Before he had returned home, Rawdon began his term in the Irish House of Commons in 1781, continuing until 1783. In 1783, in exchange for his service in the American rebellion, he was made an English peer (Baron Rawdon). By 1789, Rawdon’s mother had ascended to the barony of Hastings after the death of Rawdon’s brother, prompting Rawdon to add Hastings to his name.<br /> <br /> In 1793, Rawdon-Hastings returned to military service to fight against the French. He became the Earl of Moira after the passing of his father, and he was appointed major general. He began his long service in the House of Lords in 1793 as well. An Irish native, he was an impassioned speaker on the issue of reform in the Irish administration and Catholic enfranchisement. He also continued to climb the ladder of military rank. By 1798 he had been promoted to lieutenant general and by 1803 he had been made a full general. In 1803, Rawdon-Hastings became commander-in-chief of British forces in Scotland.<br /> <br /> In November 1812, Rawdown-Hastings was appointed Governor-General of India, a position he held from October 1813 until January 1823. His achievements included overseeing victory in the Gurkha War and the purchase of the island of Singapore. He oversaw the extension of British imperial control over India. In 1824, he was appointed Governor of Malta but died off the coast of Italy two years later on a voyage home with his wife. She returned his body to Malta for burial but followed his instructions to cut off his right hand, preserve it, and bury it with her upon her death. </p>",

            "bodyText": "A younger son of John Campbell, fourth duke of Argyll, William entered the Royal Navy in 1745 and served in India. As captain of the <em>Nightingale</em>, in 1763 he put into Charleston, where he met Sarah Izard, a rich heiress, whom he wed on April 17, 1763. Returning to Britain, he successfully ran for Parliament from Argyllshire. In 1766 the Rockingham administration appointed him governor of Nova Scotia, and in June 1773 his family’s influence secured his promotion to the governorship of South Carolina.<br /> <br /> Campbell arrived in Charleston in June 1775. By then the revolutionary Provincial Congress and its Council of Safety had usurped royal authority, and Campbell faced impossible obstacles as governor. Rumors of arming Indians and slaves against the colonists complicated his task even further and eventually led revolutionary authorities to execute <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-jeremiah.htm\">Thomas Jeremiah</a>, a free black harbor pilot, who was accused of being a ringleader of the impending uprising. Governor Campbell was powerless to intervene. Campbell was, however, able to communicate with loyalists in the backcountry. His optimistic reports of their strength influenced British decisions to attack South Carolina in 1776 and 1780.<br /> <br /> “The powers of Government are wrested out of my hands. I can neither protect, nor punish; therefore with the Advice of His Majys Council I apply to You & desire that in this dreadful emergency You will aid me with all the assistance in Your power, in enforcing the Laws, & protecting His Majys Servants.” Lord William Campbell on August 15, 1775 addressing the House of Assembly<br /> <br /> After patriots learned of Campbell’s activities, he was forced to flee from Charleston on September 15, 1775. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-sullivan-s-island.htm\">Battle of Sullivan’s Island</a> in June 1776, Campbell commanded gun crews aboard the <i>Bristol</i> and received wounds from which he never completely recovered.

            "bodyText": "<p>If ever one individual left an indelible mark on the National Park Service, that individual might well have been Frank “Boss” Pinkley. Frank Pinkley (1881-1940) was a farm boy from Missouri whose doctor ordered him to go to Arizona for six months in 1900 to recuperate from a mild case of tuberculosis. If he had a round-trip ticket he never used it and a year later he accepted a government job as caretaker of Casa Grande ruin, where he lived in a tent and dug his own well. After a brief time in the Arizona State Legislature, Pinkley returned to his job at Casa Grande. Before his death in 1940, rose to the position of Superintendent of the Southwest National Monuments, administering 28 different parks throughout Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah.<br />  </p> <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1592515570776\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1592515570776\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1592515570776\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1592515570776\">Contributions to Tumacácori</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1592515570776\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1592515570776\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\"> <p>Tumacácori came under Pinkley's leadership in 1919 and for the next 10 years, he tirelessly worked to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/preservation.htm\">preserve, repair, and restore the mission</a>. Much of his effort focused on the stabilization of the church and repairing damage caused by treasure hunters. When he first saw the church, much of the façade was missing, the roof had fallen in, walls had crumbled, and treasure hunters had left gaping holes in the floors and walls of the nave and sanctuary.</p> <p>Pinkley embarked on a fundraising drive in the local area. With contributions and an allotment from the National Park Service, he raised $2,155 ($28,545 in 2020 dollars). Using these funds most judiciously, Pinkley decided to imitate the “methods of the builders in making our repairs.” <br /> <br /> He used local laborers who produced adobe from the raw materials on the site to rebuild the walls. To reroof the church, Pinkley contacted the U.S. Forest Service to obtain the pine timbers needed for the beams from the Santa Rita mountains. Boss Pinkley and his team of laborers then used ax and adze to shape the logs, much as the original builders had. The floor was cleared of debris and re-laid. Laborers filled in the holes in the walls, rebuilt the stairs to the tower, reconstructed the dome, and partially restored the pulpit. They also reconstructed the arched pediment. Tumacácori came back to life.</p> <p>Besides the repair of the church, Pinkley made huge efforts to interpret the story of the mission. He wrote the first interpretive guide for the fledgling park, to guide visitors through the mission complex. He believed that Tumacácori should be educational, communicating the history of the early settlement of the southwest. As early as 1919, he lobbied for the building of a museum and created the first rudimentary “visitors center” with a handmade desk and some photos of Kino missions in Sonora. Under his guidance, by 1939 the park saw more visitors than any other park under his management save one.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p><br />  </p> <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1592515570770\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1592515570770\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1592515570770\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1592515570770\"><span>Contributions to Gran Quivira</span></a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1592515570770\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1592515570770\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\">In 1923 Pinkley spent two weeks helping Edgar Lee Hewett and the School of American Archeology with archeological excavations at Gran Quivira National Monument. During this project, Pinkley assisted with the removal of debris from the Mission. Pinkly later reported to Stephen Mather, head of the National Park Service:<br /> <br /> The work of clearing the debris out of the mission began on the morning of the 16th and continued until the night of the 21st. It was a straight job of moving dirt and rock, it was not necessary to sift it or examine it closely for artifacts. This being the case, as many men and teams as could work without interference were put on the job and it was rushed through, so far as the money could carry it, in a few days. It was by no means enough money to complete the cleaning of the mission and the complex of rooms adjoining the mission had to be left practically untouched. Let us hope that future appropriations will allow us to continue this work a little at a time year after year until real results can be shown at this very interesting monument.<br /> <br /> This was the first official archeological work completed at Gran Quivira.</div> </div> </div> <p>In 1924 Pinkley was appointed as superintendent of the Southwestern National Monuments Office (a division of the National Park Service) and became in charge of 14 separate monuments which later grew to 28 and included many of the best-known public lands in the American southwest. He was allotted $15,000 for the administration of these monuments, a figure that worked out to 9.2 cents per visitor. The monuments were staffed by a group of men and their wives, all volunteers called \"custodians.\"<br /> <br /> As their leader, Pinkley was called \"The Boss,\" a nickname he gladly adopted and used when signing monthly Southwest National Monument reports. These reports contained summaries from the Custodians at each monument, as well as ruminations from The Boss:<br /> <i><br /> \"They all act like they thought the world would promptly go to pieces if they quit work for a few days, not that I blame them for I feel the same way about myself. However, we haven't lost our sense of humor and can still get a lot of fun out of the work and those saving graces that carry us over the rough spots. My general idea is that we ought to be serious in our work and plans---but not too serious.\"</i><br /> <br /> Each summer Pinkley would load up his family into their Model T, \"Baby\", and drive a circuit visiting all of his monuments. <br /> <br /> In 1940 Pinkley was able to get funding to hold the Southwest National Monuments first Custodian School, a three day conference at Casa Grande National Monument. For his effort, most of the 27 National Monuments' Custodians and their wives were able to attend the meeting. During his opening speech Pinkley reflected on his time as Superintendent, his near 40 years of work, and thanked the wives for their efforts to protect and promote the National Monuments as much as the Custodians. In closing he said:<br /> <i><br /> \"May we leave this meeting three days hence with a bigger and broader comprehension of our work and a fixed determination to do it better this next year than it has ever been done before</i>.\"<br /> <br /> Pinkley then returned to his chair, sat down, and promptly died of a massive heart attack.</p> <p><br /> Highly esteemed and well-loved, the custodians of the Southwestern National Monuments memorialized their leader:</p> <p><em>“Through your persistent work, your determination, and your everlasting belief in and loyalty to the ideals of the National Park Service, you built up the strongest unit in that service…” -</em> Southwestern National Monuments Monthly Report, Feb. 1940</p> <p><em>“Frank Pinkley was the best loved man in the National Park Service.” - </em>Eivind T. Scoyen, Acting Supterintendent, Sequoia National Park</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Stanford White was an American architect. He was a partner in the firm McKim, Mead & White, one of the celebrated architectural practices of the late nineteenth century. He designed numerous influential civic, institutional, and religious buildings, as well as notable homes for American capitalists. He is also remembered in popular culture for his notorious murder, the result of a scandalous love affair.</p> <p>White was born in New York City, the son literary and musical critic Richard Grant White (1822-1885) and Alexina Black Mease (1830-1921). White’s father was not wealthy, but socialized within the New York art world that included figures such as the painter John LaFarge, designer Louis Comfort Tiffany, and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.</p> <p>White had no formal architectural education, but was trained in the office of the influential architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-1886), just as Richardson was beginning work on Boston’s Trinity Church. In 1879, White formed his own firm in partnership with William Rutherford Mead (1846-1928) and Charles Follen McKim (1847-1909), and together established the most successful and influential architectural practice of its time. In the early years of their practice, the firm specialized in the design of informal summer homes for the wealthy, clustered in the areas of Long Island, the New Jersey shore, and Newport, Rhode Island.</p> <p>In later years, the firm established a reputation for classical architecture in the tradition of the Italian Renaissance. Among the celebrated examples of this era (sometimes referred to as the American Renaissance), are the Boston Public Library (1887), the Columbia University library (1893), the University Club (1899), the Morgan Library (1899), and Pennsylvania Station (1904-1910; demolished). Many of their residential projects for the American millionaires during this time are also based on classical concepts.</p> <p>White is known for his imaginative, but gracefully proportioned structures set off by exquisite Italian Renaissance ornamentation. Among his more important commissions in New York City were Madison Square Garden (1891), the Washington Memorial Arch (1891), the New York Herald Building (1892), and Madison Square Presbyterian Church (1906).</p> <p>Within the firm, White landed the most commissions for private houses—New York city mansions as well as country estate homes located at Long Island, the Hudson Valley, and Newport, Rhode Island. White appreciated the lavish lifestyle of his wealthy clients, and he knew how their houses had to perform—like a fine hotel, or theatrical stage with historical references.</p> <p>White was a fluent designer. He could draw and illustrated magazine covers. He designed furniture, picture frames, pedestal bases for sculpture. Outgoing and social, he possessed a large circle of friends and acquaintances, many of whom became clients. He extended the firm’s architectural services to include interior decoration, dealing in art and antiques, and even planning and designing parties. He possessed a discerning eye for beauty and historical interest. He frequented the antique shops of Europe, procuring antiques and architectural salvage to ornament the homes of his firm’s clients. He designed and decorated Fifth Avenue mansions and country homes for the most socially prominent families of American wealth, among them Astors and Vanderbilts.</p> <p>White’s personal life is legendary. He was a tall, flamboyant man with red hair. He impressed others with his wit, charm, and generosity. In 1884, White married Bessie Springs Smith (1862-1950), daughter of a socially prominent Long Island family. But White had an insatiable appetite for young girls. On the night of June 25, 1906, Henry Thaw (1871-1947), a Pittsburgh millionaire with a history of severe mental instability, shot and killed White at Madison Square Garden in a fit of jealousy over a prior affair to Thaw’s wife, the beautiful actress, model, and chorus girl Evelyn Nesbit (1884/84-1967). During the following months, in what became known as “The Trial of the Century,” White was posthumously subject to a frenzy of popular press invective, which excoriated his character and his professional achievements as an architect. Though many facts of White’s life may have been distorted by the press, few of his friends or associates came forward to defend him.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Stanford White's architecture is remembered everywhere as a testament to a great era in America’s built heritage.</p>",

He was one of nine children of George Henry Warren I (1823–1892) and Mary Caroline Phoenix Warren (1832–1901). Whitney Warren attended Columbia University for one year in 1882, and then studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Warren also worked as an apprentice in the offices of McKim, Mead & White before joining Charles Wetmore to establish the firm Warren & Wetmore. Whitney Warren was a bon vivant and active in New York Society, most notably in Stanford White's inner circle.</p> <p>Warren & Wetmore's most notable early commission was the New York Yacht Club, designed in 1899. It was a place where Warren must have come into contact with many members of the Vanderbilt family. Whitney Warren enlarged Idle Hour for William K. Vanderbilt in 1903, and became a close friend of his. He later took over the design of Grand Central Station from Reed and Stem in 1906, the same year that Frederick Vanderbilt brought him in to make changes at Hyde Park. Florence Vanderbilt Twombly commissioned Warren to design her New York City townhouse on Fifth Avenue and 71st Street, and her daughter Ruth had him design a tennis court and pool house at Florham. Warren also designed houses for the next generation of Vanderbilts including 7 East 91st Street for Adele Sloane and J. Burden as well as Eagle's Nest in Centerport, Long Island, for William K. Vanderbilt Jr. In 1909, the Warren & Wetmore-designed Vanderbilt Hotel located at the corner of 34th Street and Park Avenue opened. The Vanderbilts actively supported Warren & Wetmore giving them the commission for numerous railroad stations and hotels.</p> <p>In 1884, Warren married Charlotte Augusta Tooker (1864–1951) in Newport, Rhode Island. Charlotte was the eldest daughter of Gabriel Mead Tooker, a prominent New York lawyer and member of Mrs. Astor's famous Four Hundred.</p> <p>Warren died after a nine-week illness on January 24, 1943 at New York Hospital in New York City. At the time of his death, Warren resided at 280 Park Avenue in New York City and was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club, and the Church and South Side Sportsmen's Clubs.</p> <p>In 1917, Warren received the Medal of Honor from the American Institute of Architects.</p> <p>Notable works by Warren and Wetmore include the New York Yacht Club (1898–9), Grand Central Terminal, New York, the Biltmore Hotel (1914), Marshall Field Building (1920), Equitable Trust Building (1918), the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Honolulu (1927), and the rebuilding of the University Library, Leuven, Belgium (1920) which had been destroyed by the Germans in World War I.</p>",

He served two terms as governor and three terms as a senator for the state. Norbeck was an outspoken advocate for many causes during his service as a governor and congressman. He advocated for the needs of the agricultural community, founding a state-enterprise program intended to help farmers. He also supported the women’s suffrage movement. Beyond these causes, Norbeck was an outdoorsman and conservationist, working to advocate for the outdoors in politics. He supported the Migratory Bird Act of 1929, advocated for the accessibility of wilderness by building highways in the Black Hills, and helped establish many of South Dakota’s public lands.<br /> <br /> Norbeck had a role in developing many units of the National Park Service today. He introduced the very first bill to make the Badlands into a National Park. By the end of his term as a US senator, he secured its National Monument status, but never stopped pushing for its designation as a park. Known as a significant patron of Mount Rushmore, Norbeck secured federal funds for the carving of the memorial. He worked directly with two presidents and Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of the memorial, to ensure its completion. Norbeck was also involved in the establishment of Wind Cave National Park and Custer State Park.",

            "bodyText": "<p>John Cabell Breckinridge graduated from Centre College in 1839 and, after studying law at Transylvania University, was admitted to the bar in 1840. During the Mexican-American War Breckinridge served as major of the 3rd Kentucky Volunteers. He was elected to Congress twice in the early 1850s and in 1856 was elected vice president under President James Buchanan. In 1860 he ran for president, but lost to Republican candidate <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. When the South began to secede in response to Lincoln's election, Breckinridge, having been elected to the US Senate, stressed the right of secession.<br /> <br /> However, when Kentucky remained in the Union, Breckinridge resigned his Senate seat and joined the Confederate army, receiving a commission as a brigadier general. He was promoted to major general following the Battle of Shiloh, in which he was wounded. Breckinridge developed an intense disdain for fellow Confederate officer, General Braxton Bragg, considering him to be incompetent. Bragg likewise had an immense dislike for Breckinridge, accusing him of being a drunk. The sentiments of both individuals came to a head at the Battle of Stones River during which Bragg ordered Breckinridge's men to make a near suicidal assault against the Union lines. Breckinridge lost one third of his command and was himself emotionally devastated. He did however continue to serve under Bragg at the battles of Chickamauga and Missionary Ridge.<br /> <br /> In 1864 Breckinridge was brought east to command troops in the Shenandoah Valley. There he defeated Major General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/franz-sigel.htm\">Franz Sigel</a> at the Battle of New Market in May. Breckinridge was briefly attached to General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-e-lee.htm\">Robert E. Lee</a>'s Army of Northern Virginia before being ordered once again to the Shenandoah Valley. Following the successful defense of Lynchburgh Breckinridge joined Lieutenant General Jubal Early's Army of the Valley District and participated in the Battle of Monocacy. He was the second highest ranking officer in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jubal-early.htm\">Jubal Early</a>'s army and moved with it to the outskirts of Washington and then back into the Shenandoah Valley.<br /> <br /> John C. Breckinridge's last major battle was fought on September 19, 1864, Third Winchester. Following the Confederate defeat, Breckinridge was ordered by the Confederate War Department to take command of the new Department of Western Virginia and East Tennessee, he was to leave the majority of his forces in the Valley with Early. In February 1865 he was appointed Secretary of War by Confederate President <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jefferson-davis.htm\">Jefferson Davis</a>. As the Confederate government abandoned Richmond, Virginia, it was Breckinridge who saw to it that the archives of the Confederacy were not destroyed, preserving the records of the Confederate government and war effort for history.<br /> <br /> Following the war, Breckinridge fled the country in a self-imposed exile that lasted until 1869. He then returned to his native Lexington, Kentucky and resumed his law practice until his death of cirrhosis in 1875.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Nathan George Evans served in the US Army and then the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. His ancestors emigrated from Wales to Pennsylvania in 1701, eventually settling in South Carolina in 1736. One of his ancestors rode with Francis Marion during the American Revolution and his older brother, Chesley, was a signer of South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession in 1860.<br /> <br /> Evans graduated from Randolph-Macon College in Virginia before receiving an appointment to West Point in 1844 through the help of Senator John C. Calhoun. He graduated 36th of 38 in the class of 1848. It was there that he was dubbed “Shanks” because, according to his classmate and eventual Union General John C. Tidball, he was knock-kneed. He served on the frontier through the 1850’s, eventually being promoted to captain and commanding Company H of the Second US Cavalry.<br /> <br /> When South Carolina seceded, Evans resigned his commission and returned home. With the creation of the Confederacy, he became a major of cavalry in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States. On April 12, 1861, from a position on Sullivan’s Island, he witnessed the firing on Fort Sumter and the outbreak of the Civil War. At First Manassas, as a temporary colonel, he recognized the threat to the Confederate left and his small brigade held back the numerically superior Union forces until reinforcements could arrive. For this action, he was rewarded with permanent rank as colonel and command of the Seventh Brigade of the Confederate Army of the Potomac.<br /> <br /> The highlight of Evans’ career came on October 21, 1861 at the Battle of Ball’s Bluff near Leesburg, Virginia. Though not present on the field there, as he was in Leesburg evaluating the possibility of a second attack from another direction, he skillfully moved his troops to where they were most needed, finally inflicting a costly defeat on the Union forces. For this victory, he was promoted to brigadier general.<br /> <br /> In December, Evans was transferred to South Carolina where his command skirmished occasionally with Union troops west of Charleston for the next few months. He was present, but not significantly involved, at the Battle of Secessionville in June 1862. In mid-July, he was given command of a South Carolina brigade and ordered to Richmond. He participated in the battles of Second Manassas and Antietam but, on November 6, was transferred to North Carolina. The remainder of the war was somewhat anti-climactic for Evans as alcohol and his irascible nature kept him in trouble with his superiors. He never again achieved the success or the acclaim he had earned at Ball’s Bluff.<br /> <br /> Heavily outnumbered, he directed the unsuccessful fighting at Kinston, NC on December 14, 1862, afterward becoming involved in a controversy about his order to burn the bridge there before all his men had retreated across it. Some 400 were captured and Evans was accused of having been drunk at the time. A hearing acquitted him and he returned to duty following which he and his “Tramp Brigade” were ordered west where he reported to General Joseph E. Johnston at Jackson, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> With the fall of Vicksburg, Evans was ordered back to Charleston, arriving in late August 1863. It was not long, though, before he was embroiled in a personal dispute with his commanding officer, Brig. Gen. Roswell Ripley, which resulted in a court-martial. Again acquitted, he quickly became involved in yet another personal dispute, this time with General P.G.T. Beauregard.<br /> <br /> On April 16, 1864, however, these all became moot as Evans suffered a serious head injury in a carriage accident in Charleston. He never again commanded troops in the field. His recovery took nearly a year by which time the Confederacy had collapsed. After the war, Evans became principal of a small school in Midway, Alabama. His head injury continued to cause problems, however, and contributed to his death on November 28, 1868.</p>",

From early statehood, the majority of elected officials in Alaska were members of the Democratic Party. In the early 1970s, the left-leaning wing of the Alaska Democratic Party expressed dissatisfaction with the status quo and revolted against the party establishment. The Alaska Ad Hoc Committee of Young Democrats, of which Buchholdt was a member, went so far as to endorse Jay Hammond, a Republican, for governor against the incumbent of their own party, Governor Bill Egan. Jay Hammond won the governorship and the 1974 election became a turning point in Alaska’s political history, opening the door for Republican-led administrations and state legislatures for many years to come.<br />  </p> <h4>From Claveria, Phillipines To Anchorage, Alaska</h4> <p>Buchholdt was born in the coastal city of Claveria in the northern Philippines in 1934. This was also the year that the U.S. Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act that committed to giving the Philippines its independence over a 12-year transition. The Philippines was in political turmoil during the early 1930s as global conflict was about to turn into World War II. Some political factions wanted independence and others wanted to remain a territory of the U.S. The constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines was approved by the voters and the first legislative elections were held in 1935.</p> <p>Buchholdt graduated high school early, when she was 15, and traveled to the U.S. to continue her education. She attended Mount Saint Mary’s University in Los Angeles, earning a degree in Zoology. She completed graduate school at University of Nevada Las Vegas, where she met her future husband, Jon Buchholdt. Following graduate school, she had a career as an elementary school teacher. Buchholdt and her husband moved to Anchorage with their four children in 1965.</p> <p>In Anchorage, Buchholdt committed herself to her new home. She actively worked to assess the needs of the Anchorage community and improve community services for children and women. Buchholdt co-founded the Boys and Girls Club of Alaska and was an active member of the March of Dimes, the League of Women Voters, the Ad Hoc Committee of Young Democrats in Alaska, and was an appointed member of the Alaska State Advisory Committee to the US Commission on Civil Rights. During the 1972 presidential elections, Buchholdt was the Alaska coordinator for the George McGovern presidential campaign.<br />  </p> <h4>After The Election</h4> <p>After the 1974 election, Buchholdt was reelected for three more terms as a House Representative for the Anchorage District and served until 1982.</p> <p>During this time, Buchholdt participated in passing legislation to improve education, environmental protections, public art programs, supporting victims of domestic violence, mental health services, oil and gas taxes, infrastructure, and establishing legislature governing the Permanent Fund Dividend program.</p> <p>Buchholdt returned to college in 1988, attending the District of Columbia School of Law, from which she and her husband both graduated in 1991. Together they opened a law firm in Anchorage.</p>   <h4>Cultivating the Anchorage Community</h4> <p>Buchholdt researched the lives of important figures in Filipinx Alaskan history and published <em>Filipinos in Alaska: 1788-1958</em>, the only publication to date that focuses on the contribution of Filipinx Americans to Alaska’s history. She produced a documentary film on the same topic. Buchholdt also served as president of the Filipino-American National Historical Society.<br /> <br /> Buchholdt is known for her active membership and leadership in civil rights and community organizations. Other notable leadership roles include serving as president of the National Order of Women Legislators in 1980, the first Asian-American to hold the position. She was the first woman president of the Filipino Community of Anchorage and served for two terms. In 1994, she served as director of Alaska’s Office of Equal Opportunity. Although she died in 2007, the Anchorage community continues to recognize and benefit from her contributions.</p>   <h4>Additional Information</h4> <h4> </h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/adn/obituary.aspx?n=thelma-buchholdt&pid=97462264\">Thelma Garcia Buchholdt Obituary </a><br /> <a href=\"http://akleg.gov/100years/legislature.php?id=9\">100 Years of Alaska's Legislature \"From Territorial Days to Today\"</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<blockquote> <p><strong><em>He was the best friend the Cheyenne and Arapaho ever had.</em></strong><br /> - George Bent</p> </blockquote> <p>Edward W. Wynkoop was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 19, 1836, Ned (as he was known) followed his sister and her husband to the Kansas Territory in 1856. He later moved to the Colorado mining settlements after being appointed sheriff of Arapaho County. In 1861, he met singer and actress Louise Matilda Brown Wakely, whom he married in August.</p> <p>He arrived in Colorado at a time of conflict with the Indians native to that region - the Cheyenne and Arapaho. Like many Native American tribes, they had been slowly forced from their traditional lands in the Central Plains by settlers surging westward. The Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1851 identified lands for them in what is today eastern Colorado. By 1858, a gold rush to the Rocky Mountain area meant a new flood of settlers and miners on their lands, bringing with them new camps and settlements.<br />  </p> <h3><strong>A Path Toward Tragedy</strong></h3> <p><br /> In February 1861, Congress created the Colorado territory partially from Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal lands ceded to the US through the Treaty of Fort Wise. This treaty, signed in 1861 by only a handful of Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs, including Southern Cheyenne Peace Chief Black Kettle, created the Fort Wise (later Fort Lyon) Reservation. However, most of the Cheyenne and Arapaho rejected the treaty and refused to leave their lands.<br /> <br /> Six weeks after the Fort Wise Treaty was signed, the Civil War began. Wynkoop, initially appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment Infantry, Colorado Volunteers, was promoted to major after the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Battle of Glorieta Pass</a>. Later that year the unit reorganized into a cavalry regiment. In 1864, Wynkoop assumed command of Fort Lyon, on the Santa Fe Trail.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>This white man is not here to laugh at us...but...unlike the rest of his race, he comes with confidence in the pledges given by the red man.</em></strong><br /> - Cheyenne Peace Chief Black Kettle</p> </blockquote> <p>Tensions between the Cheyenne and Arapaho and the Americans erupted into the Indian War of 1864. Black Kettle and other chiefs, sent a letter to Fort Lyon, which stated their desire for peace. Wynkoop, who received the letter, met with these chiefs and headmen at their encampment near the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. Wynkoop impressed Black Kettle, who said: “This white man is not here to laugh at us…but…unlike the rest of his race, he comes with confidence in the pledges given by the red man.”<br /> <br /> Wynkoop convinced some chiefs to meet with Territorial Governor (and ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs) John Evans in Denver. During this meeting, the chiefs agreed to report to the Upper Arkansas Agency and place themselves under the protection of the U.S. Army. By late October 1864, approximately 750 Cheyenne and Arapaho were camped along the Big Sandy Creek in compliance with the Army’s instructions. On November 26, Wynkoop left Fort Lyon to report to Fort Riley, Kansas, transferring his command to fellow 1st Regiment Major Scott Anthony.<br />  </p> <h3><strong>Sand Creek Massacre and the Aftermath</strong></h3> <p><br /> On the morning of November 29, 1864, Col. John M. Chivington <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">led an attack on the Indian encampment at the Big Sandy Creek</a>. Troops opened fire despite the presence of an American flag and white flag of truce. Soldiers killed many Cheyenne and Arapaho as they tried to flee along the creek bed and mutilated some of their bodies. Soldiers later burned the village. Chivington’s men killed about 220 Cheyenne and Arapaho (mostly women, children and elderly) in what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>The slaughter of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho at Sand Creek led to more fighting on the plains, prompting Congress to demand </em><em>peace negotiations.</em></strong></p> </blockquote> <p>When Wynkoop learned of the attack his shock gave way to rage, and he accused Chivington of murdering friendly Cheyenne and Arapaho. In January 1865, he returned to Fort Lyon to investigate the incident. After visiting the massacre site several months later, he wrote<img alt=\"Black and white photograph of Black Kettle.\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|300|395|0|10|10\" height=\"395\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:5693667|0|\" src=\"/fols/learn/historyculture/images/Black-Kettle-with-drop-shadow-small.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;\" title=\"Black Kettle2\" width=\"300\" /> that the site still contained human remains, “three-fourths of them…women and children, among whom many were infants.”<br /> <br /> Congressional and military investigations condemned the attack, but Chivington was never held accountable. The slaughter of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho at Sand Creek led to more fighting on the plains, prompting Congress to demand peace negotiations.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Black Kettle, whose clan was one of several at Sand Creek when the soldiers attacked. This photograph comes from a group picture taken with the other chiefs who met with Colorado territorial governor John Evans at Camp Weld. (Public Domain)</em></strong></p> </blockquote> <p>In October 1865, Wynkoop escorted peace commissioners to a meeting with Cheyenne and Arapaho on the Little Arkansas River. The resulting Treaty of the Little Arkansas condemned the Sand Creek massacre, promised compensation to victims’ families, but it also required the tribes to give up lands in the Colorado Territory and relocate to southwestern Kansas and the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). Black Kettle, who survived the horror at Sand Creek, and other chiefs agreed to the terms. Violence erupted when some of the Southern Cheyenne, with no knowledge of this new treaty, returned to find settlers on their land.<br />  </p> <h3><strong>Indian Agent</strong></h3> <p><br /> Wynkoop’s service as a soldier and advisor on the Cheyenne and Arapaho, led President Andrew Johnson to appoint him special agent to the two tribes in 1866. Indian Agent Wynkoop established his agency at Fort Larned and worked over the next year to keep peace between settlers and the tribes.<br /> <br /> Congress amended the Treaty of the Little Arkansas, eliminating the Indian lands along the Smoky Hill River, but the Cheyenne and Arapaho refused to give up these lands. In April 1867, General Winfield Scott Hancock made matters worse when he <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">destroyed a Cheyenne-Lakota village on the Pawnee Fork</a>.<br />  </p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>I most certainly refuse to again be the instrument of murder of innocent women and children.</em></strong><br /> - Edward Wynkoop</p> </blockquote> <p>In October 1867, Agent Wynkoop and a peace commission met with the tribes on the Medicine Lodge River. The resulting Treaty of Medicine Lodge established reservations in the Indian Territory. Many Cheyenne, still refusing to give up their home along the Smoky Hill River, refused to sign the treaty. To get their signatures, commissioners agreed to allow the Cheyenne and Arapaho to remain until the buffalo herds disappeared. However, after attacks on white settlements, the Army began a campaign against all the Southern tribes.<br /> <br /> Wynkoop advocated the relocation of friendly Indians to Fort Larned, but the Army rejected his plan. Fearing retribution, Black Kettle moved his band of Cheyenne to the Washita River in Indian Territory. U.S. troops <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">attacked and destroyed his village on November 27, 1868</a> in what would be called the Battle of the Washita. Black Kettle and his wife were killed in the attack.<br /> <br /> After Washita, Wynkoop realized that he was powerless to protect the Cheyenne and Arapaho. On November 28, he resigned as Indian Agent. He later wrote: “I most certainly refuse to again be the instrument of murder of innocent women and children.”</p> <h3><strong>Passing</strong></h3> <p><br /> Edward Wynkoop died at the age of 56 of kidney disease in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on September 11, 1891. He is buried in the National Cemetery in Santa Fe. During his remarkable life he witnessed and participated in some of the most pivotal events in the history of the American West. In 1910, George Bent, a Southern Cheyenne Interpreter and Sand Creek Massacre survivor, wrote: “He…was the best friend the Cheyenne and Arapaho ever had.”</p>",

            "bodyText": "Barbara Charline Jordan was the third daughter born to a Baptist preacher in the greater Fifth Ward area of Houston, Texas. Jordan grew up in a religious and supportive family where she was encouraged to pursue her dreams. Early on in her academic career she grew a fond appreciation for public speech and debate. Jordan not only developed a skill for political debate and practicing law, but also developed the skill to teach the discipline as well. She graduated from the prestigious historically black Texas Southern University and in 1959, was hired to teach Political Science at the Tuskegee Institute, now the private historically black Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama.<br /> <br /> Jordan eventually entered into private law practice but was compelled to advocate for justice on a broader scale. After a successful campaign, she became the first African American elected to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction in 1966 and served until 1972. She also became the first African American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives from the South where she served from 1973 to 1979. Additionally, she became the first black female to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 1976.<br /> <br /> Over her lifetime, Jordan became a recipient of several honors and recognitions, but one of the greatest of many came when she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994 by the 42<sup>nd</sup> president of the United States of America, Bill Clinton. Jordan is best remembered for her riveting remarks to the house Judiciary Committee during the impeachment hearings against the 37<sup>th</sup> president of the United States, Richard Nixon. The remarks she offered amplified American political oratory.<br /> <br /> Barbara Jordan met with untimely ailing and was the first African American woman to be buried in the Texas Senate Cemetery. The Barbara Jordan-Mikey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University is named in her honor. The Barbara Jordan Freedom Foundation was established in 2010 and is dedicated to continuing her legacy in securing truth, justice and rights for all people.",

Her parents Vencil and Josephine Sedlacek were immigrants from Bohemia. They had arrived in America in 1866 and settled in Nebraska to file a homestead claim shortly before Fannie's birth in 1870.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The 1870s and 1880s were difficult years in Nebraska. The Panic of 1873 led to a four year economic depression and falling farm prices. This was worsened with droughts, plagues of locusts, blizzards. These and other hardships from her childhood would help prepare her for life in the Alaskan frontier.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Fannie's mother died when she was six. Her father remarried soon after. He proved up on their homestead in 1875, sold it, and moved the family to a rented farm nearby.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Fannie Sedlacek left home at the age of sixteen making her way west cooking for railroad construction crews. She found her way to the Klondike gold rush stampeders. <br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Staking a claim in August 1900 on a stampede to Clear Creek, she met and soon married Angus McKenzie. In January, 1903, Fannie left Angus and set off on an 800 mile hike down the Yukon River ending up in Fairbanks. She made her way to the remote Kantishna Hills near Mount McKinley (now Denali) among the hundreds of hopeful prospectors in 1905.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Fannie arrived with a portable stove and food supplies and quickly opened for business to feed hungry stampeders. The gold proved too sparse and the population of prospectors and miners in the district. The hastily constructed community of Eureka (now Kantishna) dwindled to about 50 hardy souls. Fannie stayed filing multiple mining claims and built a life for herself.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Fannie met Joe Quigley who was one of the first to pursue lode mining in the district and together they staked and mined their claims in the area. They met in 1906, but did not officially marry until 1918. Both Fannie and Joe hunted moose, caribou, and Dall sheep for their meat and trapped marten and other animals in the winter to get furs to sell and wear. Fannie maintained large vegetable gardens and used nearby prospect tunnels for cold storage of produce and meat.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Fannie was a practicing naturalist and nurse. In 1920, during the Spanish flu pandemic, she worked at the Nenana Hospital in Nenana, Alaska.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In 1930, Joe suffered a mining injury that ended his mining career. Several years later, Joe and Fannie parted, splitting their income from the sale of their claims. Fannie stayed in Kantishna while Joe moved to Seattle. <br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Fannie embraced this hardworking Kantishna lifestyle for nearly 40 years dying at her home at the age of 73 on August 25, 1944. Today Fannie's yellow frame house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It serves as a vivid reminder of Fannie Quigley, Alaska pioneer mining legend from Denali Park and Preserve’s historic past.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> For a comprehensive overview of her life, it is worth reading <a href=\"https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/Searching+for+Fannie+Quigley\">Searching for Fannie Quigley</a> by historian Jane Haigh.</p>",

Indeed, through much of that time period Lash was vocally committed to a socialist revolution in the United States and he actively campaigned for abolition of mandatory military training. He became a leader in the Student League for Industrial Democracy, founded the Association of Unemployed College Alumni, and served as an officer in the American Student Union. Perhaps most notably, however, Lash was responsible for organizing various antiwar demonstrations on college campuses from 1934 to 1941, in which students refused to attend class for an hour.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Lash's antiwar convictions, however, were tempered by Hitler's rise to power in Germany, and by the late 1930s he favored U.S. participation in a coalition to contain fascism. He demonstrated this newfound commitment by briefly serving with Loyalist forces in the Spanish Civil War before returning to the United States to aid the Loyalist cause as a student leader. Shortly after his return, however, the student movement began to collapse amidst infighting over Stalin's nonaggression pact with Hitler. Lash placed himself on the anticommunist side of this debate, and in 1939 he was summoned to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee to answer questions about Communist infiltration of the American Youth Congress.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">It was at this meeting that Lash first met Eleanor Roosevelt. The first lady was captivated by the youthful and brilliant Lash, and a warm friendship developed that would last until ER's death in 1962. Initially impressed by Lash's record with the AYC on behalf of antiwar causes, she was responsible for involving Lash in FDR's presidential campaign of 1940 as the director of the DNC's Youth Committee. In time Lash became one of the first lady's most trusted advisers. Both endured criticism for the friendship they shared, Lash from radical colleagues who disdained the bourgeois liberalism of the New Deal, and the first lady from conservatives who recoiled at the idea of the president's wife commingling with upstart student agitators. J. Edgar Hoover was so suspicious of ER's friendship with Lash that he instructed FBI agents to bug Lash's hotel room and keep track of his whereabouts.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Lash remained committed to ER's political work and the Roosevelt legacy after FDR's death in 1945. He co-founded Americans for Democratic Action with ER and other liberal Democrats in 1946, and then went to work for the New York Post from 1950 to 1966. It was only after sixteen years with the Post that Lash resigned to serve as ER's official biographer (at Elliott Roosevelt's invitation) and in 1971 he published Eleanor and Franklin. His account of the relationship between FDR and ER broke ground for historians and biographers alike, and he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his achievement.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Lash spent the next sixteen years of his life writing and editing books about the New Deal era and the Roosevelts. In the process, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in biography, the National Book Award, and the Frances Parkman Prize. He died on August 22, 1987.</span></span></span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Article courtesy </span></span></span><a href=\"https://erpapers.columbian.gwu.edu/\">The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">.</span></span></span></em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Lorena Hickok, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt's</a> devoted friend, mentor, and pioneering journalist, was born March 7, 1893, in East Troy, Wisconsin, to Addison Hickok, a buttermaker, and Anna Wiate Hickok, a dressmaker. Violence and instability characterized her early life. Her father beat Lorena and her sisters, had trouble keeping a job and forced the family to move as he sought work, thus interrupting Hickok's education as she traveled from school district to school district. She left home at fourteen to work as a maid, living with nine families in two years, until her mother's cousin Ella Ellis asked Hickok to live with her. Under Ellis's guidance, Hickok finished high school and, in 1912, enrolled in Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin. Ridiculed by her classmates, Hickok never adjusted to college and flunked out after one year. The <em>Battle Creek Evening News</em> hired her to cover train arrivals and departures and to write personal interest stories for $7 a week.</p> <p>Hickok's role model, the novelist Edna Ferber, began her career as a Milwaukee reporter, so Hickok joined the staff of the <em>Milwaukee Sentinel </em>as its society editor, \"the only position available to most women on newspapers.\" Bored by society assignments, Hickok convinced her editor to assign her to the city desk, where she quickly made a name for herself as a skilled interviewer. She transferred to the <em>Minneapolis Tribune</em> in 1917, only to move to New York City to pursue her hopes of covering World War I. Hickok had trouble adjusting to such a large city, was fired after a month, and returned to Minneapolis to rejoin the <em>Tribune </em>as a rewriter and enroll at the University of Minnesota. Her college education ended when she left the university after the dean tried to force her to live in the women's dormitory. Thomas J. Dillon, the Tribune's managing editor, recognized Hickok's talents, tutored her, and offered her assignments rarely given to women, including politics and sports. \"The Old Man,\" as Hickok called Dillon, taught her the \"newspaper business, how to drink and how to live.\" In 1928, the Associated Press hired Hickok to write feature stories for its wire service. Quickly making a name for herself by covering politics and dramatic stories like the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, Hickok surpassed her male colleagues and won the coveted right to have her name appear as a by-line atop her articles.</p> <p>Hickok met Eleanor in 1932 when the reporter convinced her editors to assign her to cover Eleanor during the 1932 presidential campaign. The two women quickly trusted one another, with Eleanor speaking honestly about politics and social issues and confiding her fears about her life should FDR win the election. They become so close that Hickock let Eleanor see her stories before she submitted them to her editor, and in one case, agreed to Eleanor’s request that a story be delayed. Their campaign experience led to a lifetime of devotion to one another. Hick, as she was known, fell in love with Eleanor, and their surviving correspondence suggests that Eleanor reciprocated for a time.</p> <p>In 1933, Hickok left the Associated Press because she could no longer be objective when covering the Roosevelts. Eleanor recommended that Harry Hopkins hire the reporter to investigate conditions average Americans confronted for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). For three years, Hickok visited thirty-two states and provided detailed, salty reports on New Deal policy, living conditions, and politics to FDR, Eleanor, and Hopkins. An astute, engaged observer, Hickok could assess the problems a community faced quickly after arriving and could solicit trenchant comments from locals that helped the Roosevelts and Hopkins see their policies from the citizen's point of view.</p> <p>Hickok also provided invaluable advice to Eleanor as Eleanor struggled to adjust to living in the White House. She recommended Eleanor hold press conferences with only women reporters and encouraged her to resume her writing career, most notably Eleanor’s monthly column \"Mrs. Roosevelt's Page\" and her daily column \"My Day,\" and she edited the articles Eleanor submitted for publication. She also served as Eleanor’s trusted sounding board, especially after Louis Howe's death in 1936. Her intense concern for unemployed coal miners spurred Eleanor’s concern and played a key role in introducing Eleanor to the West Virginia community later known as Arthurdale. In the early years of the New Deal, the two women vacationed together and Hickok accompanied Eleanor on her official visit to Puerto Rico. When Hickok became executive secretary of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 1940, Eleanor invited her to live at the White House.</p> <p>Hickok's diabetes worsened in early 1945, forcing her to leave the DNC. In 1947, Eleanor helped Hickok secure a job with the New York State Democratic Committee. Hickok's health continued to decline, and in 1954, a frail and partially blind Hickok moved to Hyde Park to be closer to Eleanor. The two women collaborated on <em>Women of Courage</em>, a portrait of women political leaders, and Eleanor tried to stabilize Hickok's finances. Hickok wrote <em>Reluctant First Lady</em>, a biography of Eleanor, and six children's biographies before her death in 1968.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd was born April 26, 1891, in Washington, DC to a prominent Maryland Catholic family. She was educated in private schools, but because her family had very little money she had to go to work. In 1914, she became social secretary to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>. In that capacity, she helped Eleanor with the social obligations associated with her position as spouse of the assistant secretary of the navy. When necessary she also served as the extra woman at the Roosevelts' dinner parties.</p> <p>While working for Eleanor, Lucy met Franklin and the two began a romantic relationship. Eleanor learned of the affair in 1918 when she found a package of Lucy's letters in FDR's luggage. Despite the social stigma then attached to divorce, the couple considered it but eventually decided to reconcile because of family and financial considerations: FDR's political career, which a divorce would have ended, and a shared sense that they both wanted and needed to continue their marriage. Historians have speculated about the level of emotional and sexual intimacy the Roosevelts experienced thereafter, but most agree that the marriage endured as a shared partnership on many levels. They also agree that the affair changed both Franklin and Eleanor significantly. He became more serious personally and politically while she deliberately expanded the range and scope of her already considerable public and private activities.</p> <p>Lucy married Winthrop Rutherfurd, a wealthy widower with six children in 1920. The couple had one daughter, and the marriage lasted until her husband’s death in 1944. Although he had promised Eleanor never to see Lucy again, FDR did ask Lucy to attend his 1933 inauguration. The two began to see each other again after her husband died in 1944 because FDR wanted and needed companionship. Eleanor did not know of these meetings, many of which her daughter, Anna, arranged, and was angered when she learned of them. She was also disturbed to learn that Lucy had been among those who were with FDR when he died in Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. Lucy lived in Aiken, South Carolina, until her death in 1948.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Malvina Thompson, nicknamed \"Tommy,\" was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt’s</a> trusted assistant, secretary, traveling companion, gatekeeper, and dear friend. As Eleanor recalled in her autobiography, \"she wanted to be useful and in many, many ways. She not only made my life easier but gave me a reason for living.\"</p> <p>Born in New York City in 1893, Thompson graduated high school and taught herself secretarial skills. In 1922, after five years with the wartime American Red Cross, she joined the staff of the New York State Democratic Committee, where, working part-time, she helped Eleanor Roosevelt generate a solid women's turnout for Al Smith's 1928 presidential campaign. The two women learned their crafts together: Eleanor did not know how to dictate and Thompson did not know how to take shorthand. They quickly adjusted to each other's styles and developed such an easy working relationship that once the Smith campaign ended and Thompson began working for Louis Howe full-time, she continued to work for Eleanor part-time.</p> <p>By the time they moved to the White House, the two women had built an amazing partnership and friendship. Thompson's irreverent, humorous assessment of people and events complemented Eleanor’s earnestness and she could make Eleanor laugh as few others could. She was also one of the few who would say no to \"Mrs. R.\" (Thompson refused to call her \"Eleanor\" despite Eleanor’s request that she do so.) A shrewd judge of character, she counterbalanced Eleanor’s soft heart, often challenging Eleanor to reject a suspicious appeal or refusing to take dictation when Eleanor responded in a way that would leave her vulnerable to those who sought to exploit her generosity. Utterly devoted to Eleanor, whom she called \"just about the biggest person in the world,\" Thompson organized her life around her boss. She refused all invitations for parties and dates during her stay in the White House because \"you are always expected to pay for such favors in someway\" and \" if she lost her job tomorrow, those people\" would not \"offer her a room\" in their home.</p> <p>As key aide, Thompson traveled with Eleanor (often averaging 40,000 miles a year during the early White House years), helped organize her correspondence, typed countless \"My Day\" columns, often juggling her portable typewriter on her knees as she traveled by car, plane, boat, or train, and managed Eleanor’s frenetic schedule. She monitored Eleanor’s press conferences, critiqued her responses, and recorded key points Eleanor made when she delivered an extemporaneous speech. \"Her standards were high for me, as well as for herself,\" Eleanor recalled, \"and she could be a real critic.\" Her efficient, no-nonsense approach to her work drew praise from FDR's staff, who frequently sent messages through Thompson they were afraid to deliver in person.</p> <p>Working for Eleanor was a demanding job and Thompson's devotion touched Eleanor deeply. In 1938, when Thompson was rushed to the hospital, Eleanor cancelled all her engagements (in and out of the White House) to be at her friend's side during her hospitalization. Later that year, when Eleanor had the Val-Kill furniture factory converted into her home, she designed a wing for Thompson's use.</p> <p>Thompson's commitment to Eleanor and her job became so intense that her marriage disintegrated. She left her husband in New York when she moved to the White House with Eleanor (they divorced in 1938 on the grounds of voluntary separation) and refused to marry her longtime companion, Henry Osthagen, on the grounds that her job would prevent her from spending the time with him necessary to sustain a marriage. Val-Kill became as much Thompson's home as Eleanor’s and Osthagen became a frequent quest. (Thompson died before Osthagen and did not leave a will. Eleanor helped support Osthagen for the rest of his life.)</p> <p>In their twenty-five year friendship, they shared holidays, family celebrations, private moments of elation and exhaustion, and trust.</p> <p>\"Tommy\" Thompson died April 12, 1953, eight years to the day after FDR, from a brain hemorrhage (like FDR), after a twelve-day hospitalization. Eleanor had rushed to the hospital from Hyde Park, where she was coordinating the wreath-laying ceremony on FDR's grave. She reached her friend's side right before her final convulsion. Eleanor was devastated; as she later wrote \"when she died, I learned for the first time what being alone was like.\"</p>",

Grant's death on July 23, 1885, she participated in a long interview with the <em>St. Louis Republican</em> and discussed Ulysses and Julia Grant's life at White Haven. This interview provides crucial insights into General Grant's character and has been frequently cited by historians of biographers studying Grant's life. <br /> <br /> Robinson was born around 1827 or 1828. She may have been born at the White Haven plantation and stated that \"I lived with with the Dent family [at White Haven] from my childhood.\" Initally a playmate of Julia Dent Grant during her early youth, Robinson eventually became a cook at White Haven and was tasked with feeding the Dent and Grant families along with the enslaved laborers living on the property. The Dent family's origins in Maryland apparently played a role Robinson becoming well-versed in cooking seafood dishes. Julia Dent Grant made special mention of Robinson's cooking in her personal memoirs. \"Mammy, Black Mary, was an artist. Such loaves of beautiful snowy cake, such plates full of delicious Maryland biscuit, such exquisite custards and puddings, such omelettes, gumbo soup, and fritters--these were mammy's specialty.\" <br /> <br /> The nature of Robinson's journey to freedom is unknown, but she may have been one of several enslaved African Americans who ran away from White Haven during the Civil War around 1864. After the war she decided to stay in St. Louis and worked as a laundress. Her address in the 1885 interview was listed as 3305 Caroline Avenue, located in west St. Louis near the present-day boundaries of St. Louis University. She was described in the interview as \"a highly intelligent, copper-colored Negress . . . nearly 58 years of age.\" <br /> <br /> Although the journalist who edited Robinson's interview left out any recollections of her own experiences at White Haven, she did speak at length about Ulysses Grant's character. During the interview she described Ulysses as \"an exceedingly fine looking man\" who was \"very fond of domestic animals\" and \"one of the greatest readers I ever saw.\" She also recalled a humorous moment when Grant's dog, Leo, captured chickens on the White Haven property that were then used for cooking meals on the property. <br /> <br /> To read the entire interview with Mary Robinson, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/an-interview-with-mary-robinson-formerly-enslaved-at-white-haven.htm\">click here</a>.  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Sara Delano Roosevelt was the daughter of Warren Delano, a wealthy merchant who made a fortune in the tea and opium trade in China, and after losing it, returned to make a second fortune. Sara grew up in Hong Kong from 1862-65 and in Algonac, the family estate on the Hudson River near Newburgh, New York. She was educated at home, except for a short period in 1867 when she attended a school for girls in Dresden, Germany. Sara Delano was tall and radiantly beautiful and had many suitors. At twenty-six, to the surprise of her friends, she married James Roosevelt, a widower who was twice her age. By all accounts, she found great happiness in her marriage and in life on her husband's Hyde Park, New York, estate. After the birth of Franklin Delano Roosevelt on January 30, 1882, she was advised to have no more children. She became absorbed in raising her only son, reading to him, giving him baths, and directing his activities herself rather than leaving these tasks to servants. After the death of her husband in 1900, she became still more single-mindedly focused on her son and his welfare. She moved temporarily to Boston when he attended Harvard in order to be near him. No mother could have been more devoted. She was also strong willed, controlling, opinionated, and inflexible. She does not seem to have been enthusiastic about any of the young women her son courted and, when he fell in love and proposed marriage to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, she tried to change his mind and insisted that the engagement be kept secret for a year.</p> <p>After Franklin and Eleanor's marriage on March 17, 1905, Sara planned every facet of their lives. She built a double townhouse at 49 East 65th Street in Manhattan, one half for them, one half for herself. Later, she bought a cottage for them right next to her own on the island of Campobello where she spent her summers. When children began to arrive, she was there with advice on how to rear them and she often undermined parental discipline by spoiling them. The Delanos were a close and supportive family, unlike Eleanor's mother's family, the Halls, and Eleanor at first appreciated her mother-in-law's attention. She felt insecure about her role as a mother and relied on Sara's direction. She tried to please Sara and win her affection. But Sara was aloof and emotionally focused on her son, Franklin. Eleanor soon found her mother-in-law's domination oppressive and struggled to achieve her independence. As she developed her own interests, friends, and activities, and in the 1920s emerged as a political leader in her own right, she was able to escape Sara's authority. At times Franklin and Eleanor became allies in opposing Sara's will. After polio paralyzed FDR's legs, Sara wanted her son to retire to Hyde Park and live the rest of his life as a country gentleman, but Eleanor strongly supported FDR's desire to return to politics. Sara hated politics, hated publicity, hated newspapermen, and was prejudiced against any individual or group not belonging to her elite social class. Ironically, the public lives of both her son and her daughter-in-law exposed her to much that she found distasteful. She retained her dignity, her pride in her family and lineage, and her strong opinions, however, and remained in charge of Springwood, the estate in Hyde Park that she had shared with her husband and then with Franklin and Eleanor.</p> <p>After Sara died on September 7, 1941, Eleanor wrote in her column that Sara's \"strongest trait was loyalty to her family....She was not just sweetness and light, for there was a streak of jealously and possessiveness in her when her own were concerned.\" Eleanor recognized Sara's fierce strength, but she could not love her. \"It is dreadful,\" she wrote a friend, \"to have lived so close to someone for 36 years & feel no deep affection or sense of loss. It is hard on Franklin however.\"</p> <p>Her memory is commemorated at Sara Delano Roosevelt Park in New York City's Lower East Side, which was dedicated during her lifetime, in 1934.<br />  </p> <p><em>Biography courtesy of The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project.</em></p>",

Her father, Christopher Bush, was \"…a stirring, industrious man, and had a large family of sons and daughters.\"</p> <p>In March 1806, she married Daniel Johnston. Unfortunately, Johnston did not have the same kind of industriousness that his in-laws had and he was soon deeply in debt. When he died in 1816, Sarah was left with many of these obligations still outstanding. For the next several years she did her best to support herself and her three children.</p> <p>In 1819, Thomas Lincoln returned to Elizabethtown, a widower himself by this time, with hopes of finding a new wife and mother for his children. Having known Sarah before he moved to Indiana, and knowing she was a widow, he paid her a visit and asked her to marry him. Sarah replied that she could not marry him until she had paid her debts. Upon hearing this, Thomas agreed to pay the debts himself.<br /> <br /> Once that was done, he and Sarah were married on December 2, 1819. Sarah and her three children, John, Matilda, and Elizabeth returned with Thomas to Indiana, where Sarah set about making the two families into one.</p> <p>She found the country to be \"wild and desolate\" but the log cabin that Thomas had built was \"good, tolerably comfortable.\"She soon discovered that her new stepson was very intelligent and had a passion for knowledge; he was especially fond of reading. Consequently, her gift to him of three books left an indelible impression on him. Not only was it a priceless treasure to a boy who loved to read on a frontier where books were scarce, but it was an indication to him that Sarah would pick up where his mother had left off in terms of encouraging his quest for knowledge. The two quickly developed a close, intimate,mother-son relationship that would continue for the rest of Abraham's life.</p> <p>Even as an adult, Abraham remained close to his stepmother, whom he always referred to as \"Mother.\" After the family moved to Illinois and he had gone out on his own he still found time to visit. Mrs. Lincoln reported that she \"saw him every year or two.\" After the death of his father in 1851, Lincoln retained a 40-acre plot of land in his own name \"for Mother while she lives,\" and otherwise tended to her welfare as best he could from a distance. Abraham saw his stepmother for the last time when he visited to bid her farewell before<br /> going to Washington for his inauguration. When she later recalled the visit after her stepson's death in 1865, she wept. Sarah died in 1869.</p> <p>Lincoln said of his stepmother \"she proved to be a good and kind mother\" to him. By all reports their relationship was excellent, and Mrs. Lincoln considered her stepson a model child who was always honest, witty, and \"diligent for knowledge.\" He never needed a \"cross word.\" In all the vast literature of controversy over Lincoln's early years, there is hardly an unkind word about Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Burn became the youngest member of the Tennessee General Assembly when he was elected in 1918 at the age of twenty-two. He entered history two years later, on August 18, 1920, when he cast the deciding vote to ratify the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">19th Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution. In his pocket was a letter from his mother, Febb Burn, urging him to “be a good boy” and vote for the amendment. He took her advice.<br /> <br /> By the summer of 1920, thirty-five states had ratified the women’s suffrage amendment. Eight had rejected it. One more was needed for it to become law, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/tennessee-women-s-history.htm\">Tennessee</a> looked like suffragists’ best (and possibly only) hope. The legislature had called a special session to vote on the amendment. The battle in Nashville had been fierce. Suffragist and anti-suffragist campaigners lobbied, cajoled, and browbeat lawmakers in the Tennessee State Capitol and the halls of the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hermitage-hotel.htm\">Hermitage Hotel</a>.[1] One of their targets was Harry Burn.<br /> <br /> Burn personally supported suffrage, but he was under tremendous political pressure. He was up for reelection that fall and knew his constituents in McMinn County did not want women to vote. The Tennessee suffragists had lobbied him and thought he seemed supportive, but they couldn’t be sure. In the meantime, many of Burn’s Republican colleagues and mentors, concerned about their political fortunes in the state, pressured him to oppose suffrage.<br /> <br /> On August 18, Burn entered the General Assembly chamber wearing a red rose in his lapel, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/symbols-of-the-women-s-suffrage-movement.htm\">symbol</a> of the anti-suffragists. When a motion to table the amendment—which would have all but doomed it—came up, he voted for it. But the vote was a tie. Seeking to kill the amendment once and for all, the anti-suffrage Speaker called for another vote on the amendment itself. Burn’s yes or no vote could pass it—or send it down to defeat.<br /> <br /> Anyone watching could conclude that Burn had chosen to oppose suffrage. But in fact, he was wracked by indecision. A letter from his mother, Febb Burn, had been delivered to him in the chamber. “Hurrah and vote for suffrage and don’t keep them in doubt,” it read. “I’ve been watching to see how you stood but have not seen anything yet…Don’t forget to be a good boy and help <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">Mrs. [Carrie Chapman] Catt</a>.” As he waited to vote, he had the letter in his pocket.<br /> <br /> To the astonishment of the onlookers, when Burn’s name was called, he voted “aye.” The 19th Amendment would become the law of the land. The next day, Burn explained his choice. “I believe in full suffrage as a right,” he said. “I believe we had a moral and legal right to ratify. I know that a mother’s advice is always safest for her boy to follow, and my mother wanted me to vote for ratification.”<br /> <br /> After a hard-fought campaign, Harry Burn narrowly won reelection in the fall of 1920. He went on to a long career in public office in Tennessee. He married Ellen Folsom Cottrell in 1937 and had one child, Harry T. Burn, Jr. Burn died on February 19, 1977 at the age of 81.<br /> <br /> <strong>Notes</strong><br /> [1] The Tennessee State Capitol was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1970 and designated a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971.

            "bodyText": "<p>Mary \"Molly\" Dewson was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1874. She attended three private schools, including the prestigious Dana Hall, before entering Wellesley College, from which she graduated as a social worker in 1897. At Wellesley, she was senior class president and her classmates believed she might one day be elected president of the United States. After graduating, Dewson began working as a secretary of the Domestic Reform Committee of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, a social and reform club in Boston. There she conducted statistical studies of homelife that led to several articles. She also reorganized the club's employment office for domestic workers, formed social clubs for them, and taught at a school for housekeeping. In 1899, she published <em>The Twentieth Century Expense Book</em>, about how to manage a household on a budget. In 1900, she left the union to set up the parole department of the Massachusetts State Industrial School for Girls. She was also the department's first superintendent. While there, she tracked the girls to understand the motives behind their delinquency and crimes, and to aid in their rehabilitation. These activities led to further articles and a presentation at the 1911 National Conference of Charities and Correction, entitled \"The Delinquent Girl on Parole.\" Even before leaving the Industrial School (1912), she became involved in the minimum wage movement (1911). She was named executive secretary of the Minimum Wage Investigative Committee, which produced a report that led to Massachusetts' (and the nation's) first minimum wage law. This report brought her national recognition.</p> <p>Molly Dewson was ready for a break. In 1913 she and her lifelong partner, Mary G. (Polly) Porter, moved to a dairy farm in Worcester, Massachusetts. By 1915, however, Dewson had recharged. She entered the Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">suffrage</a> movement. During World War I, both she and Porter went with the American Red Cross to France to aid war refugees. Dewson was chief of the Mediterranean Zone by war's end. After returning from Europe, Dewson worked as Florence Kelley's principal assistant in the National Consumers' League campaign for state minimum wage laws for women and children. From 1925 to 1931, Dewson served as president of the New York Consumers' League, working closely with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, leading the lobbying effort of the Women's Joint Legislative Conference and playing a central role in the passage of a 1930 New York law limiting women to forty-eight-hour work weeks.</p> <p>In 1928, Dewson entered politics more personally, organizing Democratic women for Al Smith's presidential campaign at Eleanor Roosevelt's request. She performed a similar feat for Franklin Roosevelt's 1930 gubernatorial and 1932 presidential races. Because of her work on FDR's campaigns (and Eleanor Roosevelt's intense lobbying), Dewson was appointed head of the Democratic National Committee's Women's Division (DNC). She reorganized the division utterly. She found government jobs for female party workers, more than had been given to women under any previous administration. She is credited with securing the post of secretary of labor for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frances-perkins.htm\">Frances Perkins</a>, and placing women high up in the Social Security and National Recovery Administrations. Even so, she opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. Despite this opposition, she began to push for state laws or state party rulings that would provide even representation in membership and leadership positions for women on party committees from the precinct level up. She created the Reporter Plan, which educated female party workers on New Deal programs so that they could explain them to voters. In the 1936 election, the women's division provided 90 percent of the campaign fliers the DNC produced. That same year she got a rule passed that provided for a member and an alternate for each state on the DNC Platform Committee; the rule also required that each pair be composed of one man and one woman. Dewson's organizational abilities so impressed FDR that he nicknamed her \"the little general.\"</p> <p>She withdrew from the women's division's day-to-day affairs in 1936 because of poor health, but continued to be available to her successors. In 1937 she again returned to active public life when she was nominated and confirmed as a member of the Social Security Board. There she set up effective systems of federal-state cooperation, an issue that had been problematic. However, she again had to step down because of illness in 1938.</p> <p>For several years, she and Porter split their time between New York City and Castine, Maine. In 1952, they retired to Castine full time. Even in retirement, Dewson was busy, becoming the vice-president of the Maine Democratic Advisory Committee in 1954. Dewson died in Castine in 1962 of complications following a stroke.</p> <p><em>Article courtesy of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, George Washington University.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Mary McLeod Bethune became one of the most celebrated African American figures of the New Deal era and extended her influence as an educator, civil rights activist, and advocate for women’s equality for more than three decades from the 1920s to the 1950s. Born near Mayesville, South Carolina, July 10, 1875, she was the 15th of 17 children of former slaves who had purchased a small farm after the Civil War. Through the influence of her parents, Samuel and Patsy (McIntosh) McLeod, as well as her own self-determination, she raised herself from the position of a member of a cotton farming family to become an internationally known figure.</p> <p>At a time when African Americans rarely attained advanced education due to discriminatory practices, Mary McLeod attended the recently opened Trinity Presbyterian Mission School in Mayesville from 1882 to 1886. Aided by a scholarship and the encouragement of her mentor, Emma Wilson, she attended Scotia Seminary for Negro Girls (later Barber-Scotia College) in Concord, North Carolina, a missionary outpost of northern Presbyterians that emphasized religious instruction and industrial education. At Scotia, she completed the high school program in 1892 and the Normal and Scientific Course two years later. Although she attended the Bible Institute for Home and Foreign Missions (later the Moody Bible Institute) in Chicago, Illinois, during 1894-95 with plans to become a missionary, she was refused a commission to serve in Africa by the Presbyterian Mission Board.</p> <p>Disappointed by this turn of events, Mary McLeod returned to South Carolina and began her first teaching job at the Trinity Presbyterian Mission School in Mayesville, where she had once been a student. Shortly thereafter, the Presbyterian board appointed her to a teaching position at Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta, Georgia. There she worked with Lucy Craft Laney, the dynamic black founder and principal of the school, with whom she had previously become acquainted and who would become Mary McLeod’s model for serving others. During the 1896­-97 school year, she organized the Mission Sabbath School for 275 of the city’s poorest children. After a year, she transferred to teach at the Kindell Institute in Sumter, South Carolina (1897­-98). Following her marriage to Albertus Bethune, a former teacher but then a menswear salesman, in May 1898, the Bethunes moved to Savannah, Georgia, to further his business career. Their only child, Albert McLeod Bethune, was born the following year. Later in 1899, the family relocated to Palatka, Florida, where Mrs. Bethune established a Presbyterian missionary school. Albertus Bethune did not share his wife’s missionary ardor, however, and they separated. (Albertus would die of tuberculosis in 1918.)</p> <p>After five years of teaching and administering the school in Palatka, Mrs. Bethune’s lifelong ambition to build a school for African American girls in the South led her to Daytona Beach, Florida, where, in October 1904, the Daytona Educational and Industrial Institute opened with Bethune as its president. The school, patterned after the Scotia Seminary, was opened in a rented house with six students—five girls and her own son. As a result of her business and organizing skills, the assistance of the black community, and the largesse of some prominent white philanthropists vacationing in Florida, such as James M. Gamble and John D. Rockefeller, Mrs. Bethune’s school grew from a small elementary school to incorporate a high school under the banner of the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute in 1918. Like most other African American institutions of the period, the school stressed religion, secretarial work, homemaking, and industrial education, with emphasis on agriculture and animal husbandry in tandem with academics; the school had a farm that focused on the production and handling of food products to meet the school’s needs and to provide income. By April 1920, 47 girls had completed the full high school course, and 10, having completed the institution’s teacher training program, were teaching in Florida’s public schools.</p> <p>In 1923 Mrs. Bethune’s school merged with Cookman Institute, a Jacksonville, Florida, Methodist Episcopal Church college for men, to become the Daytona-Cookman Collegiate Institute with 42 faculty members and nearly 800 students. Six years later, the school’s name was changed to Bethune-Cookman College in recognition of the important role that Mrs. Bethune had played in the school’s growth and development. In 1932 the institution received regional accreditation as a junior college, and in 1936 the high school department was discontinued. In 1943, the college began conferring degrees in teacher education upon its first four-year graduates. Bethune would serve as the college’s president (1932­-42, 1946-­47) and as president-emeritus, trustee, and chairman of its advisory board (1946­-55).</p> <p>As an educator in the South, Mrs. Bethune had concerns that extended beyond campus life. In the absence of a municipally supported medical facility for African Americans, the Daytona school, under her guidance, maintained a hospital for African Americans from 1911 to 1927. During much of this period, she also operated the Tomoka Mission Schools for the children of black families working the Florida turpentine camps. Ignoring threats made by members of the Ku Klux Klan, she organized a black female voter registration drive in Florida in September 1920 following adoption of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. As a delegate to the first meeting of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, she voiced her opposition to degrading southern racial customs.</p> <p>While directing the Daytona school, Mrs. Bethune gained national prominence through her work with the National Association of Colored Women. From 1917 to 1925 she served as president of the Florida Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs, which opened a rehabilitative home for “wayward” and delinquent girls in Ocala in September 1921. In 1920 she founded and became president of a regional association, which became the Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs. One of the major triumphs of this organization was supplying leadership for the women’s general committee of the regional Commission on Interracial Cooperation headquartered in Atlanta.</p> <p>During 1923-­24, Bethune served as president of the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools, a professional organization of black teachers from mostly southern states.</p> <p>In 1924 Mrs. Bethune’s work culminated in her election to the presidency of the National Association of Colored Women, an office regarded by many as the highest to which an African American woman could then aspire. During her tenure in this position, she directed the organization increasingly beyond itself to the broader social issues confronting American society. As president of the National Association of Colored Women, Bethune attended meetings of the National Council of Women of the United States. This organization provided her with expanded contacts throughout American society. In 1925 this council of 38 organizations—37 white and one African American—was the avenue for the association’s participation in the International Council of Women at its quinquennial conference, which attracted representatives from 35 countries to Washington, DC. During her four years as head of the association, Bethune emphasized efficient management and developing a presence in national and international affairs and continued the organization’s commitment to a scholarship fund and to the preservation of the Frederick Douglass home in the nation’s capital as a national memorial.</p> <p>Mrs. Bethune also worked aggressively to project a positive image of African American women to whites through her travels in the United States and abroad. By her oratory and her example she inspired African American women to greater levels of service. Most important, however, she strengthened the structure of the 10,000-member National Association of Colored Women by revising its constitution, improving the association’s periodical, National Notes, and promoting greater communication between members. Through a strenuous financial campaign, she succeeded in establishing the association’s first permanent national headquarters at 1114 O Street in Washington, DC, in 1928, and employing its first paid executive secretary.</p> <p>During the 1920s, Mrs. Bethune began to develop a national presence as a result of her appointment to the National Child Welfare Commission by Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The latter invited her to a White House conference in 1930 and appointed her to the Commission of Home Building and Home Ownership in 1931.</p> <p>Beginning in 1935, Mrs. Bethune’s growing prominence was recognized by a number of honorary degrees and distinguished awards. During a 15-year period she would receive honorary doctoral degrees from eight colleges and universities. In addition, she was awarded the distinguished Joel E. Spingarn Medal by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1935, the Francis A. Drexel Award by Xavier University in 1937, and the Thomas Jefferson Award by the Southern Conference for Human Welfare in 1942.</p> <p>On December 5, 1935, in New York City, Dr. Bethune, along with 20 other African American women representing 14 black women’s organizations, established the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) to unite African American w omen in social planning and action on national and international levels around such issues as education, employment, health, housing, civil rights, and international relations.</p> <p>Although she remained active in the National Association of Colored Women, she had come to believe that its member federations and clubs were not sufficiently involved in local matters and were instead overly oriented toward self-help, thus preventing the association from speaking as the authoritative national voice that black women needed. Eloquently, she wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>The great need for uniting the effort of our women kept weighing upon my mind. I could not free myself from the sense of loss, of wasted strength, sustained by the national community through failure to harness the great power of women into a force for constructive action. I could not rest until our women had met this challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>Expressing a desire to see African American women united to “meet the unfolding of larger things,” the organization, under Dr. Bethune’s leadership, determined to pursue four principal objectives. These were to: (1) promote unity of action among women’s organizations in matters affecting the educational, cultural, economic, political, and social life in America; (2) build a fellowship of women devoted to developing friendly relations among all people in the world; (3) collect and preserve information about and affecting women; and (4) work for the complete elimination of any and all forms of discrimination and segregation based on race, religion, color, national origin, and sex.</p> <p>Serving as the president of the National Council of Negro Women from its founding until November 1949, Dr. Bethune focused the council’s activities on segregation and discrimination. She also represented the council at the 1945 founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco, serving as an unofficial observer with the NAACP delegation along with two other prominent African Americans (W.E.B. Dubois and Walter White). To strengthen the organization, she expanded its membership by creating chapters in major cities throughout the nation. The council’s first office in Washington, DC, was in her living room at 1812 Ninth Street, NW. When the growing organization required a larger permanent headquarters, she purchased a house at 1318 Vermont Avenue, NW (today known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mamc/index.htm\">Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site</a>), and employed a full-time staff. She also launched the influential Aframerican Woman’s Journal, later named Women United, which carried articles about the council and also about the many interests of African American w omen. A newsletter, Telefact, began publication in 1943.</p> <p>By the end of Dr. Bethune’s tenure as president, the council had become the largest federation of African American women’s clubs in the United States. The council included 22 national women’s organizations, including professional and occupational groups, both broadly based and subject-restricted academic sororities, Christian denominational societies, fraternal associations, auxiliaries, and various other groups. Today, the council, with its new headquarters at 633 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW (dedicated in October 1995), has an outreach of more than 4 million women in its membership through national affiliate organizations.</p> <p>Dr. Bethune propelled the National Council of Negro Women to the forefront of the country’s women’s race organizations through its “Conference on Governmental Cooperation in the Approach to the Problems of Negro Women and Children,” held on April 4, 1938, at the Department of the Interior and the White House. The 1938 conference revealed her basic strategy for racial advancement, which was to win policy-making and management positions in government for competent African American women. This emphasis upon upper-level employment was designed to benefit the black masses.</p> <p>Forceful and articulate, Dr. Bethune was a natural leader and concerned herself with improving the status of all African Americans regardless of socioeconomic position or gender. Among other positions, she served as vice president of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (1934­), president of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (1936-52­), and vice president of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare (1938­-48). Her support was important to the ongoing work of the National Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, serving as a vice president of both civil rights organizations for many years.</p> <p>Dr. Bethune’s most significant influence as an African American leader came, however, through her role in the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was she who primarily educated Eleanor Roosevelt, whom Bethune had met in 1927 through her work with the National Association of Colored Women, on the problems of African Americans in the United States. She was one of several African Americans who had direct access to the White House, providing her with a unique opportunity to personally urge the president to advance civil rights and promote African American interests.</p> <p>In August 1935, through Eleanor Roosevelt’s influence, Dr. Bethune was appointed to the 35-member National Advisory Committee of the National Youth Administration (NYA). The agency’s primary purpose was to help young people find employment during the depression and later during the World War II defense effort. She used her relatively minor advisory position as a springboard; in June 1936 she was placed in charge of Negro affairs within the National Youth Administration, and in January 1939 she became director of the Division of Negro Affairs. The directorship represented the highest federal appointment ever held by an African American woman to that time and facilitated her functioning in the agency’s managerial hierarchy. In this position, she influenced the agency to adopt nondiscriminatory employment policies and to recognize special African American needs. She persuaded the National Youth Administration to expand the Division of Negro Affairs at the national level and to employ 27 African American administrative assistants at the state level.</p> <p>When the agency adopted a regional structure in 1942, she succeeded in having it employ regional African American affairs representatives. She also guided the administration toward broadening African American participation in the school aid program, including high school and college work-study, vocational training, and job placement. She succeeded in crating the Special Negro Higher Education Fund, administered through her office, for African American graduate students and colleges. The fund disbursed more than $600,000 to 4,119 black students during a seven-year period.</p> <p>In the training program for youth out of school, she pressed for opportunities for African Americans to learn skilled trades and argued for programs to assist black youth in finding jobs. Though her demands often went unheeded during the depression, her persistent efforts later resulted in the employment of some NYA-trained African American youth in World War II defense industries that had not previously hired blacks.</p> <p>Believing in the efficacy of widespread cooperative efforts among African Americans—an important factor in the founding of the National Council of Negro Women—Dr. Bethune organized the Federal Council on Negro Affairs, popularly called the “Black Cabinet,” in August 1936. The council was an informal group of blacks in government who worked together to strengthen African American support of the New Deal and to promote nondiscrimination in government facilities, greater opportunities in government jobs, and the prevention of government actions harmful to blacks.</p> <p>The Black Cabinet began meeting weekly at Bethune’s home in Washington, DC, and she was its influential spokesperson, urging that its energies be directed to the support of the emerging drive for civil rights. As a result of these efforts, she succeeded in creating channels of communication between civil rights organizations and the Roosevelt administration. She gained government support for two important National Conferences on the Problem of the Negro and Negro Youth in January 1937 and January 1939. Sponsored by the National Youth Administration and widely covered by the national media, these conferences spotlighted the plight of African Americans in the Unites States and provided a forum through which blacks could make policy recommendations to the government.</p> <p>Dr. Bethune also worked for civil rights reform outside government channels. She participated in the New Negro Alliance’s picket line in 1939 to support the hiring of black clerks by a Washington, DC drugstore chain. After nine Scottsboro boys were found guilty of rape in three controversial Alabama trials in 1931, she spoke and demonstrated in support of the drive to free the nine defendants, which resulted in their convictions being overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1935. She was active in the efforts to gain rights for African American sharecroppers in the South, was a regular speaker at NAAP conferences and other civil rights organizations, and joined A. Philip Randolph’s March on Washington movement in 1941.</p> <p>During the war years, the National Council of Negro Women, under Dr. Bethune’s leadership, focused on problems of African American women workers through a “Hold Your Job” campaign and worked for passage of a permanent Fair Employment Practice Committee. Among other projects, the council campaigned for the admission of African American women into the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAACS) and Women Appointed for Voluntary Emergency Service (WAVES), launched a liberty ship named for Harriet Tubman, participated in numerous conferences, and cooperated with other African American and women’s organizations in various activities to support the American war effort as well as the cause for civil rights. Bethune led the National Council of Negro Women’s “Buy War Bonds” drive and served as special assistant to the secretary of war for the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps. In 1944 she toured hospitals in the First, Second, and Third Service Commands, advising on the rehabilitation of America’s war veterans.</p> <p>Dr. Bethune left her position in the government when the National Youth Administration ceased operations in 1944, and she resigned as president of the National Council of Negro Women in 1949 to retire to her home on the Bethune-Cookman College campus in Daytona Beach. This two-story, white frame residence, which had been constructed as her residence on the campus in 1914, would be designated a national historic landmark on December 2, 1974.</p> <p>During her retirement, she remained active in the nation’s political life, receiving many honors as an African American leader. In 1951, for instance, President Harry S. Truman appointer her to his Committee of Twelve for National Defense. That same year, she became president of the Central Life Insurance Company of Florida, which she had helped found in the 1920s to provide insurance for African Americans in the state. In January 1952, she traveled to Liberia as an official U.S. representative to the second inaugural of President William V.S. Tubman. While there, she received that nation’s coveted Star of Africa Aware. In April of that year, the Board of Education of Englewood, New Jersey, canceled her engagement to speak in a public school because the House Committee on Un-American Activities has branded her a communist during the “red-baiting” years of the McCarthy era. A groundswell of public support, however, eventually made possible her appearance at the school.</p> <p>In 1953 Bethune established the Mary McLeod Bethune Foundation as a nonprofit corporation to promote her social and educational ideals. Undaunted, she continued to champion democratic values and faith in the American creed until she died at her home as the result of a heart attack on May 18, 1955, at the age of 79. One of the South’s most well-known and prominent women, she was buried on a mound overlooking the campus of Bethune-Cookman College.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Clyde Milton Reasoner was born in Dows, Iowa, on April 3, 1927 and moved to Des Moines as a teenager. He had one brother and two sisters. Before joining the Navy, Clyde had completed two years of high school and was working as a baker in the local Atlantic & Pacific grocery store. His parents were divorced and his mom, Violet Winifred Reasoner, had custody of the three minor children: Clyde, Shirley and George. Clyde enlisted on November 14, 1944. His mother signed a consent form, because he was only 17 years old.<sup>1</sup> His salesman father, who had left the family, was Clyde’s link to anything regarding the Navy since he had served in a Naval Hospital in San Francisco during World War I.</p> <p>Clyde was sent to the Navy Training Center in Great Lakes, Illionois. There he learned firefighting skills, qualified as a Rifle Marksman, and was promoted to seaman 2nd class (S2c). He spent a few weeks at the Training and Distribution Center (TADCEN) in Shoemaker, California. It is unknown where he celebrated his 18th birthday on April 3, 1945, but it seems likely he was on a ship heading to the South Pacific. We do know that on April 26th S2c Reasoner reported for duty aboard USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793). The ship had recently arrived in Ulithi Harbor, in the Caroline Islands, for repairs after being hit by a kamikaze earlier in the month.</p> <p>During his three months on board USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, S2c Reasoner traveled through much of the South Pacific, seeing the islands of Ulithi, Okinawa, Guam and Saipan. He also had many new experiences; ranging from the boredom of patrolling in calm seas, training maneuvers, escort, screening and picket duties, to the terror of outrunning a typhoon, several kamikaze attacks, and rescuing survivors from the USS <em>Callaghan </em>(DD-792, a sister Fletcher-class destroyer). Shipmate Ralph Rhoads described in his diary the atmosphere into which S2c Reasoner joined the crew:</p> <blockquote>May 15, 1945 […] the [Japanese] are still using a lot of suicide planes up at Okinawa and that is probably where we will be headed for. We must have between 50 and 75 destroyers out of commission now due to suicide planes. A lot of these will never be very good again. Nearly everyone that gets hit, 1/3 of the crew gets killed or wounded. Two-to-one odds for your life isn’t very high.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>On the morning of July 28, 1945, USS <em>Cassin Young</em> returned to picket duty off the coast of Okinawa. The following morning kamikazes attacked nearby ships, sinking USS <em>Callaghan</em>. In the early morning hours of July 30, 1945, <em>Cassin Young</em> was hit by a kamikaze for a second time. This caused an explosion in the forward boiler room, killing the entire watch on duty. Twenty-two sailors lost their lives on USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, the youngest was 18-year-old S2c Clyde Milton Reasoner.</p> <p>S2c Reasoner, USNR, was buried in the US Military Cemetery on Zamami Shima, Ryuku Retto. In 1949 Clyde Milton Reasoner was reinterred in Glendale Cemetery, Des Moines, Iowa.</p> <hr /> <h3>Footnotes</h3> <ol> <li>Official Military Personnel File of Clyde Milton Reasoner, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO.</li> <li>Ralph Samuel Rhoads USS Cassin Young (DD-793) A Sailor’s War Diary (2017), entry for May 15, 1945</li> </ol>",
