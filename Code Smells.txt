The way I've consolidated things into ListVM and DataServices requires them being told which type of result/data to expect.  This is a code smell because it requires changes to the base class whenever a new derived class is created; i.e., ListVM and DataService for each DerivedListVM.  But in order to use ListView as a common XAML for all lists, ListVM has to be consolidated.  This feels like a case for template methods?
