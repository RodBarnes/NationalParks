There are vault toilets at various places along the beach, the paths to them are not paved. Many people park their camping rigs by the water and then bring their boat around to beach it with the rest of their site. There is a designated area for off-road vehicles in the dunes behind the camping portion of the beach.",

Pine rocklands are characterized by tall slash pine trees, with peeling brown bark and high green needles. The ground between the spaced out pine trees is a low lying shrubby mixture of saw palmettos, dense grasses numerous wooded shrubs. Craggy, chalky white limestone characterizes the ground, and can make walking off path difficult. If there has been a fire recently, there can be charred remains of burnt trees and crunch ash on the pineland floor Follow the slowly winding Pinelands road to a forked split to either the campground or a day use area. A slight left will take you to the campground. A white building with a green metallic roof welcomes campers to the Long Pine Key Campground. Behind this entrance station is a small patch of grass containing several garbage receptacles and tall information boards including a map of the campground and interpretive information about fire‚Äôs role in the habitat. A red payphone stands next to the information boards. The campground road follows a one-way counter clockwise loop, approximately a mile in length, that is in the shape of an oval. Slash pine trees are the dominant plant species, but a wide variety of small shrubs such as beauty berry and sumac add purple or red to the green foliage. As you follow the road around in a slow arc moving south west, the loop is bisected by alphabetized roads ascending from ‚ÄòA‚Äô to ‚ÄòK‚Äô. Each lettered road has anywhere between 5-7 camping areas. Camping areas include a paved slab for vehicle parking, a mowed lawn area, a circular black metal fire ring with a grill attachment, and a 6 or 8 foot gray picnic table. On alternating lettered roads, the restrooms sit in white buildings with green roofs and have two separate entrances on either side. White cement shower buildings have tall green roofs which are covered by solar panels for water heating. Through the vegetation to the north, there is a large blue human made lake, which surrounds an island with dozens of tall slash pines sitting atop the rocky outcrop. At the loop halfway point lies a small parking area and a paved, lighted walking path leading to an amphitheater. The amphitheater hugs the lakeside shoreline and contains twelve rows of benched seating, bisected by a center aisle. A large white wooden backdrop faces the benches as well as a presentation podium for a speaker. The road begins to circle around the loop and now heads to the northeast. The lettered roads begin to move up from ‚ÄòK‚Äô to ‚ÄòA‚Äô and there are spaced out camp areas on either side. To the south the Pine Rockland habitat extends for over a mile, with the tall slash pines looming over the campground. Following the road, to its completion the entrance station is approached from the opposite side and you can exit the campground area back to the Long Pine Key Road.",

Water is available at Steel Visitor Center or Mazama Village. Drive three miles south along Pinnacles Road from East Rim Drive. Turn right after the brown metal directional sign announcing the campground. You have arrived at the entrance. Welcoming you is a brown wood sign with the words Lost Creek Campground carved into the panel and painted white. It hangs from a beam leveraged by five round, multi-sized posts that create the sign‚Äôs base. Beneath towering lodge pole pines and Shasta Red Firs are grassy meadows with 16 tent sites distributed in an inner and outer circle. An Information bulletin board and pay kiosk is straight ahead. The bulletin board contains information on how to select a site, pay, rules, regulations and any current concerns regarding the campground. From the kiosk, go left towards site #1 and continue as the road winds around to site #4. If your go right, you will by-pass sites 1 through 4, and turn right in front of site 5. Lost Creek runs behind sites 2 thru 5. Wildflowers highlight the area during summer and fall colors resume their brilliance as the weather cools. Between sites 4 and 5 is Greyback Road, the former East Rim Drive. There is a locked metal gate swung across the road to prohibit vehicle traffic. This road is now considered a trail for hikers, bicyclists, and pet walking. Across from sites 4 and 5 is a native stone and wood structure. This restroom is closed due to water rights legislation which does not give the National Park Service senior rights to use of the water in Lost Creek and its reservoir. Instead, there are portable toilets, several which are accessible, stationed alongside the building. Beyond the closed restroom, the road continues in a circular fashion with access to sites 6 to 16. The road and all campsite parking are covered with small crushed gravel-like rock. Tent areas are mostly dirt and natural debris with some crushed rock. All sites are generally level with room to park two vehicles. Each site has one picnic table; bases are white and formed from concrete; tops are made of heavy planks of wood. Most are in the sun with a possibility of shade at times throughout the day. Each site also has one bear-proof, metal food storage locker. The park is home to many animals, including black bears. All of your food, garbage, cooking equipment, storage containers (e.g. ice chests), and toiletries (soaps, toothpaste, etc.) must be kept in your vehicle or in the bear-resistant locker provided at your campsite. There are tree stumps and logs throughout the meadow and around campsites. Many dead trees stand along and beyond the creek. There are trash and recycling containers in several locations in the campground. The creek is closed to fishing to save and protect native bull trout. Since the campground is alongside Pinnacles Road it is not quiet during the day due to cars traveling to and from Pinnacles Overlook. After sunset when vehicle traffic comes to a halt and sunshine shifts to a starlit sky, and again when quiet hours begin at 10 pm, giving way to the sounds of Lost Creek and the wind, that the campground is quiet.",

            "audioDescription": "Turn right after Annie Creek Entrance Station, onto the main road to Mazama Campground. Stay straight driving past the right turn for the Mazama Village Store. 214 sites are organized on the left-hand side of the road into seven loops lettered A to G, each with a sign identifying the loop location. Travel throughout each loop is one-way in a clockwise direction. At the front of each site is a wooden post with the site number. The sites are dispersed through a forest of lodgepole pines, mountain hemlocks, Shasta red firs, and subalpine firs. Douglas squirrels, gray jays, and Steller‚Äôs jays are commonly seen and heard. Each site contains a brown wooden picnic table, a bear-resistant food locker, and a fire ring with a grill. A paved or gravel parking area is provided for cars or an RV. Trash and recycling receptacles are dispersed throughout each loop. The first left turn from the main campground road goes to A-loop with 15 sites including one accessible site, A10. A restroom with running water and flush toilets is near A13, with women on one end of the building and men on the other. A fresh-water spigot is across from the restroom. The second left turn from the main campground road goes to B-loop which has 16 sites including two accessible sites, B1 and B6. There are two restrooms (as previously described) behind sites B5 and B10, and two fresh-water spigots near the restrooms. A right turn at the intersection of loop B goes to the Mazama Village Store, gas pumps, and Annie Creek Restaurant and Gift Shop. The next left is C-loop with 26 sites, two restrooms, and fresh-water spigots at C6 and C19. Directly across from the start of C-loop is the dump station access. Turn right off the main campground road, then take an immediate left to access the dump station. Loop through the dump station area to get back to the main campground road. C-loop is followed by D-loop with 35 sites, one restroom near site D6, and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. A path between sites D20 and D21 leads to the campground amphitheater. E-loop is the largest loop in the campground with 55 sites, which accommodate tent campers only. There are two restrooms near sites E20 and E47, and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. Between sites E19 and E21 is a short, gravel access road to the campground amphitheater for park rangers and emergency vehicles, and for visitors walking to or dropping-off. F Loop has 29 sites, and two are accessible, F17 and F21. There is a restroom across from sites F1 and F2, and a restroom with an accessible shower between sites F18 and F22. Multiple fresh-water spigots are located throughout the loop. The end of the main campground road circles through G-loop. This loop has 37 sites with a restroom at the beginning of the loop and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. From July through early September, rangers present evening programs in the amphitheater, located between D & E loops. There is no parking, including accessible parking, at the amphitheater. Visitors must walk to or be dropped off. Drop-off drivers may use the gravel access road between sites E19 and E21 but cannot park there without the ranger‚Äôs permission due to limited space. Unlit walking paths from D & E loop which lead to the front of the outdoor amphitheater are soft soil, not a packed surface. In the amphitheater, lights are on the ground next to the 22 rows of wooden bench seats in three sections from left to right, with wide aisles. Benches face a stage and large movie screen protected within a white structure. There is no designated space for wheelchairs. On the left-hand side of the seating area is a large rock campfire pit, used at the ranger‚Äôs discretion. Rangers wear microphones and will try to accommodate any accessible requests brought to their attention. Annie Creek flows through a canyon behind the campground loops and can be heard from several campsites. Annie Creek Trail cuts behind loops C through G with access from the amphitheater or site C11. It is a steep, narrow, dirt path that descends into the canyon following alongside the creek before returning up steep switchbacks.",

Late summer can bring strong monsoonal storms that can make access roads hazardous or inaccessible. Fall brings cooler temperatures and marks the start of hunting season. Winter commonly means freezing temperatures, and snow is often seen at this location. Spring is pleasant, with warm days and cooler evening temperatures. Wildflowers are generally seen later in spring than in lower elevation areas.",

Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with slots for dropping registration payment receipts into individual squares. To the left of the registration board is a brown box with a lid holding campground registration envelopes. A 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing payment envelopes stands in front of and to the left of the board. It has a slot at the top for slipping in the envelope. Posted to the left of the registration board is payment information and campground registration instructions, along with a site map of the campground. Above the board a notice reads, Firewood not available in campground. Purchase outside of park. To the right of the board are campground regulations and a tide chart. A recycle bin and garbage dumpsters are to the right of the kiosk on a gravel surface. To the left of the kiosk, a concrete sidewalk leads to a wide patio area with a white, rectangular restroom building with a blue metal roof. The women‚Äôs room is on the left short side of the building, and the men‚Äôs room is on the right front side of the building. Across the sidewalk from the women‚Äôs room is a square, 3-foot-tall stone water station. It‚Äôs two spigots face the restroom. A sign on top reads, no dishwashing. The sidewalk loops in front of the water station and leads back to the road. Be advised. The concrete sidewalk ends after about 20 feet, transitioning to gravel, then asphalt. In places along the asphalt section, cracks and frost heaves create an uneven surface.",

The side facing the entrance road includes information about day hikes at Quinault; wildlife, food, and your safety; stock use; river crossings; pet regulations; firearms and weapons; and cougars in the area. On the opposite side is a box with a lid holding camping permits. Posted above are campground registration instructions and payment instructions. Other notices include campground and fishing regulations, nearest services, how to help preserve your park, and to contact a park ranger or dial 911 in an emergency. On the food storage locker behind the bulletin board a sign reads: Shared food storage for walk-in sites or campers with no vehicles. Place all food and scented items in locker anytime they are not in use. Please do not use for garbage. Thank you. Campsite surfaces are flat and mostly grass and dirt. Each site has a picnic table and in-ground metal fire pit. The sites are nestled in a forest of young and old pine trees.

To the left (north) is the entrance to the Campground reservation station parking lot. To the right begins the one-way loop into and around the campground itself. Turning left into the Campground reservation lot, two long rows of parallel parking spaces face left and right along a one-lane, roughly 250-foot (75 meter) long central driveway. The cinderblock Campground reservation station is located at the top of the lot at the right. A concrete sidewalk surrounds the station, edged with low, flat boulders. Note a wheelchair-accessible parking space located at the top of the lot at the right, just before the station. A short, concrete ramp leads up from the space to the station sidewalk. At the top of the ramp to the right, note an automated external defibrillator (AED) device mounted in a small metal and glass case on the side wall of the building. Note there is a second wheelchair-accessible, reserved parking area directly across the road from the station at the left. The reservation window juts out from the left-side wall of the small building, with a thick, 12-inch (30 centimeter) deep wooden writing shelf along its entire width at its base (about four feet [one point two meters] high). Note two concrete support pillars set back from the window on the sidewalk at the front left and right. Bulletin boards on the walls on both sides of the wide, central reservation window provide information about weather in the canyon, North Rim Park Ranger programs, and other camping available outside the park. The North Rim Campground has three A D A accessible family campsites. These sites have larger parking areas, are located closer to restrooms, and have raised fire rings. From the three A D A campsites, wheelchairs can access the nearby restrooms. Restrooms have paved ramps to restroom entrances, and each restroom has an A D A compliant stall. Moving from the General Store into the Campground, note a small dirt and gravel area at the left with an information kiosk in the center under some trees. Being mindful of a couple boulders in front of the kiosk, a couple bulletin boards provide information about the weather, North Rim Park Ranger programs, and what‚Äôs currently in bloom. In the Spring and early Summer, bitterweed blooms with long, thin yellow petals, alongside the small yellow clusters of creeping barberry, the deep blue to bluish purple, notched flowers of Nelson‚Äôs larkspur, the elongated clusters of purple lupine, or the rounded pink and white petals of spreading phlox. Later in the season, the yellow desert blazing star blooms with five broad, bright yellow petals with a tuft of yellow filaments in the center, alongside goldenrod, pink and white buckbrush, wild strawberry, and the showy red tubular, two-inch long, three-lobed blooms of the long leafed paintbrush. The North Rim Campground, open seasonally from May 15 through October 15",

If you are standing at campground, Cuyler Harbor Beach is a mile to the north, by trail. The ranger station is about half a mile away to the southwest. The Lester Ranch site is about halfway along that trail. To the west, in the distance, is Green Mountain. At the campground, there are nine, slatted wooden U-shaped fences or windbreaks that stand about five feet tall. A metal storage box on legs is positioned in a corner of each windbreak. A wooden and metal picnic table is adjacent to each campsite. A wooden restroom building is at the south end of the campsite. It is about 5 feet by 6 feet, with a shingled roof, a lockable door, and a single pit toilet inside. The sign on the door shows symbols for a man and a woman. On the exterior, attached to one side, is a low box with a hinged lid. On another side of the building is a bulletin board with updateable information posted behind glass. On the fourth side of the building is a panel of regulations titled ‚ÄúSan Miguel Island Campground‚Äù with its own, separate audio description.",

In late summer and fall, the grass is brown, the brush looks brown and brittle, and the branches of the coreopsis are brown with shaggy dark brown tufts at the tips. A dirt and gravel trail through the camping area connects ten sites, each with a picnic table and a metal food storage box.

At the southern edge of the campground is a creek that runs at the base of the canyon. A distant view of the ocean can be seen beyond the mouth of the canyon. At the lowest part of the campground, if you are facing up-canyon, the restroom building is on your right. A short cement sidewalk leads up toward this single-story wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof. The roof has two solar panels on the roof. One is a solar hot water panel‚Äîa grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building‚Äôs left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters‚Äîthree-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side. A wooden plaque with a sign that reads, Please help protect our wildlife. Please do not rinse dishes, brush teeth, or use soap at the water faucets. Please wash dishes at the large sink next to bathroom. Thank you.",

Sites A-E are located on a short paved loop road off of Turkey Run Road and Sites F-I are located around a large paved square parking area at the end of Turkey Run Road. The amphitheater is located down a dirt trail at the southwest corner of the large square paved parking area. Sites A, B, D, G, H, and I can hold up to 25 campers, and sites C, E, and F can hold up to 40 campers. All these group campsites are in a mixed hardwood forest with plenty of shade, several picnic tables at each site, and grated campfire rings. There are 2 restrooms with flush toilets and sinks: one at the end of the loop near sites A-E and one near the square parking area near sites F-I. Several dark brown park office buildings are also located near the square parking area, although they are closed to the public. Several dirt trails through the forest leave from the campground area: the Turkey Run Ridge Trail for hiking starts across Turkey Run Road from the loop holding sites A-E, the Little Run Loop Trails for hiking start from behind the restrooms near the square parking area, and Old Blacktop Road for hiking and biking is a wide gravel trail that start at a gate at the end of Turkey Run Road near the end of the square parking area.

The campground is in the bottom of a deep canyon in a forest of mid elevation evergreen trees. White River Road ends at the campground with the campground ranger station to the right on arrival with information boards and parking just beyond. Past the ranger station the road continues into the campground loops. The campground has four campsite loops, labeled A through D. Loop A is the first loop to the right. Turnoffs for loops B and C continue in order on the right as you drive down the main road of the campground. A few individual campsites border the right side of the main road. The entrance to the picnic area is located directly across from the entrance to Loop C. From the main road, continue straight past Loop C to Loop D which circles to the left and returns back to the main campground road across from Loop C. Campsites on the right side of the road on the farthest side of Loop D are situated next to the White River. A historic patrol cabin that has exhibits inside on the early use of a system of patrol cabins and the history of the round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail is to the right as you enter Loop D. The small amphitheater is located to the right just passed the patrol cabin. There are five restrooms. One restroom is located on the left side of the loop in Loop A, one is on the right near the entrance of Loop B, one is between the picnic area and Loop D, an accessible restroom is between Loop B and Loop C, and one is on the left side of Loop D across from the amphitheater. The Wonderland Trail runs through the campground and can be accessed to the right of the patrol cabin to head uphill toward Sunrise and next to the restroom in the picnic area to head south. Glacier Basin Trail is accessed across the road from the amphitheater or from the right side of farthest end of Loop D. The picnic area runs parallel to the road with parking spots on either side of the short picnic area road, picnic tables are on the far side of the picnic area from the road, a restroom is located to the right of the picnic tables, and a trail to access the river is accessed from the left end of the picnic tables.",
