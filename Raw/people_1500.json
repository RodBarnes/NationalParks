            "bodyText": "In 1760 at only eighteen years of age, John Johnson, son of Sir William Johnson, became Captain of a company of the Tryon County Militia.<br /> <br /> While studying in England, Johnson had his father's hereditary title confirmed by King George III, and he was knighted Sir John Johnson in 1765. When his father died in 1774, Johnson also became Major General of the Tryon County Militia. With the coming of the American Revolution however, he was forced to flee to Canada in 1776 to avoid being arrested. His crime was being a loyalist in patriot territory. The patriots also feared Johnson would use his strong influence to rally both loyalists and members of the Six Nations Indian Confederacy to the British cause.<br /> <br /> Once in Canada, Johnson raised the King's Royal Regiment of New York. Much of the regiment was composed of men from the Mohawk Valley who, like Johnson, had been forced to flee to Canada because of their loyalist sympathies.<br /> <br /> Johnson and his regiment were with Barry St. Leger while they besieged Fort Stanwix in August of 1777. They also fought in the Battle of Oriskany against former friends, family, and neighbors. Johnson and his followers had planned on regaining their homes and lands once the British took Fort Stanwix. When the British were forced to retreat, this dream was destroyed. Later in the war, Johnson carried out raids throughout the Mohawk and Schoharie Valleys that destroyed crops and villages and spread terror throughout the patriot inhabitants of the valleys. Johnson had an intense hatred for these people who had driven him out of his home and his beloved Mohawk Valley.<br /> <br /> Johnson never returned to New York after the war, and his home was sold by the Americans to help pay off their war debts. Johnson remained in Canada and eventually took over his father's role as superintendent of Indian affairs and during the War of 1812 he served as Brigadier General for a portion of the Canadian Militia.<br /> <br /> The members of his regiment would help to found and settle the modern day Kingston, Canada area. Upon his death in 1830 people of all classes and sorts in Canada gathered at his new home in Kingston to mourn him as a man of the people.",

            "bodyText": "Johnson came from Ireland to America in the 1740's to manage his uncle's Mohawk Valley estate. A very enterprising man, Johnson was quick to grasp the possibilities that existed for accumulating wealth and land in the Valley.<br /> <br /> Along with overseeing his uncle's business affairs, he soon had his own trading business with the Indians. He was one of the few Englishmen to understand the benefits of assimilating Indian culture into his political and business dealings with them. This helped give Johnson more credibility with the Indians. His greatest influence would always be with the Six Nations, particularly the Mohawks. Johnson was eventually adopted into the Mohawk Nation and took Molly Brant, a Mohawk Clan Mother, as his second wife in a common law marriage.<br /> <br /> With start of the French and Indian War, English political and military leaders recognized Johnson's talents in working with Indians. In 1755, Johnson was appointed as Superintendent of Indian Affairs and was given a dual military commission as \"Colonel of the Six Nations\" and Major General of provincial forces. Also in 1755, Johnson was given the task of leading a mixed colonial/Indian force against French Fort Fredrick (modern Crown Point, NY) on Lake Champlain. The French attacked Johnson's force while it was encamped at Lake George, and Johnson was wounded. The resulting Battle of Lake George gave England its only victory against the French that year. To reward him, King George II knighted Johnson and made him a Baron. Johnson was the only colonist ever to be knighted, and the title is still in existence today. In 1759, Johnson was assigned to raise and lead a colonial/Indian force to support the British during their attack against French Fort Niagara. During the siege of the fort, the British commander was killed, and Johnson claimed command by virtue of his senior rank. This put him at odds with the regular British officers who did not feel that provincial commissions were on par with royal ones. In spite of this, Johnson retained command and finally forced the French to surrender.<br /> <br /> Johnson worked tirelessly throughout the war to ally the Six Nations with England. This job was made all the more difficult due to England's lackluster performance against the French during the war's early years. Most Six Nations support for the British during the war would come from the Mohawks, due to Johnson's personal influence with them. It wasn't until near the end of the war, when it was obvious that France would lose, that Johnson's efforts bore full fruit and brought the Six Nations onto England's side as official allies. In 1764, a year after the end of the French and Indian War, a united Indian uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion broke out in response to illegal colonial settlement on the frontier. It was largely through Johnson's influence that the Six Nations did not join in this rebellion.<br /> <br /> While Johnson did usually keep the interests of the Indians at heart, he was not above using his position for personal gain. In 1768, he acted as the official Crown representative to negotiate a boundary line treaty of the frontier between England, the Six Nations, and other affiliated Indian nations. During these negotiations, Johnson overstepped his authority and pushed the boundary line further west then had been agreed to by the British government. Except for Johnson and some close friends, this treaty left everyone else (Indians, colonists, and the British government) unhappy.<br /> <br /> Johnson was the driving force behind the creation of Tryon County in 1772. Situating the county courthouse and jail in his developing village of Johnstown allowed him to control virtually most of the political life of the new county. It was this power and influence in the daily workings of the county that kept rebellious activity nearly non-existent in the Mohawk Valley for many years directly prior to the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> A combination of his old war wound and various sicknesses began to take a toll on Johnson's health as he aged, but he was not one to rest. In the midst of an Indian conference at his home in July of 1774, Sir William Johnson died. His death would leave a gap in royal authority over both the Indians and the colonists at a time when England needed it most.",

Butler’s Father, John Butler had been a longtime friend of Sir William Johnson and served under him in the British Indian department.<br /> <br /> With the coming of the American Revolution, the Butlers maintained their loyalty to the king. When his father fled to Fort Niagara in 1775, young Butler went with him and received a commission as an Ensign in the 8<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot.<br /> <br /> Butler served with the detachment of the 8<sup>th</sup> Regiment that besieged Fort Stanwix in 1777. During the siege he was given permission to take a small party of British, Loyalist and Indian troops down to German Flatts (modern Herkimer) in an attempt to recruit support for St. Leger’s army. With the belief that traveling under a white flag would protect them, Butler made no effort to conceal his activities. While meeting with residents in a local tavern, Butler’s group was quickly captured by the American garrison at Fort Dayton. A court martial board headed by Lt. Col. Marinus Willett sentenced Butler and several more of the group to death as spies. Instead of being executed however, Butler was sent to prison in Albany. After prolonged petitioning to be moved from the unhealthy conditions of the Albany prison, Butler’s request was finally honored, and he was moved to a private house and closely guarded. Aided by Loyalist sympathizers in the city, Butler eventually escaped on August 21 of 1778 and rejoined his father at Fort Niagara. Once there, he accepted a captain’s commission in his father’s newly raised regiment of Loyalist rangers.<br /> <br /> Butler organized and led the Loyalist/Indian raid on the settlement of Cherry Valley in November of 1778. Whether due to a thirst for revenge or a lack of experience in commanding Indians, Butler separated his forces and gave the Indians free reign through the settlement. This led to many civilian deaths and the raid became known as a “massacre.” One of the families killed had been close friends of the Butler’s prior to the war, and even Butler’s father expressed dismay over his son’s conduct during the operation. Walter Butler would be forever blamed for the “Cherry Valley Massacre” and tales of his bloodthirstiness (whether fact or fiction) would grow as the war went on. Walter Butler soon became the most hated man in the Mohawk Valley.<br /> <br /> Butler took part in the resistance efforts against the American invasion of Six Nations Indian lands in 1779 and served during Sir John Johnson’s raid of the Mohawk and Schoharie Valleys in 1780.<br /> <br /> In October of 1781, Butler commanded a party of rangers during the last large-scale Loyalist/ Indian raid into the Mohawk Valley. Attacked by Col. Willett’s forces at Johnstown, the Loyalist/Indian force began a retreat through the Adirondack wilderness to reach Canada. Pursued closely by Willet’s troops, on October 30, Butler was placed in charge of the rear guard as the main force crossed West Canada Creek. In the brief skirmish between Butler and Willett’s forces, Butler was killed, most likely by an Oneida Indian. Butler was also scalped. Willett’s sentence of death from 1777 had finally been carried out. One story holds that Butler’s regimental coat and officer’s insignia was sold in Schenectady and his scalp traded in Albany.<br /> <br /> Word of the British surrender at Yorktown reached Albany at the same time as the news of Butler’s death. It is said that the report of Butler’s death caused even more rejoicing than the news of Yorktown.  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Suffragist Margaret Foley relied on her captivating personality and trained voice to draw attention to women’s suffrage in Boston. Called “heckler-in-chief” by a <em>Boston Herald</em> journalist, Foley followed anti-suffrage politicians throughout the state, asking them how they would vote on prospective state suffrage bills.<sup>1</sup> Historians credit “the Heckler” with pushing multiple anti-suffrage politicians out of office.</p> <p>Born on February 19, 1873 to Irish immigrant parents in Dorchester, Massachusetts, Foley’s life experiences differed from many of the wealthier suffrage leaders.<sup>2</sup> Graduating from Girls’ High School in Roxbury, Foley worked in a hat factory and served as the treasurer for the Hat Trimmers’ Union. She also held a position on the board of the Boston Woman’s Trade Union League (BWTUL).<sup>3</sup> As a working-class woman, Foley believed that all women deserved the right to vote. In particular, she argued that those who paid taxes, especially those overlooked by society, deserved a political voice:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Some men say that they think a tax-paying woman should have the ballot. I contend that the poorest factory girl is helping pay the taxes and she should have a right to say something about the care, fire protection and sanitary condition of property.</em><sup>4</sup></p> <p>Throughout her career, Margaret Foley worked for different suffrage organizations, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mwsa.htm\">Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association (MWSA)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ma-margaret-brent-suffrage-guild.htm\">Margaret Brent Suffrage Guild</a>. As an MWSA field manager, she solicited support for suffrage by organizing talks and rallies, speaking on street corners and in public meeting houses, and drawing the public’s attention to women’s suffrage. Foley believed, “out-door meetings are a tremendous power in the way of impressing people with the ‘votes for women’ idea.”<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Even before traveling to London with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florence-luscomb.htm\">Florence Luscomb</a> to study under the militant Suffragettes, Foley used drastic tactics to promote suffrage. This included heckling anti-suffrage politicians on the campaign trail and distributing suffrage pamphlets from a hot air balloon over a fair in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1910. While her presentation and tactics sometimes clashed with local suffrage leaders of the middle and upper class, Foley's working-class immigrant background gave her the means to reach broader audiences. Foley extended these skills beyond Massachusetts, traveling across the country to help in various suffrage campaigns.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>While Margaret Foley never married, she did have one constant relationship until the end of her life. Helen Elizabeth Goodnow, a wealthy Boston suffragist, first met Foley when they both worked for the MWSA. In 1916 when the MWSA arranged for Foley to tour the southern states to promote suffrage, Goodnow volunteered to work as Foley’s secretary. At the end of the tour, they attended the Women’s Suffrage Conference in Minnesota. In letters to her grandmother, Goodnow wrote about their activities in Minnesota, and how “Foley likes me better than most any other of her friends. Funny isn’t it.”<sup>7</sup> Goodnow later wrote,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>I think of the hundreds of people who would give anything to be with her for a week. We read together, walked together, got up and went to bed when we felt like it. And she really loves me. Think of Margaret Foley liking little me.</em><sup>8</sup></p> <p>Foley and Goodnow lived together for the rest of Foley's life, although how they defined the nature of their relationship remains unclear.</p> <p>While the <em>Boston Globe</em> called Foley a “pioneer suffragist” upon her death in 1957, Boston publicist William H. McMasters felt she deserved an even greater accolade. Writing to the Editor, he commented on his “great privilege to work with her for the cause to which she dedicated her life.” Calling Foley a woman of “high ideals and undaunted courage,” McMasters closed with a hope that her spirit would find peace in a place of equality.<sup>9</sup> </p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>“M’Inerney is Heckled Again,” <em>Boston Herald</em>, September 22, 1911.</li> <li>Margaret Foley and Helen Elizabeth Goodnow Papers.

He was educated in Cambridge, England.<br /> <br /> In 1756 he joined the British Army as an Ensign in the 28th Regiment. The next year the 28th was shipped to the Americas to participate in the French and Indian, or Seven Years War.<br /> <br /> In 1758, he had already achieved the rank of Captain, now in the 48th Regiment, and took part in the Siege of Louisbourg. In 1759 as a Brigade-Major he participated in the British capture of Montreal.<br /> <br /> He achieved rank twice more in two regiments over the next decade before ending up as Lt. Col. of the 34th Regiment. In 1777 he was appointed brevet Brig. General to lead the western branch of Gen. Burgoyne's three pronged New York invasion force. This lead to his failed siege of the now American Fort Stanwix. St. Leger vastly underestimated the Americans' ability to defend themselves, and in the end attempt to force the garrison to surrender was routed by low morale and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/benedict-arnold.htm\">Benedict Arnold's</a> approach from the east.<br /> <br /> Although he is usually remembered for this failure he was promoted to colonel in 1780 and given command of a group of rangers based in Canada. For the remainder of the American Revolution they led secretive expeditions into the colonies, including two attempts to capture Philip Schuyler and conducting negotiations with Ethan Allen to secure Vermont's loyalties as a free and independent British colony.<br /> <br /> In 1780 <em>St. Leger's Journal of Occurrences in America</em> was published in London. In 1785 his name disappeared from the British Army lists in Canada. He is thought to have died in 1789. However, his will was not proved by his widow until 1794.",

He engaged as the tutor to the son of Conrad Weiser, a Palatine German in Pennsylvania working as a liaison between that colony and the Six Nations Indians.<br /> <br /> Claus accompanied Weiser on a mission to meet with the Onondagas in 1750. There he first met Sir William Johnson. Claus seems to have become enamored with the business of Indian affairs, and with the support of Pennsylvania’s governor, he returned to the Mohawk Valley to immerse himself completely in the culture of the Six Nations. It was the governor’s request that Claus work particularly with the Mohawk community at Ft. Hunter, and he established himself there in 1751.  Claus also resumed his friendship with Johnson. Claus learned the Mohawk language and immersed himself in the Six Nation’s culture. When William Johnson received his appointment as Indian superintendent in 1755, it ended all colonial governors’ authority to conduct Indian affairs on their own and released Claus from his duties to Pennsylvania. Claus then accepted a commission from Johnson as a lieutenant in the Indian department and an appointment as deputy superintendent of Indian affairs. Claus accompanied Johnson on his campaign against Ft. St. Fredric (Crown Point) and took part in the Battle of Lake George. When the war ended, Claus continued his deputy superintendent position and Johnson put him directly in charge of the Indian nations of Canada. Claus married one of Sir William’s daughters in 1762.  Despite his position as superintendent of the Canadian Indians, He and his wife settled in a house in the modern Amsterdam area, near Ft. Johnson. In 1768, Claus was appointed colonel of a regiment of Albany county militia. Claus retained his position as deputy superintendent after Johnson’s death, when Sir William’s nephew Guy Johnson became the new superintendent.  <br /> <br /> With the coming of the American Revolution, Claus retained his British loyalties. In 1775, he fled to Canada with Guy Johnson. Arriving there, he learned the British governor of Canada, Sir Guy Carleton had created his own Indian department and replaced Claus. He traveled to Britain in the winter of 1775 and spent two years there attempting to reestablish a position for himself. He finally returned in the spring of 1777 with a commission as superintendent of the Indians for the St. Leger expedition. It was the Indian scouts sent out by Claus that brought back reports that Fort Stanwix was too strong to be damaged by the small cannon St. Leger had with him. In the end however, St. Leger dismissed this information. Claus would later claim to his superiors that the scouting report was given early enough for St. Leger to have sent for heavier artillery if he had chosen to act upon it. The failure of the Stanwix expedition was also a personal blow for Claus as it ended his hopes of returning to his home, property, and life in the Mohawk Valley. In 1778, a new British governor, Sir Fredrick Haldimand, was appointed to Canada, and with more and more Six Nations Indians seeking refuge in Canada, Haldimand appointed Claus Deputy Superintendent of the Six Nations in Canada.<br /> <br /> For the remainder of the war Claus would be based in Montreal overseeing scouting and intelligence gathering operations by combined groups of Six Nations Indians and Indian department rangers.<br /> <br /> After the war, Claus worked at establishing lands and communities for Six Nations Indians who decided to settle in Canada. He also collaborated with Mohawk leader Joseph Brant to translate the English “Common Book of Prayer” into the Mohawk language. Claus actively pursued compensation from the British government for the loses he incurred in supporting the British during the war. It was during one of these trips to England seeking compensation that he died on November 9, 1787.<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>The man for whom Fort Stanwix was named lived an unusual life and died an unusual death. General John Stanwix was a British soldier and politician who lived between 1690 - 1766.</p> <p>Were it not for his rich uncle -- his mother’s brother -- he would have gone through life with his original name, John Roos. He was born around 1690 to the Rev. John Roos, a rector of Widmerpool in Nottinghamshire, England. His uncle, Col. Thomas Stanwix, was a member of Parliament. When his uncle died in 1725, he inherited his fortune -- and took his uncle’s last name.  </p> <p>It was common in England at that time for people to adopt the names of those who left them large inheritances. It was a way for those who were childless to assure that their names would live on. Stanwix and his wife, Ann Holmes of Dublin, had one son and one daughter, Fidelia.</p> <p>Stanwix was a captain in his uncle’s regiment, the 12th Foot. He had entered the army when he was 16 years old. In 1745, he was promoted to the rank of major. Four years later he became an equerry -- an officer of the British royal household who attends or assists members of the royal family -- to the Prince of Wales. In 1754, Stanwix was appointed deputy quartermaster-general. His wife died that year.  </p> <p>Following in the footsteps of his uncle, Stanwix also served as a member of Parliament, representing Carlisle, from 1741-1742 and from 1746-1761.</p> <p>And in 1756 -- 20 years before the Declaration of Independence in 1776 -- he received orders to the British colonies in America, where he served in the Royal American Regiment as colonel-commandant of the 1st Battalion. His headquarters were in Pennsylvania. His only son died the same year.</p> <p>In 1758 -- the year the British started construction on Fort Stanwix, which was named in his honor -- he made brigadier-general. Subsequently, Brig. Gen. Stanwix became the first commander of Fort Stanwix, an outpost designed by Lt. John William, a member of Great Britain’s Corps of Engineers, also oversaw its construction. Another man who helped build the fort was Colonel Marinus Willett -- who would eventually end up an officer in the Continental Army and second in command of the fort during the American Revolution. </p> <p>When a dispute arose among officers over the fort’s design, Stanwix stepped up and let it be known that the construction would not be delayed while they argued over the fort’s shape and size. He ordered Williams to proceed. The plans called for the fort to be 330 feet from bastion point to bastion point, and large enough to house 400 soldiers. According to one source, the first log was laid on Aug. 26, 1758. The fort was completed between between 1758 and 1761, at a cost of $266,000.</p> <p>In 1759, Stanwix was promoted to major general, and returned to Pennsylvania. There, he had Fort Pitt built. At that time, his duties included the defense of the western border of Pennsylvania, and “subduing the French posts from Pittsburg to Lake Erie.”</p> <p>In 1761, Stanwix became a lieutenant general. He returned to England and was appointed lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight. From 1761 to 1766, he served as a member of Parliament for Appleby in Westmorland. Stanwix married Mary Sowle in 1763, but had no more children.</p> <p>Sadly, Stanwix, along with his wife and daughter, were lost at sea while crossing from Dublin, Ireland, to Holyhead, Wales when the packet The Eagle went down on October 29, 1766. Stanwix, 76, had been on his way to London to attend parliament. There were no survivors. <br /> <br /> No images of Stanwix himself are known to exist. However, a funeral/mourning print to his daughter has survived as a memorial to the tragedy that ended their lives. A poem etched on the portrait reads:<br /> <br /> <em>On the dark bosom of the faithless main Where stormy winds and roaring tempests reign, Far from her native fields and friendly skies, In early death's cold arms Fidelia lies. Ah! spare to tell (for she is now no more) What virtue beauty sweetness charm'd before Here let the pensive muse in silence mourn Where friendship to her name has rais'd the sacred urn.</em></p> <hr /> <h4>Credits:<i></i></h4> <p><i>This article was compiled for the Rome Historical Society by Chip Twellman Haley, retired Daily Sentinel news editor.

            "bodyText": "Goose Van Schaick was born in Albany, NY in 1736.<br /> <br /> His father, Sybrant, was mayor of Albany from 1756-1761. Goose became a Lt. in the 1756 Crown Point expedition, and captain of militia in the capture of Ft. Frontenac under Bradstreet in 1758. By the end of the French and Indian War he had also served as a Lt. Col. for the 2nd NY Provincials and 1st NY Regiment.<br /> <br /> In June of 1775 Van Schaick became a colonel in charge of the 2nd NY Regiment. He and his men joined Montgomery as part of the American invasion of Canada. Early next year, 1776, he was commissioned commander of the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">1st NY Regiment</a> while at Johnstown in the Mohawk Valley. He was wounded at Ticonderoga in 1777. It is believed no images of him exist as he was concious of the scar left on his face from the wound. He commanded a brigade during the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. Around the same time he also became a brother-in-law to young <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-gansevoort.htm\">Col. Peter Gansevoort</a> as his sister Catherine became Gansevoort's new bride.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-van-schaick-expedition-april-1779.htm\">What he might be best known for is his raid against the Onondagas while under command of Fort Stanwix in April of 1779</a>. This preceded the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-clinton-sullivan-campaign-of-1779.htm\">Clinton/Sullivan Campaign</a> of that year. Van Schaick left the fort with approximately 550 men, marched through the surrounding Onondaga territories for five days and 180 miles, was able to considerably disable the Nations forces for making war, captured 37 prisoners, 100 muskets, and never lost a single person before returning to the gates of the fort. He was given the Thanks of Congress on May 10, 1779 for his actions.<br /> <br /> Van Schaick remained in command of Albany during the Clinton/Sullivan Campaign before marching south to participate in the <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/york/index.htm\">Yorktown Campaign</a>. On October 10, 1783, he was breveted Brig. Gen., and one month later he retired from the American Continental Army. Van Schaick's facial scar became cancerous as he aged. According to most sources, Goose Van Schaick died on July 4, 1789, most likely as a result of that cancer. ",

            "bodyText": "The man known as \"Gentleman Johnny\" to his peers was born in 1722, a descendent of the Lancashire family.<br /> <br /> He was educated in his youth at the Westminster School. In 1740, he became a cornet in the 13th Light Dragoons and bought a lieutenant's commission the next year.<br /> <br /> In 1743, the young gentleman eloped with Lady Charlotte; sister of a close friend from Westminster and daughter to the Earl of Derby. Her father was not pleased and gave them a small amount of money as a dismissal from the family. With this, Burgoyne purchased a captaincy in the 13th Dragoons. However, after a short while, their money was gone and the commission had to be sold. The couple moved to France just to get by.<br /> <br /> After seven years in financial exile Burgoyne had mastered the French language and literature. His father-in-law had also come to see family in a different light and worked to get John a captaincy in the 11th Dragoons. In 1758, Burgoyne trade that for a commission as a captain and Lt. Col. in the Coldstream Guard. Between his military prowess and Lord Derby's influence, Burgoyne became an important part in the British campaign against the French coast during the Seven Years/French and Indian War. He was also the key figure in the formation of the first two British light horse regiments, one of which he was given command in 1759. For the rest of the war he lead these men in a brilliant and just manor earning the nickname \"Gentleman Johnny\" from his soldiers for his leadership.<br /> <br /> During this time he also served in the Parliament and was considered a true politician, helping to bring about reform in the East India Company with the Regulating Act. He was also considered a reckless gambler, an amateur actor, a playwright, but still true to the Tory cause.<br /> <br /> At the outbreak of the American Revolution, in 1775, Burgoyne was shipped to Boston with Gen. Wm. Howe and Henry Clinton to help British Gen. Gage assess the situation in the harbor. He became more of a hindrance that a help, however, becoming the over-eager butt of American and British jokes and over-analyzing Gage's tactics to the point of discredit. Before shipping back to England in November 1775 he witnessed the Battle of Bunker/Breed's Hill first hand.<br /> <br /> In May 1776, Burgoyne was sent back with just enough men to halt the American invasion force at Quebec. While participating in the Battle of Valcour Island he began to envision the workings of a New York invasion, the Campaign of 1777. His campaign began well early in the summer of 1777 with the hopes that Gen. Howe (already in New York City) and Barry St. Leger (coming from the west through the Mohawk Valley) would be able to successfully divide the colony in half and meet him at Albany, NY. His branch quickly made it to the area of Stillwater, NY by September, never knowing the other two commanders would not be making the rendezvous. After two hard fought battles in the next month, Burgoyne surrendered his army of 6,000 men to the American Gen. Horatio Gates on October 17. After his parole back to England and much controversy he was able to convince his peers that much of the blame lay with others for lack of proper planning and support of his plan.<br /> <br /> He was returned to some power throughout the British Empire in the years to follow but began to retreat more into his private life, focusing on the writing and release of his plays. The most famous of these is <em>The Heiress</em>. In 1776, his wife Lady Charlotte died, yet Lord Derby continued to raise four of Burgoyne's children from illegitimate relationships. The eldest of which, Sir John Fox Burgoyne, went to participate in the Battle of New Orleans.<br /> <br /> Seemingly healthy the day before, John Burgoyne died on June 4, 1792. On August 13 he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey.",

When they arrived at the Newark airport early that morning, they were offered the opportunity to take Flight 93 instead of their scheduled, later flight. Jean had worked as a Registered Nurse and nursing instructor, and was a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician. Volunteerism, driven by deep faith, filled her and her husband's retirement years.They mentored and supported many in their church and community of Spring Lake, New Jersey.  In addition to her nursing degree from the University of Rochester, Jean held a master’s degree in education from Columbia University. When the Petersons married in 1984, each had three children from a previous marriage.</p>",

Following the construction of U.S. Highway 62/180, they developed a roadside store. <br /> <br /> The Glovers were opposed to the establishment of Guadalupe Mountains National Park and refused to sell their lands which were included within the proposed park boundary.

He filed for the purpose of settling on public land in Coffee Springs, Geneva County, Alabama. On the application, John solemnly swore that he was “a native born citizen of the U.S. and over 21 years of age” and confirmed that he had resided on the land since October 29, 1888.<br /> <br /> The application was made for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation for his exclusive use and benefit and not directly or indirectly for the use or benefit of any other person. He confirmed that his improvements consisted of one log dwelling, one cook house. and seven acres of land in cultivation that he valued at $200. John stated that because of the great distance to the District Land Office, he was unable to appear in person to file the Homestead Affidavit. He confirmed that he had never before made a homestead entry and provided his mark of an “X”. The Homestead Affidavit was signed by S. F. Latimer, Clerk of the Court of Geneva County, Alabama on October 10, 1889.<br /> <br /> At the Post Office in Coffee Springs, Alabama, the application for the homestead property in Geneva County was submitted on October 10, 1889. Under Section 2289, Revised Statues of the United States, John Kyles submitted the application for Surveyed Lands located at the North half of the Southwest quarter, the Northwest quarter of the Southeast quarter and the Southeast quarter of the Northwest quarter of Section 34 in Township 3 North of Range 21 East of the St. Stephens Principal Meridian containing 160.78 acres. The application also indicated an “Excess Receipt” notation number 23392.<br /> <br /> John’s request was received and acknowledged by the Land Office at Montgomery, Alabama on October 12, 1889. Julian H. Bingham, Register of the Land Office, certified the application for surveyed Lands under the Revised Statutes of the United States and confirmed that the application was valid.<br /> <br /> After the land was properly registered, the Receiver’s Office in Montgomery acknowledged the receipt of $14.00 from John Kyles on October 12, 1889, as the amount of fee and compensation of Register and Receiver for the entry of property located at North half of the Southwest quarter, the Northwest quarter of the Southeast quarter and the Southeast quarter of the Northwest quarter of Section 34 in Township 3 North of Range 21 East, of the St. Stephens Principal Meridian.  The receipt was signed by Nathan H. Alexander, Receiver. <br /> <br /> John (Henry) Kyles obtained a license to marry Frances Eddins on June 23, 1892 in the Coffee County Probate Court signed by Judge B.M. Stephens. Peter Eddins witnessed the rites of matrimony which were solemnized by Hamp Thomas, Minister.<br /> <br /> Public Notice No. 14256 of John’s intention to make final proof in support of his claim was posted from October 31, 1893 to December 16, 1893 in the Geneva Mirror, a newspaper published by Mirror Publishing Company. Names of witnesses who could prove that John Kyles maintained continuous residence and cultivated the land were included in the posting. The witness names were John T. Harrison, Henry Finney, Alexander Fitzpatrick, and Archie McNair, all of Coffee Springs, Alabama. This public notice was acknowledged by J.H. Bingham, Register in Chancery Court for Geneva, Alabama. <br /> <br /> The following Homestead Proof and Testimony of Claimant was provided by John Kyles on  December 16, 1893. He gave his age as 35 years old at the time and his post office was located in Coffee Springs, Alabama. He was a natural citizen, born in Mississippi, although most of the census records indicate that he was born in Georgia. He claimed to be the person who made the homestead entry on October 12, 1889. He described the land he claimed as primarily pine and timber and only fit for farming purposes.<br /> <br /> His initial residence was established on October 1888. The improvements to the land included a residence of a framed log house and 50 acres of open land. He placed the value of his homestead at $400. He lived continuously in the residence with his wife and two children and he had never been absent from the homestead since making the settlement. <br /> <br /> He cultivated about 50 acres of crops each year, for a total of five years of crops. His land was not within the limits of an incorporated town or used in any way for trade and business. He described the land as common pine land with some timber, but the most valuable use was for agricultural purposes. There were no indications of coal or minerals of any kind on the land. He had not made any other homestead entry and he had not sold, conveyed, or mortgaged any portion of his land. He did not have any personal property of any kind elsewhere. He completed the form with his signature and it was certified by R.M. Gray, Register on December 16, 1893.<br /> <br /> Two witnesses provided statements in support of John Kyles’s application. The witnesses were John T. Harrison, 27  years old and Archie McNair, 35 years old. Both witnesses confirmed everything as stated by John Kyles. They both listed the improvements to the land as one framed dwelling, one log house and fifty acres of open land valued at $400. Both witnesses signed their statements and both testimonies were signed by R.M. Gray, Register in Chancery for Geneva County, Alamabama on December 16, 1893.<br /> <br /> In the “Final Affidavit Required of Homestead Claimants” John Kyles solemnly swear that he was a citizen of the United States, that he actually made settlement upon, cultivated, and resided upon the land from October 1, 1888 to the present (December 16,1893). He was the sole bona fide owner as the actual settler. The affidavit was signed by John Kyles and certified by R. M. Gray, Register in Chancery for Geneva County, Alabama on December 16,1893.<br /> <br /> On January 5, 1894 a Certificate of Posting of Notice was required as final proof in support of his Homestead Entry No. 23027 in the Land Office at Montgomery, Alabama was certified by Register J.H. Bingham. A printed copy of the notice was posted in a conspicuous place in his office for a period of 30 days, commencing on October 31, 1893.<br /> <br /> John Kyles made the final payment of $.60 to the Montgomery Receiver’s Office on January 11, 1894. The Final Certificate No. 12820 for 160.78 acres was certified at the Montgomery, Alabama Land Office on the same date and signed by J. H. Bingham, Register. <br /> <br /> The Homestead application received by the Land Office in Montgomery on January 11, 1894 was approved on October 20, 1894. The Homestead Land was finally patented on November 21, 1894 and recorded in Volume 25, page 373. The patent was signed by President Grover Cleveland on November 21, 1894.<br /> <br /> In the 1900 Census, John Henry Kyles, 30 and his wife Frances “Fannie”, 27 were enumerated in Beaver Dam, Geneva County, Alabama. They had three children, Lula; 4, Arcus; 2 and Matterson; 6 months. Also living in his household was John’s widowed mother, Dollie Kyles. They were living on the homestead that was patented in 1894. Some of the neighboring families, who also served as witnesses for his Homestead application were Archibald McNair and Lizzie Fitzpatrick, the widow of Alexander Fitzpatrick. They were also homesteaders.<br /> <br /> By the 1910 Census, John and Frances were enumerated on Settlement Road in Beaver Dam, Geneva County. They had been married for 18 years and had a total of nine children, but a set of twins had died. Their seven living children were Lula; 16, Arcus; 14 and Modeson (Matterson); 12, Joseph; 10 (my grandfather), Viola; 8, Mary F.; 6, and Mantley, 1. It has been shared that John rented portions of his land to three other families and that he cared for his parents until they died. The details about the renters had not been confirmed at the writing of this story. Sadly, his wife, Frances died in 1917 at the age of 36. The cause of death was listed as paralysis.<br /> <br /> In the 1920 Census, John was 51, widowed and living on Upper Enterprise Road in Coffee Springs, in Geneva County. He was living with three sons Arcus; 23, Madison (Matterson) 22, Mantley; 11, two daughters Dolly M.; 16, Mary Frances; 13, and a boarder Obe McNair. In a rented dwelling on his farm lived his 71 year old mother, Dolly and his brother John C., 60. In another rented dwelling on his farm lived Marvin Fitzpatrick and his wife. By 1921, John married Sarah Baldwin, his second wife. Unfortunately, his mother, Dollie Kyles, died in June of 1925 at the age of 90. The cause of death was listed as senility.<br /> <br /> The 1930 Census revealed that 61 year old John and his 36 year old wife Sarah were living on Ezell Bridge Road in Center Geneva in a home that they owned. They had four children, Corabelle (Carrie Belle) 8, Lucius; 6, Roy; 4, and Vela (Vedie M.) 14 months. <br /> <br /> Between 1935 and 1940, John moved his family from his homestead. The 1940 Census revealed that John and Sarah were living in a rented home in Leverett, Coffee County, Alabama. They had two daughters, Carrie Belle; 17 and Vedie M.; 11, two sons Roy; 14 and Nathaniel; 9 and a niece Minnie Phillips; 9. It’s not clear why the family moved or what became of the homestead. It has not been confirmed whether any of the homestead remains in the family. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=AL4830__.373&docClass=STA&sid=s1skbopo.1vd\">General Land Office Records</a><br /> <br /> <strong>~ Contributed by Dr. Mary K.

John Henry Kyles was a farmer. When he obtained his homestead land, he rented out a portion of his land to other farmers while he took care of his parents until their death. He had the example of his father, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/willis-kyles.htm\">Willis Kyles</a>, who obtained a patent for his Homestead on November 9, 1891. As I researched the family, I found the Kyles surname spelled many different ways including Kiles, Kylis, Kyle, Kyler, Kytes, and Kyes. I found that John Henry Kyles was noted as Henry J., John Henry, Henry , John H. on various documents. He had a brother named John C. Kyles who was about 10 years older, however John C. was never a homesteader.<br /> <br /> John Henry Kyles and his first wife and second wife, Frances Eddins and Sarah Baldwin, created an extended family of descendants that easily number in the thousands across the U.S in Alabama, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and other locations. My grandfather, Joe, was one of the 12 Kyles children that migrated to Vassar, Michigan in the mid 1940’s with several others from the Geneva community for jobs in the manufacturing industry. This homestead story is a powerful example of the positive influence that one man’s effort can manifest. This story also demonstrates the power of hard work, perseverance, and community helping each other to achieve a collective goal. The next steps are to explore the current property ownership to see if any family ownership remains. Other steps include to write the stories of the homestead application witnesses, some who eventually became related by marriage. Their stories also deserve to be told.<br /> <br /> <b>About the Author: </b>Dr. Mary K. Clark was raised in rural Millington, Michigan.

His parents were Payne Gibson and Amanda Oats.<br /> <br /> Gibson paid fees of $6.77 on May 1, 1901, and by July 1901 he completed building his house. He and his new wife, Indiana “Indy,” moved onto the property on August 3, 1901. The land was comprised of timber and for agricultural purposes. Afterward, Daner improved upon his property building his dwelling place, (produced with lumber) kitchen, corn crib, and cotton house (all made with logs). He farmed up to 15 acres over 5 seasons. The land and dwellings total value at that time was $200.<br /> <br /> He listed his witness as Charley Edwards, William Miller, Wilbur Ewell, and Berg Fleming, but only he, Charley Edwards, and William Miller were the final witnesses. They listed their nearest post office as Knoxville, Missippi.<br /> <br /> Daner was advised on September 1, 1904, that if he chose to prove his claim through another agent, according to the law of January 1904, it would delay his patent. Daner chose to keep the chancery clerk in Meadville and advised them on September 4, 1904. He next placed his Notice of Publication ad for his patent in Meadville, Mississippi on September 29, 1906. His Proof of Publication was posted weekly in Meadville, Mississippi from October 4, 1906, to November 1, 1906. His Certificate As To Final Posting was posted in the Searchlight Newspaper on November 12, 1906.<br /> <br /> Daner's application was approved April 19, 1907, for the South half of the Northwest quarter of Section 49, Township 5N, Range 1E. His first fee for the property was on May 31, 1901, in the amount of $7. The final fee of $1.77 was paid on November 12, 1906, and Daner received his patent the following year, when he, his wife, and four children were living on the property.<br /> <br /> By the time Daner received his patent, he, his wife, and four children - Luther, Cornelius (Bully), Fannie, and Payne were living on the land. By 1931, Daner and Indiana had 9 more children, Willie, Done, Thad, Albert (Bob), Sarah, Etta, Dick, L.C., and Thelma Ruth.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=0602-191&docClass=MV&sid=fml5sw4h.jip\">Patent Details - BLM GLO Records</a><br /> <br /> ~ Contributed by Denise Griggs<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Denise Griggs\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7164933|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Denise-Griggssmall.jpeg\" title=\"Denise Griggs\" /><br /> Denise Griggs<br /> Photo Credit: D.

            "bodyText": "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Zitkála-Šá (“Red Bird”) was born on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota on February 22, 1876. A member of the Yankton Dakota Sioux, she was raised by her mother after her father abandoned the family. When she was eight years old, Quaker missionaries visited the reservation. They took several of the children (including Zitkála-Šá) to Wabash, Indiana to attend White’s Indiana Manual Labor Institute. Zitkála-Šá left despite her mother’s disapproval. At this residential school, Zitkála-Šá was given the missionary name Gertrude Simmons. She attended the Institute until 1887. She was conflicted about the experience, and wrote both of her great joy in learning to read and write and to play the violin, as well as her deep grief and pain of losing her heritage by being forced to pray as a Quaker and cut her hair.<br /> <br /> She returned to live with her mother on the Yankton Reservation in 1887, but left only three years later. She felt that she did not fit in after her experiences at the Institute. At fifteen years old, she returned to the Institute to further her education. Her study of piano and violin led the Institute to hire her as a music teacher. She graduated in 1895. When she received her diploma, Zitkála-Šá gave a speech advocating for women’s rights.<br /> <br /> Instead of returning home, Zitkála-Šá accepted a scholarship she was offered at Earlham College in Richmond Indiana. It was while at Earlham that she began to collect stories from Native tribes. She translated the stories into Latin and English. In 1897, just six weeks before she was to graduate, Zitkála-Šá had to leave Earlham because of financial and health issues. Again, she chose not to return to the reservation. Instead, she moved to Boston, where she studied violin at the New England Conservatory of Music.[1]<br /> <br /> In 1899, she took a job as music teacher at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania.[2] From 1879 until 1918, it was the flagship <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/boarding-schools.htm\">Indian boarding school</a> in the United States, and used as a model for many others. In 1900, the school sent Zitkála-Šá back to the Yankton Reservation to gather more students. She was shocked to find her family home in disrepair. Many people on the reservation lived in deep poverty, and white settlers were occupying land given to the Yankton Dakota people by the federal government. Zitkála-Šá returned to Carlisle and began writing about Native American life. Her autobiographical and Lakota stories presented her people as generous and loving instead of the common racist stereotypes that portrayed Native Americans as ignorant savages. These stereotypes were being used as arguments why Native Americans needed to be assimilated into white American society. Her writing, which was deeply critical of the boarding school system, was published in the national English-language magazines including <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> and <em>Harper’s Monthly</em>. In 1901, she wrote a piece for <em>Harper’s</em> that described the profound loss of identity felt by a student at the Carlisle Indian School. She was fired from Carlisle.<br /> <br /> Afterwards, Zitkála-Šá spent some time back at home on the reservation taking care of her mother and collecting stories for her book, <em>Old Indian Legends</em>. She also took work at the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) office at Standing Rock Indian Reservation as a clerk. She married Captain Raymond Talefase Bonnin in 1902. They were assigned to the Uintah-Ouray Reservation in Utah, where they lived and worked for the next fourteen years. While there, they had a son, Raymond Ohiya Bonnin.<br /> <br /> In 1910, Zitkála-Šá met William F. Hanson, a professor at Brigham Young University in Utah. They collaborated on an opera. <em>Sun Dance</em> was completed in 1913. Zitkala-Ša wrote the libretto and songs for the story, based on a sacred Sioux ritual that the federal government had prohibited. <em>Sun Dance</em> was the first American Indian opera written. It is a symbol of how Zitkála-Šá lived in and bridged both her traditional Native American world and the world of white America that she was raised in.<br /> <br /> While on the Uintah-Ouray Reservation, Zitkála-Šá joined the Society of American Indians, a group founded in 1911 with the purpose of preserving traditional Native American culture while also lobbying for full American citizenship. Beginning in 1916, Zitkála-Šá was the Society’s secretary. In this position, she corresponded with the BIA. She became increasingly vocal in her criticism of the Bureau’s assimilationist policies and practice, reporting abuse of children when they, for example, refused to pray as Christians. Her husband Raymond was fired from the BIA office in 1916.<br /> <br /> The family moved to Washington, DC. Zitkála-Šá continued her work with the Society of American Indians, where she was colleagues with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/marie-louise-bottineau-baldwin.htm\">Marie Louise Bottineau Baldwin</a>. From 1918 to 1919 Zitkála-Šá edited their journal, <em>American Indian Magazine</em>. She lectured across the country, promoting the preservation of Native American cultural and tribal identities (though she was adamantly against the traditional use of peyote, likening it to the destructive effects of alcohol in Native communities). While being sharply critical of assimilation, she was firm in her conviction that Indigenous people in America should be American citizens, and that as citizens, they should have the vote: “In the land that was once his own – America… there was never a time more opportune than now for American to enfranchise the Red man!”[3] As original occupants of the land, she argued, Native Americans needed to be represented in the current system of government.<br /> <br /> The federal Indian Citizenship Act passed in 1924. It granted US citizenship rights to all Native Americans. However, this did not guarantee the vote. States retained the authority to decide who could and could not vote. In 1926, Zitkála-Šá and her husband founded the National Council of American Indians. Until her death in 1938, she served as president, fundraiser, and speaker. The Council worked to unite the tribes across the United States to gain suffrage for all Indians. Zitkála-Šá also worked with white suffrage groups and was active in the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC) beginning in 1921. Zitkála-Šá created the Indian Welfare Committee of GFWC in 1924. That year, she ran a voter registration drive among Native Americans, encouraging those who could to engage in the democratic process and support legislation that would be good for Native Americans.[4]<br /> <br /> The same year, Zitkála-Šá also published a report entitled \"Oklahoma’s Poor Rich Indians: An Orgy of Graft and Exploitation of the Five Civilized Tribes – Legalized Robbery.\" This article was instrumental in getting the government to investigate the exploitation and defrauding of Native Americans by outsiders for access to oil-rich lands.<br /> <br /> Until her death on January 26, 1928, Zitkála-Šá continued to work for improvements in education, health care, and legal recognition of Native Americans as well as the preservation of Native American culture. She died in Washington, DC. She is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with her husband. Sharing a headstone, she is memorialized as: “His Wife / Gertrude Simmons Bonnin / Zitkala-Ša of the Sioux Indians / 1876-1936.”[5]<br /> <br /> Discover the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-places-of-zitkala-sa.htm\">Places of Zitkála-Šá</a>.<br /> <br /> Notes:<br /> <br /> [1] The New England Conservatory of Music at 290 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 14, 1980.<br /> <br /> [2] The Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

            "bodyText": "Charles Leroy Thomas was born on April 17, 1920, in Birmingham, Alabama, to Horace and Essie Thomas. Horace Thomas was a veteran of World War I. Shortly after Thomas was born, the family moved to Detroit, Michigan, for better jobs and opportunities. The family was able to buy a home there, part of the growing Black middle-class in the area.<br /> <br /> Thomas excelled in school. He had a passion for reading and a great interest in planes and electronics. After graduating from Cass Technical High School in Detroit, he enrolled in the mechanical engineering program at Wayne State University. Shortly after graduating from high school, Thomas started working as a skilled molder at Ford’s Rogue Factory Complex. His father at first helped him get a summer and after-school job there. <br /> <br /> On January 20, 1942, Thomas, then a college junior, was drafted into the U.S. Army. He soon traveled to Fort Custer in Battle Creek, Michigan, for processing. Thomas spent a few days at Fort Custer filling out paperwork and medical examinations before going to Camp Wolters, Texas for basic training and advanced infantry training. He remained at Camp Wolters Infantry Replacement Training Center until July 25, 1942 when he was sent to the 614th Tank Destroyer (TD) Battalion at Camp Carson, Colorado.<br /> <br /> The 614th TD Battalion's mission was to seek, strike, and destroy enemy tanks. The tank destroyer vehicles, which had five-man crews, were built on a tank chassis but without the armor. The primary weapon of the 614th TD Battalion was the 75mm field gun mounted on a M3 half-track. Thomas, equipped with mechanical engineering training, stood out to his superiors and was chosen to attend Tank Destroyer Officer Candidate School when the 614th was re-located to Camp Bowie, Texas on December 18, 1942.<br /> <br /> Upon graduating from Officer Candidate School on March 11, 1943 Thomas was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to Company C in the 614th TD Battalion. Shortly after commissioning, Thomas and the rest of the 614th TD Battalion were transferred to their new home at Camp Hood, Texas. The 614th TD Battalion was reorganized as a towed battalion in May 1943 and their new weapon was the M5 3-inch gun pulled by the M3 half-tracks.<br /> <br /> In late February 1944, the 614th TD Battalion transferred to Camp Polk, in Louisiana, to participate in the Louisiana Maneuvers. These maneuvers were grueling large-scale military exercises in bayous and swamps of the area. The 614th participated in these maneuvers until March 21, 1944, when they returned to Camp Hood.<br /> <br /> On August 10, 1944, Thomas and the rest of the 614th TD Battalion boarded a train on a three-day, 1,700-mile journey to Camp Shanks in Rockland County, New York. Camp Shanks was known as “Last Stop USA” before heading overseas to fight in Europe. <br /> <br /> On August 27, the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion boarded the Esperance Bay in New York City bound for Avonmouth, United Kingdom. They arrived on September 7. On October 2, the men of the 614th headed toward Southampton to prepare for transport to France. Shortly after arrival in Southampton the 614th boarded Landing Ship Tanks, known as LSTs, for the five-day journey across the English Channel. The men landed on Utah Beach and traveled 25 miles east to Cherbourg, France. They bivouacked in a rain-soaked field for the next 30 days. After thirty days in Cherbourg, the 614th was attached to the 95th Infantry Division, which was part of General George Patton’s Third Army. Thomas knew with this assignment he and his men would see combat.<br /> <br /> The 614th first saw combat on November 22, near Mittel, Germany. During this battle 1st Platoon was the first to be hit with enemy fire. When Thomas heard the opening salvo, he rushed his 3rd Platoon forward to assist his comrades. During this first encounter with the enemy, Thomas demonstrated a fearlessness to help his brothers in arms. During their next engagement on December 8, Thomas and his company continued to impress higher-ranking officers with their accurate firing on the enemy.<br /> <br /> On December 14, Thomas led the 3rd Platoon toward the French village of Climbach. As they approached the town, German artillery hit Thomas’s scout car, wounding Thomas in both his arms and legs. He was helping the other men in his car when he was hit with machine-gun fire. Severely wounded, Thomas ordered his guns to deploy and take out the German positions. Thomas continued to lead his troops and identify enemy targets. He eventually was evacuated once he was confident his junior officer could handle on the situation. <br /> After the war, when asked about the battle, Thomas said, “I know I was sent out to locate and draw the enemy fire, but I didn’t mean to draw that much.” Thanks to Thomas’s and the 3rd Platoon’s heroism, the Allied Forces were able to take Climbach.<br /> <br /> Thomas was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on February 20, 1945. After recovering from his wounds, Thomas stayed in the Army and retired on August 10, 1947, with the rank of major. In civilian life, Thomas worked as a missile technician at Selfridge Air Force Base in Michigan and as a computer programmer for the Internal Revenue Service. Major Charles L. Thomas died on February 15, 1980, in Wayne, Michigan. He was buried at the West Lawn Cemetery in Wayne.<br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, the Department of Defense began to study the issue of why no African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II. The investigation looked at historical documents including Distinguished Service Cross paperwork. It was determined that Black soldiers had been denied consideration for the Medal of Honor in World War II because of their race. The report put forward seven men who deserved the Medal of Honor for their actions. Charles L. Thomas was one of them. President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to Thomas on January 13, 1997. The award was presented to Thomas’ niece, Ms. Sandra Johnson.<br /> <br /> Charles L. Thomas’ Medal of Honor citation reads:<br /> “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Then Lieutenant Charles L. Thomas distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 14 December 1944. One platoon of Company C, 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was designated as the lead element in a task force formed to storm and capture the village of Climbach, France. Lieutenant Thomas, the Commanding Officer of Company C, realized, with the obscurity of information regarding the enemy and a complete lack of reconnaissance, the mission would be an extremely dangerous one. Fully cognizant of the danger, Lieutenant Thomas volunteered to command the selected platoon of his company and ride in the column's leading vehicle - a highly maneuverable, but equally vulnerable, M-20 scout car. Lieutenant Thomas knew that if there was a concentration of enemy armor in the village, as was believed, he would absorb the initial shock of the first enemy resistance. The task force left Preuschdorf, France, at 1023 hours, and proceeded to advance in column toward Climbach. Lieutenant Thomas in his scout car stayed well in front of the column. At 1400 hours, upon reaching the high ground southeast of the village, Lieutenant Thomas experienced initial contact with the enemy. As his scout car advanced to an exposed position on the heights, he received intense direct fire from enemy artillery, self-propelled guns, and small arms at a range of seven hundred yards. The first burst of hostile fire disabled the scout car and severely wounded Lieutenant Thomas. He immediately signaled the column to halt. Before leaving the wrecked vehicle, Lieutenant Thomas and the crew found themselves subjected to a veritable hail of enemy fire. Lieutenant Thomas received multiple gunshot wounds in his chest, legs, and left arm. In spite of the intense pain caused by his wounds, Lieutenant Thomas ordered and directed the dispersion and emplacement of his first two antitank guns. In a few minutes these guns were effectively returning the enemy fire. Realizing that it would be impossible for him to remain in command of the platoon because of his injuries, Lieutenant Thomas then signaled for the platoon commander to join him. Lieutenant Thomas then thoroughly oriented him as to the enemy gun positions, his ammunition status, and the general situation. Although fully cognizant of the probable drastic consequences of not receiving prompt medical attention, Lieutenant Thomas refused evacuation until he felt certain that his junior officer was in full control of the situation. Only then did Lieutenant Thomas allow his evacuation to the rear. Throughout the action, Lieutenant Thomas displayed magnificent personal courage and a complete disregard for his own safety. His extraordinary heroism spurred the soldiers of the platoon to a fierce determination to triumph and resulted in a mass display of heroism by them. Lieutenant Thomas' intrepid actions throughout the operation reflect the highest traditions of military service.”<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"It was just very interesting and very flattering that somebody was even thinking about letting me do this.\" -Dick (Richard) Bowser, about designing the tram system at the Gateway Arch, in an interview with NPS historian Bob Moore in 1993.</em></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Have you been to the top of the Gateway Arch? If so, you might remember the slightly claustrophobic, gently pivoting futuristic white capsules you rode up in. The Gateway Arch tram system is a one-of-a-kind invention that incorporates components of ferris wheels and elevators in its design. There is nothing else quite like it anywhere in the world! It was invented in only two weeks by a fascinating young man named Dick Bowser.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">A series of seemingly unrelated events all conspired to give Mr. Bowser the experience, skills, and abilities he needed to invent the ingenious tram ride. </p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><br /> <strong>Childhood as an Elevator Mechanic's Apprentice</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">Dick Bowser's parents, Ruth and Virgil Bowser, were both raised on farms in southern Michigan. Ruth worked as a schoolteacher before she married, and Virgil held jobs as a pattern-maker and owner of a machine shop. Soon after baby Dick entered the world in 1921, Virgil went to work for the Warner Elevator Company. When the depression hit in the 1930s, however, the elevator company closed down. Virgil leased a machine shop to take over many of the former business's clients personally. Dick was around 10 years old at the time, which was old enough to help his dad with the family business. Dick explained what that was like in a 1993 interview with park historian Bob Moore: \"At ten years old, I became the helper. I would run the elevator, and my father would be on top, to inspect the cables and grease things and so forth. . . This used to cause a bit of excitement . . . people would come up and want that elevator, and see this kid in there running the elevator, and they'd go to the manager and they'd bang on the doors and holler and so forth, because this kid was playing with the elevator.\" (Bowser, 1993). As Dick grew up, he moved with his family to Florida and then North Carolina for his father's work. Dick eventually graduated high school from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.</p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A Short College Education in Engineering</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">He enrolled in the engineering school at the University of Maryland, but as he describes it “I was a lousy student.” (Bowser, 1993). His main interests at the time were cars and a young woman he was courting (Nellie G. Harland Bowser, who later became his wife of over 50 years). After just a few semesters of school, Americans joined the fight in World War II, so Dick Bowser took the opportunity to drop out of school and join the Navy.</p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Navy Training</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">An aptitude test administered during Navy boot camp earned Bowser a position as a fire controlman. This involved using early computers (“as big as refrigerators lying on their back” [Bowser, 1993]) to calculate ballistics data. He also managed equipment that automatically set fuses so they would fly the proper distance before detonating. He quickly rose through the ranks and left the Navy almost four years later as a first class petty officer.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Night Classes</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">When Bowser returned from the war, he worked briefly at the Naval Ordinance Lab in White Oak, Maryland. That job offered its employees the chance to take after-hours adult education programs through Montgomery Junior College. Bowser took advantage. “So I went over and I signed up for everything available. . . there was college algebra, solid geometry, analytical geometry, descriptive geometry. I went just because they were available, and it didn't cost me very much to go, and it was a good thing to do for my employment with the Navy, and so forth.” (Bowser, 1993). He didn’t know it yet, but those math skills would be essential when he was designing the Gateway Arch tram system. </p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Back to Elevators</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, Virgil Bowser (Dick’s father) was busy inventing an ingenious parking system garage that had horizontally and vertically traveling elevators. By 1953, Bowser Company Parking Systems were being built in cities all over the country. The older Bowser needed some help, and he knew just who to turn to. “My mother talked me into going to work for my father. I was not too anxious to do this . . All the things that he didn’t want to do, I got stuck with” (Bowser, 1993). Business was very good for the next few years, but the older Bowser was starting to think about retirement. According to Dick, the father and son only had one major disagreement during the time they were working together. Virgil “wanted to keep it [the company] in the family. He wanted my little boys to have the Bowser Company Parking System to work for when they got older. And I had no intention then of making the decision of what my kids were going to do when they grew up.” Eventually, the Bowsers negotiated the sale of the business. In February of 1960, Dick Bowser left Bowser Company Parking System, with no way of knowing the huge opportunity that was about to come his way.</p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Meeting Eero Saarinen</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">Less than a month later, Bowser decided to drive from his home in Des Moines, Iowa to Washington DC to check out a parking garage he was considering leasing. On the way, he stopped in Moline, Illinois to visit a friend/business associate named John Martin. When Bowser arrived, Martin had just got off the phone with architect Eero Saarinen’s team, who had been calling elevator manufacturers looking for somebody to design a transportation system for the architect's gigantic and ambitious Gateway Arch design. Martin excitedly told his friend Bowser about the project. “My own knowledge of the St. Louis Arch was that it was something everybody in St. Louis was talking about, but they didn't want to buy parking garages. I had been down there trying to sell parking garages.” (Bowser, 1993).<br /> <br /> Martin called Saarinen’s office back and introduced Mr. Bowser. “John Martin had a lot more confidence in me than I had in myself, I think.” (Bowser 1993). They had a very short conversation about elevator possibilities. It went well. Saarinen’s team asked when Bowser was available to meet with the architect, and he told the team Saturday would work. “We had a meeting on Saturday morning. Can you imagine somebody telling Eero Saarinen if he wanted to talk to them that he’d have to come in Saturday morning! This whole thing was just beyond my comprehension, even what happened.” (Bowser, 1993). After the meeting, they said they’d give Bowser a call. He finished his trip - he didn’t want to lease that parking garage after all - and returned to Des Moines. He might have wanted to sit by the phone and wait for Saarinen’s call, but he had already made other plans. The family went to Florida for a week to visit Grandpa and Grandma Bowser, Virgil and Ruth.<br /> <br /> “When I returned to Des Moines, the first telephone call I had -- I don't know whether they’d been trying to call me or not -- but the first ring on the telephone was Saarinen’s office. And they wanted to know if I could put some kind of a concept together for some elevators in the Arch” (Bowser, 1993).<br /> <br /> Bowser only had two weeks of work time before the deadline. He carefully considered the unique constraints of the project. The Arch was to be much narrower at the top than at the base. Space for a stairway needed to be included in case of emergencies. He also needed to leave room for an observation platform. He decided an elevator machine could work, and he assembled freehand sketches and filled a notebook with scribbled notes. Some of the notes his wife Nellie typed up “in between making coffee so I could work all night and things like that.” (Bowser, 1993).<br /> <br /> The forty-five minute presentation to Eero Saarinen and the consulting architects and politicians went very well, and a lively question-and-answer session went on for hours afterwards. Mr. Bowser remembers towards the end of the discussion, “One man got up and I knew just from the way he asked the question, he wanted to know how much education I had. His question was, 'Mr. Bowser, what are you?' And something told me, don’t get in an argument with this man, so I just told him I was 38 years old, and everybody laughed, and that was the end of my credentials as far as being able to do the Arch. I still laugh about that, and I think it’s the most appropriate answer I could have given.“ (Bowser, 1993)</p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\">No One Else For The Job</h4> <p dir=\"ltr\"><br /> Dick Bowser was involved in every part of tram construction, installation, and early maintenance, which is very unusual for most government contracts. As George Hertzog, who served as Superintendent of the park from 1959-1962, remembers it, \"They got the bid, but they didn't have an engineer that knew how to build it! So they hired Bowser to go up and build it. So that's how Bowser got his job. He disigned this thing for Eero, went up there and built it. And then when they got it built, Bi-State hired him to install it. When he got in installed, I hired him to maintain it. And that's how he got in the Park Service.\" (Herzog, 1994). There was truly no one else who had the knowledge, skills, and abilities to make the tram a reality. Bowser’s amazing, unique tram system celebrated its first ride to the top in 1967 and is still being used today.</p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Life After the Tram was Installed</strong></h4> <p dir=\"ltr\"><br /> Bowser worked at the Gateway Arch as part of the National Park Service maintenance staff until 1972. He spent much of his later years in Florida, and he passed away in 2003 in Richmond, Virginia. Bowser is survived by his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and by the thousands of visitors who enjoy his remarkable invention every year.</p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\">References:</h4> <p dir=\"ltr\"><br /> Bowser, Dick (Richard) B.

            "bodyText": "<p>Methodist Episcopal minister Jonathan Bridge participated in the abolition movement as well as the 1850 Boston Vigilance Committee.<br /> <br /> Born in 1812 to Isaac Bridge and Susan Shattuck, Jonathan Davis Bridge grew up on a small farm in Northfield, Massachusetts. Bridge had eleven younger siblings. The family farm, which had “difficult to cultivate” soil, struggled to meet the needs of the large family. As a boy, Jonathan Bridge attended the town’s school where he received a limited education.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Isaac and Susan Bridge belonged to the rapidly growing Methodist Episcopal Church. As a teenager, Jonathan Bridge attended an early revival hosted in the town. This meeting inspired him to become a minister himself. At eighteen, Bridge became ordained as a local preacher and left home to study under the Presiding Elder of the Springfield District, the Reverend Orange Scott.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Bridge spent the early years of his career as a traveling preacher. He hosted revivals in communities much like the one he grew up in. In 1832, Bridge married the schoolteacher Abigail Learnard in New Salem, Massachusetts.<sup>3</sup> The couple had three sons. One of them, Watson Wilberforce Bridge, later served as a Captain of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm#:~:text=The%2054%20th%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment%20is,for%20the%20Union%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War.\">54th Massachusetts Regiment</a> under <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-g-shaw.htm\">Colonel Robert Gould Shaw</a> during the Civil War.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Abigail Bridge accompanied her husband on his travels. During her husband’s free time, Abigail used her experience as a teacher to help Jonathan build on the rudimentary education he received as a boy.<sup>5</sup> With Abigail’s instruction, Jonathan Bridge became a “great reader, an intense thinker, and a writer who commanded a finished and nervous style.”<sup>6</sup> Jonathan Bridge received his first ministry in 1835, and he spent the next twenty years presiding over Methodist congregations across Massachusetts.</p> <p>Bridge remained close to his mentor, Rev. Orange Scott, a prominent abolitionist. Reverend Scott introduced Bridge to the abolitionist cause, which the young Reverend Bridge took up with conviction. Under Scott’s guidance, Bridge wrote many articles and sermons supporting the abolitionist movement, and he used his “caustic pen” against anyone who defended the institution of slavery.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Methodist leaders did not always agree with the abolitionist values preached by Orange Scott, who they considered a radical. This conflict came to a head in 1842, when Reverend Scott started his own abolitionist ministry, the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion. Despite agreeing with Rev. Scott on the issue of slavery, Bridge decided to remain in the Methodist Church.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Reverend Bridge used his position as a minister to assist freedom seekers along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/what-is-the-underground-railroad.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>. While appointed to a Methodist Church in Boston, Jonathan Bridge joined the Anti-Slavery Society and the Vigilance Committee of 1850. According to Bridge’s son, Melville, in an 1896 article, Reverend Bridge met the freedom seeker and Underground Railroad conductor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/josiah-henson.htm\">“Father” Josiah Henson</a> while in Boston. After hearing the story of Henson’s escape from slavery, he introduced the man to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-beecher-stowe.htm\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, who used Henson’s experiences as inspiration for <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>Bridge left Boston in 1851 to preach at the First Methodist Church in Springfield, Massachusetts on Pynchon Street. His eldest son, Melville, recollected that his father often sheltered freedom seekers traveling to Canada in their Springfield home and directed them to sympathetic members of his congregation for aid.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>In 1854, Jonathan D. Bridge became the Presiding Elder of the Worcester District. He served in this post for two years before dying of consumption in Wilbraham, Massachusetts at the age of 44.<sup>11</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <p>1.

After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1841, he began living and working in Boston as a \"conveyancer,\" a lawyer who oversees the transfer of property, including willed estates. In 1845, Bowditch moved to Brookline, although he kept his office at 8 Railroad Exchange in Boston.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>He gave his first recorded antislavery speech in 1845. Abolitionists, he said, must \"solemnly pledge ourselves to follow out these great principles [of human brotherhood], and resolve that, constitution or no constitution, custom or no custom, nothing shall ever induce us to acquiesce in or tolerate slavery.\"<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In 1846, he openly called his listeners to civil disobedience. When law and conscience came into conflict with each other, as they did over slavery, he declared that we are \"bound to follow… [our] conscience and to disobey the law.\"<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Bowditch backed up those words with deeds. He led the Massachusetts opposition to annexation of the slave state of Texas. He resigned his commission as Justice of the Peace rather than take the required oath to support a federal Constitution which protected slavery. He helped organize the 1846 revival of the Boston Vigilance Committee. Four years later he helped reinvigorate that Committee in response to the new 1850 Fugitive Slave Law. He also regularly broke the law of the United States when it conflicted with his conscientious hatred of slavery.</p> <p>When freedom seekers <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">William and Ellen Craft</a> came to Massachusetts, Bowditch sheltered them in his home at 9 Toxteth St. In 1853, he joined <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/austin-bearse.htm\">Captain Austin Bearse</a> and others in a bold attempt to rescue a freedom seeker confined on the brig <em>Florence</em> in Boston harbor. Bowditch wrote that Bearse sailed his yacht <em>Moby Dick</em> alongside the <em>Florence</em>, jumped on board and, pretending to be a slave catcher, demanded that the mate release the freedom seeker \"quicker than lightning!\":</p> <blockquote>... whereupon the mate rushed below and Bearse after him… the black man… was set free and was on the deck of our yacht in less than a minute… The whole thing was done so neatly and expeditiously that we could hardly refrain from laughing out aloud; and long before we got under full headway we could not restrain ourselves, and the mate saw that he had been mistaken … John K. Pearson [owner of the \"Florence\"] had seen us start, and watched our whole operation through his glass, but was wholly unable to prevent us, though he afterwards threatened dire vengeance.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Bowditch took the man to his Toxteth St. house before sending him on his way to safety in Canada.<sup>5</sup> Bowditch also sheltered <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a> when authorities threatened to arrest him for his role in the 1854 attempted rescue of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>. In these and many other incidents, Bowditch risked both liberty and continued livelihood in the name of freedom.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Bowditch opposed all forms of injustice, prejudice, and inequality. He publicly condemned the spirit of racism then common in American business, society, churches, and the military. He helped raise and recruit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/a-brave-black-regiment.htm\">54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</a>. He fought for equal rights for women. When Massachusetts looked to revise its state Constitution in 1853, he, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abby-kelley-foster.htm\">Abby Kelley Foster</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-stone.htm\">Lucy Stone</a>, and others demanded that the state strike \"out the word MALE wherever it occurs in that instrument.\" Bowditch argued that \"men and women together by the use of the ballot have an inherent right to govern themselves as they think best,\" and asked, \"Why then has suffrage not been granted?\"<sup>7</sup> He served as President of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association for seven years. Bowditch also worked as a Director of the American Woman Suffrage Association. He remained a close friend of Lucy Stone, serving as a pall bearer at her funeral in 1893.</p> <p>William Ingersoll Bowditch died at his home in Brookline on January 24, 1909. He left behind the legacy of a lifelong fight for freedom and equality. As Henry Browne Blackwell wrote, he should always be remembered as \"one of Boston's most illustrious workers for anti-slavery and woman suffrage.\"<sup>8</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Bowditch’s first Brookline home still stands at 9 Toxteth Street. It is a listed site on the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.

            "bodyText": "What does a French diplomat have to do with Rock Creek Park and why is there a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/jean-jules-jusserand-memorial.htm\">memorial</a> to him here?<br /> <br /> Jean Adrien Antoine Jules Jusserand was born in France to a wealthy family. He was determined from a young age to learn about new cultures and gain as much knowledge as he could. He attended boarding schools and university in France and studied literature, science, law and history and was deemed an excellent student. He graduated with degrees in history and law and even pursued (and received) a doctorate in history.<br /> <br /> Jusserand's international career began in 1878 when he was a student-consul in London. By 1882, he was the partner of the Minister of France in Tunisia. This was in part due to his literary achievements. While there, he became known as a respected diplomat and would hold several positions in numerous countries.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he was named Ambassador to the United States. He took up the position officially on February 7, 1903.<br /> <br /> Over the course of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/life-of-theodore-roosevelt.htm\">Theodore Roosevelt's</a> administration, Jules Jusserand became a frequent visitor to Rock Creek Park. The president enjoyed visiting the park and would often go on point-to-point hikes. Few could keep up with him, but Jusserand would. These \"steeplechase hikes\" were the talk of many Washingtonians. <br /> <br /> In 1905, Jusserand used all of his diplomatic skills and influence with Roosevelt to \"save the peace\" in Morocco. <br /> <br /> Jusserand became Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in May 1913. It was a position he held until 1925.<br /> <br /> He was also integral in the United States' involvement in World War I. Though the opinions of the American public were divided, he urged President Woodrow Wilson to get involved. Though the United States initially claimed neutrality, the country eventually entered the war in 1917. Jusserand was quoted as saying \"For the first time, a neutral nation has decided to enter the conflict without prior bargaining, without having laid down a condition.\" Jusserand was so trusted by Wilson that when the president traveled to Paris for the Paris Peace Conference, Jusserand went with him.<br /> <br /> Ambassador Jusserand and his wife were frequent visitors to the park and often took tea at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/rocr/learn/historyculture/peirce-mill-history.htm\">Peirce Mill</a> Tea House. In 1915, an article in <em>The Washington Post </em>detailed an oppressively still and quiet summer in the nation's capital. <br /> <br /> <em>\"The French Ambassador and Mme. Jusserand both delight in tea at Pierce Mill. Before the weather became too warm, the Ambassador walked to the mill and Mme. Jusserand drove out and met him there.\"</em><br /> <br /> Other than being a frequent visitor of Rock Creek Park and Peirce Mill, Ambassador Jusserand and his wife presided over the dedication of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/joan-of-arc-statue.htm\">Joan of Arc</a> statue in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/meridian-hill-park.htm\">Meridian Hill Park</a> along with President and Mrs. Harding.<br /> <br /> Jusserand's service spanned five presidencies and 22-years. He retired in 1925 and returned to France.<br /> <br /> Jusserand died of kidney disease in 1932. Almost immediately, a memorial commission came together with the intent of honoring the great diplomat. A memorial bench, constructed of pink granite, was approved by an Act of Congress in 1935. It was decided that the bench should be placed in Rock Creek Park, due to the love that the Ambassador had for the park.<br /> <br /> The bench, erected at no cost to the United States, was dedicated on November 7, 1936. President <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/franklin-d-roosevelt.htm\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, his wife, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor</a>, and Jusserand's widow, were in attendance. In his dedication address, Roosevelt stated, <br /> <br /> \"Almost we can say - that he was a great American as well as a great Frenchman. We shall link Mr. Jusserand’s name forever with the names of Lafayette and Rochambeau and De Grasse and the other valiant Frenchmen whose services in this country entitle them for all time to the grateful remembrance of all Americans.”<br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<h2><strong>THE LIFE AND LEGEND OF HIRAM SCOTT</strong></h2> <p>One of the most commonly asked questions posed by visitors to Scotts Bluff National Monument is, \"How did the bluff get its name?\"<br /> <br /> The answer to that question is shrouded in mystery and has intrigued travelers through the North Platte River Valley for almost two centuries.</p> <h3><strong>WHO WAS HE?</strong></h3> <p>Hiram Scott was born about 1805 in St. Charles County, Missouri, and was an employee of William Ashley's Rocky Mountain Fur Company. He is described as unusually tall and muscular. In 1826, Hiram Scott is believed to have taken part in the first fur trader rendezvous held near the Great Salt Lake, and it has been assumed that he attended those held in 1827 and 1828.</p> <p>We do know that there was a man by the name of Hiram Scott who was employed by the American Fur Company. His name appears on the pay lists of that company in 1827, where he is listed as a clerk. We also know that his name does not appear in any of the company's papers after 1828.</p> <p>Beyond this - little else is known with any certainty. In the early days of the fur trade, it was the practice of the various fur companies to send trappers into the Far West to gather pelts which would then be brought back to St. Louis and sold to eastern buyers.</p> <h3><strong>THE FUR TRADE</strong></h3> <p>Beaver furs were especially popular for making men's hats and collars for fancy coats. Muskrat, rabbit, and otter pelts were also marketable, but it was the beaver's fur which brought top dollar. It was the seemingly endless supply of beaver pelts which drew young men such as Hiram Scott out into the frontier. As the business evolved, the fur companies realized that rather than send trappers out to catch and skin the beavers, it would be more efficient to obtain the pelts from the various Native American tribes in the West.</p> <p>In exchange for the furs, the companies would offer manufactured items such as pots and pans, bolts of cloth, knives, axes, and firearms.</p> <p>Each spring caravans of traders ventured into the frontier loaded with trade goods. They would meet with the tribesmen and independent fur trappers at pre-arranged sites to conduct their business. Each of these annual events came to be known as a fur trading \"rendezvous.\"</p> <p>Clerks such as Hiram Scott were necessary to keep track of the many transactions which were made at a rendezvous. Many different accounts had to be maintained, payrolls met and accurate inventories of the trade goods had to be kept. The responsibilities of a fur company clerk would have required a reliable, well-organized, and above all - a literate person.</p> <p>It is believed that Hiram Scott was returning to St. Louis from the 1828 rendezvous when he died near the bluff which now bears his name. Unfortunately, the details surrounding his death have been lost to history.</p> <h3><strong>SCOTT'S DEATH</strong></h3> <p>The basic story of Scott's death was first recorded by Warren A. Ferris, who traveled through the area in 1830. He related that during Scott's eastward journey, Scott had contracted a severe illness. Two comrades placed him in a boat and attempted to transport him downstream. However, for some unknown reason, the two men abandoned Scott on the north bank of the Platte River. The next spring, Scott's skeleton was found on the other side of the river, implying that he had somehow managed to cross to the opposite bank before he died.</p> <p>A subtle variation on this story was recorded two years later by Washington Irving. Instead of being abandoned by just two men, the ailing Scott was supposedly left behind at the Laramie Fork by a larger party who feared for their lives due to starvation. The next summer, Scott's bones were found near the bluffs - 60 miles from where he had been left to die.</p> <p>In 1834, missionary Jason Lee recorded a story about Hirman Scott that was very similar to those earlier versions, except that the pathetic Scott had traversed 100 miles before dying near the bluffs on the North Platte River.</p> <h3><strong>THE STORY GROWS</strong></h3> <p>The story of what happened near Scott's Bluffs was told and retold. With each telling the story took on new perspectives. Some stories included dramatic attacks by Indian warriors while other suggest murder and foul play. Some stories include the noble theme of the doomed Scott insisting that his comrades leave him behind so they might save themselves from his fate.</p> <p>There has been some speculation that Hiram Scott was actually injured in an encounter with some Blackfeet Indians that took place at the 1828 rendezvous at Bear Lake, Utah. This has been used to explain why Scott became incapacitated on his journey back east, but as with most of the information about Hiram Scott, very little is known for certain.</p> <h3><strong>SCOTT'S BLUFFS</strong></h3> <p>Almost immediately after his death, the bluffs along the North Platte River came to be known as Scott's Bluffs. In 1830, the first wagons made the overland trip on the same route used by early fur traders like Hiram Scott, and the bluffs that bear his name served as a landmark for people making their way west.</p> <p>The fur trade continued for a decade after Hiram Scott's death in 1828, but by 1840, the beaver had been trapped out and fashions changed. When men began wearing hats made of silk instead of beaver fur, the value of furs dropped. Twenty years later a demand for buffalo hides briefly rekindled fur trading on the high plains.</p> <p>Hiram Scott's final resting place is not known. His remains were almost certainly found near the North Platte River, but the site has never been located. <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/hiram-scott-memorial.htm\">Today, a plaque dedicated to his memory is located along the North Overlook Trail on the summit of the bluff that bears his name.</a></p> <p>Over the years, the geological features known as \"Scotts Bluff's\" have taken on their own individual names. They are now known as Dome Rock, Crown Rock, Sentinel Rock, Eagle Rock, and Saddle Rock. However, the largest and most prominent is known as Scotts Bluff, and still stands as a landmark for travelers and a reminder of the tragic incident that took place nearly two centuries ago.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<h2>The Rebecca Winters Story</h2> <p><a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/winters-grave.htm\">Seven miles northeast of Scotts Bluff National Monument lies a solitary grave. </a>This site marks the final resting place of Rebecca Winters, who died of <a href=\"https://nps.gov/articles/000/cholera-a-trail-epidemic.htm\">cholera</a> on August 15, 1852. Rebecca was only one of thousands of people who succumbed to disease as they made their way west on the overland trails, but her grave is one of only a few that remains identifiable today.</p> <h3>Cholera</h3> <p>From what we know of Rebecca Winters, the fact that her grave was marked is not surprising. By all accounts, she was a warm and caring person, deeply committed to her faith and her family. She was born in the state of New York in 1802, the daughter of Gideon Burdick, a Revolutionary War veteran. She and her husband, Hiram, were early members of the Mormon Church, being baptized into that faith in June of 1833. As a result of their religious beliefs, they endured severe persecutions at the hands of non-believers. The Winters family was forced to relocate several times, make new homes in Ohio, Illinois and Iowa. In an effort to escape these persecutions, in June of 1852 they joined with other Mormons in making the great exodus to Utah. Unfortunately, somewhere along the Platte River valley, several people in their party contracted cholera. This was an especially deadly disease that killed thousands of emigrants. Sadly, Rebecca Winters was among those who fell victim to the disease. Her husband and a close friend, William Reynolds, had the painful task of burying her, and their special efforts speak volumes to the affection they had for Rebecca.</p> <h3>A Sad Day</h3> <p>The normal practice for emigrants making their way west was to hide the graves of loved ones who died during the journey. Often graves were dug directly in the roadway, and after burial, wagons were driven over it to obscure all signs of it. This was not done out of a callous disregard for the deceased, but to reduce the likelihood that the grave might be disturbed by wild animals. Hiram Winters and William Reynolds first dug an unusually deep grave. They then placed a layer of wooden planks, apparently salvaged from abandoned wagons, on the bottom of the grave. The story is told that her friends and family could not bear the thought of dirt touching her. However, there was not enough wood to build a coffin, so Rebecca’s body was carefully wrapped in blankets and then placed in the grave. A second layer of planks was placed over her body, and the grave was filled in. Undoubtedly a tearful burial service was held as the earthly remains of Rebecca Winters were laid to rest. As a final token of his friendship, William Reynolds took a metal wheel rim and chiseled the following words, “Rebecca Winters, Age 50.” In later years, Reynolds’ daughter Ellis related the story that her father had worked on the metal rim by the light of a candle she held for him. The rim was then bent into an oval shape, approximating the outline of a grave stone, and was placed over the fresh grave. The Winters family then continued their westward journey and settled in Pleasant Grove, Utah.</p> <h3>The Railroad</h3> <p>It was this metal memorial, which withstood decades of weathering and countless prairie fires, that led to the discovery of the grave in 1899 by surveyors for the Burlington Northern Railroad. For years, the story has persisted that out of respect for this grave, the route of the railroad tracks was altered to preserve the site. Whether or not this is true, tracks were laid only a few feet from the grave. Expanding rail traffic, and an increased number of visitors to the gravesite, gave rise to concerns for visitor safety. The Burlington Northern approached the descendents of Rebecca Winters and asked if the grave might be relocated to a safer, more accessible location. After some deliberation, the Winters family approved the plan.</p> <h3>Reburial</h3> <p>On September 5, 1995, the exhumation of the grave began, with 65 members of the Winters family in attendance. Within a few hours, the work by a team of archaeologists from the Nebraska State Historical Society revealed human remains. Soon the complete skeleton was unearthed, a testimony to the care taken during burial so long ago. The site selected for Rebecca Winters’ new grave is only 100 yards away, just off US Highway 26. On October 14, 1995, the pioneer woman’s remains now in a mahogany casket, were once again laid to rest. 125 of her descendants attended the reburial, including her 16 year old great-great-great granddaughter, also named Rebecca Winters. Also in attendance was the great-granddaughter of William Reynolds, the man who had chiseled the metal marker for the original burial, 143 years before.</p>",

In 1843, he served as an Assistant Secretary and Vice President, and in 1845, meeting records list Bramhall among the Society’s Legal Counsel and the Committee of Roll and Finance.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Cornelius Bramhall’s name appears in connection to the Vigilance Committee of 1846 and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">Vigilance Committee of 1850</a>.<sup>6</sup> Though appointed by his peers to serve in the 1846 Vigilance Committee, Bramhall ultimately declined to participate, possibly due to political differences with the group’s founder, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/samuel-gridley-howe.htm\">Samuel Gridley Howe</a>.<sup>7</sup> Two other men appointed to the 1846 Vigilance Committee refused to serve for similar reasons as well. When the Committee of 1850 formed following the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Bramhall joined without reservation. Vigilance Committee account books list Bramhall as a financial contributor to the Committee's activities, though further details of his involvement are not specified.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Cornelius Bramhall’s abolition work in Boston came to an end in 1855, when he opened a business in New York manufacturing water heaters and kitchen stoves. Bramhall proceeded to auction off his home in Dorchester, and he and Ann Rebecca moved to Orange, New Jersey.<sup>9</sup> Shortly after their move, Bramhall officially resigned his officer positions in the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. He joined the New York Anti-Slavery Society, where he served as Vice President and a member of the Executive Committee from 1856-1864.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>Letters between William Lloyd Garrison and Ann Rebecca Bramhall indicate frustration with life in New Jersey, which had a smaller abolitionist community.<sup>11</sup> The Bramhalls still found ways to stay active in the abolitionist movement despite its relative unpopularity in their new community. In 1859, after the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/john-browns-raid.htm\">John Brown’s raid</a> on Harpers Ferry, Cornelius and Ann Rebecca Bramhall joined fellow New Jersey abolitionists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-stone.htm\">Lucy Stone</a> and Henry Blackwell in writing letters to the governor of Virginia. They hoped to recover the remains of any participants sentenced to death for their involvement in the raid who had no family to bury them.<sup>12</sup> In addition to these actions and their continuous involvement in the New York and American Anti-Slavery Societies, the Bramhalls regularly hosted fellow abolitionists in their New Jersey home.</p> <p>Cornelius Bramhall died in 1896 in New York, two years after the passing of his wife. Both Cornelius and Ann Rebecca Bramhall are buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>New England Society of Orange, New Jersey, <em>Constitution and Bylaws of the New England Society of Orange, New Jersey </em>28th Edition (New Jersey: The Chronicle Press, 1897), <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/yearbook02lcnewe\">http://archive.org/details/yearbook02lcnewe</a>.</li> <li> \"Obituary 1 -- no Title,\" <em>New York Times</em> (1857-1922), Nov 22, 1894.</li> <li><em>Stimpson’s Boston Directory</em> (Boston: Stimpson & Clapp, 1846).</li> <li>William Lloyd Garrison, <em>The Letters of William Lloyd Garrison </em>(Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1971), 402, <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/lettersofwilliam0000garr_t0a7\">http://archive.org/details/lettersofwilliam0000garr_t0a7</a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; text-align: -webkit-match-parent;\">.</span></li> <li>“Thirteenth Annual Meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society,” <em>The Liberator</em>, January 31, 1845.</li> <li>Boston Citizens, Samuel Gridley Howe, <em>Address of the Committee Appointed by a Public Meeting, Held at Faneuil Hall, September 24, 1846 </em>(Wentworth Press: 2019), 53; Austin Bearse, <em>Reminiscences of Fugitive-Slave Law Days in Boston </em>(Boston: Warren Richardson, 1880), 3.</li> <li>Conrad Edick Wright, Katheryn P.

            "bodyText": "<p>During World War II, the incarceration of Japanese Americans forced Ruth Tanbara and her husband Earl to leave their home in Berkeley, California. They were the first Japanese Americans to resettle to St. Paul, Minnesota, where they promoted the acceptance of Japanese Americans from incarceration camps. After the war, the Tanbaras stayed in St. Paul and remained leaders in the Japanese American community.</p> <h2>Early Life and Education</h2> <p>Ruth Tokuko Nomura Tanbara was born in Portland, Oregon, on October 15, 1907. Her parents immigrated four years earlier. Ruth grew up in an active household in Portland. She was the second of four children and her parents fostered thirteen other children over the years.<br /> <br /> Ruth did not become involved with organizations or social groups until adulthood. As a child, she focused on schoolwork and took lessons for the piano and Japanese language. After graduating from high school, Ruth won an essay contest to tour Japan. The trip renewed her interest in Japanese culture and traditions, which she maintained throughout her life.<br /> <br /> In 1930, Ruth earned her Bachelor of Science in Home Economics from Oregon State Agricultural College. She was the first <em>Nisei </em>(second generation) woman from Portland to enroll. Community engagement became a hallmark of Ruth’s adult life. In Portland, she taught English to Japanese American preschoolers and worked as a secretary for the Japanese consulate and YWCA.<br /> <br /> In September 1935, Ruth married Earl K. Tanbara and moved to Berkeley, California. Earl was the advertising manager at the Dollar Steamship Company in San Francisco. Ruth worked part-time with the International Institute as a social worker for the Japanese American community.</p> <h2>World War II and Japanese American Resettlement</h2> <p>In February 1942—ten weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor— President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/executive-order-9066.htm\">Executive Order 9066</a>, which authorized the forced removal of all people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast of the US. Removals began in March, first to temporary detention centers and later to one of ten incarceration camps, known as “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/war-relocation-centers.htm\">Relocation Centers.</a>”<br /> <br /> Earl and Ruth prepared to leave with their family members but were stopped when they went to register. A US Army official offered them a choice: enter an incarceration camp or assist with resettlement. The latter required the Tanbaras to leave their families, move to the Midwest or East Coast, and facilitate the acceptance of resettled Japanese Americans.<br /> <br /> The War Relocation Authority used resettlement to advance several goals: to keep <em>Nisei </em>high school and college students in school, address agricultural labor shortages, and assimilate “loyal” Japanese Americans into the white middle-class. Government officials worried that incarceration would result in dependency. Earl and Ruth were both in their early 30s, educated, and employed. These characteristics made them ideal candidates to assist with resettlement.<br /> <br /> In August 1942, the Tanbaras decided to relocate to St. Paul, Minnesota, because a family-friend offered them a temporary place to stay. Ruth’s brother Paul was also stationed nearby at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/historyculture/langschool.htm\">Military Intelligence Service Language School at Fort Snelling</a>.<sup><a href=\"#end-ref1\">[1]</a> </sup>Ruth recalled that Minnesota was predominantly white and that only ten Japanese American families lived in St. Paul before the war. To promote Japanese American acceptance, Ruth and Earl gave talks about Japanese Americans for churches, schools, youth groups, and farming communities. They also played a key role in the St. Paul Resettlement Committee, helping resettled Japanese Americans find jobs and housing. Within a three-year period, they assisted over 100 families.<br /> <br /> Despite their efforts to promote Japanese American acceptance, the Tanbaras still experienced racism. The couple had difficulty buying a house during wartime. The seller believed neighbors would object to living next to Japanese Americans. Once they secured their own home, Ruth invited her brother Paul and his friends over for Sunday dinners. A neighbor once reported the Tanbaras to the FBI, claiming that the couple was hosting Japanese soldiers. Officers from Fort Snelling had to explain that these soldiers were Americans training at the Military Intelligence Service Language School. They also advised Ruth to hang a service flag to counteract suspicion.<br /> <br /> In January 1945, the military announced the end of Japanese American incarceration. Although “evacuees” could return to the West Coast, Ruth and Earl decided to stay in St. Paul.<sup><a href=\"#end-ref2\">[2]</a></sup> Ruth later described the relocation from the West Coast as a “blessing in disguise.” Before <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwarii/index.htm\">World War II</a>, discrimination limited where Japanese Americans could live and work, often restricting them to dilapidated living conditions and low-wage jobs. The Midwest and East Coast offered opportunities to move into middle-class homes and lifestyles, such as college scholarships and better jobs.</p> <h2>Community Involvement</h2> <p>After the relocation, Ruth remained a central figure in the Twin Cities Japanese American community. She and Earl continued to seek out ways to help resettled Japanese Americans adjust to their new lives in Minnesota.<br /> <br /> After the war, Ruth joined the program staff at the St. Paul YWCA full-time, directing 60 adult education classes and the international program, known as World Fellowship. As a requirement for the position, she entered graduate school. In 1953, she earned her Master of Science degree in Adult Education from the University of Minnesota Department of Home Economics Education. Ruth retired from the YWCA in 1972, after 30 years on the program staff. The following year, the St. Paul YWCA dedicated a Japanese garden dedicated to Ruth to celebrate her contributions to the organization.<br /> <br /> Ruth volunteered on committees and served as a board member of several organizations including the St. Paul-Nagasaki Sister City Committee, Japan American Society of Minnesota, and Minnesota Museum of Art. She and Earl also worked with the Japanese American Citizens League to repeal a law that prevented Japanese immigrants from becoming citizens.<br /> <br /> Some of these activities enabled Ruth to celebrate her Japanese heritage. For many years, she taught Japanese flower arranging and contributed to the International Institute’s annual Festival of Nations, co-chairing the Japanese food booth. Between the 1960s and 1980s, Ruth led several tour groups to Japan. She also initiated a project to document the lives of Japanese American women in Minnesota. A collection of their memoirs called Reflections was published in 1994.<br /> <br /> Ruth Tanbara died January 4, 2008. She was 100 years old.<br />  </p> <hr /> <p><em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em></p> <hr /> <h2>Notes</h2> <p><a href=\"#text-ref1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/histfort.htm\">Historic Fort Snelling</a> was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"#text-ref2\">[2]</a> Ruth and Earl Tanbara's home of over 37 years is a non-contributing property in the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/93202626\">Historic Hill District</a>, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.</p> <h2>Bibliography</h2> <p>Asaka, Megan. “Resettlement.” Densho Encyclopedia.

            "bodyText": "<p>Liang May Seen is described as the first Chinese woman to settle in Minneapolis. She was a key figure in the city’s growing Chinese American community before World War II, organizing social activities for recent immigrants and bridging cross-cultural divides. </p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{28}\" paraid=\"647516079\" role=\"heading\">Early Life </h2> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{36}\" paraid=\"1253672863\">Liang May Seen was born to an impoverished family around 1871 in Guangdong, China. Her parents tried to arrange a better life for her. When Liang was 14, they sold her to a man who promised to help her marry a wealthy husband. During the late 1800s, this kind of arrangement was not unusual. Many poor families sold young women and girls to work as servants (or even concubines) in wealthy households or brothels. These settings offered better living conditions and marriage prospects than peasant families could provide. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{189}\" paraid=\"1191836388\">But procurers often misled poor families and neglected to formalize the arrangements. They instead sold young women and girls into sex work or domestic servitude. Liang’s procurer sold her to a brothel owner in San Francisco’s Chinatown. In San Francisco, a group of white Christian women came together to assist Chinese women and girls. They founded a Presbyterian Mission Home in 1874. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{189}\" paraid=\"1191836388\">When Liang arrived in the United States, she plotted her escape. In 1889, she sought refuge at the Presbyterian Mission Home. The missionaries offered a safe place to stay as well as training based on middle-class, Christian values. They hoped to prepare Chinese women for marriage or religious service. Liang stayed at the Home for three years. She converted to Christianity, learned household tasks, and studied English, math, and Cantonese.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{70}\" paraid=\"598404488\">Marriage and Migration </h2> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{80}\" paraid=\"36960669\">By the early 1890s, most Chinese living in the United States were men. The Chinese Exclusion Acts restricted <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/aapi-theme-study-essay-4-immigration.htm\">immigration</a> based on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ulysses-s-grant-chinese-immigration-and-the-page-act-of-1875.htm\">gender</a>, occupation, and income. These policies shut out most laborers and women, but granted entry to some students, tourists, diplomats, and merchants. When immigrant men wanted to marry, they returned to China or looked to mission organizations. With the missionaries' help, Liang married Woo Yee Sing on July 21, 1892. After their wedding, Liang joined her new husband in Minnesota. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{90}\" paraid=\"603552613\">Woo was one of the first Chinese immigrants to permanently settle in Minnesota. Due to Chinese Exclusion, the state's Chinese American population grew slowly, mostly from internal migration. During the 1870s, Woo came to the US to work at <em>Gum Shan</em> [Gold Mountain] in California. He and others soon migrated east to escape violence and racism in the west. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{104}\" paraid=\"1939976539\">In Minneapolis, Woo became involved with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/westminster-presbyterian-church.htm\">Westminster Presbyterian Church</a>, a cornerstone of the local Chinese American community. Woo started his own hand laundry business near the church. He also helped his brother Woo Du Sing and other relatives to emigrate. In 1883, the brothers founded Canton Restaurant, Minneapolis' first Chinese restaurant. By the 1890s, Woo's businesses and involvement with the church made him a leader within the small Chinese community (about 75 to 80 men in 1885). </p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{123}\" paraid=\"74202333\" role=\"heading\">Life in Minneapolis </h2> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{129}\" paraid=\"1723668720\">With businesses that attracted both Chinese and white neighbors, the Woos helped to bridge cultural divides. In 1904, Liang opened her own Chinese curio shop next to Westminster Presbyterian Church, where she sold imported Chinese goods, including art, vases, and other artifacts. Her husband later opened Yee Sing and Company, a larger import business. In 1909, Canton Restaurant relocated and reopened as <em>Yuen Faung Low </em>[Exotic Fragrance from Afar]. Until its closing in the 1960s, it was more commonly known as John’s Place.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{157}\" paraid=\"1513677706\">At Westminster church, the Woos attended integrated gatherings and church services in English. Through these activities, Liang befriended fellow churchgoers, white neighbors, and local missionaries. She also remained connected with friends at the mission in San Francisco. On a return visit in 1906, the Woos adopted a young boy named Howard. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{165}\" paraid=\"1964110942\">Although Chinese Americans found Minnesota more welcoming than California, they still experienced racism. White students called Howard Woo racist names when he was in elementary and high school. In 1912, an unidentified assailant planted a small bomb in the stairway of Canton Restaurant. Howard later described damage to the front of the business and the stairway. “Everything was just piled down,” he recalled. He believed the attack was racially motivated. </p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{177}\" paraid=\"1669317923\" role=\"heading\">Community Involvement and Later Life </h2> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{183}\" paraid=\"1630746431\">The early 1900s saw the arrival of other Chinese women. Under Chinese Exclusion, merchants could only bring their wives and children to the US if they achieved a certain volume of trade each year. This included Liang’s sister-in-law, Woo Du Sing’s wife, and a new friend, Minnie Wong. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{189}\" paraid=\"1191836388\">To foster connections across cultural differences, Liang and Minnie Wong created a new women’s organization within the church. They invited new arrivals to attend religious and social gatherings. These events helped recent immigrants to practice English and learn about American culture. For white women, these gatherings also promoted the acceptance of Chinese American women.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{201}\" paraid=\"111523400\">The outbreak of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/aapi-theme-study-essay-10-wwii.htm\">World War II</a> brought significant changes, including the end of Chinese Exclusion in 1943 and the influx of 8,000 Chinese war brides after the war. Liang died in 1946, just long enough to witness the resurgence within the Chinese American community she had pioneered.</p> <hr /> <p aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{215}\" paraid=\"1668791962\" role=\"heading\"><em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em></p> <hr /> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{215}\" paraid=\"1668791962\" role=\"heading\">Bibliography </h2> <p paraeid=\"{dd015c2f-1640-4dd8-91d2-34adb8e6cae3}{223}\" paraid=\"93873006\">Chinn, Margaret Woo.

For our debt to the past can be paid in no other way.” <b> </b></em></p> <h4><b>Early Life </b></h4> <p>William Kent’s early life was spent in Chicago and Marin County. His father, Albert, came from a prosperous farming family in Connecticut and attended Yale. He built a family fortune, with businesses scattered from New York to St. Louis.  </p> <p>After the great Chicago fire of 1871, the elder Kent moved his family to Marin County. There, young William learned to appreciate the natural beauty that surrounded him. William continued the family tradition of a Yale education. Which impacted his life in many ways. The most important being it is where he met his wife, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/elizabeththacherkent.htm\">Elizabeth Thacher</a>.  </p> <p>After graduation, Kent moved his family to Chicago to oversee his father’s business interests. There, he became the candidate for alderman of the Municipal Voters League to fight corruption in city politics.  A Republican, Kent joined the “Progressive” wing of the Party. Which consisted primarily of men like himself: wealthy, well-educated professionals  </p> <h4><b>Muir Woods </b></h4> <p>The Kent's traveled to Marin in 1903 after an economic downturn impacted the family's fortune. While there, a friend took them to <strong>Redwood Canyon</strong>, urging them to buy the grove and protect the majestic trees. At the time, much of the surrounding land was being plundered for timber and commercial use. Hesitant, the couple did buy all 611-acres for $45,000, “the lowest possible price… for preservation and not for exploitation.”  </p> <p>In 1907, Redwood Canyon was under threat again – this time from a company that sought to exploit it for water. Arguing the resource was more important than tourism. To preserve their land, Kent went to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/gifford-pinchot.htm\">Gifford Pinchot</a>. President Theodore Roosevelt had appointed Pinchot head of the newly formed Forest Service. The Kent's sought to save the pristine redwood grove by donating it to the federal government. </p> <p>Invoking the Preservation of American Antiquities Act, Pinchot brought the conflict to Roosevelt’s attention. In 1908, the President accepted the land and named the grove Muir Woods National Monument. After the Kent's requested it be named for family friend and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jomu/index.htm\">conservationist John Muir.</a>  </p> <h4><b>Politics </b></h4> <p>Due to Kent's experience fighting corruption in Chicago, he was recruited in to the San Francisco Good Government League. By 1910, he decided to run for Congress. A member of the Progressive party, his political allies strongly supported him, and he went on to represent California in the House of Representatives for three terms.  </p> <p>In 1915, Kent took thirty Congressional members and their wives to the top of Mt. Tamalpais. He served them lunch in the gorgeous natural setting of <strong>Muir Woods</strong>. By the next session of Congress, he had authored and secured the passage of the <strong>National Park Service Act</strong>.  </p> <p>He also supported the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/california-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">Nineteenth Amendment</a>. Likely influenced by his wife Elizabeth, a suffragist. William stated in Congress “all people should have the right to vote, and a woman is a person.” Although they agreed on suffrage, the couple disagreed on approach. William was supportive when she was lobbying, and organizing Congressional hearings for women’s right. But he did not appreciate Elizabeth's use of militant tactics, protesting, and frequent arrest.   </p> <h4><b>Anti-Immigrantion</b></h4> <p>Along with suffrage and conservation, Kent carried racist views into the halls of Congress. During his campaigns, he ranted against Asian Americans, proclaiming: “We must exclude Asiatics.” Backed by the Oriental Exclusion League, many whites-only labor unions and headline driven newspapers. In a quote to a local newspaper Kent proudly states: “I have been writing and talking about the necessity of keeping this a white man’s country for the last 30 years.” </p> <p>Once in Congress he helped push through policies that barred Asian immigrants from owning land, becoming U.S. citizens and entering the country. Although the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/chinese-exclusion-act\">1882 Chinese Exclusion Act</a> was already in place, Kent supported the law’s extension.</p> <p>After serving three terms, Kent left Congress to pursue a U.S. Senate seat. During his campaign speech, he stated:<br /> <br /> <em>“We who happen to be of English descent are proud and happy in the fact that the country from which we came was not overrun by successions of peoples yellow and black and indiscriminate in their breeding.” </em> <br /> <br /> He ultimately lost that Senate race.  But he did not disappear from political life. President Woodrow Wilson, whom he had campaigned for, appointed Kent to the National Tariff Board in 1920.</p> <h4><b>Legacy </b></h4> <p>Though marked by some great environmental achievements, William Kent's initiatives centered whiteness. Educated and prosperous, Kent felt entitled to the privilege's society provided for him and his family. He believed in – and indeed, helped create – a world, in which whites of European descent were superior.  </p> <p>Some may wish to dismiss or excuse his racism; asserting he was merely a product of his day. But that perspective ignores the prominent leaders and politicians of the time who scorned his xenophobia. And diminishes the impact Kent's policies had on vulnerable communities both then and now. <br /> <br /> Kent died on March 13, 1928 in Kentfield, California from pneumonia. He was survived by Elizabeth, five sons, two daughters, and ten grandchildren.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>When Iris Calderhead was just six years old, her father, William Calderhead, was elected to his first term as a United States Congressman from Kansas. As a little girl, she would travel with him around the state to meet with constituents. But it was a constituency in which Iris could not participate in. She made sure that didn’t stay the case for the next generation of women.<br /> <br /> After graduating from the University of Kansas she served for a brief period as an English teacher in her hometown of Marysville, Kansas. While vacationing in New York City, she met organizers from the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, an event that changed her life. Within months she was marching through Washington, DC carrying the purple, white, and gold banners of the women’s suffrage movement. She resigned from her teaching position before the next school year and became an organizer for the Congressional Union and later National Woman’s Party, primarily organizing women in the western states.<br /> <br /> Some western states had already granted women’s suffrage to varying degrees, and Iris Calderhead believed that it was the responsibility of western women to fight for national voting rights on behalf of eastern women. She told a Tulsa, Oklahoma newspaper in late 1916, “Penned by the thousands in gray mills and factories, forced to work for starvation wages, these women are powerless to enforce humane legislation for themselves and powerless to give the time for the battle for political equality. We have got to make this fight for them thru [sic] the national amendment.”<br /> <br /> By early 1917, Calderhead was one of the Silent Sentinels,<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">protesting in front of the White House in support of the 19th Amendment</a>. That spring, the National Woman’s party designated her as the Vice-Chair of Demonstrations. In June, she was arrested for the first time. President Woodrow Wilson was scheduled to speak at the dedication of a statue for Robert Emmet, who had led a rebellion for Irish Independence. Calderhead and a colleague planned to unveil a banner calling Wilson “A Liberal Abroad and a Conservative at Home” and questioning why he supported Irish liberty while denying American women’s struggle. The charges were soon dropped, but Calderhead continued the fight. On July 4, 1917, she was one of a dozen suffragists arrested in front of the White House. She spent three days in jail and went right back to the picket line in front of the White House. <br /> <br /> In October of 1918, she married John Brisbane Walker, a prominent magazine editor who had previously been the owner of Cosmopolitan Magazine. Despite newspaper criticisms of suffragists getting married, Iris continued to fight for women’s suffrage and the rights of women around the country, serving as a national officer and organizer in the National Woman’s Party. She often viewed the fight for women’s rights through the lens of labor reform, and in 1919, newspapers reported that she and her husband were launching a socialist newspaper. Her husband passed away in 1931, but the now widowed suffragists continued the fight. <br /> <br /> By the 1930s she was working out of what is now <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/index.htm\">Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument</a> as the Director of the National Woman’s Party Campaign for Equality Reservation to adherence to the World Court. In the aftermath of World War I, the League of Nations was creating a World Court, and Calderhead led the charge to force the World Court to protect the rights of women around the world. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=IbvsRbZf8FYC&vq=iris%20calderhead&pg=PA50#v=snippet&q=iris%20calderhead&f=false\">She testified before Congress on the issue in 1932</a>, saying, “You see, [the League of Nations] it is antifeminist in its point of view. It is a question of going into an international government, an international system, which is based up on the Old World standards, and which up to now has not made a single concession to the American standard of equality for men and women.” That same year, Congress proposed legislation to remove married women from the Federal civil service, and the National Woman’s Party crafted a resolution encouraging women to consider divorce to keep their jobs. Calderhead presented that resolution to President Herbert Hoover, which also asked for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. By the mid-1930s she worked for the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, a New Deal program designed to support farmers through subsidies and soil conservation.<br /> <br /> In January of 1941, Iris Calderhead, a suffragist, socialist editor, New Dealer, and champion of global women’s rights, married the most unlikely of people – oil geologist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/wallace-e-pratt.htm\">Wallace E. Pratt</a>, Vice President of the Standard Oil Company. Within weeks of their marriage in rural West Texas, the two began designing a home together at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gumo/planyourvisit/mckittrick.htm\">McKittrick Canyon</a>, in what is today <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gumo/index.htm\">Guadalupe Mountains National Park.</a> Completed during World War II, their home, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/gumo_ship_on_the_desert.htm\">Ship on the Desert</a>, was designed to resemble an oil tanker. The architects corresponded with both Iris and Wallace, and the two moved in before the end of World War II. For the next 20 years, the family lived in this remote section of the West Texas Chihuahuan desert. But reminders of her legacy were never too far away. Although the house had been designed to look like an oil tanker, the entrance door was painted a vibrant purple – the color of the women’s suffrage movement and banners she had once carried in front of the White House. By the early 1960s, Iris’s health was failing, and the Pratt family moved to Tucson, Arizona. Iris Calderhead Pratt died in March 1966. Although she had been out of the national spotlight for twenty years and was married to one of the most important oil men of the 20th century, her obituary in the New York Times led by defining her legacy and not her husbands' -  “Mrs. Iris Calderhead Pratt, once jailed briefly for picketing the White House as a suffragette when Woodrow Wilson was President, died yesterday.” Iris was cremated and and her ashes were scattered in McKittrick Canyon, an unlikely final resting place that just a few years later became part of Guadalupe Mountains National Park. </p> <br />  ",

By 1908, Pratt had earned two Bachelor degrees in geological studies from the University of Kansas. He subsequently earned a Master’s degree in 1909, and an Engineer of Mines degree in 1914 from the same university. From 1909 to 1914, Pratt lived and worked in the Philippines, where he became the chief of the Division of Mines. In 1916, Pratt was employed by the Texas Company and moved to Houston, Texas. Pratt was hired in 1918 as the first geologist for the Humble Oil Company, which would later be incorporated into Exxon. He was promoted several times and eventually became the vice president of Humble’s parent company, Standard Oil Co.<br /> <br /> Pratt was introduced to the Guadalupe Mountains by an associate, Judge Drane, while on a business trip to Pecos, Texas in 1921. After Drane mentioned that there was land for sale, Pratt and three colleagues bought ranch property in the area. By 1930, Pratt had purchased the rest of his original partners’ land holdings and continued to expand his ownership, which included the lower portion and mouth of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gumo/planyourvisit/mckittrick.htm\">McKittrick Canyon</a>. Pratt grazed approximately 100 head of cattle on his property, which he called Manzanital Ranch. Between 1931 and 1932, Pratt and his wife, Pearl Stuckey, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/gumo_pratt_cabin.htm\">had a stone cabin built </a>at the confluence of the north and south forks of McKittrick Canyon to serve as their summer home. The site of the Cabin also includes a stone garage, a pump house, and stone walls along the west, south, and east edges. The Cabin was intended to be used as a primary residence,but the threat of strong floods inspired Pratt to consider other options. Pearl died in 1940, and in 1941 Wallace remarried <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/iris-calderhead-pratt.htm\">Iris Calderhead</a>, a prominent suffragist, who had once been arrested for protesting in front of the White House. Shortly after their marriage the couple began designing a second home, which they named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/gumo_ship_on_the_desert.htm\">Ship on the Desert</a>, on higher ground outside of the canyon.<br /> <br /> After moving from the area in the early 1960s because of Iris's declining health, the Pratt family donated their property, including the Cabin, to the National Park Service between 1960 and 1963. Additional land that is now encompassed by the Guadalupe Mountains National Park was purchased by the federal government and the park was officially dedicated and opened to the public in 1972. Iris died in 1966 and Wallace had her ashes scattered in McKittrick Canyon. He married Suzanne d'Autremont shortly afterwards. She cared for Pratt until his death in 1981, and had his ashes scattered in McKittrick Canyon. <br /> <br /> Wallace Pratt was among the pioneers of scientific exploration in the oil industry. His distinguished career led to great advancements in geologic research and technology related to oil exploration. Pratt published numerous documents, notably <em>Oil in the Earth</em> (1941) and <em>Toward a Philosophy of Oil Finding</em> (1951), which are still pertinent to the natural resources industry today. He was ahead of his time, calling for advancement in oil and natural gas conservation, and alternative energy technology early in his career. Pratt advocated for responsible and efficient methods of extracting, transporting and refining oil. His deep appreciation of the natural world was a catalyst for the preservation of what is largely considered one of the most beautiful areas in Texas and now makes up the core of the Guadalupe Mountains National Park.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Despite a successful career as a Washington, D.C. lawyer and service as the United States District Attorney, Francis Scott Key could easily be a name lost to history. Instead, he is renowned as author of one of the most famous poems in American history.</p> <p>Key was born on August 1, 1779, in western Maryland on a family estate called \"Terra Rubra.\" He attended grammar school in Annapolis, and continued on to study law while apprenticing with an uncle's law firm. By 1805, he had a well-established law practice of his own in Georgetown, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and was appointed the United States District Attorney in 1833.</p> <p>The law was only one of Key’s interests. He was a deeply religious man, and at one time in his life considered giving up his law practice to enter the ministry of the Episcopal Church. Because of his religious beliefs, Key was strongly opposed to the decision to go to war in 1812. But deep love for his country overrode this, and he served for a brief time in 1813 in Captain George Peter's Georgetown Light Field Artillery.</p> <p>But Key’s greatest service to the war effort would come in 1814. Prominent Washington physician Dr. William Beanes was taken prisoner by the British following the capture of Washington on August 24, and Key was asked to secure his release. Key made his way to Baltimore, and on September 5, 1814, sailed in a small flag-of-truce vessel out of the port of Baltimore with Colonel John Skinner to negotiate prisoner exchange with the Royal Navy.</p> <p>The British officers aboard the flagship HMS <em>Tonnant </em>were kind to Key and Skinner, and agreed to release Dr. Beanes. However, as the negotiations had been taking place, the Battle of Baltimore had begun. The three Americans were kept in the harbor and from a distance of approximately eight miles, watched the bombardment of Fort McHenry.</p> <p>What happened next became legend. After 25 hours of continuous bombing, the British abandoned their attack and retreated. Key scanned the sky in the morning following a night of attacks for clues as to what had happened. To his surprise and relief, the American flag was still flying! Overjoyed and inspired by patriotism, he quickly penned the words to a poem called “The Defence of Fort McHenry.” The first stanza of this poem is well-known to Americans as the lyrics to the national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner.”<br /> <br /> After the war, Francis Scott Key continued to live a very religious life. He was well-liked by his friends and was active in his community and especially his church. Key remained an amateur poet throughout his life, writing poems especially with religious themes. Although his best-known poem was published in 1814, the rest of his poems were not published until 14 years after his death. Key died of a lung infection on January 11, 1843, while visiting his daughter in Baltimore.</p>",

He was leader of India’s nationalist movement and India’s first prime minister after independence (1947-1964).  </h3> <p paraeid=\"{1c7c08d6-bd19-4066-bff0-83346cf3d23d}{236}\" paraid=\"1588162290\">Nehru was educated at home until age 16 and then continued his education in England at the Harrow School and later at Trinity College in Cambridge, where he earned a degree in natural science. He then studied law at the Inner Temple in London before returning to India in 1912 where he practiced law until 1919. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{3}\" paraid=\"922533145\">In 1919, Nehru became aware of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The massacre, also known as the Massacre of Amritsar, was an event in which 379 innocent people were killed and at least 1,200 wounded when the British army continuously fired for ten minutes on a crowd of unarmed Indians. The incident changed Nehru's life. In concert with his father, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal devoted himself to the struggle for India’s independence from the British Empire. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{25}\" paraid=\"643008012\">During the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22) led by Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru was imprisoned for the first time for activities against the British government. Over the next two and a half decades, he spent a total of nine years in jail. Given his compelling oratory and close association to Gandhi, he was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1929. From 1930 to 1936, Nehru was in jail for conducting civil disobedience campaigns.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{49}\" paraid=\"466865800\">During World War II, Nehru desired to support the Allied war effort. However, Nehru’s views on the war differed from those of Gandhi. Initially, Gandhi believed that whatever support was given to the British should be given unconditionally and that it should be of a nonviolent character. Nehru held that nonviolence had no place in defense against aggression and that India should support Great Britain in a war against Nazism but only as a free country.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{59}\" paraid=\"1004021743\">Nehru was imprisoned nine times during WWII over involvement in actions related to support for Indian independence from Great Britain. He was released from his last detention on June 15, 1945.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{73}\" paraid=\"1400566524\">In 1946, Nehru joined India’s interim government as deputy prime minister (the British viceroy being considered prime minister) and minister of external affairs. From India’s independence in 1947 until his death, Nehru continuously held the posts of prime minister and minister of external affairs. In 1947, despite his reservations, Nehru acquiesced to the Muslim League’s plan to divide India, and in August 1947, Pakistan was created - Pakistan being primarily Muslim and India predominantly Hindu. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{85}\" paraid=\"1853936931\">Nehru’s name is associated with the development and implementation of the basic principles of the internal and foreign policy of the Republic of India, which have been referred to as the “Nehru course.” Chiefly, he oversaw India's transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, multi-party system.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{97}\" paraid=\"1510650717\">Starting in the late 1940s, both the United States and the U.S.S.R. began seeking out India as an ally in the Cold War. However, Nehru, led a “non-alignment policy”, by which India and other nations wouldn’t feel the need to tie themselves to either country in order to thrive. Therefore, Nehru is considered a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) of nations professing neutrality. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{107}\" paraid=\"694024812\">Prime Minister Nehru visited the United States in late 1956, arriving in Washington D.C. on December 16. On the following morning, President Eisenhower met him at the Blair House and together they drove to Eisenhower’s Gettysburg farm. Nehru’s visit to the farm was the first of a foreign leader and was carefully fitted into the official itinerary. Together they spent that day and part of the next in some fourteen hours of conversation. During the visit, Nehru became the only world leader to stay overnight at the farm as part of his visit during the Eisenhower administration.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{121}\" paraid=\"848133939\">On December 18th, Nehru and Eisenhower returned to Washington. Nehru went to the White House the next morning and they continued private talks. In the end, President Eisenhower had made fourteen pages of notes on their conversations. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{135}\" paraid=\"2137559191\">Some of the topics discussed during the visit addressed India’s neutrality, socialism, and the way the “third world” viewed the actions of the President of the United States. More specifically, what was the Indian government’s stance on the U.S. actions during the Hungarian Revolt and the Suez Crisis? Prime Minister Nehru was an information conduit for President Eisenhower on how \"third world\" nations viewed the West.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e4935e3c-4056-46cc-82e8-c845f0d06816}{145}\" paraid=\"1776529632\">In his memoir <em>Waging Peace 1956-1961</em>, President Eisenhower stated that he liked Prime Minister Nehru and that he deeply sympathized with the problems that Chinese aggression had caused India. He believed that Nehru sincerely wanted to help the Indian people and lead them to higher levels of living and opportunity. He thought it fair to conclude that Nehru was essential to India. </p>",

Roach was born in Grainger County in East Tennessee on March 17, 1847. Roach’s family were farmers and lived in a one-room log house on thirty-five acres of land. Growing up, Roach only attended ten months of school in total, as he had to work most of the time on the family farm. Like many communities in East Tennessee, Grainger County had few slaveholders and the majority of the residents were poor farmers likes Roach’s family. According to Roach, there were few opportunities for young men to save up enough money to purchase their own farms or go into business for themselves. He remembered that the members of the community who owned enslaved people did not have close relations with the non-slaveholding residents. Roach stated that when an enslaver did employ a non-slaveholder, the worker <strong>“was principally looked on as being no better than a slave and was treated as one.”</strong></p> <h4>Civil War</h4> <p>When the Civil War began, Anderson Roach was like many other East Tennesseans and remained loyal to the US government. At the age of sixteen, Roach left his home in Grainger County and traveled north to Kentucky, where he enlisted in the US Army at Camp Nelson on July 19, 1863. Roach was mustered in as a private in Company F of the 8<sup>th</sup> Tennessee Cavalry on August 11, 1863. Roach served with the regiment throughout the rest of the war, participating in numerous operations in Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina.<br /> <br /> Between December 1863 and March 1864, Roach was absent from his unit without leave, likely because he was spending time at home with his family, but he rejoined the 8<sup>th</sup> Tennessee Cavalry and was restored to duty without any serious repercussions. As part of his military service, Roach fought Confederate forces to help secure US control of East Tennessee, raided enemy industrial infrastructure in Virginia, and performed garrison duty in his home region in the war’s aftermath. In a questionnaire completed in 1922 by surviving Civil War veterans in Tennessee, Roach recalled:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>While in regular camps we had plenty to eat plenty to wear and good treatment but when we were on raids, as we were most of the time, we suffered untold agony from cold and exposure. There were several hundred of the soldiers feet froze and had to be amputated…The regiment in its marches and counter marches traveled three thousands three hundred and twenty three miles, less than fifty miles of this distance by rail, the balance except from Strawberry Planes to Camp Nelson, a distance of 170 miles, which was traveled on foot, was on horseback.</strong></p> <p>Roach was mustered out of Federal service at Knoxville on September 11, 1865.</p> <h4>Post-War Life</h4> <p>After the Civil War ended and he was discharged, Roach walked from Knoxville to his home in Grainger County. Roach once again took up farming and remained a farmer for the rest of his life. Roach married Susan L. McDaniel in November 1865, and after her death in 1879, he remarried to Darthula E. Walker around 1880.<br /> <br /> Roach died in Loudon County, Tennessee, on March 9, 1925. He is intered at New Corinth Cemetery in Grainger County.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><em><strong>Article Written by Nicole Martin</strong></em></p> <hr /> <p>Sarah Winnemucca, born in 1844 and called Thocmetony (Shell Flower) by her family, was a member of the Paiute tribe in present-day Nevada. Winnemucca worked as both an interpreter and negotiator between American Indian tribes and the U.S. Army during the “Indian wars” that occured throughout the American West in the decades after the Civil War. As a skilled writer and activist, she demanded that Americans live up to their own political ideals, exposing the violence and hypocrisy that accompanied western expansion in her quest to secure her people “a permanent home on their own native soil.”<sup>1</sup></p> <h2>Early Life</h2> <p>During Winnemucca’s youth, the life her people had enjoyed in the Great Basin changed dramatically. Occasional interactions with Spanish officials and American traders were replaced with a tidal wave of migration in the wake of the discovery of gold in California and silver on the Comstock Lode in Nevada. “They [white people] came like a lion, yes, like a roaring lion, and have continued so ever since,” Winnemucca wrote in the opening lines of her autobiography, the first book published by an American Indian woman.<sup>2</sup> This invasion of the Paiute homeland destroyed her tribe’s ability to continue their long-established patterns of hunting and gathering.<br /> <br /> Winnemucca’s grandfather and father served as guides to early white settlers, including the explorer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/historyculture/civil-war-at-fort-mason.htm\">John C. Fremont</a>. While these friendly relationships resulted in Winnemucca living in white households for several years, she also witnessed a number of violent acts at the hands of white settlers, including the murder of two uncles, the attempted rape of her sister, the Pyramid Lake War and Bannock War, and the burning of Paiute food supplies.<br /> <br /> In the 1870s, Winnemucca became an interpreter for the Indian Office. She persuaded reluctant bands to relocate to reservations and negotiated with military commanders to increase supplies and protect reservation boundaries. However, she watched with dismay the corruption of Indian agents, many of them bureaucrats from Christian denominations, which often left her people starving. In 1878, the forced removal of many Paiutes who remained peaceful during the Bannock War from the Malheur Reservation, which lay within their traditional homeland, to the Yakama Reservation hundreds of miles north, incited her to action.<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">3</span></p> <h2>Vancouver Barracks During the Indian Wars</h2> <p>The experiences of Winnemucca’s own band were not unique. As the population of American settlers increased in the 1850s, and as the US government assigned Native Americans to reservations created for their “education,” many tribes resisted the transition and the hardships that came from relocation and life under corrupt agents. After the Civil War, Congress announced it would no longer negotiate treaties with American Indian tribes. Instead, Native communities would simply be subject to federal power, including “civilizing” programs that envisioned incorporating Native communities into a homogeneous nation-state. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Francis Walker, believed this new policy reflected America’s “imperial greatness” and fairly compensated Native Americans for dispossession of their lands.<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">4</span><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/vb.htm\">Vancouver Barracks</a> contributed to this imperial program by serving as a place of incarceration for Native Americans captured in the region, many of whom were resisting efforts to place them on reservations. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/general-oliver-otis-howard-house.htm\">General Oliver Otis Howard</a>, the commanding officer of the Barracks from 1874-1880 and former Commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau, viewed imprisonment in the post <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/photosmultimedia/guardhouse-stereoscope.htm\">Guard House</a> as a significant form of leverage in his councils with local tribes. He used the threat of imprisonment to pressure a council of Nez Perce leaders who followed a popular non-Christian Dreamer prophet religion he deemed uncivilized. \"I showed them that Skimiah, a 'Dreamer,' leader of a small band near Celilo, was already in the guardhouse at Fort Vancouver,\" Howard recounted, \"and that this would, doubtless, be the fortune of any other 'Dreamer' leader for non-compliance with Government instructions.\"<sup>5</sup><br /> <br /> By 1880, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/1880svancouverincarceration.htm\">fifty-three American Indian prisoners</a> – men, women, and children as young as three years old of the Shoshone and Bannock tribes, including Tukudika, Weiser, and Boisé bands–were held at Vancouver Barracks. Male prisoners were made to do road work, while female prisoners sewed, as part of the larger U.S. policy to “uplift” Native peoples through “Anglo Saxon civilization,” including gendered understandings of work. In his book, <em>My Life and Experiences Among Our Hostile Indians</em>, Howard wrote about this group, saying that at Vancouver Barracks “we had the opportunity of applying processes of civilization, namely, systematic work and persistent instruction to Indian children and youth.”<sup>6</sup></p> <h2>Sarah Winnemucca’s Advocacy for Native Prisoners of War</h2> <p>After the Native prisoners arrived, Winnemucca visited Vancouver Barracks and began work as an interpreter and teacher for the prisoners. In letters, several officers stationed at Vancouver Barracks spoke very highly of her, especially of her compassion towards the women and children brought to the post. Howard wrote that Winnemucca was his interpreter, and “bore a prominent and efficient part” in aiding the incarcerated people.<sup>7</sup><br /> <br /> Since the forced removal of her people, Sarah Winnemucca had devoted herself to social activism. In the early 1880s, she became a prolific public speaker, giving over 300 speeches in support of reservation Indians. Winnemucca understood the conventions of her largely white and female audience, including the importance of embodying the “Indian princess” trope in order to be heard.<sup>8</sup> When she spoke, she reversed the normal narrative that depicted Indians as “savages” threatening white settler homes. Instead, she portrayed these same settlers as violent threats to Indian homes, including the perpetuation of sexual violence against Native women.<sup>9</sup><br /> <br /> At odds with most Indian reformers of the day, Winnemucca trusted US soldiers, whom she worked with, but did not hesitate to point out the hypocrisy of reformers and agents of the Indian Office who used Christian benevolence to justify terror and Indian dispossession. She explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Oh, for shame!...Yes, you, who call yourselves the great civilization; you who have knelt upon Plymouth Rock, covenanting with God to make this land the home of the free and the brave. Ah, then you rise from your bended knees and seizing the welcoming hands of those who are the owners of this land, which you are not, your carbines rise upon the bleak shore, and your so-called civilization sweeps in land from the ocean wave; but, oh, my God! leaving its pathway marked by crimson lines of blood, and strewed by the bones of two races, the inheritor and the invader; and I am crying out to you for justice.”<sup>10</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In 1880, Winnemucca met with President Rutherford B. Hayes, the first sitting president to visit the Far West. She advocated for the humane treatment of her tribe, asking that they be allowed to return from where they were being held on the Yakama Reservation to their native homelands. While her words reduced First Lady Lucy Hayes to tears, the president did not change his mind.<sup>11</sup><br /> <br /> In March, 1881, Winnemucca wrote a plea for the fifty-three prisoners being held at Fort Vancouver. She asked that they be allowed to stay, writing that the men wished to continue to work for the military. She explained,</p> <blockquote> <p>“If they could have a place, or a bit of land given them to use for themselves, yes, a place for their own benefit, and where they could work for themselves, I would teach them habits of industry, and it would help much in supporting them; and it is necessary that there should be, at least for the present, some appropriation made for them, in order to provide clothing for the women and children, and a proper place to live in.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Being under military authority would be better, she argued, than turning them loose “to wander in idleness or learn evil, or go back to bad habits again” or be “cheated” by corrupt agents.<sup>12</sup><br /> <br /> Winnemucca’s model Native community took the form of an idealized reservation, where a virtuous white agent or military support would keep other white Americans away, allowing Native autonomy and domestic values to thrive. This vision informed a petition she made to Congress, in which she asked the honorable members to restore the Paiutes to the Malheur Reservation so that they could “afford homes….without losing their tribal relations, so essential to their happiness and good character” and which would “defend them from the encroachments of white settlers, so detrimental to their interests and their virtues.”<sup>13</sup> The virtues she referred to, as seen in her plea for the Fort Vancouver prisoners–such as traditional gender roles, modesty, and industriousness–resonated with mainstream American understandings of domesticity and civilization. Winnemucca’s vision thus melded conservative elements with a radical central tenet: Native distance from violent white American settlers.<sup>14</sup><br /> <br /> Despite Winnemucca’s plea for the Shoshone and Bannock prisoners held at Vancouver Barracks, the group was released and escorted to the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho that same year. Winnemucca’s inability to convince officials, along with repeated failures to help her people gain the assistance they needed and her collaboration with white sponsors, all contributed to reducing her standing in her own community by 1882.<sup>15</sup><br /> <br /> Winnemucca went on to write her autobiography, <em>Life Among the Piutes </em>[sic]<em>: Their Wrongs and Claims</em>. Published in 1883 with the help of the sisters Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Peabody Mann, prominent woman reformers, the book boldly testified not only to the mistreatment of Paiutes living on the Yakama Reservation but also American expansion more generally. Her desire for permanent homes for her people remained constant. “I beseech of you,” she wrote, “sweep away the [Indian] agency system; give us homes to live in, for God's sake and for humanity's sake.”<sup>16</sup> White Americans, including former supporters, roundly attacked the book for exposing the violence of American settlement.<br /> <br /> In her final years, Winnemucca shifted her attention from lecturing on the plight of Indigenous peoples at the hands of American expansion to education. She began a school for Paiute children, where she taught in their native language and in English. Unlike most government boarding schools, her independent school did not require students to leave their families. While well-attended, it shut down from insufficient funds and outside support after three years. She died in 1891.<sup>17</sup><br /> <br /> <b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvTTPkLaidc\">Click here to watch a video about Sarah Winnemucca at Vancouver Barracks on Fort Vancouver National Historic Site's YouTube channel.</a></b></p> <hr /> <p><sup>1</sup> “Letter from Sarah Winnemucca, April 4, 1870,” reprinted in Helen Hunt Jackson, <em>A Century of Dishonor: A Sketch of the United States Government's Dealings with Some of the Indian Tribes</em> (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1881), 396, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Century_of_Dishonor.html?id=asRiAAAAMAAJ\">access online here</a>.<br /> <br /> <sup>2</sup> Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins, <em>Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims</em> (Boston: Cupples, Upham and Co., 1883), 5, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_Among_the_Piutes.html?id=7D8EAAAAYAAJ\">access online here</a>.<br /> <br /> <sup>3</sup> Frederick Hoxie, <em>This Indian Country: American Indian Activists and the Place They Made</em> (New York: Penguin Books, 2012), 143-152; For more on Winnemucca’s biography, see Sally Zanjani, <em>Sarah Winnemucca </em>(Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2001).<br /> <br /> <sup>4</sup> Hoxie, <em>This Indian Country</em>, 157-161; Francis Walker, Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1872), 398, <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.ou.edu/indianserialset/5628/\">access online here</a>.<br /> <br /> <sup>5</sup> Oliver Otis Howard, Annual Report of the Secretary of War (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1877), 590, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hdBDAQAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PP10&printsec=frontcover27+leader+of+a+small+band+near+Celilo%2C+was+already+in+the+guardhouse+at+Fort+Vancouver&source=bl&ots=QOJVuJgOlD&sig=ACfU3U2FcjxipZZb4j1wB0RgGcKnUnvwnw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEj5bXntD2AhXAknIEHe28D6sQ6AF6BAgPEAM\">access online here</a>.<br /> <br /> <sup>6</sup> Oliver Otis Howard,<em> My Life and Experiences Among Our Hostile Indians </em>(Hartford, Conn.: A.D.

            "bodyText": "<h4>Early Life</h4> Warren Goodale was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, on July 2, 1826. He attended Williams College in his home state but left before completing his degree due to health issues. Goodale sailed from Boston to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he worked first as a teacher at Royal School and then became the Marshall of the Kingdom and later Collector of Customs. When he returned to Massachusetts for a brief visit, Goodale married Ellen Whitemore in 1852. Ellen joined Goodale in heading back to Hawaii, where they had five children together. However, in February 1862, soon after she gave birth to twins, Ellen died. <h4>Civil War</h4> Following his wife’s death and with the Civil War raging, Goodale returned to Massachusetts with his family. Goodale entrusted his five children to the care of his brother and enlisted as a private in the 11<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Light Artillery on September 14, 1864, at the age of 38. Goodale’s unit was sent to the frontlines in Virginia, where they participated in the siege operations at Petersburg through the end of the year and into the first few months of 1865. Besides the enemy forces, Goodale and his comrades also contended with inclement winter weather. Goodale took pride in his ability to withstand the wintry conditions, writing <strong>“I endure the cold quite as well as my fellows and think I make as hardy & reliable a soldier as many of the veterans.”</strong><br /> <br /> At the end of March 1865, Goodale was commissioned a lieutenant in the 114<sup>th</sup> US Colored Infantry (USCI), one of the African American regiments organized at Camp Nelson. Units of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cane/united-states-colored-troops.htm\">US Colored Troops</a> (USCT) were segregated, with white commissioned officers leading Black soldiers. Many white soldiers in the US Army desired appointments to USCT regiments to receive promotions. Goodale was mustered into the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI only a couple days before the successful conclusion of the sieges of Petersburg and Richmond in early April. Goodale was with the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI when it marched into Richmond as one of the first Federal regiments to enter the Confederate capital after its abandonment. Goodale remained with the 114<sup>th </sup>USCI while it was stationed in Virginia and then accompanied the unit to Texas to perform garrison duty on the US-Mexico border after the end of the war.<br /> <br /> Goodale became a regimental quartermaster, meaning that he oversaw the acquisition and distribution of supplies and equipment to the men of the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI. As garrison duty in Texas was long, tedious, and seemingly without purpose compared to when fighting the Confederacy, many men longed for their military service to end. Goodale was no exception. In December 1865, Goodale wrote to his family: <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>When I left you there was good reason for my going, now there is no good reason for my remaining longer in the Army. We may all feel proud and satisfied that I could do a man’s share in putting down the wicked rebels, and come out from all danger unharmed. But I am neither proud nor satisfied to be here.</strong></div> <br /> Despite his displeasure with garrison life, Goodale continued to perform his duty and served with the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI until he was discharged in February 1866. <h4>Crucial Insights</h4> Goodale was never at Camp Nelson or even in Kentucky, but he spent nearly a year as a junior officer in the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI, leading and interacting with the hundreds of Black Kentuckians who comprised the regiment. As nearly all the African American troops were formerly enslaved men who had gained their freedom by enlisting in the US Army, most were illiterate and did not leave any written accounts of their lives during the Civil War. Goodale, on the other hand, wrote many letters to his children back home in Massachusetts. The writings of USCT officers may not have been penned by the actual Black soldiers, but they are important sources for understanding these men’s wartime experiences. Goodale frequently wrote about the Black soldiers in the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI, describing the military activities that they engaged in, their everyday lives in camp and on the march, and the trials and tribulations that they faced while in the army.<br /> <br /> In his own correspondence, Goodale often praised the men of the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI. In April 1865, Goodale wrote, <strong>“the 114<sup>th</sup> were noted for their good discipline,” </strong>while the following month he remarked,<strong> “Few of them can read or write, but they are civil obedient and much more intelligent than I had supposed.” </strong>After a military inspection in November 1865 in Texas, Goodale was proud to report: the inspecting officer <strong>“was pleased to say that the Regiment looked the best of any in the Brigade. No news to us but we are pleased to be told so on such good authority.”</strong><br /> <br /> Goodale did not only become familiar with the Black troops through personal interactions, but also because many of them turned to regimental officers like Goodale to write letters to their families back home in Kentucky and also read ones they received from loved ones. Through this practice, Goodale learned much about the struggles faced by Black civilians in Kentucky during the Civil War and its aftermath. After writing and reading a series of letters on behalf of his men in July 1865, Goodale asserted, <strong>“The families of these soldiers, and the poor freed slaves in Kentucky are suffering a great deal from their old masters.”</strong><br /> <br /> To learn more about the experiences of the 114<sup>th</sup> USCI in Virginia and Texas as related by Goodale in his letters home, click <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cane/through-the-eyes-of-an-officer-a-lieutenant-of-the-114th-us-colored-infantry.htm\">here</a>. <h4><b>Post-War Life</b></h4> After leaving the army, Goodale returned to Hawaii and worked as manager of several sugar plantations in Honolulu. He was appointed as head of the Hawaiian Mission Children’s Society and was actively involved in the Historical Society of Honolulu. At the age of 70, Goodale died suddenly from heart disease on February 22, 1897, and was buried in Honolulu in Nuuanu Cemetery, also known as Oahu Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Today, the Warren Goodale Papers are held by the Massachusetts Historical Society. <h4> </h4> <h4> </h4>",

            "bodyText": "Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr., was born on December 18, 1912, in Washington, D.C. He was the second of Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., and Elnora Dickerson Davis’s three children. Davis, Sr., was a U.S. Army officer and became the first African American to earn the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army. Elnora Davis died in 1916 from complications of childbirth.<br /> <br /> Davis, Jr., and his family lived in Washington, D.C. while his father was deployed in the Philippines starting in 1917. The family was reunited in 1920 when Davis, Sr., was stationed at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama where he taught military science and tactics, precursor to the modern-day ROTC. They then moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1924, when the senior Davis was assigned as an instructor to a federalized Ohio National Guard unit. Davis, Jr., graduated from Cleveland’s Central High School in 1929. He attended Western Reserve University and the University of Chicago before entering West Point in 1932.<br /> <br /> Like the African American cadets before him, Davis, Jr. suffered from the racism that prevailed at the academy. White cadets excluded him from activities because of his race. He lived by himself and ate his meals in silence since no white cadets would talk to him. Nevertheless, he persevered and graduated from West Point in 1936 in the top 20 percent of his class (Class Placement 33). He was the fourth African American to graduate from the academy. Reflecting on his time at West Point, Davis, Jr., said “It was designed to make me buckle, but I refused to buckle. They didn’t understand that I was going to stay there, and I was going to graduate. I was not missing anything by not associating with them. They were missing a great deal by not knowing me.” <br /> <br /> Although Davis, Jr. wanted to be an Army aviator, there were no all-Black aviation units at that time, so he was assigned to the Twenty-fourth Infantry at Fort Benning Georgia. In that era, African Americans were restricted to serving in the four all-Black regiments that were known as the Buffalo Soldiers. During that time, he led a company of soldiers and attended infantry school.<br /> <br /> In June 1938, Davis, Jr., was assigned to Tuskegee Institute as professor of military science and tactics, the position his father held 18 years earlier. He served at Tuskegee until February 1941 when his father, then a brigadier general, transferred him to his staff at Fort Riley as part of the 4th Cavalry Brigade that encompassed the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments. <br /> <br /> Davis, Jr.’s assignment as his father’s aide at Fort Riley lasted only four months. General Davis, Sr., received a letter from the Chief of the Air Corps requesting that his son should transfer to the Tuskegee Army Airfield for pilot training. Davis, Sr., quickly approved the transfer.<br /> <br /> Davis. Jr., now an Army captain, accepted the position; he began ground training at Tuskegee Institute in July 1941. He, along with 12 other aviation cadets, comprised the first class that would later be known as the Tuskegee Airmen. In March 1942, Davis, Jr., graduated and earned his wings. In May, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and transferred to the Army Air Corps as part of the expansion and mobilization effort after the United States entered World War II. <br /> <br /> In August 1942, Davis, Jr., was made the commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron at Tuskegee Army Airfield. He and his men continued to train in Tuskegee until March 1943 when they received word that they were officially being deployed in April.<br /> <br /> The 99th Squadron made its way to Camp Shanks, New York, to await passage aboard the <em>SS Mariposa</em>. They left the docks in Brooklyn, New York, on April 15, sailing to North Africa. Operating out of Tunisia, the 99th first saw combat on June 2, during Operation Corkscrew, in which they targeted enemy positions on the German-held Italian island of Pantelleria in a successful dive-bombing raid. <br /> <br /> Davis, Jr., returned to the United States in the fall of that year to take command of the 332nd Fighter Group. While in Washington, he successfully defended the 99th Squadron in the halls of the Pentagon against accusations of incompetence and calls for its dissolution. He and the 332nd then deployed to Italy two months later.<br /> <br /> The 332nd Fighter Group, stationed at Ramitelli Airfield, consisted of four fighter squadrons. The fighter group earned the nickname “Red Tails” because of the distinctive markings on their planes. It amassed an impressive record of protecting bombers on missions deep inside Germany. It was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its mission on March 24, 1945, when they protected bombers on their way to Berlin.<br /> <br /> After the war, Davis, Jr., assumed command of the 477th Composite Group at Godman Field, Kentucky. He held progressively higher commands throughout his career, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant general before retiring from the U.S. Air Force on February 1, 1970.<br /> <br /> General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., was promoted to four-star general by President Bill Clinton on December 9, 1998. He died on July 4, 2002, at the age of 89. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery Section 2, Grave E-311-RH.<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Harriet Bell Hayden, a prominent abolitionist and activist, sheltered freedom seekers in her home on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/beacon-hill.htm\">Beacon Hill</a> and dedicated her life to advocating for equal rights for all.</p> <p>Born into slavery in 1816, Harriet Bell Hayden grew up on a Kentucky plantation. Many details of Harriet Hayden’s early life are unknown. By the time she married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a> in 1842, she had one son named Jo. Only a few years after they married, the Haydens escaped slavery with help from abolitionists Calvin Fairbank and Delia Webster.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The Haydens took a long and risky road to freedom. In 1844, the family traveled by train from Kentucky to Ohio, before crossing the border into Canada.<sup>2</sup> Harriet and Lewis Hayden decided that they needed to aid others in their own freedom journeys, and the family returned to the United States in 1845. That same year, Harriet Hayden gave birth to her daughter, Elizabeth. In 1846, the Haydens settled in Boston’s Beacon Hill neighborhood. Harriet and Lewis Hayden soon found themselves at the center of Boston’s abolitionist movement working with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">Vigilance Committee of 1850</a>, which formed to aid and protect people escaping from slavery.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Harriet Hayden spent over a decade sheltering freedom seekers in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-and-harriet-hayden-house.htm\">family home</a>, which the Haydens had converted to a boarding house for freedom seekers on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/boston-an-underground-railroad-hub.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>. While Lewis tended to his responsibilities as a shop owner, Harriet likely took over the day-to-day operation of the boarding house to meet the needs of the freedom seekers who sheltered there, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">William and Ellen Craft</a>.<sup>4</sup> Harriet Hayden provided her guests with food, shelter, and protection on their dangerous journeys to freedom.</p> <p>Hayden also used her home as a meeting and organizing space, hosting prominent abolitionists visiting Boston. In 1859, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a> stayed with the Haydens while preparing for the historic raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia that same year. Lewis Hayden played a role in recruiting participants and financial backers for the raid, and an obituary for Harriet Hayden noted, \"no woman perhaps knew more than she of the inside history of the Harper’s Ferry tragedy.\"<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Harriet Hayden became a more public figure later in life, as social expectations for women changed. During the Civil War, Hayden and other formerly enslaved Bostonians took classes in reading and writing under the instruction of Mrs. Apphia Howard, a White abolitionist.<sup>6</sup> The skills she learned during this period helped her become an even stronger advocate for equal rights.</p> <p>Harriet and Lewis Hayden committed themselves to a variety of social causes and organizations beyond the Abolitionist movement, including Boston temperance groups and the West End Woman Suffrage League.<sup>7</sup> In 1875, Harriet Hayden co-founded the Prince Hall Auxiliary Association to provide an organizing space for female family members of the Prince Hall Masons, a Black masonic society.<sup>8</sup> Over the next few years, Hayden led the association in raising funds for a new masonic lodge. In 1876, she organized a celebration for Black Bostonians for the centennial of the American Revolution. Lewis Hayden gave an address at this event, where he praised the women's association’s fundraising activities and declared, \"the men of Massachusetts owe a debt to you, for, as of yet, they have not recognized your rights… there should be [no rest] until every human being is made equal before the law.\"<sup>9</sup></p> <p>Harriet Hayden never stopped advocating for the equal rights of Black citizens and Boston's Black community. When she passed away in her home in 1893, Hayden left $5,000 to Harvard University to create a scholarship for Black students pursuing a career in medicine.<sup>10</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Stephen Kantrowitz, <em>More Than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic, 1829-1889</em> (New York: Penguin, 2012), 91.</li> <li>Kathryn Grover and Janine V.

            "bodyText": "<p>Printer Robert F. Wallcut played an integral role in Boston’s abolition movement and Underground Railroad network.</p> <p>Born in 1797, Wallcut grew up in Nantucket, Massachusetts with parents Benjamin and Elizabeth. Little is known about his early life, however, newspaper articles and his obituary provide some information. In 1817 he graduated from Harvard College with other well known Bostonians such as Reverend Samuel J. May and Samuel E. Sewall.<sup>1</sup> Wallcut also served as a Unitarian minister throughout Massachusetts, and in 1832 he married Mary Ann Powers.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Embracing a life of activism in the 1840s, Wallcut supported anti-slavery and social justice causes. He participated in the Massachusetts Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment and the New England Non-Resistance Society, while also acting as the Recording Secretary of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-anti-slavery-society-office.htm\">Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society</a> for over a decade.<sup>3</sup> Most notably, Wallcut held the position of General Agent for <em>The Liberator</em> from 1846 to its final edition in 1865.<sup>4</sup> In this role, Wallcut facilitated aid to freedom seekers and anti-slavery causes by frequently directing his readers to send thier contributions to him at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/liberator-office.htm\"><em>The Liberator</em> office</a> at 21 Cornhill.</p> <p>For example, following the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Wallcut issued a call to action in <em>The Liberator</em>. In “To the Friends of the Fugitive,” he wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Alarmed at the operation of the new Fugitive Slave Law, the Fugitives from slavery are pressing Northward…They are coming to us in increasing numbers, and they look to us for aid. Oppressed by the tyranny of a heartless and God-defying government, who will help them? Their first and most earnest desire is for employment…Help us, then, all you who are friends of the fugitive, to extend to them this charity, this simple justice. Let all, who know, or can learn of places which may be filled by these men, women and youths, information by letter or otherwise, to Robert F. Wallcut, or Samuel May, Jr., 21 Cornhill, Boston…this appeal is made to you. Cannot you find, or procure, one or more places where the hunted slave may abide securely, and work through the winter? … Many of the fugitives come very poorly provided with clothing; and those who have garments of any kind to spare, will be sure to confer them on the suffering and needy by sending them, marked “For fugitives,” at 21 Cornhill, as above.”</em><sup>5</sup></p> <p>His publishing work extended beyond <em>The Liberator</em>. Wallcut also published several works by prominent Boston abolitionists. These included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-cooper-nell.htm\">William Cooper Nell’s</a> <em>Colored Patriots of the American Revolution</em>, one of the first published African American history books, and William I. Bowditch’s <em>The Rendition of Anthony Burns</em>.</p> <p>In addition to his work as a printer and agent for <em>The Liberator</em>, Wallcut also served in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, a group dedicated to fugitive assistance. According to the records of the Vigilance Committee, Wallcut assisted 44 named freedom seekers and an untold number of “fugitives” and “children” with board, clothing, and fares to Canada. For example, in June 1854, the Vigilance Committee reimbursed Wallcut for “Alfred Perkins. Mrs Wilson & child & Mr Foster & John Jones fares to Canada & sundries.”<sup>6</sup> He also provided furniture and financial assistance to the famed freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-story-of-jane-johnson.htm\">Jane Johnson</a>. </p> <p>Along with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/austin-bearse-home.htm\">Austin Bearse</a>, Wallcut helped reunite father and daughter freedom seekers George and Lizzie Lewis at Henry Thacker’s House on Southac Street.<sup>7</sup> He also escorted abolitionist author <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/harriet-beecher-stowe.htm\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> to the safe house run by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-and-harriet-hayden-house.htm\">Lewis and Harriet Hayden</a> where she met thirteen freedom seekers living there in 1853.<sup>8</sup> At this time and throughout the 1850s, Walcutt lived at 9 Columbia Street.</p> <p>The final edition of <em>The Liberator</em>, published after the Civil War, records what may be his final public statement, as no newspaper records, except his obituary, have been located beyond 1865 regarding Wallcut. In this publication, Robert F. Wallcut, the “honored and faithful General Agent” who put “his heart in his work,”<sup>9</sup> wrote to editor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a> reflecting on the work of <em>The Liberator</em>:</p> <p><em>The Liberator has ministered spiritual food and moral strength … to all of us. Its record is now to be sealed up. Who of us will not sorely miss it? How few more than I!</em><sup>10</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"Obituary,\" <em>Boston Herald</em>, March 2, 1884.</li> <li>\"Obituary,\" <em>Boston Herald</em>, March 2, 1884; “Ordination at Berlin,” <em>Christian Register</em> (Boston, Massachusetts), February 13, 1830; “Ecclesiastical,” <em>Christian Register</em>, December 12, 1835; “Married,” <em>Boston Christian Herald</em> (Boston, Massachusetts), October 3, 1832.</li> <li>“New England Non-Resistance Society,” <em>The Liberator</em> (Boston, Massachusetts), December 18, 1846; “Constitution and Officers of the Massachusetts Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment,” <em>The Liberator</em>, January 31, 1845; “Action of the Board of Managers,” <em>The Liberator</em>, July 10, 1846; “Tribute of Respect,” <em>The Liberator</em>, May 6, 1859.</li> <li>“Special Notice,” <em>The Liberator</em>, March 13, 1846.</li> <li>“To the Friends of the Fugitive,” <em>The Liberator</em>, October 18, 1850.</li> <li><em>Account Book of Francis Jackson, Treasurer The Vigilance Committee of Boston</em>, Dr. Irving H.

            "bodyText": "Elmer P. Gibson was a high-ranking African American Army Chaplain who served in World War II and the Korean War. He was an advocate for desegregating the military, and practiced desegregation as a chaplain, by holding integrated church services in the Aleutian Islands and other places. Later in life he served as an advisor to President Harry S. Truman and was a college president.  <p>Elmer P. Gibson was born in 1903, in Greensboro, North Carolina. His father, Reverend Lewis B. Gibson was formerly enslaved. His mother was Cornelia Adeline Pettiford Gibson. While in high school, Gibson was licensed to preach at St. Matthew’s Methodist Episcopal Church in Greensboro. Gibson attended Lincoln University, a historically black university in Oxford, Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1926 and began work as a deacon.<br /> <br /> Gibson was the first African American graduate of his seminary, Crozer Theological, in Chester Pennsylvania in 1930. He was ordained as a minister in 1928 and received a third degree in 1932 from the University of Pennsylvania. From 1933 to 1941, Gibson was the pastor of John Wesley Methodist Church in Salisbury, Maryland. During this time Gibson married Jeffery Melnese Wilson and they began a family. The Gibsons had a daughter (Cornelia) and a son (Elmer H.).<br /> <br /> As the United States became involved in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwarii/index.htm\">World War II,</a> Gibson was commissioned in the Army’s Chaplain Corps as a First Lieutenant in 1941. He first worked with the 367th Infantry Regiment (Colored). He then transferred to the newly formed 364th Infantry Regiment (Colored), 92nd Infantry Division. The 364th was mostly made up with people from the 367th. Gibson and his family moved with the Infantry to Phoenix, Arizona and then Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi. Gibson and the 364th were deployed to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/index.htm\">Aleutian Islands</a> on Christmas Day, 1943.<br /> <br /> Gibson was not only the regimental chaplain, but often the only Army chaplain available on Adak and Shemya Islands, in the Aleutians. He presided over integrated church services since there were no other chaplains. Gibson’s devotion to integration was noted, and he received the Legion of Merit award in 1945. His commanding officer, Brig. Gen. John F. Goodman wrote, “He is a great believer in bringing the white and colored races into a sensible toleration of each other. I believe him to be one of the best Chaplains I have seen since being in the service.”<br /> <br /> The award citation noted that Gibson “directed religious activities of the 364th Infantry Regiment in an exceptionally meritorious manner. He successfully handled all press releases for the colored troops on the islands and fulfilled all his tasks with untiring devotion to duty and conducted religious services not only for Negro troops but for other troops as well. He was an outstanding officer, leader, and a man of great capacity for work and by his untiring devotion, loyalty, understanding, and keen personal interest in the welfare of others contributed in no small measure to the morale of not only the men in the 364th Infantry Regiment but all others with whom he came in contact. His professional ability, tolerant outlook and unremitting devotion to duty reflects great credit upon himself and the military service.”<br /> <br /> After the end of World War II, Gibson returned to civilian life. He had the opportunity to continue his military chaplaincy career, but he declined. He would not have been given the rank of other chaplains (Major). In 1946, Gibson took an Army examination, passed. He was appointed to the Regular Army by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hstr/index.htm\">President Harry S. Truman</a>. Gibson received a permanent rank of Major and became one of the highest ranked African Americans in the Army.<br /> <br /> Gibson continued his advocacy to integrate the Army. He became an advisor to President Truman. In that role, he helped make plans and policies to completely desegregate the entire Armed Forces. In 1948, President Truman issued <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/executive-order-9981.htm\">Executive Order 9981</a>. It established equal treatment and opportunity in the military, regardless of race. Gibson testified before the Committee on Equal Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services (also called the Fahy Committee) on the topic of integration. He continued to promote integration, since it took the military branches awhile to put in place desegregation.<br /> <br /> Gibson was promoted to Lit. Colonel in 1950 while stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey. He became the first African American Army Post Chaplain in US history. He supervised almost two dozen other chaplains, both black and white, at Fort Dix, beginning in 1951. In May, 1952, Gibson arrived in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kowa/index.htm\">Korea</a>. He worked as the Assistant Corps Chaplain for the US Army 10th Corps (another first). Gibson’s duties included ministering to injured soldiers; talking and praying with soldiers waiting to for evacuation; providing chapel services for troops; ministering at local Korean Christian churches; and giving food and clothes to Koreans. Gibson remained in Korea until October of 1953.<br /> <br /> Gibson was awarded the Bronze Star Medal because he “frequently visited the front-line troops, often under fire, to conduct religious services and see to their spiritual guidance and well-being.” Gibson finished his military career as 2nd Infantry Division Chaplain at Fort Lewis, Washington. He retired in 1957 as Lieutenant Colonel.<br /> <br /> After retiring from the military, Gibson moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Temple University for a master’s degree in Educational Psychology. Gibson graduated in 1959, the same year he became president of Morristown College, a historically black college in Morristown, Tennessee. Gibson retired in 1969, and the college closed its doors for good in 1994, the same year that Gibson died. He was 90 years old and was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery (Section 64, Site 565).</p> <h2>References</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/north-carolina-state-archives/albums/72157709882523936/with/48374459816/\">Extensive Photo Album</a> from the State Archives of North Carolina, covering Elmer Gibson's time in World War II, the Korean War, and civilian life. </li> <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/nc-stories-of-service/elmer-p-gibson-army-chaplain-and-integration-pioneer-pt-1-455e04eb7521\">Detailed three-part biography of Elmer Gibson</a>, by Matthew Peek, State Archives of North Carolina </li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Catherine Jefferson Wiggins was born in Georgia in 1847 and was more than likely born enslaved. She married Luther Wiggins on December 13, 1868, in a town called Hamilton in Harris County, Georgia. They had seven children, Smith, William, John, Jasper, Sissie, Maggie, and Jeff. Sometime after 1870 they migrated to Carpenter, Mississippi which was located in the county of Copiah.<br /> <br /> In July of 1903, Catherine, along with one of her sons, her daughter Maggie Lipscomb, and Maggie’s husband, settled upon section 18 on the east half of the northeastern quarter west of the Choctaw Meridian. On July 20, 1903, Catherine Wiggins applied for Homestead entry with application number 38966.<br /> <br /> Catherine and her family went on to improve the land by adding a two room lumber house, kitchen, smokehouse, crib, stable, cotton house, orchard, and field and fencing. The value was estimated to be about $200.00.<br /> <br /> The home Catherine lived in was built in December of 1903, nearly six months after settling on the land. In January of 1904, Catherine moved into her home establishing residence, but more than two years later, on November 15, 1906, Catherine passed away never being able to see the completion of her application process.<br /> <br /> On July 22, 1908, Maggie Lipscomb, Catherine’s daughter, would file and sign with her own hand a Notice of Intention to Make Proof with the Department of the Interior in Jackson, Mississippi. She would re-file the same notice on September 5, 1908, and it would appear in the <i>Hazlehurst Courier</i>. The notice stated, “…Maggie Lipscomb for the heirs of Catherine Wiggins, deceased, Carpenter, Mississippi…has filed notice of intention to make final 5-year proof to establish claim to the land…” The article went on to list the four witnesses who supported her claim: James Ginane, a native-born Irishman, Frank Hunter, Ely Glenn, and Squire Moore.<br /> <br /> On November 8, 1909, President William H. Taft signed patent number 88149. Maggie had finally obtained the land patent for 79.3 acres on behalf of the heirs of her mother, Catherine Jefferson Wiggins.<br /> <br /> By 1910, Smith Wiggins, Catherine’s oldest son, was recorded on the census as being by occupation a gen farmer that owned his own farm and home that was under a mortgage. The Glenn family and Squire Moore and family were recorded as his neighbors which supports the fact that he was living on the land obtained by homestead patent. By 1920, Smith owned the home free and clear and was still farming cotton.<br /> <br /> Smith was an extremely talented person and was recorded as literate in 1900. He was known to be an excellent wood carver and basket weaver. Those talents he passed along to his children. In the 1930s, he enjoyed visits with his children and grandchildren, and they were amazed at how much money he had been able to save; not believing in banks, he kept his money stored in barrels around his home. When his family visited, he would tell them that he was being pressured by certain individuals to sell his land, but he never would even when some of the pressure became violent. Some family members urged him to sell it and not risk his life because of it, but Smith was unmoved. On February 26, 1939, tragedy struck. Smith Wiggins was burned to death in his home. His death certificate stated that he was “found to have died from burns by jury of inquest.” His family was deeply saddened but not shocked when a telegram arrived announcing his death.<b> </b><br /> ~ Contributed by Trenika Austin<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Woman with glasses, dark eyes and hair smiles\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7317552|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Trenika-Austin.jpg\" style=\"width:200px;\" title=\"Trenika Austin\" /><br /> Trenika Austin<br /> Photo Credit: T.

            "bodyText": "<p>Singleton Don McCormick was born on February 10, 1872 in Robeson County, North Carolina. His parents, who had been born enslaved, were Willie and Adeline “Cinderella” Page McCormick. Don was the middle child, the fourth of the McCormicks’ seven children listed on the 1880 U.S. Census for Thompson Township North Carolina.                 <br /> <br /> Sometime during the 1880s, his parents moved the family from North Carolina to Arkansas. Don’s niece, Bessie McCormick Price, gave an oral history passed down to her by her father (and Don’s youngest brother), Chalmers McCormick. Chalmers told her that when he was a little boy his father Willie was given a team of mules and a wagon, and told to head west, following the river trails.  <br /> <br /> This would have happened sometime between 1883 and 1891, when young Chalmers would have been aged four to twelve, and his big brother Don aged eleven to nineteen. Their parents were attracted by the work available in the area, and recruiters were actively seeking formerly enslaved individuals from southeastern slave states to move to Arkansas. In addition, The United States allowed blackpeople as well as white people to acquire land in former confederate states under the 1866 amendments to the Homestead Act of 1862. This was free land which was not available to them in eastern states like North Carolina. <br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Color painted portrait photo of adult black woman in a pink and floral design dress.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7340493|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Minnie-Lee-McCormickresize.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\" title=\"Minnie Lee McCormick\" /><br /> Minnie Lee (Wainwright) McCormick<br /> Photo Credit: Susan Lasley<br /> <br /> Minnie Lee Wainwright was born December 27, 1878, in Humboldt, Gibson County, Tennessee. Her father's name is unknown, but her mother was Amanda Cumbery. Minnie Lee's surname was changed after her mother married Sam Robinson in 1880.<br /> <br /> Don McCormick and Minnie Lee Robinson married February 7, 1897. By the time Don filed their final homestead proof application, they had the three children mentioned in the final proof—Willie, Amanda, and Nellie.<br /> <br /> Don and Minnie Lee almost lost their chance to own the land they had cultivated and worked for years in Dexter, Jefferson County, Arkansas. By March 1902, after eight years of effort, Don missed an important deadline for the final affidavit for an important reason: He was locked up in jail.               <br /> <br /> In a separate affidavit he filed  August 8, 1903 with the County Clerk of Jefferson County, Don stated that he could not make the final proof in time because between March and May 1902 he was confined to the Jefferson County Jail, “charged with unlawfully cutting State Land Timber” and therefore could not make his final proof before the county clerk. He further stated that he was eventually acquitted of the charge and released from jail.                <br /> <br /> Don went on to file the final proof in late May 1902. But about a week later, the Land Office at Little Rock, Arkansas, indicated that his proof was not received in time, with the reason given that Don “was in prison at the time.\" and under \"Duress.” The Land Office approved his application anyway, subject to confirmation by the Board “under Rule 33.” That approval was confirmed October 5, 1903.  <br /> <br /> According to his witnesses’ affidavits, Don settled his land in March 1894 and took residency a couple of months later, in May. He had filed his affidavit on March 7, 1894, then made his formal application, No. 19986, and paid a $13 application fee on March 10, 1894.  Four of his neighbors, Henry J. McEachern, Milton Hill, John Harris, and David Rose, had also traveled from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, settling in Jefferson County Arkansas during the Westward migration. McEachern and Hill would later witness on Don’s final proof. Another of the neighbors, David Rose (born around 1840 in Virginia) had already received his land patent in 1890.              <br /> <br /> The land staked for their claim was timber land. The witnesses said Don had cultivated three to seven acres over seven seasons. He built two “box houses” and a stable, with the total value of the improvements about $100-$150 in 1902 dollars. He filed his proof of publication as required, in the Pine Bluff Graphic, a weekly newspaper. The published ads appeared for six weeks, beginning April 9, 1902.   <br /> <br /> Don McCormick had been taught to read and write. Documents contained in his application file from the National Archives show his original signatures. The file also included a letter he wrote in his own hand to J. E. Bush, who in 1902 was the receiver at the Little Rock Land Office:<br /> <br /> “Dexter Ark. 5/29/1902<br /> Mr JE Bush Sir<br /> Inclosed Please find [-?-] fee & commission<br /> and I also send proof of Publication from The Editor of the Graphic<br /> Please accept it and please Let me hear from again if possible<br /> Please oblige.<br /> Don McCormick<br /> Dexter”<br /> <br /> The Land Office obliged. Through hard work, a suspicious arrest, incarceration, and a court trial, Don and Minnie Lee McCormick got their land, the land patent confirmed in certificate no. 10455. The patent was granted October 23, 1903, then issued October 26, 1903 for 120 acres of land in Jefferson County, Arkansas. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=AR3060__.287&docClass=STA&sid=3w03v01e.vvp\">Patent Details - BLM GLO Records</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Contributor: Susan Lasley</strong><br /> <br /> Susan Lasley is the great-granddaughter of Don and Minnie Lee McCormick, and the granddaughter of Amanda McCormick Lasley, who was one of Don and Minnie Lee’s three young children living on the land at the time the land patent was granted.

            "bodyText": "Matilda was born in Canada, and by the age of 11, her father had passed. Normally her mother, who was left to raise the family alone, would have endured serious hardship but not in Buxton, Kent, Canada. Buxton was the last stop of the Underground Railroad for runaway slaves from the states before the Civil War, and the settlement took good care of their own. All children went to school, and if there was an adult who wished to learn, they were welcome also. Widowed families were always cared for.<br /> <br /> Matilda, married by 1878, was off with her family to pursue homesteading in Nebraska. By 1880, Matilda was living in Dawson County, Nebraska with her husband Richard, age 28, their two children Florence, age 3, and Lawrence, age 2, Matilda’s younger brother, Leroy Gields, and their mother Nancy. By 1883, the relationship between Matilda and her husband had deteriorated to the point that Richard packed his bags and headed back to Canada with their son and did not contribute to the family needs. She was not left without support though. Her brothers and their families also lived nearby, and Matilda was not to be out done. On February 18, 1883, she traveled to the land office in Grand Island and applied for 160 acres of land under the Homestead Act of 1862. Matilda paid $18 in filing fees and received application #17530.<br /> <br /> October 10, 1883, Matilda signed a Declaration of Intention to renounce her citizenship to the Queen Victoria of Great Britain and obtained her citizenship of United States. She was able to erect a sod frame house 38x14, frame stable 16x12, frame corncrib 8x17, chicken house 8x10, sod cellar, frame pig pens- hog pasture1/4 acre and stock pasture, 12 acres of 2 wire fence, well 105 feet deep, and 48 acres of cultivated land all totally value of $248. By 1885, Matilda was divorced, and by 1893, Matilda received her citizenship papers. She was then granted her patent #9886 on July 31, 1893, over 10 years later.<br /> <br /> Matilda was an active member of the DeWitty settlement and believed in education. She was highly respected in both DeWitty and the white settlement of Brownlee. So much so she was only the second Black person buried in the Brownlee Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Matilda’s young daughter Florence married Charles E. Meehan in 1898 with James L. Hatter and Miss Anna Meehan as the witnesses. Florence, as an heir to her mother’s original 160-acre claim, went on to claim an additional 480 acres of grazing land in Cherry County, Nebraska. The Kinkaid Act of 1904 allowed for the extra acres of grazing land to be added in the state of Nebraska. The patent, #02795, was issued on April 4, 1912, under Matilda’s name.<br /> <br /> Contributor: Joyceann Gray, SSG USA RET<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Headshot of black woman with shoulder length grey hair and glasses\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7108514|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Joyceann2018.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\" title=\"Joyceann Gray\" /><br /> Joyceanne Gray<br /> Photo Credit: J.

            "bodyText": "John Denny enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1867 in Elmira, New York and served with C Troop of the Ninth Cavalry in the western plains.  Late in 1879, Denny was serving as acting Sergeant of B Troop, Ninth Cavalry while they meandered their way through the arid lands of New Mexico in search of Apache Indians who left their reservations. <br /> <br /> While on patrol, Denny’s troop unknowingly rode into an ambush staged by the Apache they were pursuing. A fierce firefight ensued, and casualties began to mount. One of those causalities, Private A. Freeland was laying incapacitated in an open area of the battlefield, exposed to enemy fire. Upon witnessing this, Denny raced out to Freeland and picked him up and carried him to safety while taking fire from the enemy. Miraculously, Freeland lived to fight another day, thanks to the selfless actions of his fellow trooper, Sergeant John Denny.<br /> <br /> For reasons unknown, Denny would not receive any award or citation for his bravery in the immediate years that followed. Twelve years later, with Denny’s former commanding officer attesting and other troopers vouching, Denny received the Medal of Honor in 1891. Perhaps it was the legendary tale of Denny’s actions that allowed his story to live on for twelve years, or possibly that the paperwork finally had made its way through the rank and file in Washington? His Medal of Honor citation reads as follows: \"Removed a wounded comrade, under a heavy fire, to a place of safety.\"<br /> <br /> John Denny retired from Army service in 1897 at the rank of Corporal. He was promoted to Sergeant on a few occasions, only to be busted down in rank as a result of unruly behavior for fighting and brawling. Nonetheless, his battlefield actions were never lessened by these unfortunate circumstances. After 30 years of service in the U.S. Army, Denny retired in Nebraska. He received a small pension and supplemented it with a job at Fort Robinson. He lived there until 1899 when he took ill and had to relocate to the U.S. Soldiers’ Home in Washington D.C. His health continued to deteriorate and on November 28th, 1901, John Denny passed away.<br /> <br /> Sgt. John Denny is buried along with other military veterans at the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery in Washington D.C.",

            "bodyText": "<p>On November 13, 1900, Harriet Branum Johnson gave notice that she intended to prove up her homestead at the Guthrie, Oklahoma Land Office where her husband George W. Johnson had applied in 1893. More than seven years had passed during which the family made the necessary land improvements and became part of a tight-knit community of homesteaders. When George died unexpectedly on September 14, 1897, it was up to Harriet and her children to finish proving his claim number 12130 or lose the land and the improvements they had already made.<br /> <br /> George Johnson and Harriet Branum were married in the spring of 1876 in Obion County, Tennessee. Likely born enslaved about 1854 in Virginia, George Johnson was also known as Manuel. Very little is known about his early life and how he came to live in Tennessee. Harriet Branum was born into enslavement on October 12, 1853 in Weakley County, Tennessee. According to family oral history, as told by her daughter Daisy Mae Johnson Armstrong, Harriet was the child of her mother’s enslaver as were her mother and grandmother before her. The Johnsons made their home in Woodland Mills Township near the Tennessee - Kentucky state line. By 1880, they had welcomed four children, Sara, Laura, Georgia, and Henry. George’s sister Jennie Bransford DeHoney lived nearby, one of at least fourteen children in the large, blended family of Robert Bransford.<br /> <br /> Obion County, Tennessee held little financial opportunity for African Americans and, particularly in the northwest corner of the state, there existed a constant threat of violence. Though there is no evidence to date that the families were directly affected, skirmishes between Whites and Blacks and the burning of an all-Black community in the county in the years after the Civil War indicate an ominous racial tension. Faced with these circumstances and perhaps to take some control over their futures, two couples, George’s sister Jennie Bransford with her husband Willis DeHoney and Wesley Bransford with wife Jane Ligon, moved to Barry County, Missouri sometime between 1880 and 1884. Shortly afterward, George and Harriet Johnson joined them in Missouri where the two youngest of their children were born.<br /> <br /> While they were the last of the three couples to arrive in Missouri, the Johnsons were the first of them to move farther west to claim a portion of unassigned lands in Oklahoma Territory in October 1893. By that time, the best of the land tracts for agriculture had been claimed. In fact, three other homesteaders had made entry on the same 162 acres of sandstone hills and had canceled or relinquished their claims between September 1889 and fall of 1893 when the Johnsons settled on it. According to family lore, at least three of the older children supported the family by working off the farm. Georgia is said to have done domestic work in a nearby town while Henry and Andrew worked on farms in the area. Their contributions would have been used for food and supplies to make the necessary land improvements. Without their support, it may have been impossible to sustain a farm on this particular land.<br /> <br /> As his widow, Harriet Branham Johnson proved up George’s homestead claim on January 11, 1901. Neighbors and fellow Black homesteaders William Hardiman and Charles Morris provided their testimonies. The Johnsons had built a hen house and a corn crib, fenced in a pasture, and cultivated 40 acres and an orchard. They had also constructed an addition to the house left on the property by a previous homesteader. Harriet Johnson’s land patent number 4714 was issued on December 30, 1901.<br /> <br /> Back in Barry County, Missouri, the Pierce City Lynching in August of 1901 resulted in the exodus of all its Black residents. According to one newspaper account, there were no Black citizens left in the county after Willis DeHoney, husband to Jennie Bransford, sold their farm a month after the bloody events and moved away. It is unclear whether they moved directly to Oklahoma, but in February 1905 they were living in Logan County, Oklahoma, not far from the Johnson family homestead. Also in Barry County, Missouri, Wesley Bransford died between 1897 and 1900 leaving his widow Jane to raise their six children who were still at home. By 1906, Jane Bransford’s household had also moved to Logan County, Oklahoma, where the three couples’ families were together again.<br /> <br /> Several Johnson children married the sons and daughters of other homesteaders in the area, including the children of three of the four witnesses who had agreed to testify to their land improvements. A group of children of area homesteaders, including sons Andrew and Henry Johnson and their spouses, moved to Los Angeles, California in the 1910s. Daisy Mae Johnson married J.T. Armstrong who became a prosperous merchant in the railroad town of Luther, Oklahoma. And with a nod to the strength and bravery of their parents, aunts, and uncles, Edward, John, and Mollie Bransford, children of Wesley and Jane, became homesteaders in Alberta, Canada.</p> <p><strong>~ Contributed by Erika Lusco</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Erika Lusco\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7338564|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Erikiita-3.jpg\" style=\"width:200px;\" title=\"Erika Lusco\" /><br /> Erika Lusco<br /> Photo Credit: E.

His mother traveled for work so Hughes spent most of his childhood in Lawrence, Kansas where he was raised by his grandmother.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ee0ab14b-a281-4cf7-9de6-807de1726d7f}{191}\" paraid=\"1518642073\">His grandmother provided Hughes with stories and books which opened the world of literature to the young Hughes. Books became a place where he could find refuge in his childhood. After his grandmother’s death, he returned to his mother in Lincoln, Illinois and eventually graduated high school from Central High School in Cleveland, Ohio where he was awarded class poet and editor of the yearbook.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ee0ab14b-a281-4cf7-9de6-807de1726d7f}{207}\" paraid=\"937851521\">After high school, he attended Columbia University in New York, but he left after spending a year there. He did not enjoy his experiences at Columbia, but he loved the community he found in Harlem, New York. His poetry was first published in the NAACP magazine <em>The Crisis</em> during this time, which gave him some national attention. Afterwards, he traveled to Africa and Europe as a crewmember aboard the boat <em>SS Malone</em>. He stayed in Europe for some time but eventually moved back to the US and published his first book <em>The Weary Blues</em> in 1926. A few years later, Hughes graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and returned to New York to pursue his career as a writer.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c67f4ab2-f7c9-4231-976c-a195c2b33a94}{32}\" paraid=\"1666262133\">He went on to write poetry, plays, novels, and newspaper columns where his name became a fixture of the Harlem Renaissance, which celebrated African American culture and achievement. Hughes claimed that the people he met in his everyday life were the influences of his work, but blues and jazz were the rhythm of his work. This is evident in his poetry where he mentions everyday people in his community along with the poetic rhythms of jazz and blues.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c67f4ab2-f7c9-4231-976c-a195c2b33a94}{62}\" paraid=\"343549670\">Hughes died on May 22, 1967 but his legacy lives on in his collection of literary works.</p>",

Hartsuff.<br /> -General Orders No. 103, April 27, 1863</em></h4> <br /> George L. Hartsuff was a career army officer who rose to the rank of major general of volunteers during the Civil War. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1852, graduating 19th out of 43 in his class, and was assigned duty with the 4th US Infantry. Hartsuff first saw action as a young artillerist during the Seminole Wars in 1855, where he received two severe wounds. <br /> <br /> At the outbreak of the Civil War, Harstuff served on the staff of General William S. Rosecrans in Western Virginia before being promoted to brigadier general on April 15, 1862. He saw action at the Battle of Cedar Mountain, the Battle of Second Bull Run [Manassas], and the Battle of Antietam, where he recevied a suffered a serious wound to his hip. After a long recovery, Harstuff was promoted to major general on November 29, 1862 and sent west to serve in the Department of the Ohio.<br /> <br /> He was assigned command of the newly organized Twenty-third Corps on April 27, 1863 as part of Major General Ambrose E. Burnside's Army of the Ohio. Harstuff made his headquarters at the Oliver Perry House [White House] at Camp Nelson prior to the start of the East Tennessee Campaign in August 1863. The Twenty-third Corps spearheaded the army's advance into Tennessee, culminating with the successful liberation of Knoxville on September 3rd. Suffering from his wounds, Hartsuff was relieved of command in November 1863. He returned to the army in March 1865 and participated in the final campaigns around Petersburg, Virginia.<br /> <br /> Following the war, Hartsuff reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and served in various post during Reconstruction. On June 29, 1871, Hartsuff was retired with the rank of major general \"for disability from wounds received in battle.\" General Hartsuff died of his wounds three years later at the age of 43 and was interred at West Point Cemetery. <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Charity Adams was born on December 5, 1918, in Kittrell, North Carolina. She grew up in Columbia, South Carolina, the oldest of four children. Her parents believed strongly in a good education. Adams graduated valedictorian of her high school at the age of 16 in 1934 with perfect school attendance. She won many scholarships to colleges and chose to attend Wilberforce University in Ohio.<br /> <br /> Founded in 1856, Wilberforce University was named for the great 18th-century abolitionist, William Wilberforce. It is the nation’s oldest private, historically Black university owned and operated by African Americans. Throughout its 163-year history, Wilberforce University has demonstrated a formidable spirit of resilience and triumph and has never wavered from its sacred duty to educate and enrich its students.<br /> <br /> Adams graduated from Wilberforce in 1938. She majored in physics, mathematics, and Latin with a minor in history. After graduating, she returned to South Carolina to teach. She taught junior high school math and science from 1938 to 1942. During her summer breaks, she attended graduate school at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.<br /> <br /> After entering World War II, the United States moved to expand its military capacity. In the spring of 1942, the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC), later known as the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) was formed. Adams was accepted into the WAAC in July 1942. She was a member of the first African American Officer Candidate School at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. She graduated first in her class and was commissioned a second lieutenant on August 29, 1942. Upon commissioning, Adams was the first African American woman to be an officer in the WAAC. She remained at Fort Des Moines until 1944, holding numerous positions including staff training officer, station control officer, and company commander. During that time, she was promoted to major. This promotion made her the highest-ranking female officer at the training center.<br /> <br /> On July 3, 1943, the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) was renamed the Women’s Army Corps (WAC). All the women who were in the WAAC were given the opportunity to transfer to the WAC or return to civilian life. A majority of WAACs, including Charity Adams, chose to transfer to the WAC. About 25 percent decided to return to civilian life.<br /> <br /> At the end of 1944, Adams was chosen to command the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. The 6888th, known as the Six Triple Eight, was the only African American WAC unit to go overseas during the war. Their mission was to sort, organize, and direct mail to U.S. servicemen. <br /> <br /> On February 3, 1945, the first group of women from the 6888th sailed to Great Britain. The voyage took 11 days, during which they survived close encounters with Nazi U-Boats. They arrived in Glasgow, Scotland, on February 14, 1945. The 6888th was then stationed in Birmingham, England, where they discovered warehouses full of undelivered mail. The unit worked in three shifts around the clock seven days a week to clear the backlog. They adopted the phrase, “No Mail, Low Morale”—mail was the only connection the men fighting on the front lines had with friends and family back home. Before the 6888th, mail delivery was intermittent at best. The morale of the soldiers was waning because they had no connections outside the military.<br /> <br /> The women developed a new system of organizing and tracking mail. The system required tracking individual servicemembers by maintaining about seven million information cards. The cards included serial numbers to distinguish different individuals with the same name. They also tried to deliver mail with insufficient information through this system. The hardest part for the unit was returning mail when it was addressed to a servicemember who died. Yet, thanks to their system, they were able to process approximately 195,000 pieces of mail per day. The U.S. Army thought it would take the 6888th six months to clear the mail backlog in Birmingham. The 6888th cleared the back log in three months.<br /> <br /> On June 9, 1945, Adams and the rest of the 6888th were transferred to Rouen, France. They were there to clear another mail backlog. In France, the Six Triple Eight worked alongside French civilians and German prisoners of war. On December 26, 1945, Adams was promoted to lieutenant colonel, the highest rank within the WAC.<br /> <br /> In February 1946 most members of the Six Triple Eight were discharged from the WAC at Fort Dix in New Jersey. A month later, Adams was honorably discharged from the Women’s Auxiliary Corps. After her discharge, she picked back up where she left off in her studies at Ohio State. She graduated with a master’s degree in psychology in 1946. She then moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where she worked with the Veterans Administration as a register officer. She reviewed veterans’ applications for educational funding under the G.I. Bill. She subsequently worked at various colleges in a number of academic roles.<br /> <br /> On August 24, 1949, Charity Adams married Stanley A. Earley, Jr. The couple met while attending Wilberforce University together. They moved to Zurich, Switzerland, while Earley completed his medical training. They returned to the United States in 1952 and settled in Dayton, Ohio. <br /> <br /> Charity Earley devoted much of her post-Army life to her family and community. She served on the board of directors of Dayton Power and Light, the Dayton Metro Housing Authority, and the Dayton Opera Company; the board of governors of the American Red Cross; and the board of trustees of Sinclair Community College. She volunteered for the United Way, the United Negro College Fund, the Urban League, and the YWCA. She was the founder of the Black Leadership Development Program (BLDP) in Dayton in 1982, which provides community leadership training for African Americans. <br /> <br /> Charity Adams Earley died on January 13, 2002, at the age of 83 in Dayton. She was buried in Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum, Section 308, Lot 326, Grave B.",

For 43 careful years she watched the rough frontier city blossom to a Duneland metropolis; she fearlessly maintained the harbor beacon as lighthouse keeper while enduring the ensuing hardships with her lifelong companion Ann Hartwell. </h3> <h4>Quote by her:</h4> <p>“It is fearful to hear the groaning storm for hours before it breaks upon us–its groans, its mysterious booming sounds, its howls and its wild, demonical shriek. It is then that I am in the light-house and keep my lamps trimmed, for then the poor wretches that are tossed about on the angry waves and are at their wits’ end most do need the faithful discharge of my duties.”</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“There were times when she was ill. There were nights when the groaning, wind driven seas lashed over the long pier that led to the harbor beacon. But she never failed.”</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Harriet Colfax was born on December 3rd, 1824 in Ogdensburgh, New York; a village along the St. Lawrence River that was incorporated in 1817. As a young woman, Harriet taught piano and voice lessons. She became friends with Ann Hartwell in Ogdensburgh; Ann was a young teacher who would remain her lifelong companion. Over 600 miles to the west, the idea of Indiana’s first harbor town was realized when Michigan City was incorporated in 1836. Two years later, it’s first light was shown at the harbor; a 39 foot brick tower and separate quarters for a lighthouse keeper were authorized by the United States Congress.<br /> <br /> In 1853, Harriet decided to move to the young city on Lake Michigan with her brother, who started a local newspaper business where Harriet helped typeset. Ann followed shortly after in 1854. In 1856, Harriet’s brother suddenly died of tuberculosis at age 26. Despite this early tragedy, Harriet enjoyed the freedom of the frontier and remained living in the growing harbor city. Around this same time, Ms. Colfax and Ms. Hartwell moved in together. By 1858, Ann was a teacher for the public school system and Harriet taught music lessons. The same year, the Michigan City lighthouse was rebuilt larger in 1858 to protect its bustling harbor. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“This time, instead of constructing a separate tower and dwelling, a short, square, wooden tower was built atop the northern end of a new, seven-room, one-and-a-half-story dwelling. The foundation of the structure was built of Joliet stone, while Milwaukee cream city brick was used for the upper portion. The tower’s lantern room had nine sides, two of which were blind, and housed a new, fifth-order, L. Sautter & Cie. Fresnel lens that produced a fixed white light at a focal plane of fifty-two feet.”</p> <p><br /> Today, it is one of the oldest lighthouse standing on the shores of Lake Michigan and houses the Old Lighthouse Museum.<br /> <br /> In 1861, Harriet was appointed to the federal position of lighthouse keeper at Michigan City. Newspaper reporters that told her story for decades assumed she achieved this with the influence of her legislator cousin and future Vice President, Schuyler Colfax Jr.. Harriet and Ann moved into the lighthouse together when she assumed her role. That same year, when men left Michigan City for the Civil War, the citizens presented the American flag and Ms. Hartwell gave an encouraging speech to the Union soldiers before they marched away. Four years later when President Abraham Lincoln’s funeral train made an impromptu stop in Michigan City, Ms. Colfax assembled local schoolgirls to sing hymns and present a flowered cross wreath on the casket of President Lincoln. <br /> <br /> In 1871, the city extended the harbor’s “east pier,” and built an elevated walk and wooden tower with an additional light that required lighting at the end of the 1,500 ft structure. In the first half of her service, Harriet was provided with lard oil for the lamps that she would have to heat to light her beacons. The lard would occasionally re-harden before she could get to her destination, necessitating a re-melt. She used this method until around 1882, when lard oil was replaced with kerosene.<br /> <br /> In 1872, Harriet recorded a dangerous storm on the lake, “Gale perfectly fearful by nightfall. Waves dashed over the top of the beacon. Reached the beacon at imminent risk tonight as the waves ran over the elevated walk. Watched both lights with closest attention all night.” That year she was noted as making a salary of $520 which is around $11,800 in 2022 with inflation. The next spring she encountered another treacherous gale, “A terrible hurricane to-night at about the time of lighting up. Narrowly escaped being swept into the lake.” In 1874, the city transferred the elevated walk and pierhead light to the longer “‘west pier.” The west pier extended five hundred feet further into the lake, and required Harriet to row across Trail Creek in a small boat to reach it.<br /> <br /> In 1881 a reporter visited and gave a detailed account of Harriet and Ann at the lighthouse:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“I knocked on the door and was invited by a cheery voice to ‘come in.’ … I walked leisurely into the hall, and was met by a lady with a bright, intellectual face, and dressed in a spotted muslin freshly goffered and laundered. She invited me into the parlor, where I announced myself as ‘Pan handle,’ of the Courier-Journal, and begged leave to pay my respects to Miss Harriet E. Colfax, the keeper of the lighthouse. <br /> <br /> The lady said Miss Colfax would be down in a moment, and, while waiting her coming, I engaged in a pleasant conversation with the lady who had received me. She was agreeable, affable and highly intellectual, bright and sparkling, and as thoroughly au fait in conversational tactics as any lady born and raised amid courts and courtiers. <br /> <br /> This was Miss Ann Hartwell, the friend and confidante of Miss Colfax. For over twenty-five years these ladies have dwelt together alone in the same house, under the same roof, have sat at the same ingleside, have eaten at the same table, have drawn comfort and consolation from the same Christian fount, have wept each other’s tears, shared each other’s joys…<br /> <br /> In a few minutes Miss Hattie Colfax made her appearance, dressed in the same faultless attire, hair cut short, without bangs, frizzes or montagues. She was dignified and stately as a queen, while her more loquacious maid of honor was the very embodiment of wit and pleasantry. As the two ladies stood before me I felt that I had never seen before two so remarkable specimens of matchless neatness, intellectual dignity and refined cultivation, buried all alone in that Lighthouse on the Point.<br /> <br /> They were politely communicative, and Miss Colfax said: <br /> <br /> ‘I was appointed by Mr. Lincoln soon after his inauguration, to the position of lighthouse keeper at this place… For over twenty-five years my friend Miss Hartwell and I have lived together, and for twenty years have lived in this house. My duties are to keep the lights burning all the year round until navigation is closed by the ice. I light them after sunset, every day and extinguish them after daylight.”</p> <p><br /> Harriet highlighted some of the hardships the tumultuous lake produced:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“…I have witness many a fearful storm from the dome above us, when the winds blew great guns and dashed the water and the foaming waves over the breakwater, and sometimes for fifty feet up the sand dunes… It is fearful to hear the groaning storm for hours before it breaks upon us–its groans, its mysterious booming sounds, its howls and its wild, demonical shriek. It is then that I am in the light-house and keep my lamps trimmed, for then the poor wretches that are tossed about on the angry waves and are at their wits’ end most do need the faithful discharge of my duties.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…I have seen poor men drowned right before my eyes… powerless to help them.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… I have witnessed many wrecks, and have seen the ships break to pieces on the beach or on the breakwater. But the saddest of all is to see a lone, helpless fellow-being clinging to the rigging and holding out his hands miles away to his friends on shore for relief.’”</p> <p><br /> In 1883, Ann retired from school after teaching the youth of the growing coastal city for a quarter century. She opened a newsstand book exchange in downtown Michigan City that became the first lending library in the area. In 1886, a frightful storm swept the west pier’s beacon light into the lake: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“It was a stormy night towards the end of 1886 that Miss Colfax made her last trip to the beacon light. With her pail of heated oil in one hand and her lantern in the other she sallied forth into one of the most tumultuous storms that ever raged along the coast of Lake Michigan. The sleet stung her face, the furious wind drove the spray of the seas and the sand of the dunes pelting against her, and the darkness of the tempest fell so suddenly that she could hardly find the wave washed end of the pier. But she gained it, grasped the handrail, and, with head bent, struggled forward to the beacon tower.<br /> <br /> The waves dashed over and smote against the piling and woodwork of the pier till the timbers groaned and the frail woman could scarcely keep her footing. She fought her way along, gained the stairway, and in the shelter of the tower top filled the great lamp and lighted it. Then she came down, drenched to the skin, chilled to the bone, and for the first time, scared almost to fainting. The tornado had increased in fury, the slender stairway quaked beneath her, the tower wavered, and the noise of the wind and water was like the rending of a thousand sails. She had hardly gained the mainland when there was a grinding crash. She looked back in terror to see the great beacon, like some big meteor, whirl in an arc through the livid night and fall hissing into the lake.<br /> <br /> All night she watched the tower above her own house praying that no ships would venture in, or that the main light, which she kept burning more brightly than ever, might guide them past the wreck of the beacon pier. And in the morning when daylight came, and she had snuffed the harbor light, she went down to the pier to see the ruin which the storm had wrought. The beacon tower was gone, half of the long pier had been dismantled, and the shore was strewn with the wreckage of a structure that had withstood the storms of fifteen years.<br /> <br /> ‘I have seen many storms,’ said Miss Colfax the other day, ‘but never one like that. I was sorry to lose the old beacon, in spite of all the trouble and danger it brought me, for I was getting fond of it, and it was a great help to the sailors who didn't know the old harbor entrance.’”</p> <p><br /> Newspaper records reveal that Ms. Colfax and Ms. Hartwell made a number of visits to Ann’s niece and nephew-in-law in South Bend 1889-1899. One article in 1894 referred to the loving pair as the niece’s “aunts.” In 1890, a string of articles calling her “The Sailors’ Friend” and “brave-hearted little woman” appeared all over the country. The article recounted one harrowing evening where Harriet braved the weather to light the pierhead beacon: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“On one very cold, stormy night when the waves dashed incessantly over the raised walk and it was only by waiting for the temporary lull that the passage could be made. Miss Colfax warmed the lard oil and started forth on her marvelous errand. Twice she was driven back before she gained the beacon, and when at last she reached the structure she found to her dismay and annoyance that the lock had been tampered with and obstinately refused to open. In her desperation she finally broke a pane of glass, and crawling through the aperture, inserted the lamp in place, but so much time had been lost that the oil congealed and all attempts at ignition proved futile. But the beacon had to be lighted and the woman never for one moment flinched. Lamp in hand, she started back to the lighthouse though an icy shower, slipped, fell, rose and slipped again, but at length reached the end of the pier in safety. The oil was again heated and again she started out for the beacon, this time accomplishing her task but returning with a bruised body and thoroughly soaked condition. Men said who knew of this performance that no amount of money would have tempted them to make the journey the second time as she did…”</p> <p><br /> In 1893, an article offered a perspective of other dangers Ms. Colfax experienced: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Only one instance of cowardly insult has Miss Colfax experienced and this, too, occurred on the way to the beacon light one night in November, when two men stood in the center of the deserted walk and barred her progress. To her mild but firm request to pass they paid no attention, and in attempting to forcibly pass them she found herself a prisoner. Still fearless and determined the little woman gave one of the ruffians an unexpected push, darted past him, and set her lamp in its place, instead of returning to the house, as she might have been pardoned for doing under the circumstances. As she retraced her way she found her passage opposed again, and thoroughly frightened she was about to scream for help, when a boat engineer came to her rescue.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">A still more thrilling experience she relates of encountering an escaped lunatic on the pier one evening, who insisted upon accompanying her inside the structure. Fortunately, she was unconscious of the man’s condition but refused his request, as it was strictly against the rules of the department. He followed her and attempted to crowd through the narrow doorway, but, summoning all her fortitude, she looked him fearlessly in the face and ordered him decidedly to stay outside. He heeded the authority in her tone for an instant, and in the interval she slipped inside and locked the door. Two keepers soon relieved her of her unwelcome guest without further trouble…”</p> <p><br /> Towering sandhills and scattered vegetation lined the coast. Just across Trail Creek stood what was once Indiana’s tallest dune, Hoosier Slide- a two-hundred foot heap of golden sand. While it cannot be confirmed that Ann and Harriet ever climbed Hoosier Slide, they doubtlessly knew of the famous dune that attracted curious onlookers to its crest. Harriet was noted in naturalist journals for some of her bird observations on the lake in the winter of 1883-1884.<br /> <br /> A traumatic experience occurred in 1895 when Harriet was run down by the drunk driver of a horse-drawn cart. Although she suffered bruises across her body, she was miraculously left without life-threatening injury from the cart’s wheels or horses’ trampling feet. That same year, a string of articles spread around the country that told of her position as lighthouse keeper that stated, “It is fair to say she is a Western woman.” In 1897, an even wider geographic spread of articles highlighted her and other women with unconventional careers entitled “Women All Over the World Taking Up Men’s Work.”<br /> <br /> Since the pierhead light was added in 1871, Harriet gained an assistant keeper to help tend the lighthouse. Over the decades, the role was filled by five different people, two women and three men. The census in 1900 recorded that Harriet was “head” of the household while Ann was noted as her “partner;” it also noted that a 28 year-old Polish servant was living with them. Two years later an article revealed that “Ann and Tat,” as they were affectionately called, had exchanged engagement rings nearly half a century prior and had been wearing them ever since. The article states, “Both women are exceedingly reserved as to how they came to join their lives, but those who are near to them tell of the romantic tie that seems to have bound them together for all time.” While some articles circulated speculative ideas to give reasoning for their union, the pair themselves never hinted at having failed engagements. The women were also noted for putting their earnings into a common fund.<br /> <br /> In 1904, after 43 years as lighthouse attendant, Harriet was forced into retirement with the decision to modernize and electrify the old lighthouse. That fall, an extensive article was written that highlighted Harriet’s determination, changing times, and her reluctance to speak on her romantic life:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“There were times when she was ill. There were nights when the groaning, wind driven seas lashed over the long pier that led to the harbor beacon. But she never failed. Drenched with icy spray, almost blown from the slippery footing, groping her way from the lighthouse to the beacon, across the wind swept sand dunes, floundering, tired with the burden of her big lamp, chilled with the blasts of belated spring or early winter, she never failed to keep the beacon bright and constant, never permitted the terrors of the storm or the fears of her womanly heart to deter her for a moment.<br /> <br /> …And then, if you will listen, she will tell you long forgotten tales of shipwrecks on the Indiana coast. Of storms that almost blew her into the lake; of castaways and rescues; of bold sailors who brought her presents in the days of her youth, and of how some famous captain praised the brightness of her light and the fidelity with which it always ‘showed.’ But of the romance of her own calm life, if there was one, she will say nothing. The town gossips say that ever so many years ago, when little Harriet Colfax was the prettiest schoolma'am in Michigan City, there was a–<br /> <br /> But Miss Colfax doesn't like this kind of gossip about herself, and if you ask her she will change the subject.<br /> <br /> ‘What a dreadful noise the carpenters are making,’ she will suggest. ‘I suppose it is necessary, though. The place was good enough and I'm not fond of changes.’”</p> <p><br /> The article also provided further insight into Ann and Tat’s companionship:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“In the house of Miss Colfax, her confidante and companion of seventy years, lives Miss Ann Hartwell, a tiny, slim, blue eyed woman with curly gray hair, infinitely gentle, and like her aged comrade in many ways. Passing the four score milestone together, these two quaint, lovable spinsters have been bosom friends since the days of their childhood in Ogdensburg, N.Y. Miss Hartwell was a pioneer school teacher of northern Indiana, she taught three generations of its people, and when old age and failing health brought an end to her work she went to the lighthouse to pass away her final years with ‘Harriet.’ Here they lived for many years, clinging to the old fashioned habits and methods of half a century ago.<br /> <br /> Winter and summer on Sunday mornings these two slow going, weary but dainty ladies can be seen wending away to church, arm in arm, dressed like the fashion plates of the ante-bellum days, smiling upon middle aged men and women who were their pupils forty years or more ago, cheering one another with gossip of the romances of the far time when they were themselves belles of the same town in which they are now ending their peaceful lives. There is something almost childlike in the tenderness with which the two cronies love one another.<br /> <br /> ‘We have never quarreled, Harriet and I,’ Miss Ann will say.<br /> <br /> ‘And we never will, Ann,’ Miss Colfax will answer, taking the other's small, thin hand in hers. ‘Never! That is, unless you again insist on tending my light. That's one thing you or anyone else shall never do while I am lighthouse keeper.’<br /> <br /> And then the queer, guileless pair will laugh right heartily, smiling in each other's faces as though it were a merry topic.”<br />  </p> <p>The lighthouse that stood since 1858 was remodeled and enlarged to house three keepers, now responsible for three lights and a fog signal. The head keeper had four rooms on the east side of the building and the two assistant keepers were given three rooms on the west side; with an entrance for both. The lantern room was no longer necessary, and it was removed from the structure. Harriet spoke of the passion she had for her work just before her retirement:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“The lard oil would get hard before I could get the lamp lighted, but once lit it never went out, you may be sure.  My lights never went out till I quenched them myself. . . I love the lamps, the old lighthouse, and the work. They are the habit, the home, everything dear I have known for so long. I could not bear to see anyone else light my lamp. I would rather die here than live elsewhere.”</p> <p><br /> She proceeded to light the lamp for the reporter just days before it would be her last: “‘It is time,’ she said, lighting up the lamp and smiling a happy smile. In an instant the tiny, glass covered cage was flooded with a fierce light.”<br /> <br /> Ms. Colfax retired on October 14, 1904 at eighty years old- and just six days before the light she had faithfully kept for over four decades was extinguished for the final time. She wrote in her logbook October 8, “Sold household effects preparatory to vacating the dear old lighthouse.” Four days later she made her last entry, “Fair, warm wind, smokey atmosphere. Received another call from Mr. Armstrong, my successor.” Keeper Armstrong recorded in his logbook October 13, “The retiring keeper left the station this 4 p.m. and all her personal effects.”<br /> <br /> By October 31st, the pair were moved into their new home and Ann’s mental health had substantially declined. Ann died about 3 months after moving on January 27th, 1905 at age 77. The Michigan City Dispatch wrote of her:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Deceased was a devoted member of the Episcopal church with which she labored faithfully and incessantly from childhood. She was a woman of superior intelligence and activity, and was constantly identified in the church and social events of the city for the leadership in which she was ever in demand. Honorable, consistent and actuated always by the highest motives she won and held the admiration of her friends. Hers was a useful, well-spent life and all who came in touch with her could not but feel the influences of her excellent character, her bright, genial disposition. The world is better for her having lived.<br /> <br /> In her early life, in Ogdensburg, she formed warm attachments for a girl friend, Miss Harriet E. Colfax, which attachments grew to a sisterly love. Miss Colfax came to Michigan City in 1853 and when Miss Hartwell came in 1854, the friendship which began in Ogdensburg was continued and the two women became inseparable life companions.”</p> <p><br /> On March 25th, Harriet completed her last will and testament with instructions to leave money and possessions for her family and her church. One paper reported she “left a goodly part of $50,000 to the Michigan City diocese of the Episocopol church endowment fund.” Harriet died shortly after Ann on April 17th, 1905 at age 81. Articles that carried her death notice called her the “Heroine of Light.” Harriet’s last observation would foreshadow the accelerated industrialization that predated a shifting attitude in conservation of natural resources. Harriet would have witnessed the deforestation of the region due to extensive harvesting and processing. She would have begun to see the decline of the once great Hoosier Slide, which would be reduced from 200 feet tall to nothing in the two decades following her death.<br />  </p> <p>But Harriet and Ann also influenced and inspired the future generation that would help rise to support and protect the Indiana Dunes. Ann and Tat are buried side-by-side in Greenwood Cemetery, Michigan City. The Old Lighthouse Museum has had a replica lantern room-reinstalled, and the site is a wonderful place to connect to Harriet and Ann’s lives.</p> <h3>Bibliography</h3> May 5, 1905; The Buffalo Inquirer, Buffalo New York<br />  “The Heroine of the Light” ; Page 5<br /> <br /> August 11, 1881; The Courier Journal, Louisville, KY<br />  “Michigan City” ; Page 6<br /> <br /> October 2, 1904; Chicago Tribune, Chicago, IL<br /> “A Fragile Woman of 80 Years is Uncle Sam’s Oldest and Most Reliable Lighthouse Keeper” ; Page 64<br /> <br /> January 14 1895; The Indianapolis Journal, Indianapolis IN <br />  “Harriet Colfax, Lighthouse Keeper.” ; Page 4  <br /> <br /> October 15 1890; The New Era, Humestown, Iowa <br />  “The Sailor’s Friend” ; Page 7<br /> <br /> October 11, 1904; South Bend Tribune, South Bend, IN<br />  “Leaves Old Lighthouse” ; Page 2<br /> <br /> January 25 1895; South Bend Tribune, South Bend, IN <br />  “Colfax, Lighthouse Keeper” ; Page 6<br /> <br /> May 3, 1865; Chicago Tribune, Chicago, IL <br />  “A Cross of Solid Flowers” ; Page 2<br /> <br /> May 16, 1872; The Clinton Public, Clinton, IL<br />  “Personal and Literary” ; Page 6  <br />  <br /> September 8 1893 The Londonberry Sifter, Londonderry, Vermont <br />  “Girl Keepers of the Light” ; Page 2  <br /> <br /> Newspapers.com search 1897<br />  “The New Woman In Earnest” ; Logansport Pharos-Tribune; Logansport Indiana; Page 22<br /> <br /> December 18 1902 ; Crestline Advocate, Crestline, Ohio<br />  “Bond of Two Women.” ; Page 2<br /> <br /> October 31, 1904; Palladium Item, Richmond, Indiana <br />  “Lived in Lighthouse Fifty Years” ; Page 5   <hr /> <p><em>The content for this article was written by Joseph Gruzalski, a researcher with Indiana Dunes National Park.

She studied diligently and began work as a research chemist. Nature went from being a hobby to the perpetual forefront of her mind. From 1967-1976 she personally led one of the state’s most politically-difficult preservation battles and saved what many consider Indiana’s highest quality prairie remnant, today’s Hoosier Prairie Nature Preserve.</h3> <h4>Quote from her:</h4> <p>“Whenever I talk to anyone, I talk prairie.” <br /> -Irene, Indianapolis Star, October 16, 1976</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“Trailblazer for land protection in Indiana”<br /> -John Bacone, Director of the Indiana DNR’s Division of Nature Preserves</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Irene Mary Speros was born in Gary, Indiana on April 19, 1921. She was the only daughter of Greek immigrants, and grew up with her parents and younger brother at Indiana Harbor in East Chicago, Indiana. In her youth, Irene participated in Girl Scouts. In 1932 she picnicked with the troop at Wicker Memorial Park in Highland, IN. That July she went with her troop to Winamac, IN where she camped near the Tippecanoe River. Irene’s father was employed with the township’s trustee office, and in May of 1933 he was invited to attend a banquet in honor of the current governor. Mr. Speros brought Irene with him and they spent the Sunday in Indianapolis together.<br /> <br />  Later that summer at an event called “Girl Scout Day” in Washington Park, Michigan City, over 150 scouts participated in a day of games and events. A local newspaper highlighted the affair; “Exciting games, closely contested races, the singing of favorite songs and quantities of ice cream all combined to make… a great success… after lunch, ribbons were awarded to the winners of various events…” Irene and her partner won the three-legged race. The next summer she would attend another camping trip with the Girl Scouts, this time for almost two weeks in Syracuse, Indiana.<br /> <br /> Irene attended Washington High School in East Chicago, Indiana. In her sophomore year in 1935, she was elected as one of two “councilmen of the Second Ward,” part of the student government association. She was also “assistant chairman” of the health committee that year. That fall, at her brother’s tenth birthday, the Times of Munster reported, “Miss Irene Speros kept the guests amused with games, and later served the group with refreshments.” By December 1935, she represented her high school at the Purdue-Indiana high school debaters’ conference. The next December she was placed on the “honor scholarship roll.” Irene remained active in debate, but also became a reporter for her school’s weekly paper. She became its feature editor. In November of her senior year, Irene and her partner placed first among all affirmative teams in Indiana according to the Times of Hammond. <br /> <br /> Miss Speros graduated from Washington Highschool in 1938. She was one of ten students who received a scholarship for a year’s full-tuition to attend Chicago’s “Central YMCA College” of the 154 that applied from over fifty different high schools. Upon graduating, Irene also received a scholarship from a national Hellenic organization, as well as the George H. Lewis gold medal, “one of the highest awards to a girl graduate” at her high school.<br /> <br /> During college, Irene became active in the Daughters of Penelope, a philanthropic group with Hellenistic values that promotes education and civic responsibility. In 1939 she was chosen as her chapter’s delegate to the group's conference. In 1941, Irene was elected president of the local chapter. The next year, Irene graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. Following graduation, Irene accepted a position with Western Electric to do library research work. She became one of the first women to work in the laboratories of the Lever Plant in Hammond, Indiana.<br /> <br /> Irene met chemical engineer Robert Dean Herlocker when she worked for Sinclair Refineries. The fellow chemists married on September 10, 1949. A local newspaper described the scene:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Carrying a bouquet of white roses, orchids, and stephanotis, the bride appeared in a gown of white slipper satin, simply made with a beaded neckline, gathered skirt and short train. Her bonnet-type headpiece of white satin held a veil of silk illusion in place.</p> <p><br /> Mr. and Mrs. Herlocker lived together in Hammond throughout the 1950s. Irene became active in the American Association of University Women (AAUW) by 1954. Within a few years, she chaired the membership committee. She saw great value in the organization and stated, “Membership… provides an opportunity to join with other college women graduates in a practical, constructive contribution to the functioning of democracy.” Irene also became active in the local League of Women Voters chapter.<br /> <br /> The Herlocker’s moved to Munster, Indiana where expanses of open land were more common and Irene was delighted to find more unique bird species than she was accustomed to.  She recalled that sparrows and robins used to be some of the only bird species she saw.  Many meetings for AAUW were held in her and Robert’s Munster home. From 1961-1964, Irene served as the AAUW’s Calumet chapter’s president. <br /> <br /> In June of 1961, Irene attended the AAUW’s national convention in Washington D.C.. In 1962, the Herlocker home became the headquarters of the “Munster Unit” for the local League of Women Voters and Mrs. Sylvia Troy served as chairman. These two women would forge a friendship that would benefit many natural areas in Indiana. In March of 1963, a few months after the release of “Silent Spring,” Irene wrote in to the local newspaper about the lack of chickadees she’s noticed, “I’m not one of those zealous bird-watchers. I’m just curious and I miss them around the yard. I just have not seen any this year and in other years there were dozens of them around through the winter.”<br /> <br /> Irene discovered that some of her neighbors in Munster were those zealous bird-watchers; together, they explored surrounding nature spots. On May 23, 1967, when one such neighbor was moving away to Texas, Irene was asked if she wanted to come to a secret birding spot surrounded by railroad tracks and light industry. Irene eagerly agreed. Her neighbor’s name for the area would not prepare her. “I’ll take you to the Griffith dump,” Mrs. Phyllis Finch told Irene. The introduction changed Irene’s life.<br /> <br /> The “dump” was in fact, an expansive prairie habitat with boblinks, meadowlarks, and carpets of rare and unusual wildflowers. Irene recalled, “I was stunned. I couldn’t believe there was something so beautiful only 10 minutes from my home. The ground was covered with flowers…” The dazzling diversity and alluring blooms caused Irene to purchase a wildflower identification book for herself. This was followed by a two volume set, a three volume botany set, and a microscope. Irene began to realize the prairie was a botanical treasure; a piece of remnant Hoosier prairie-land.<br /> <br /> Just two years after her first visit, the nearly 400 acre prairie was reduced by 73 acres from the construction of a crude oil tank storage farm. Deeply concerned with the precious land’s fate, Irene began to occasionally mention to experts that she believed she knew the location of a prairie remnant. She was surprised to find out some people knew of the jewel; they cautiously encouraged her to to save it. “Everybody said, ‘Keep it quiet, keep it quiet,’” she recalled. “How do you save 300 acres in Lake County? We didn’t even have a county park.” <br /> <br /> Irene continued her work with AAUW. While her previous projects centered around membership and economics, by the early 1970s Irene led discussions on environmental issues. One article read, “Mrs. R. D. Herlocker will head a group studying pollution, conservation and population policy under the topic ‘This Beleaguered Earth.’” In 1970, Irene represented AAUW at the Federal Water Quality Administration's conference on Lake Michigan pollution. She professed her support for thermal pollution standards and pressed Indiana to accept them:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Most of our members live in Indiana in the Calumet Region. In efforts to do something to clean up our environment, we encounter nothing but excuses and buck-passing between the State and local agencies:<br /> ‘We don’t have the manpower to do the job.’<br /> ‘We don’t have the monitoring equipment.’<br /> ‘We don’t have the money.’<br /> ‘These things take time.’<br /> ‘The laws aren’t strong enough.’<br /> ‘Industry has a timetable.’<br /> <br /> We say to you now, and I address myself primarily to the Indiana representatives, all you need is the wisdom, the integrity, and the backbone to accept these recommendations. Remember, you are not servants of the Republican Party, of the Democratic Party, or of industry; you are servants of the people.<br /> <br /> Ecclesiastes said: ‘To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven.’ This is the time to fill your purpose in the public interest.”</p> <p><br />  In the meantime, Irene contacted her congressman, Rep. Ray Madden, for support. He told her to get the support of Izaak Walton League and Save the Dunes Council. The Izaak Walton League wanted officially-conducted surveys to show the prairie’s value, so Irene contacted Dr. Robert Betz of Northeastern Illinois University who came and completed the first plant list. <br /> <br /> Irene also contacted the Nature Conservancy for assistance. They asked her how much money her committee could raise. “What committee?” she responded. Will Barnes, director of the Indiana Division of Natural Preserves encouraged Irene to form an informal group of local experts that were interested in preserving the special prairie. Irene gathered her support and they decided to name the land “Hoosier Prairie.” Irene formed the Hoosier Prairie Committee of which both Dr. Robert Betz and Sylvia Troy of Save the Dunes Council became members. The committee concluded that the best way to protect the prairie island was to get it into the ongoing efforts for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore expansion. Sylvia appointed Irene to the Save the Dunes Council committee that was to select the new areas for the expansion bill. <br /> <br /> The family that owned Hoosier Prairie became sympathetic; they did not donate the property but agreed not to sell it to development for the time being. It was time to stop being quiet and publicize; the conservationists needed to raise funds and spread the word. The committee mobilized and used local press, radio, and television to alert the public to the prairie’s rareness and fragility. Hoosier Prairie’s first publicity was at a 1972 town hall meeting where the towns of Highland, Griffith, and Schererville all pledged their support towards preserving the prairie. Press referred to it as, “The last patch of virgin prairie in Indiana.” Mrs. Herlocker told a reporter of the land’s charm; “The prairie grows on you and I began to visit it again and again.” Irene also had the support of her husband, Robert, who was active in the Hoosier Prairie Committee, Save the Dunes Council, Nature Conservancy, and National Audubon Society.<br /> <br /> On May 9, 1972, The Times of Munster reported that Irene, Sylvia Troy and Mrs. Helen Bieker of the Indiana Division of the AAUW met privately with county commissioners about the land’s protection. In February of 1973, Irene spoke to the Calumet Area Branch of AAUW to advocate preserving Hoosier Prairie.  At that time she was noted for being a member of the Save the Dunes Council, Izaak Walton League, and Audubon Society.<br /> <br />  In January of 1973, an expansion bill for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was introduced, but there was not a consensus to include Hoosier Prairie. The Times of Munster reported on June 8, 1973 that oak savanna habitat bordering the prairie was bulldozed as a part of the expansion of an adjacent crude oil storage tank area. This destroyed about 13 acres. The pressure to preserve the prairie was on, but the federal outlook seemed unfavorable. The Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Nathaniel Reed said that the prairie remnant would be a “natural for the Nature Conservancy,” and recommended not to include it because of its separation from the rest of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Irene called the president of the Nature Conservancy and secured his pledge to facilitate acquisition if it were included in the Dunes bill.<br /> <br /> By chance, Irene ran into old schoolmate and State Senator Ralph Potesta at a university luncheon in Gary in November of 1973. Her conversation would spark movement on the state’s preservation front. Senator Potesta submitted a resolution that urged the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to acquire Hoosier Prairie, and a feasibility study was authorized. Through her connections to Save the Dunes, Irene knew that even after the park was authorized, the land was not instantaneously protected. “We know we are in for a fight,” she told a reporter in December of 1973.<br /> <br /> On February 3, 1974; the Times of Munster reported that Irene said “since a recent proposal to expand the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore did not call for the acquisition of the prairie, the decision was made to persuade the state to buy the land.” She had testified to the House Natural Resources Committee that unanimously passed a resolution calling for a feasibility study. <br /> <br /> But Irene did not give up pressure on saving the prairie federally. On June 17, 1974, Irene and her Hoosier Prairie Committee, along with other organizations went to Washington D.C. for the hearings supporting the National Lakeshore’s expansion bill. Studies to determine Hoosier Prairie’s significance led to its successful nomination as a National Natural Landmark in September of 1974. Although the designation reaffirmed its value, it did not provide protection. On September 27, 1974, it was reported that Irene was to testify before the senate subcommittee in support of including Hoosier Prairie in the expansion bill. She was joined by the Hoosier Prairie Committee, Nature Conservancy, Indiana University Northwest and the Governor’s office. “You really need good shoes to walk in those marble halls,” Irene said.<br /> <br /> After a geologist spoke with the committee, Irene asked if she would get to say anything as chairman of the Hoosier Prairie Committee. A condescending Senator Bible responded “you sure will.” After Irene made a correction to one of his numbers, he said, “Are we going to have any of these pretty girls say anything?”<br /> <br /> Irene spoke next, and bickering with Senator Bible continued. When Irene tried to speak on her history with the prairie, Senator Bible continuously brought her off-topic, asking her why the Nature Conservancy would not purchase the prairie if it was so significant. Eventually he asked Irene:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">BIBLE: What would I see there that would be so unique and unusual?<br /> IRENE: I will tell you. I have lived in Lake County all of my life. I did not know anything like this existed until a friend took me there in 1967. I practically fell over. <br /> BIBLE: Why did you almost fall over?<br /> IRENE: It is so beautiful. <br /> BIBLE: Why is it so beautiful? <br /> IRENE: May 23, 1967, the ground was covered with birchwood, violets, blue grass, yellow star grass. My husband has photographed over 200 native plants through the seasons. A prairie is not like a woodland.<br /> BIBLE: We have a prairie. We have the one out in Kansas. Not in my State, but in Kansas.<br /> IRENE: Many people have never seen a prairie. A third of the United States used to be prairie and it is practically all gone. This is the largest prairie in Illinois and Indiana…<br /> BIBLE: You are in love with it and think it should be preserved.<br /> IRENE: It is beautiful. Scientifically, ecologically, botanical—it is very rare. If a passenger pigeon came back, would we let it disappear again because we did not have the funds? Or would we have to wait for the next year or next year? Here this prairie we thought was all gone, and now we have the prairie. If we do not save it now it will be gone again. We are having our second chance.”</p> <p><br /> In her prepared statement, Irene wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We believe the Hoosier Prairie should be part of an expanded Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore because it is an integral part of the ecology of the Dunes, as part of the ancient bed of glacial Lake Chicago, and because of its national significance as the last large tract of prairie near the eastern border of the ‘Prairie Peninsula.’</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…I wish to emphasize that we know of no opposition to the efforts to preserve the Hoosier Prairie. This priceless remnant of our vanishing landscape has miraculously survived in the highly industrialized, urbanized, Calumet area, but it will be doomed to destruction unless you act soon to save it.</p> <p><br /> To the Hoosier Prairie Committee’s dismay, the bill died at session's end.<br /> <br /> The State’s feasibility study was completed in 1975 and it concluded the State should acquire the property. On February 3, 1975, it was reported that Senator Ralph Potesta introduced a bill calling for the appropriation of just over $1 million to purchase the 331 acres.<br /> <br /> On March 20, 1975, a Dunes expansion bill was introduced to the House that included Hoosier Prairie. At a hearing for the subcommittee on public lands, Irene spoke to the House members; “We are not playing games with the Prairie. It doesn’t matter who gets it. The important thing is that it has to be acquired before it disappears, and we are trying everything.”<br /> <br /> A few months later, in the last minutes of the session, the Indiana General Assembly reinserted funds to purchase the Hoosier Prairie. Because of its national significance, the State Budget Committee agreed to authorize the allocation of money for the prairie’s purchase if the federal government contributed to half of the required funds. The Nature Conservancy, who had already been negotiating with the property owners, began to arrange the purchase. Because of their interest in conservation, the property owners agreed to sell significantly less than the cost estimated by the park service.<br /> <br /> The Nature Conservancy led the efforts to secure an unusually large $450,000 federal grant that provided for the funding needed to purchase the prairie. By May of 1976, the grant was secured. Although its protection by the State appeared forthcoming, Irene still testified to protect Hoosier Prairie through the National Park Service:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It is our position that in spite of its imminent acquisition by the State, Hosier Prairie should be included within the boundaries of the Lakeshore. This tract is geologically and botanically an important part of the story of the Indiana Dunes.</p> <p><br /> On September 29, 1976, the first Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore expansion bill finally passed. It included Hoosier Prairie. That October, the Indianapolis Star reported the success and said that Irene was a retired chemist, amateaur naturalist, and “non-stop prairie enthusiast.” “It’s a very complicated story. I talked to everybody,” Irene told the reporter. That same month she led a hike:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Gene Coleman, president of the Dunes Calumet Audubon Society chapter, follows Mrs. Herlocker through the prairie, flower book in hand and tiny daughter, Amanda, riding his shoulders. The child can identify some of the flowers. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘She’ll be leading her own nature hikes by the time she’s 12,’ Coleman proudly proclaims.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘We’ll leave something for you, honey,’ Mrs. Herlocker promises.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘It’s fun, in a gruesome sort of way,’ she reflects, recalling her frantic campaign of the last six years. ‘It’s my life.’</p> <p><br /> On January 14, 1977, the State of Indiana purchased Hoosier Prairie for permanent protection. Over nine years after Irene’s first walk in the prairie, it was finally saved and afforded a double layer of protection as a Indiana State Nature Preserve and part of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. That September, her husband Robert died suddenly at age 66. Irene insisted on guiding a group in the prairie the following day. In 1980, the Indiana DNR’s Annual Report stated that Irene “has been working as an interpretive naturalist at the prairie during the summer months.” In honor of her conservation efforts, in 1986, Indiana DNR’s Outdoor Indiana magazine spoke of Irene’s triumphs and referred to her as the “Queen of the Prairie.”<br /> <br /> Over a decade passed as Irene continued to guide hikes and lead lectures on the prairie. In 1985, Irene went on a three week group trip to China where she met Hansi (John) Meyer of Beverly Shores. Their relationship grew and they married on January 2, 1988. Irene moved into the home John had designed on the lakeshore. “It has a great view,” Irene said of the house shortly after their marriage, “the lake looks different every day.” Today, their home still stands in Beverly Shores as a historic resource within Indiana Dunes National Park, and it is occasionally toured during the spring “Logs to Lustrons” program. <br /> <br /> On March 25, 1994, Irene, along with Charlotte Reed, Barbara Plampin, Kay Franklin, and Irene Herlocker-Meyer gave a program entitled “Women of Dunes” at the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center on Emma Pitcher, Dorothy Buell, Bess Sheehan and others. Nicole Barker, former Executive Director of Save the Dunes spoke of Irene’s devotion, “Her ‘never-give-up’ spirit is a model for us all.”<br /> <br /> Irene was a life trustee for both Shirley Heinz Land Trust and the Save the Dunes Council. In Irene’s final years, she lived just a few miles from the prairie in an assisted-living facility in Munster. She would visit the prairie occasionally even in her 90s. Irene’s car was easy to spot; it had the iconic rear license plate that read, “PRAIRIE.”<br /> <br /> Irene Speros Herlocker-Meyer died on September 21, 2014. Kris Krouse, Executive Director of Shirley Heinz Land Trust said of the prairie protector, “Irene has left a real legacy for those of us involved in land conservation… We have so many more partners and funding sources to work with today. Irene literally had to invent a way to achieve her goals.” John Bacone, Director of the Indiana DNR’s Division of Nature Preserves said that she was a “trailblazer for land protection in Indiana… There weren’t a lot of examples for her to follow. She had to feel her way around, every step of the way, and use every tool and contact she could find.”<br /> <br /> The roughly 300 acre core of Hoosier Prairie has grown to an over 1,500 acre mosaic of black oak savanna, dry sand prairie, mesic sand prairie, wet sand prairie, sedge meadow and marsh habitats. Over 120 bird species use the site, and it is home to over 350 plant species of which at least 43 are considered rare in the state. Its unique, double protection by the State of Indiana and the National Park Service reaffirms the prairie’s irreplaceable character and tells of the limitless extent that Irene went to protecting it. </p> <hr /> <p><em>The content for this article was written by Joseph Gruzalski, a researcher with Indiana Dunes National Park.

After moving to Chicago in 1949, she marveled at the region’s freshwater resources and the Indiana Dunes quickly became a favorite family haunt. She joined efforts to save the unprotected dunes in 1959, seeing creation of a park in 1966 and launching her lifelong career into environmental policy and education. </h3> <h4>Quotes by her:</h4> <p>“We’ve got to learn to live with the lake; it’s too big for us to control.”</p> <h4>Quotes about her:</h4> <p>“She became a writer, a grass-roots organizer, an educator, and a municipal and federal government official whose work would touch practically every drop of water and every mile of shoreline in the Great Lakes basin while educating tens of thousands of people in its ecology.”</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>A grandchild of homesteaders, Leila “Lee” Carman was born February 25, 1928 and grew up in Oklahoma and Kansas during the Great Depression. She loved to explore around her grandparents’ wheat farm, where the freedom to wander would make her aware of relationships to the land. She would later say, “I was a child of the Dust Bowl.” The 1930s brought severe drought and dust storms to the region due to unsustainable farming methods. This man-made environmental disaster was a very formative experience for her. The New York Times relays an early story from her childhood:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">One morning her grandfather lifted her onto his saddle and rode out with her to a pasture to inspect a row of drought-resistant trees that he had planted to halt erosion. They found that the trees, together forming what was called a shelterbelt, were, supported by a federal New Deal soil conservation program, growing just fine.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The lesson stayed with her, she later said, arousing in her a passion to help protect the earth and kindling a seven-decade career in environmentalism — in her case far removed from that parched Oklahoma soil.</p> <p><br /> Lee attended North High School in Wichita, Kansas. A yearbook photograph from 1944 shows her ironing; oblivious to her potential, its caption reads: “Be careful there Lelia Carman, or you will burn that blouse!” Lee continued her education and attended Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, today’s Oklahoma State University. Not uncommon for Oklahoma women at the time, Lee was the first woman in her extended family to attend college. According to her son Paul, “It was her mother’s insistence that she go.”<br /> <br /> She was active in numerous honorary fraternities and assistant editor of the daily campus paper. While at college, Lee met Lambert “Bud” Botts. The couple married in Chicago on September 17, 1949. That same year, they moved to Hyde Park, where Bud would attend the nearby University of Chicago for graduate studies. Lee completed her studies by mail and received an English degree.<br /> <br /> Lee often reflected on her first reaction to Lake Michigan: “I couldn’t get over the marvel of a lake that wasn’t made by the Army Corps of Engineers.” Her daughter Beth later clarified, “Because that’s the only way you got a lake in Oklahoma.” In April of 1954, Lee gave birth to their first child, Karl. In February of 1956, she gave birth to their daughter, Beth. In the late 1950s, Lee began writing a “garden” column for the Hyde Park Herald that represented early urban conservation.<br /> <br /> In 1959, Lee joined the Save the Dunes Council, a citizen group determined to preserve the Indiana sand dunes for a national park. The area had already become a favorite haunt for her family. Her daughter Beth maintains that through Save the Dunes, Lee learned how to be an environmental activist. Beth spoke of her mother: “She saw the dunes, and the grasses, and the woods, rising up next to this amazing blue water and she never got over that.” She joined the group’s Board of Directors and managed “public relations.” Lee gave birth to their son, Paul, in 1962. A few years later in 1965, Lee had their fourth and final child, Alan.<br /> <br /> In 1966, Save the Dunes’ efforts were rewarded with the authorization of an Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. That same year, Lee became an editor for the Hyde Park Herald, serving into 1969. Bruce Sagan, owner of the newspaper since 1953, reflected on Lee’s work: “her objective journalism was a crucial component of the civic discussion during that complex history.”<br /> <br /> Lee knew the power of citizen action; she decided to leave her work in the newspaper and take a position with the Open Lands Project in Chicago, a local group known as a leader in urban conservation. She was hired in 1969 to develop a general environmental education program that would focus on Lake Michigan-specific environmental issues. On April 22, 1970, thousands of activists in Chicago joined cities across the world to demand a healthy, sustainable environment in celebration of the first Earth Day. In her new role with Open Lands, Lee helped organize a teach-in event and spoke at a local college to highlight the pivotal day in environmentalism.<br /> <br /> By the early 1970s, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore had acquired land for the park, and the development of West Beach for visitor use was in the news. Despite the wins in land protection, Lee feared that the pollution affecting the lake’s water quality would endanger recreation. In May of 1970, the Chicago Tribune captured Lee’s concern:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘All this is very good, even wonderful,’ comments Mrs. Lee Botts, official spokesman for the Dunes council pessimistically, ‘but what if lake pollution, which surveys show to be growing steadily worse, becomes so bad that they’ll have to close West Beach just about the time when they expect to formally open it? We’ve got to lick pollution right away.’</p> <p><br /> The next year, the National Park Service revealed controversial development plans for the West Beach property that included a marina, sports fields, parking garages, and swimming pools — a move that blindsided conservationists. The Chicago Tribune reported Lee’s reaction to the Park Service’s early West Beach development plans:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When I saw the proposal for swimming pools I was so baffled I thought the park service had come under the influence of the University of Chicago professor who said it would be cheaper to build swimming pools for everyone than to stop pollution. I have never encountered anyone who went to the lakeshore because they wanted to swim in a swimming pool.</p> <p><br /> Save the Dunes was set on changing the plans. “They protested to the newspapers, to their congressional supporters, and to the Secretary of the Interior… A planning advisory group incorporating local and regional planning agencies as well as area citizens’ groups was created; and a new, more acceptable General Management Plan for park development eventually emerged.” “Park service attitudes have subsequently changed. Local public hearings on General Management Plans are now required throughout the National Park system…”<br /> <br /> Around 1970, the negative effects of thermal pollution on ecosystems were becoming more understood. In March of that year, Lee criticized the lack of communication concerning new nuclear power plants and the public:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In spite of the serious dispute about the consequences, only the public so far as questioned whether the lake can survive its function as a cooling pond when it is already dying of its burden of municipal sewage, agricultural fertilizers and industrial wastes…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Each nuclear power plant has been authorized in a separate decision, without relation to other power plants in terms of environmental effects.</p> <p><br /> On May 2, 1970, as president of the Open Lands Project, Lee criticized state agencies for “prematurely” issuing construction permits for a nuclear power plant just north of Chicago in Zion, Illinois. A four-state water quality conference concerning Lake Michigan was to be held in Zion on May 7th, and Lee knew the effects of thermal pollution were not considered when the permit was issued. She would speak in Michigan the following year: “We’re not against nuclear power, we need electricity. But electricity doesn’t have to be produced at the expense of the environment.”<br /> <br /> At the water quality conference on May 7th, 1970, Lee clarified the role of the Open Lands Project. She said the group would provide organizations from surrounding states with reviews of new research relating to the lake. “We are not political,” she said. “We will also serve as liaison with government agencies on the local, state, and federal level.” She also announced plans for a newsletter so that pertinent information could reach a larger audience.<br /> <br /> Also at the conference, the Federal Water Quality Administration (FWQA) announced their thermal pollution policy that forbade dumping heated water into the lake. The policy blindsided industry officials and environmentalists alike; Lee said at the time, “I hope it’s true… It may be one of those things that is too strict to be enforced.”<br /> <br /> In June of 1970, Lee participated in a Save the Dunes event at Marquette Park where over 150 people came to hike and learn about the Dunes. Charlotte Read spoke on problems that endanger the dunes, such as sand mining. Lee focused on thermal pollution. Sylvia Troy addressed the Council’s newest threat, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company’s (NIPSCO) proposed coal-burning power plant in Michigan City, Indiana. Lee knew the effectiveness of citizen action, and she realized the need for an organization that focused on protecting Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> In September of 1970 she founded the Lake Michigan Federation, the first citizen-run organization for the protection of a Great Lake. The group's motto was “Citizen Action to Save a Great Lake.” The group originally operated out of Open Lands, but became an independent organization in the fall of 1971. Lee served as the group's executive director from 1971-1975. The Federation led advocacy for the first binational Great Lakes Waters Quality Agreement, successfully lobbied for congressional passage of the landmark 1972 Clean Water Act, and pressured states to enforce provisions to decrease pollution into Lake Michigan. The Federation also played a key role in persuading Congress to ban PCBs through the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act.<br /> <br /> Explaining the name, Lee stated:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It is called a Federation because it is not designed to act on behalf of its members, but to provide information needed by its members to decide when and where to take action of their own. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…So the basic structure of the Federation provides for membership to organizations and individuals who can look to the Federation as their clearinghouse for information about Lake Michigan.</p> <p><br /> Although the group would touch on local issues, Lee knew that focusing on larger issues would have the most positive impacts; “We remain convinced that we will achieve more for the lake in the long run by dealing with broad policy issues which these local situations reflect.”<br /> <br /> In 1971, the Lake Michigan Federation campaigned for more stringent standards for industrial plants, power plants, and municipalities that discharged wastes into the lake. The Times in Munster quoted Lee: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We think we have barely started…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We think we are justified in asking for special conditions to preserve Lake Michigan.</p> <p><br /> Lee provided the spark that got Lake Michigan and surrounding states at the international table involving Great Lakes policy decisions. In August of 1971 during the Conference of Great Lakes Governors and Canadian Premiers, Botts questioned why the state of Illinois and Lake Michigan were not involved in the international deliberations, as Lake Michigan’s waters were directly tied to the other four Great Lakes. The next day the Governor of Wisconsin introduced a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the eight Great Lakes states and two Canadian provinces, declaring: “The water quality objectives set out in the international agreement between the two federal governments apply to Lake Michigan…”<br /> <br /> While much of the conservation world was focused on pollution, the Lake Michigan Federation was additionally cognizant of human-induced coastal erosion issues happening on Lake Michigan shores. High lake levels caused exacerbated erosion in areas where human-made structures interrupted the natural shore. By the end of August 1971, Lee and the Lake Michigan Federation publicly expressed that the Army Corps of Engineers and the State of Indiana should be held responsible for restoring the lake’s eroded shoreline and preventing further damage. They highlighted the accelerated destruction of the shoreline by Army Corps-permitted projects like Bethlehem Steel's lakefill near today’s Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk and the breakwall structures near Mt. Baldy in Michigan City. Lee contended that the permits were issued under the condition the environment would be protected, and that now the Army Corps and the state were trying to convince the public that the beaches would return when abnormally high lake levels dropped. A Chicago Tribune article highlights Lee’s view: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In response to the idea that the flooded beaches were simply under unusually high lake levels, Lee responded ‘They won’t. They are washed away. They are not under the high water. They are gone.’</p> <p><br /> Lee noted that erosion worsened with the erection of jetties, which simply moved erosion further down the shoreline and magnified the problem. “In 1971… the corps agreed to dump dredged sand but put it in the wrong place to preserve the beaches,” Lee said. In fall of 1973, the Army Corps awarded a $2.5 million contract to place boulders along about 2.5 miles of shoreline. Anticipating an increase in erosion and the subsequent private property damage, exposed septic tanks and expensive road repairs; the Superintendent of the national lakeshore had to make a difficult choice. Superintendent Whitehouse told the press: “If there was another way to solve this problem, I’d say ‘fine.’ But I don’t see any other solution right now”.<br /> <br /> The limestone boulder revetments act as a barrier to protect remaining coastal dunes from the lake’s erosional wave-action. Lee expressed her concern that one project would lead to another. “She sees the revetments as ‘one more man-made structure altering the natural character of the shoreline,” wrote The Indianapolis Star. Speaking on coastal erosion a few years later, Lee said, “We’ve got to learn to live with the lake; it’s too big for us to control.” Lake levels follow a cyclic pattern; recent high water periods have resulted in additional boulder revetments to Indiana’s lakeshore. <br /> <br /> In 1971, a national conservation on the use of phosphates accelerated when its dangerous caustic and destructive ecological properties were discussed at the congressional level. Under Lee’s leadership, the Federation seized the opportunity and successfully persuaded Mayor Richard J. Daley to make Chicago the first Great Lakes city to ban phosphates in detergents. In 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency’s May report featured Lee on the cover and included the story entitled: The Incomparable Lee Botts. The article praised her for her many years of work to preserve, guard, improve, and protect Lake Michigan and its surrounding area. The ban went into effect on June 30th, 1972. In Green Bay, Wisconsin that July, locals reported foul smelling and tasting water in the lake. A fertilizer-induced algae bloom was to blame, which elevated conservationists’ growing fears that Lake Michigan could become a “dead lake,” like Lake Eerie. Lee used the moment to highlight Lake Michigan’s water quality issues: “We’re very alarmed. I hope it will convince anyone who isn’t already convinced that we haven’t been making false alarms. The lake is in serious danger.”<br /> <br /> Lee’s hunch that the FWQA’s ban on thermal pollution from May of 1970 would be too strict to be enforced proved true. In November of 1972, the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it would not enforce its previously stated thermal pollution standards. “This is a capitulation to the utility lobby,” Lee said. Out of the four states that border Lake Michigan, only Indiana chose to independently adopt the thermal pollution standards, an agreement that necessitated NIPSCO to incorporate cooling of their discharge waters at their Michigan City power plant.<br /> <br /> Still, with only Indiana complying, Lake Michigan was threatened with thermal pollution at the majority of its shores. Lee saw the morality of Lake Michigan and urgency to protect it:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The historical trend is for ever more pollution of Lake Michigan and basing decisions on stopping pollution on the cost rather than the possible benefits…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">To call this trend ‘normal’ is to say that murder is normal, and to do it in the name of planning makes it premeditated murder.</p> <p><br /> Thermal pollution is now regulated by the Clean Water Act by section 316(a); however, the law allows permitting authorities to evaluate whether a variance should be granted on a case-by-case basis.<br /> <br /> In February of 1974 when President Nixon nearly halved the EPA’s budget for bringing Lake Michigan’s sewage treatment plants to Clean Water Act standards, Lee said “Lack of sewage treatment will still damage the lake directly… Citizen pressure is still the way to save Lake Michigan, and the place to bring pressure is Congress.” Later that year, Congress responded to the public’s outcry and passed the Impoundment Control Act, which made it clear a president could not refuse to spend appropriated funds.<br /> <br /> In September of 1974, the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) held a hearing in Chicago concerning a President Nixon-initiated energy project that would rely heavily on upping coal production and building nuclear plants. The hearing was one of ten that took place across the U.S. on “Project Independence,” Nixon’s bold plan for the nation to become energy independent by 1980. The project materialized in response to the 1973 oil crisis, and was now being continued by President Ford. Lee felt the project was unachievable, came at too high an environmental cost, and was one of the few environmentalists invited to testify at the hearing. A few weeks before the hearing, Lee was quoted in a Chicago Tribune article; “Project Independence is a fraudulent effort to convince the American people of the necessity to exploit our natural resources in the name of energy.”<br /> <br /> Around this same time, Lee sat on an advisory board for the Ford Foundation’s Energy Policy Project, and consulted with the Nuclear Regulatory Commision on the proposal to build nuclear energy centers around the country. In June of 1975, her efforts for pursuing smart energy were rewarded when she was appointed to the Consumer Affairs-Special Impact Advisory Committee to the FEA.<br /> <br /> The same article that noted this achievement also cited her opposition to NIPSCO's proposed “Bailly I” nuclear power plant near Cowles Bog. Lee knew the plant would adversely affect the Indiana Dunes, and was vocal in her opposition to it. NIPSCO announced its plans in 1970, and construction began before being halted by litigation. In 1977 at West Beach’s dedication, Lee was in attendance, proudly wearing a lapel pin that expressed her opposition to Bailly I. Court battles continued for over 10 years before the company announced the project’s abandonment in 1981 after spending $191 million.<br /> <br /> Lee and Lambert divorced in 1975. That November, Lee criticized the EPA for failing to protect the lake and those who depend on it.  A national discussion on banning polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by passing a toxic substance control law was underway, and Lee said she was dismayed that the EPA had failed to enact regulations on the chemicals. A few days later she wrote to the Chicago Tribune, “The American public has not turned away from its concern for protecting the environment and is demanding that we protect the environment while providing jobs.” Lee said that the government should invest its research and development money in environmentally safe energy sources such as solar energy, rather than in environmentally destructive sources such as coal or nuclear energy. Lee’s wealth of ideas did not go unnoticed.<br /> <br /> Around the start of 1976, Lee was hired by the EPA and joined the staff of their Region 5 office in Chicago. Lee worked for the young agency for two years as deputy director for public and intergovernmental affairs. She focused her efforts on trying to convince EPA officials in Washington D.C. that PCBs were a risk to residents and wildlife of the Great Lakes. A magazine published by the office later that year described her in a headline as “Lady of the Lake.” By the end of 1977, the EPA banned PCB discharges into rivers and lakes; two years later they banned the use and production of the chemical entirely.<br /> <br /> Phosphate pollution continued to be an issue for Lake Michigan. On October 1, 1977, Michigan joined Indiana; New York; Minnesota; Akron, Ohio and Chicago in banning laundry detergent that contained phosphates. At the same time, senators and representatives from Great Lakes states were pressing for federal legislation. Phosphates cause accelerated aging, or eutrophication of a lake. Although Lee viewed a ban of phosphate detergents in the Great Lakes basin as “the single biggest step we can take immediately,” it never materialized. Despite this, each state in the country voluntarily banned phosphates in detergents by 1994.<br /> <br /> In February of 1978, Lee addressed recently proposed budget cuts for the EPA for 1979-1980 while alluding to a general unrecognition of the Great Lakes’ worth from the nation’s capital: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The fact that cuts of this extent had been considered reflects the lack of appreciation in Washington for the Great Lakes as a resource. There are a lot of people in Washington who think the Great Lakes are little puddles. They have no sense of the lakes’ importance as one-fifth of the world’s fresh water.</p> <p><br /> The squeaky wheel got the grease; later that month, President Carter appointed Lee as the chairman of the Great Lakes Basin Commision— a collection of international water quality and water use planning agencies that work to solve Great Lakes issues. Lee promised to change the Commission’s “do-nothing” image while also beginning to tackle air pollution. Following the release of a 1978 study on Great Lakes pollution sources, Lee said, “Until now, we’ve been concentrating on what comes out of pipes… It’s clear we must pay more attention to air than we realized.” A couple years later she celebrated the increased understanding of environmentalism that she witnessed over the last decade:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… the most important thing is that environmental protection is now part of the system. We know a lot more about how things work, but we’re not as far as we need to be. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In 1970, we didn’t have any idea that a lot of the pollution going into the Great Lakes was falling from the air. We thought it was all coming from the ends or pipes, or running off the land. Now we know a good portion comes from the air.</p> <p><br /> In May of 1980, while still serving as chairman of the Great Lakes Commission, Lee reflected on her work and on the paradigm shift in environmentalism:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The most important thing I do is get agreement from 8 states and 12 federal agencies on what has to be done for the Great Lakes… Everyone now agrees that the environment must be protected. The argument now is how we do it. Ten years ago, it was whether it had to be done. That’s an incredible difference, and it happened in a pretty short time… One of the most important things happening now is the recognition of the link between good economics and good environmental protection… That is becoming clearer and clearer.</p> <p><br /> On September 30, 1978, President Reagan terminated the Great Lakes Basin Commission. Lee moved to Evanston, Illinois, where she held a research faculty position at Northwestern University from 1981 to 1985. In October of 1981, the Botts’ leaseback home in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore burned down in Beverly Shores from arson. Her daughter Beth would later write:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The house was nothing, but the surrounding woods, full of shelf lichens, grapevines for Tarzan swings, trillium, cardinal flower, sassafras, marsh marigolds, a big old willow for a treehouse, had been the playground of my younger brothers’ childhoods.</p> <p><br /> The Botts’ home was one of five that burned at the time, including two other environmentalists’. Additionally, conservationist Sylvia Troy’s home burned down from arson in Beverly Shores seven years earlier. After the 1981 event, the Indianapolis News wrote of Beverly Shores’ “Fire Chief Stanley”: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘We’ve discounted the theory about the anti-environmentalist connection,’ said the burly veteran of 20 years on the Beverly Shores department.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Stanley, who open describes his attitude as ‘anti-park,” actually has an interesting counter theory for those who say the fires are a campaign of terror against person opposing lakeside development.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘With Reagan cutting back on park and environmental money, what better way for the environmentalists to gain sympathy than to have this kind of tragedy perpetrated against them.’ </p> <p><br /> Regardless of the intent of the house fires, suffice to say tensions were high among conservationists and anti-park sentiment. Lee highlighted land use issues in a Times article from Munster:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All over the country there are tremendous conflicts over use of shoreline. More and more people want to live on shores, more and more people want to go to shores and more and more industries want to locate on shores.</p> <p><br /> Lee wrote a piece for The Indiana Dunes Story; How Nature and People Made a Park, a collection of short essays by regional conservationists and scientists published in 1984. Lee wrote of the region’s fragility:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The use and lose dilemma is worse for the Indiana Dunes because it is a small park accessible to many people and because so many of its valuable natural areas are especially vulnerable. Mount Baldy cannot survive too many climbers, Pinhook Bog too many hikers, nor the heron rookery too many visitors during the nesting season.</p> <p><br /> In 1985, Lee joined the senior staff of Mayor Harold Washington, Chicago’s first African-American mayor. Under Mayor Washington, Lee served as director and organized the city’s first-ever Department of the Environment. That October, with Mayor Washington’s endorsement and support, Lee became the first environmentalist to run for the board of the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago (now the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, MWRD;) she lost by just 2%. Although Lee was unsuccessful with the MWRD, her environmentalist platform helped pave the way for later successful environmentalist tickets like Cam Davis and Debra Shore.<br /> <br /> In 1988, Lee and a Canadian Great Lakes advocate Bruce Krushelnicki authored a resource entitled, The Great Lakes: An Environmental Atlas and Resource Book. Their intent for the book was to provide an ecosystem approach to the understanding of the Great Lakes Basin. That same year, Lee retired to the Dunes and entered an agreement with the National Lakeshore to live in another leaseback home near the western edge of today’s West Beach. “The Dunes was the place she connected to nature, to kids; the future, the life of the world.” A 1994 Chicago Tribune article that highlighted environmental activists of Northwest Indiana wrote that Lee was a warm, lowkey activist who was often referred to as “Mother Botts.” The article also quoted a Chicago alderman, who said; “she knows how to make the government work. Lee brings people together.” She used this skill to accomplish what she would consider her proudest achievement. <br /> <br /> Lee decided to work on getting an environmental education center in the National Lakeshore that would focus on educating youth by other young people. She saw the center as being a way to move environmental values out into the world, an extension of the teaching and mentoring she had been doing her whole life. The Great Lakes Basin Commission quoted Lee, “I worked from inside government and outside government… I learned there are a lot of different ways to make things happen.”<br /> <br /> Through Lee’s vision and coordination, the Indiana Dunes Environmental Learning Center was established at the site of the historic Goodfellow Youth Camp. They opened their doors to students for the first time in 1998. Lee saw the organization through its infancy by initially chairing its board of directors. She believed that introducing kids to the dunes, one classroom at a time, was the best way to ensure their protection. Lee said, “more and more kids can learn to love the dunes, and as they do, others will follow.” Today, known as the Dunes Learning Center, it operates as a private, non-for-profit partner of Indiana Dunes National Park and offers year-round environmental education programs to thousands of students annually. Today, plans and funding to begin the restoration of historic elements of the Goodfellow Youth Camp on the Dunes Learning Center’s campus have been secured.<br /> <br /> In 2000, Lee started the Northwest Indiana Quality of Life Council; a mix of environmentalists, industry, government, and others who come together to discuss environmental problems to solve them cooperatively. That March, Lee was quoted, “People need to know about where they live and care about it.” That August, The Times in Munster, IN wrote of the major economic benefits that Dunes tourism brings to the region. Lee said:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Ecotourism was happening here 100 years ago. It just came under a different name.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">People have been pumping money into the Northwest Indiana community for quite some time. That’s why all the industries, businesses, tourists and even a national park found its way here - because of the dunes and the lake. It’s not a secret any longer.</p> <p><br /> In 2002, the 1400-member national Clean Water Network named Lee Botts as one of the 30 people who had made the most difference in pioneering the federal 1972 Clean Water Act. In 2005, the Botts’ leaseback agreement ended with the National Lakeshore. Lee gave a bittersweet goodbye to the land she and her family had grown connected to over the last 17 years. The house was removed, and the land was rewilded. Beth Botts wrote that year: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We knew our patch intimately: how the marsh’s water level was connected to that of the lake, so that in some years it was dry down to the bottom, only to rebound lushly as soon as the lake level rose; how you could mark the turn of the year by the sound of the spring peepers emerging to sing there; how busy muskrats built mounds beside the path, damselflies darted, blue and green herons hunted; how hawks and falcons lazily rode on the columns of warm air rising from the dunes, waiting for prey among the birds that migrate north along the lake.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…Now, her house and those of my brother and their neighbors are torn down, the debris carted away, the sand and sand cherries taking back what long ago was theirs. The woodchucks that harried my mother’s vegetable garden can relax. The irritating interlude of a century or so during which humans thought they owned the place is over. It's their dune again.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…My mother, 77, has moved on, planted another garden, found another window through which she can watch a peaceful pond with herons and snapping turtles and water lilies. She says she feels fortunate and privileged to have enjoyed the beach house as long as she did.</p> <p><br /> Lee recognized the incredible environmental changes that were happening in the region, and pushed for ways to document the work and spread the word. In 2010 she started the Northwest Indiana Restoration Monitoring Inventory, an organization that continues to track successful and ongoing restoration projects in the region.<br /> <br /> To reach an even wider audience, Lee felt that a documentary should be made to showcase the region’s restoration work. This was an idea she had brought up with her children at the dinner table for decades. When she couldn’t find someone to do it; in 2010 at age 85, she paired with director and producer Pat Wisniewsky and decided to write and executive produce the film herself. She wrote the script, conducted many of the interviews, led fundraising efforts, and traveled to promote the film even after being unable to drive her own car. On Earth Day in 2016, Shifting Sands premiered and Lee introduced the film at a number of viewings. According to the Northwest Indiana Times; in hindsight, Lee’s children believe the film project helped extend their mother’s life. A student textbook and educator’s guide of activities were developed in coordination with the film; limited copies are available at the National Park’s Paul H. Douglas Center for Environmental Education.<br /> <br /> Lee Botts died on October 5, 2019 at age 91, just months after Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was renamed Indiana Dunes National Park. Michael Bryson of Roosevelt University wrote after her passing: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">A person who did any one of the above accomplishments would rightly be lauded for the impact of their work on behalf of people and the environment. The fact that Lee Botts did all this and more — through her own will, dedication, and fierce advocacy as well as her ability to connect and collaborate with others — is nothing short of astounding.</p> <p><br /> For the Love Of Water’s founder and president, Jim Olson, said of Lee:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When you met and worked with Lee, she became your mentor whether you knew it at the time or not. You knew she was a leader, one who led and worked passionately for the integrity of the Great Lakes, but also as a champion of the integrity of the process and the persons involved, whom she challenged to do the right thing. She was always prepared, saw the next strategical moves, and was fiercely articulate when she spoke or wrote. Her legacy includes much of the policy and values that protect the Great Lakes today.</p> <p><br /> Environmental attorney and Great Lakes advocate Bill Davis said: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Lee had a very narrow definition of what was impossible, and from a political point of view, that is an extremely important and powerful concept. There was very, very little that Lee truly thought could not be done. I remember during the ’80s when the Great Lakes movement was discussing what our position should be on discharge of persistent toxins; it was Lee’s influence directly and through those she had mentored that led us to the position of zero discharge. I believe that would have been unthinkable without Lee.</p> <p><br /> Howard Learner, director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago said, “Lee made clear that we can almost never be effective enough or strong enough when it comes to protecting the Great Lakes… [she] set the bar high, which is where it should be.”</p> <hr /> <p><em>The content for this article was written by Joseph Gruzalski, a researcher with Indiana Dunes National Park.

            "bodyText": "<p>In the hard winter of 1780, a woman then known as Sarah Benjamin was working in the house of John Willis, Albany’s resident blacksmith, as a servant when she met her future husband Aaron Osborn. Sarah discovered that Aaron had been splitting his time between service and blacksmithing at Willis’s-- first serving at his enlistment site in Goshen, Orange County NY and then a year at Fort Schuyler/Stanwix.<br /> <br /> They married quickly that same winter month of 1780 in the blacksmith’s house. But, rather than a honeymoon, Aaron discovered he would be returning to the war. Desiring Sarah to come with him, Sarah initially offered a hard pass, but after learning that Mr. Osborn would be serving on the Commissary Guard and that she would be given sleigh, horseback, and wagons to ride on, Sarah begrudgingly agreed. Sarah was always very firm in her opinions.<br /> <br /> Sarah and her husband had a tireless journey through the northeast. Starting in Albany, they moved from place to place. Across the Hudson to Fishkill, then to West Point, down to Philadelphia, further to Baltimore, then all the way back up to Yorktown, where the final battle of the Revolutionary War would take place. While on the journey, some Quaker women tried to urge Sarah to stay behind, and, while it was likely that she wouldn’t have, Aaron stepped in, saying “No, he couldn’t leave her behind.”<br /> <br /> The Quaker ladies trying to encourage Sarah to stop following shows the role of women at the time was to stay away from the war and ‘in their own lane.’ It also showed the role of the Quaker people in the war. The Quakers were notorious pacifists, and during the Revolution were often torn between following their religion and avoiding harassment by their pro-war neighbors. Though Sarah partook in stereotypically ‘womanly’ activities (cooking, mending, cleaning) at the different encampments, her accomplishments do not deserve to go unrecognized. Having done so much for the war while taking discouragement from so many shows her resilience.<br /> <br /> American soldiers during the battle of Yorktown set up their camps about a mile away from the city. From there, they dug entrenchments all the way to the battle site, relentlessly bombarded by enemy artillery. A stark change of pace came as a plague settled about the soldiers. On a misty, cool night, Sarah noticed many men in the trenches throwing up their food, those men including her husband. Smartly, Sarah drew the conclusion that they were vomiting due to lack of time to cook. She knew that these men were overworked, overexerted, underpaid, exhausted, dehydrated and starved, and she wasn’t going to take it. She created a coalition of women camp followers, and together they prepared food for the soldiers- they cooked beef, baked bread, and made hot coffee that they could regularly bring to the trenches.<br /> <br /> On one fateful trip, Sarah herself met the large looming General George Washington. The General had asked if she was afraid of the cannonballs, to which she boldly answered,“No, the bullets would not cheat the gallows… and it would not do for the men to fight and starve too.”<br /> <br /> As the final surrender occured at Yorktown, numerous men began to cheer, and \"the drums continued beating and all at once the officers hurra’d and swung their hats.\" Sarah asked them “what is the matter now?” To with one replied “are not you soldier enough to know what it means?\" Sarah answered “no,” and the man replied, “the British have surrendered!” Although she was not an actual soldier, Sarah had earned the respect of the men of the Continental Army who saw her as not only competent but nearly their peer as a fellow \"soldier\" at their side.<br /> <br /> Many years after the war was over and the American soldiers had won. But because Congress had failed to “make ends meet,” and the Revolutionary soldiers got little to no money during and after their military service. Sarah Osborn, like with many other things, was not going to take it. If alive, Aaron Osborn was likely going to be the one to present his and Sarah’s pension statement to court. Unfortunately, he died<font color=\"#005999\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.25px;\"><b> </b></span></font>before doing so. And so, at the ripe age of 81 years old, Sarah took it upon herself to present. So, on November 20th, 1873, now Sarah Benjamin (after marrying her third husband, John) personally appeared before the court of Wayne County, Pennsylvania, and explained why she should be able to collect her and her husband’s pension for their work during the war, starting with the hard winter of 1780…<br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Sarah’s story, while often overlooked (similarly to other women’s stories of the revolution) was a prominent part of the war. Her story, working alongside the folklore of Molly Pitcher, the narratives of Molly Brant and Margaret Corbin, and the tale of Mrs. McCarthy shows that throughout history women have been undoubtedly resilient. Through constant bombardment and pushing back, women have stood their ground and have done so much more than many women of the past could have dreamt of. Sarah and many other women of the revolution deserve to be remembered for the ‘secret’ work they have done.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

She was a resounding voice in securing the park’s first expansion bill, and for nearly a decade she vehemently protected the Dunes from further development and barrage of threats while leading the Save the Dunes Council at a critical time in the park’s infancy.  </h3> <h4>Quote by her:</h4> <p>“I view the Save the Dunes Council as a model of citizen action. This is the course democracy must take in the future to get results- individual involvement. The alternative is to sit back and let the powers that be make all the decisions”</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“I’ve never seen anyone so singleminded in my life— I don’t think she thought of a thing except the Dunes, and she would wear you down. There was no way you could avoid being impressed with her arguments, and if she had a weakness, it was that disagreement with her was the equivalent of domestic treason.” -Tom Dustin</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Sylvia Cranberg was born November 4th, 1921 in New York City. She grew up in the Bronx, and discovered her love for the natural world on her annual trips to the Atlantic Coast with her mother. Sylvia adored the East Coast’s beaches, dunes, and ocean. She fondly remembered “one year we lived in a tent for the summer.” Miss Cranberg attended an all-girl public high school in the Bronx, and then attended Hunters College for women; both choices she attributed to for being “terribly shy.” She found refuge by hiking and biking in the nature of the Pennsylvanian countryside.<br /> <br /> She graduated from college in 1944 and moved back to NYC and worked as a social worker while at night school getting her masters at Columbia. Sylvia met and married Jack Troy in 1946, and she “had to quit work” at school when she had her first child and the young family moved to Fire Island as Jack assumed the position of doctor.<br /> <br /> Two years later in 1948, Sylvia and Jack moved to Whiting where they were surprised to find an industrialized lakefront. “On the map it looked fabulous. It was close to Chicago’s large medical centers and cultural activities and close to the shores of Lake Michigan, which I knew were beautiful from articles I had read in the National Geographic,” she recalled. But they found the industrial influences depressing, and quickly found respite at the Indiana Dunes State Park which provided a twice-a-week escape with her husband and daughter. “The Indiana Dunes are simply magnificent, it has a quietness, it’s simply lovely.”<br /> <br /> Sylvia and Jack decided to move to Munster before finally relocating to Beverly Shores. Around 1960 Sylvia attended a Save the Dunes dinner at Jackson’s Restaurant in Miller. She recalled, “I was immediately impressed with the quality of the people, and I approved of their objectives. They were all nature lovers— non-political, non-activist, not organizers, not joiners, not cause-oriented. They sought out the Dunes because they loved it. They all came from somewhere else and joined together out of that love. As a group they lacked personal animosity and self-serving motivation. They trusted each other and were utterly devoted to Dunes preservation.” This initial gathering inspired Sylvia wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> As her first project for the Dunes, Sylvia began the Calumet chapter of the Save the Dunes Council.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“The people in Lake County [Indiana] already knew what industry—how industry could destroy the environment of an area. And they saw what happened to the lakefront in Lake County; and many of the people had lived there long enough to remember how beautiful the lakefront had been in Hammond. Everyone was saying, ‘Oh thirty years ago, the lakefront in Hammond was just beautiful.’ So they had already experienced what heavy industry can do to the area…”</p> <p><br /> Sylvia expanded the Council’s reach in Lake County whose members contacted thousands.<br /> <br /> In 1962, the group lost one of the most important parcels of the dunes it was fighting to protect. Members were in a Senate meeting when they learned Bethlehem Steel had begun leveling the dunes they were there to save. “Terricide, we called it,” said Sylvia. “The killing of land. Even as Congress was deliberating on a bill to preserve the very area, industry unleashed its bulldozers to preserve the very area, industry unleashed its bulldozers and leveled those magnificent dunes.” She reflected: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“It was a low point of the struggle and a point at which the Council seriously considered giving up on the whole thing. They decided, instead, to fight harder and to save as much unspoiled land as they could – in big and little pieces – along the whole 15-mile shore.”</p> <p><br /> In a later interview she thought back to the Council’s early hopes: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“We were hoping to save it all. And we were very optimistic. But this was prior to 1970 when Earth Day began and the full flower of the environmental movement hadn’t really hit. If it had, I think we could have saved it all.”</p> <p><br /> From 1965-1967 she served an elevated role in Save the Dunes as Dorothy Buell’s assistant. “We spent a lot of time in church basements, school rooms… anyone who would listen… We learned about how Congress operates, how to prepare testimony.”<br /> <br /> “We stressed the natural values of the area, the scientific value,” Sylvia recalled.<br /> <br /> Sylvia helped garner the labor union’s support. “Organized labor came over to our side… These were all people who lived in the area and used the lakeshore. I don’t think we could have done it without the help of the unions.” Sylvia explained the sided conflict and Senator Paul Douglas’ invaluable support:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Douglas set to work on a compromise the opposition couldn’t refuse. The state of Indiana had won its battle for a deep-water port near Burns Ditch, but it still needed 25 million in federal funds to build the harbor’s outer breakwater. Douglas lined up enough votes to block the funds unless a vote was also taken on park authorization. The battle raged. Was the issue ‘picnics versus paychecks?’ Should they ‘steel more of the dunes?’”</p> <p><br /> The Save the Dunes Council made personal visits to all 435 House members and all 100 senators. They taught themselves lobbying skills, how to prepare testimony, learned the importance of congressional committees staff, and the intricacies of the legislative procedure. In November of 1966, the Council’s efforts were rewarded with the authorization of an Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Sylvia proudly proclaimed, “It is a people’s park created by people’s interests.”<br /> <br /> The Council assumed that it had achieved its goal and considered disbanding. Its members soon discovered, as their predecessors had learned when they won approval for the state park, that a park remains theoretical without money to pay for it.” In May of 1967, Sylvia urged locals to write their congressman to urge the appropriation of funds for the national lakeshore; “the Lakeshore cannot become a reality until funds are appropriated for the purchase of land.”<br /> <br /> As Dorothy’s husband’s health failed and her responsibilities at home increased, Sylvia took more of the workload. In 1967, a reluctant, rather naive Sylvia Troy took charge of Save the Dunes, a position she would hold until 1976. This change, coupled with Save the Dunes losing their tax-exempt status from lobbying for the park, set the stage for a more forceful Save the Dunes. <br /> <br /> “Sylvia exuded fire and determination.” She believed the Council’s “prime purpose is to defend the resource – to protect the park and its natural values which so many have worked so hard, so long, and so determinedly to preserve.” In 1967, Save the Dunes’ lobbying campaign secured an initial 1 million for land acquisition of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.<br /> <br /> Sylvia recalled an early battle in a later publication by Shirley Heinz Land Trust:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In 1967, after the National Lakeshore has been approved by Congress but before much parkland had been purchases, the Chicago, South Shore and South Bend Railroad, which runs through the park, approached the National Park Service with a proposal to build an 800-car freight yard on 26 acres within the park boundaries between U.S. Highway 12 and South Shore tracks. Outrageous? We thought so, but without our intervention the freight yard would most likely be there.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Extensive meetings followed for nearly two years with the president of the railroad. Save the Dunes Council, and the National Park Service participating…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The wrangle continued, finally culminating in the South Shore presenting the Park Service with a written contract for the park’s approval of the freight yard. We insisted the matter first required the agreement of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Advisory Commision…At a momentous meeting of the commission at the Red Lantern Inn in Beverly Shores, all of the parties concerned were present, including the attorney for the Save the Dunes Council. The scene was set. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Our attorney read the contract aloud and proposed specific alternate wording to include environmental safeguards and protections for the park. He was backed by the commission. The railroad objected to the changes and withdrew the contract. This was a rare victory with no compromises for the park. The importance of a citizen watchdog group to protect the park was affirmed.</p> <p><br /> Sylvia wrote to Paul Douglas reflecting on the affair, “We had thought it hopeless. Our only explanation is persistent pressure by a great many people. The moral here, apparently, is never give up.” In 1968, Sylvia spoke out about building an airport in Chesterton, fearing the environmental impacts it would cause to the dunes and transportation issues to the area. “We have fought threats to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore from the land and from the water, and now we must fight this threat from the air.” The airport never materialized.<br /> <br /> In early 1970, Sylvia discovered that private industry was actively sand-mining dunes within the boundary of the lakeshore, “...she worked herself into the kind of rage that produced instant results. She demanded that the NPS regional director view the damage…” That May, the park service’s regional director came to meet with Sylvia and Charlotte Reed of Save the Dunes to discuss areas of concern. Sylvia told him, “Look, they’re hauling sand out by the truckload— you’re entrusted with the park and you have to do something.” She recalled, “I made a great big scene, said this has got to stop and it’s going to stop and that’s it.” Thanks to Sylvia, with evidence of illegal sand mining, officials agreed to initiate declaration of taking to protect the resources. “Troy grew to see clearly that the council’s two roles, legislative stimulation and agency oversight, would of necessity have to continue.”<br /> <br /> Sylvia was a conservationist who contended that communication between the government and local groups left room for improvement in the early years of relations concerning Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. In 1971, the National Park Service unveiled their plans for the development of West Beach. The Council had to travel to Indianapolis to find what the park’s development plans were. “An hour before daybreak, Save the Dunes Council President met future Executive Director Charlotte Read and Porter County Chapter Izaak Walton League President Herbert Read to begin the trip.” Up until then the plans had remained closely guarded with no public input.<br /> <br /> They were left in shock as the plan was unveiled: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“...two Olympic size swimming pools… two steel bathhouses…a three-story parking garage…a pavilion, sports fields, winter coasting slopes, a manmade dune, a bandshell and amphitheater, an ice-skating rink, basketball courts, a viewing terrace overlooking the swimming pools, a general field game area, a boating and fishing lagoon, five day-use shelters, storage and maintenance facilities, an administration building, and sixteen residential units for NPS employees.”</p> <p><br /> After the meeting quickly ended, the conservationists went up to view the plans closer-up. After saying the plans were not public, the officials collected the documents and left. “They act like they’re handling C.I.A. documents,” Charlotte Read quipped, shaking her head. “No, they act like we’re the enemy,” Troy remarked.<br /> <br /> Charlotte commented after their gloomy lunch together, “This is too dangerous to believe. We’ll change those plans…”<br /> <br /> “They protested to the newspapers, to their congressional supporters, and to the Secretary of the Interior… A planning advisory group incorporating local and regional planning agencies as well as area citizens’ groups was created; and a new, more acceptable General Management Plan for park development eventually emerged.” <br /> <br /> “Park service attitudes have subsequently changed. Local public hearings on General Management Plans are now required throughout the National Park system…” Today, local and regional groups share enormously improved dialogue with both government and industry.<br /> <br /> In August of 1970, NIPSO filed an application for a permit to construct a nuclear power plant adjacent to its fossil-fuel Bailly generating facility at Burns Harbor. That October, Sylvia wrote an article against NIPSCO’s new Michigan City coal-burning power plant, fearing for its environmental impact and beautification of the shore. She alerted the public of two other power plant projects planned on the lakeshore; a Marquette plant in today’s Miller Woods and the Bailly nuclear plant next to Cowles Bog. “Let us preserve what remains of our beaches for public use and recreation for this and future generations!” The most active group that opposed the facility, known as “Bailly I,” was the Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League led by Herb and Charlotte. They, along with Sylvia Troy and Edward Osann were instrumental in the decade-long battle to halt a nuclear power plant in the Dunes’ backyard. Eleven years after NIPSCO revealed their project, they announced they had abandoned their plans. “The anti-nuclear groups dragged Nuclear Regulatory Commission proceedings to a point where it was no longer feasible to build the plant.” “Ultimately the project became a victim of one lengthy delay after another,” said NIPSCO chairman of the time, Edmund Schroer. Sylvia reflected on their win, “I think it shows individual citizens have power if they wish to use it. It shows our system works and what democracy is all about.”<br /> <br /> Sylvia alluded to a fiery contention shared by many conservationists and Save the Dunes members about Burns Harbor in an October 1971 Chicago Tribune article. The United States General Accounting Office had just provided Congress with a “scathing report” on Burns Harbor.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Pollution from existing and future development in the Burns Waterway harbor area, unless adequately controlled, will have a detrimental effect upon the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore…The state of Indiana has not provided the manpower nor the financial resources necessary to adequately control the sources of air and water, pollution in the harbor area.”</p> <p><br /> “The GAO slapped the wrists of the Army Corps of Engineers for failing to investigate more thoroughly whether a change in the plans making the harbor smaller than originally expected has jeopardized economic justification for the harbor.”<br /> <br /> Sylvia remarked: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“The report confirms everything that the conservationists have been saying about the project since the 1930s… From a taxpayer’s viewpoint, the report confirms our original estimate that the port would be a private port for two steel mills, not a public harbor, and there was no economic justification for the harbor.”</p> <p><br /> On May 7, 1972, The Times of Munster reported that in March, Sylvia Troy had gone to Washington D.C. with other region environmentalists and reversed an earlier decision not to provide an expansion report for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Officials came in May to conduct the field work to make the report, enabling the continued push for a park expansion.<br /> <br /> Sylvia was a staunch advocate for funding the lakeshore. In May of 1973, she went to congress to testify when the park’s funding went from $2.3 million to $74,000.<br /> <br /> In 1973, the lake experienced high water levels. The Beverly Shores area experienced exacerbated erosion due to the breakwater at Michigan City disrupting long-shore currents. That August, Save the Dunes Council filed a suit in U.S. District Court seeking to force the Army Corps of Engineers to modify the Michigan City breakwater; Sylvia fought for a permanent solution. “Mrs. Troy maintains that even the Army Corps of Engineers, which built the breakwater, admits it is a major factor in causing beach erosion to the west.” In fall of 1973, the Army Corps awarded a $2.5 million contract to place boulders along about 2.5 miles of shoreline. The boulders act as a barrier to protect remaining coastal dunes.<br /> <br /> In 1972, Sylvia expressed concerns over the Cowles Bog Wetland Complex. The Council’s senses were heightened to the importance of buffer zones after it was discovered that an Indiana Toll Road Commission's salt pile was “bleeding” into the national lakeshore’s Pinhook Bog wetland. A corridor of man-made ponds known as the “greenbelt” exists between Cowles Bog and its industrial neighbors. “Uses are allowed in this that are incompatible,” Sylvia said. The area posed a serious risk of coal ash-pond seepage contamination, something that Sylvia and the Council alerted the park service and other officials about after they witnessed accelerated dumping in the area in 1973.<br /> <br /> “‘They are apparently determined to destroy their section of the bog and worst of all endanger the remainder of the bog before legislation is even considered by Congress,’ Mrs. Sylvia stated.”<br /> <br /> Despite the council’s desire of having no discharge in the area, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) offered to construct a dyke around the ash dumps to prevent pollution. Although an ecology committee had suggested a clay dyke, it was made with permeable sand. Save the Dunes Council would fight to include the “greenbelt” property in the 1976 and 1980 expansion bills. Although the greenbelt was never officially acquired by the national park, in the last expansion bill of 1992 stipulated that the property owner is required to maintain the natural state of the greenbelt, and must notify Congress three years prior to changing the character of the property.<br /> <br /> Today, the EPA is prepared to clean up two hazardous waste sites adjacent to the “greenbelt,” a buffer zone between industry land zoned “high impact use” and National Park’s Cowles Bog Wetland Complex. “The cleanup approach that has been selected as the final remedy is intended to balance the need to eliminate contamination to IDNP while preserving its fragile ecosystems. Invasive or potentially destructive cleanup methods have not been selected…”<br /> <br /> Sylvia developed contacts, expanded her associations with environmentalists, scientists, unions, and people in the media. She became a formidable asset to congressional hearings, where she would “work herself into a state of indignation sufficient to unleash the desired reaction at the desired time.” She successfully led the council through it’s first park expansion bill in 1976. On October 19, 1976, the South Bend Tribune quoted her: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“It is truly impossible to pay tribute to all the thousands of Americans who have worked so long and hard for the dunes… We have learned in our quarter-century of operation that preserving and protecting the Indiana Dunes does not end with the passage of a bill, but that continued citizen participation is necessary to make sure that future generations will enjoy one of America’s great natural resources.”</p> <p><br /> In the same year Sylvia stepped down from Save the Dune’s helm, she wrote, “It’s going to be a constant battle to maintain the quality of the water and the air… The whole history of the dunes has been one of compromise.” In July of 1981, the Vidette Messenger of Porter County reported that Sylvia and Charlotte had formed the “Northwest Indiana Clean Air Coalition” in response to a July 17 bill that granted steel mills three more years to comply with the Clean Air Act. By 1983 the coalition was bringing 20-30 environmental groups together to discuss and improve air quality.<br /> <br /> Sylvia was one of the founders of Shirley Heinze Land Trust in 1981; in 1995 she said, “It’s a legacy to the future.” She was a life-trustee for the organization. In 1984, Sylvia was published in “The Indiana Dunes Story, How nature and people made a park.” At that time she was a trustee and the secretary for the group, who sponsored the writing project. Her chapter tells the story of the struggles and triumphs of citizens preserving the Dunes: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Efforts to save the dunes are as old as the earliest attempts to destroy them; and interestingly, even the first steps to ensure preservation were the result of citizen initiative and grass roots action. The battle began when improved transportation radiating out from the fast-growing city of Chicago made the south shore of Lake Michigan accessible simultaneously to scientists, nature lovers, and commuters to factory jobs.”</p> <p><br /> Over the years, Sylvia reflected on the Council’s victory in securing a national park. “It is nothing short of miraculous… It’s just amazing the park is here when you think of the early opponents. Industry opposed it because they wanted development; they wanted to make money. Porter County would have been a duplicate of Lake County if they had had their way.”<br /> <br /> At an interview in her home in Beverly Shores, Sylvia reflected:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“...I don’t think Paul Douglas could have done it without the help of Indiana citizens. I think I’m realistic about what we did, and it was a great learning experience, it was a great growth experience for me personally, and it was a great learning experience about how government operates. And it was a fascinating microcosm, you know, to watch a bill move through Congress, totally absorbing and fascinating experience… I think that the whole council experience changed me dramatically. Well, it was a vehicle for my own personal growth. It was a two-way— I frequently thought that the dunes did more for me than I did for it. [Laughs] It was sort of a two-way process. I mean, I learned about my own capabilities, about my own strength, about my own assertiveness on behalf of a cause.”</p> <p><br /> “We just took it step by step. Somehow it was a convergence of all these gifted people in various fields and it worked beautifully.” Sylvia spoke of the council in 2021, “It was very much a family and still is.”<br /> <br /> Sylvia passed away on June 25, 2020 at the age of 98. Her fiery passion lives on in the individuals who fearlessly fight for what they believe in.</p> <hr /> <p><em>The content for this article was written by Joseph Gruzalski, a researcher with Indiana Dunes National Park.

            "bodyText": "Cleveland Leigh Abbott was born on December 19, 1894, in Yankton, South Dakota. His parents, Albert and Mollie Abbott, were originally from Alabama and moved to South Dakota in 1890. He grew up in Watertown, South Dakota, and graduated from high school in 1912. After graduating high school, Cleveland attended South Dakota State College in Brookings, South Dakota. Besides being a good student and graduating in four years, he also played football, baseball, basketball, and ran track, earning 14 varsity letters. He graduated from college in 1916 as one of the first African American graduates from a South Dakota college.<br /> <br /> After college graduation, he taught at Tuskegee Institute as an agriculture instructor. Around this same time, he married his Jessie Harriet Scott. They had one daughter, Jessie Ellen, who went on to be the first women’s track team coach at Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee.<br /> <br /> As the country mobilized for World War 1, Cleveland Abbott joined the U.S. Army. He was assigned to the 366th Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant at Camp Dodge, Iowa. The 366th Infantry was a segregated all-Black regiment. The 366th was formed on August 16, 1917, and assigned to the 92nd Infantry Division. As an all-Black unit, the 92nd was nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers Division. This was in honor of the original Buffalo Soldiers of the late 1800s.<br /> <br /> On June 15, 1918, the 366th departed Hoboken, New Jersey, for the port of Saint Nazaire, France. The 366th saw combat on the Saint Die Sector near Vosges, France. During the night of September 7 and into the early morning of September 8, the Germans attacked the 92nd Division’s lines with a reported 730 mustard-gas shells falling. This was the first and only time the German raiding parties were successful in entering the trenches of the 366th Infantry’s lines. After a brisk firefight, the 366th drove the Germans back to their original positions. <br /> <br /> From October 5 until the end of the fighting on November 11, the 366th was assigned the Marbache Sector near Lorraine, France. On November 10, the 366th received orders to attack the German positions because military intelligence reported that the Germans were in full retreat. The men advanced as ordered and took Bois Voivrotte, France, before retreating when the Germans used extensive mustard-gas shells and high explosives on the 366th’s new position.<br /> <br /> On November 11, at 11 a.m., the entire front became quiet and calm. The Armistice ending the Great War had taken effect, bringing an end to the bloody and brutal fighting. Abbott and the rest of the 366th remained in Europe with the Army of Occupation until they returned to the United States on February 28, 1919.<br /> <br /> After the war, Abbott joined the faculty at Kansas Vocational School in Topeka, Kansas. At the school he served as the commandant of cadets and a coach. In 1923, Abbott returned to Tuskegee Institute, this time as an agricultural chemist and athletic director. As Tuskegee Institute’s athletic director, Abbott also coached the football team from 1923 until 1954. During his time as head coach, the Tuskegee Golden Tigers had a record of 202 wins, 97 losses, and 27 ties. They had six undefeated seasons during his tenure. In 1937, Abbott started Tuskegee’s women’s track and field program. That team was undefeated from 1937 to 1942. The track and field team included six women who later participated in the Olympics, including gold medalists Alice Coachman and Mildred McDaniel.<br /> <br /> Cleveland Leigh Abbott died on April 14, 1955, at the Veterans Hospital in Tuskegee. He was buried in the Tuskegee University Campus Cemetery at Tuskegee, Alabama.<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Waverly Bernard Woodson, Jr., was born on August 3, 1922, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were Waverly and Edna Louise Baxter Woodson. His father worked as a postal carrier in Philadelphia. He graduated from Overbrook High School and later attended Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania. While at Lincoln, he took a pre-med program.<br /> <br /> Woodson left college during his sophomore year and enlisted in the Army on December 15, 1942. After scoring very high on an Army aptitude test, he was assigned to the antiaircraft artillery and sent to Officer Candidate School. He was one of two African Americans in the course. While in OCS, his superiors informed him that the antiaircraft artillery could not billet him because of his race. He was then sent to medic training and assigned to the all-Black 320th Antiaircraft Barrage Balloon Battalion.<br /> <br /> The 320th Antiaircraft Barrage Balloon Battalion was an all-Black army unit formed in 1942. The battalion trained at Camp Tyson near Paris, Tennessee. Camp Tyson was the only training area for barrage balloon battalions. The camp trained more than 30 barrage balloon battalions, including four comprising all-African American recruits: the 318th, 319th, 320th, and 321st Barrage Balloon Battalions. Each battalion consisted of 1,100 men and more than 50 balloons.<br /> <br /> The barrage balloon was a lighter-than-air balloon that was tethered over an area that the army wished to protect from air attack. The balloons were flown at irregular intervals and altitudes. If an enemy plane attempted to fly into the area, it ran the risk of striking one of the wire cables holding the balloons. The cable could slice off a wing or become entangled in the propeller. It was a passive form of defense that forced the enemy aircraft to fly above the balloons, making it more difficult for them to hit their target.<br /> <br /> Woodson, along with the rest of the 320th, boarded Landing Craft Tanks (LCT) in the late hours of June 5, 1944. They were preparing to land in the first waves of American soldiers on Utah and Omaha beaches during the D-Day landing of June 6. As Woodson neared Omaha Beach in the third wave, the Germans opened fire. “They were shelling the devil out of us,” Woodson recalled. “At the same time, we went over two submerged mines. The whole thing jumped out of the water.” The explosion killed several people in the LCT. Woodson received shrapnel wounds to his buttocks and inner thigh. He treated his own wounds and continued onto Omaha Beach to help the countless wounded.<br /> <br /> Woodson set up a medical aid station using the cover of a rocky embankment to shield himself from German machine gun fire. He spent the next 30 hours there treating the wounded and dying on Omaha Beach. At that point, suffering from blood loss and pure exhaustion, he collapsed. He was transferred to a hospital where he recuperated for three days before requesting to return to the beach and treat more soldiers.<br /> <br /> He was interviewed on radio and by newspaper reporters. On August 28, 1944, the Army recounted Woodson’s heroics and noted that he “was cited by his commanding officer for extraordinary bravery on D-Day.” Stars and Stripes, the official U.S. military newspaper, declared him one of the medics who “covered themselves in glory on D-Day.” The Pittsburgh Courier, one of the most widely read Black newspapers, hailed him as the “No. 1 Invasion Hero.”<br /> <br /> After the war, Woodson returned to Lincoln University to complete his studies, graduating in 1948. He later earned a medical technology degree. Woodson returned to active duty during the Korean War and was promoted to the rank of staff sergeant. <br /> <br /> In 1952, he married Joann Katharyne Snowden. The couple had three children. After the Korean War, Woodson became the director of the morgue at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. While at Walter Reed he also taught anatomy classes. He continued to work in different areas of the medical field until he retired in 1990 as a supervisor in the Clinical Pathology Department at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. <br /> <br /> During his military career he received the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European, African, Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead and two Bronze Stars, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, National Defense Medal, Korean Service Medal, and the United Nations Medal.<br /> <br /> Woodson died on August 12, 2005, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, at the age of 83. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.",

            "bodyText": "Marinus Willett was born on July 31, 1740 in Jamaica, Long Island. His first military experience came during the French and Indian War.<br /> <br /> In 1758, Willett received a commission as an officer in a New York provincial regiment, which would bring him into contact with the Mohawk Valley for the first time. During that year, Willett worked on the initial <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-oneida-carry-and-its-early-fortifications-1755-1757.htm\">construction of Fort Stanwix.</a><br /> <br /> With mounting tensions between England and the 13 Colonies, Willett was an active member of the New York City Sons of Liberty. When New York raised five regiments in 1777, Willett received the rank of lieutenant colonel in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-3rd-new-york-regiment-of-the-continental-line-1777-1781.htm\">3rd New York Regiment</a>. As the 3rd NY garrisoned Ft. Schuyler (Stanwix) in April 1777, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-gansevoort.htm\">Col. Peter Gansevoort</a> took command of the regiment and Willett became his second. In 1775, he participated in the attempted American invasion of Canada. Thus began Willett's second tour of duty in the Mohawk Valley.<br /> <br /> During the British <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-1777-siege-of-fort-schuyler.htm\">siege of Ft. Schuyler in August 1777</a>, Willett led a successful attack against the Indian and loyalist camps that greatly demoralized the Indian forces with the British. Shortly after this, Col Gansevoort sent Willett through British lines to find reinforcements. This was also a success. Willett remained at the fort until 1778, when he took leave to join the main army under General Washington. Over the next three years, Willett was involved in several different military actions, including a return to Fort Stanwix to serve under <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/goose-van-schaick.htm\">Col. Goose Van Schaick</a> during <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-van-schaick-expedition-april-1779.htm\">1779 expedition against the Onondagas</a>.<br /> <br /> In 1781, Governor George Clinton of New York appealed to Willett to take command of all the American troops in the Mohawk Valley to deter the numerous Indian and loyalist raids. Counter-attacks led by Willett were partially successful, leading to the death of notorious loyalist leader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/walter-butler.htm\">Walter Butler</a>. In 1783, Willett carried out one of the last military operations of the war, a surprise attack against British held Oswego. The attack failed when Willett's force, being led by an Oneida scout, became lost in the dark as they approached the fort.<br /> <br /> With the end of the war, Willett returned to New York City, where he served two different terms as sheriff, and in 1807, a one-year term as mayor. Col. Marinus Willett died on August 22, 1830 at the age of 90. Recognizing the contributions he had made to his country, over 10,000 people mourned the death of this patriot.",

He worked as a \"counsellor,\" or lawyer, in Boston with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/john-w-browne-law-office.htm\">an office at 19 Court Street. </a>In 1842, he married Martha Ann Gibbs, and with her, had their daughter, Laura. The family resided at 120 Harrison Avenue in the city.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>While attending Harvard, he met and befriended <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/wendell-phillips.htm\">Wendell Phillips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-sumner.htm\">Charles Sumner</a>, two prominent abolitionists whom Browne would share common cause with for the remainder of his life. An early supporter of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, he became an active participant in Boston's abolition movement as an organizer, writer, and speech giver.<sup>2</sup> For example, he wrote and gave speeches promoting his belief in the \"Higher Law\" rather than supporting the current laws of the nation protecting slavery, in particular the hated law <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fugitive-slave-laws-boston.htm\">Fugitive Slave Law of 1850</a>. He said:</p> <blockquote>What madness is theirs, who affirm that kidnapping committed by a private citizen is punishable crime, but that kidnapping committed by a great nation is venerable law!<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Browne also had strong connections to Boston’s Underground Railroad network. In 1846, he joined and became the \"General Agent\" of the second Boston Vigilance Committee, a short-lived organization dedicated to fugitive assistance. As general agent, Browne helped freedom seekers find employment and shelter. He kept detailed narratives of the nineteen freedom seekers assisted by the organization between November 1846 and April 1847, before <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joshua-b-smith.htm\">Joshua B. Smith</a> took over as the lead agent for the group.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1850, Browne joined the third and final iteration of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, established in response to the new Fugitive Slave Law. This organization committed itself to protecting and assisting those coming to and through Boston on the Underground Railroad. In July 1853, he helped rescue a freedom seeker, Sandy Swain, held on a brig in the harbor.<sup>5</sup> According to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/austin-bearse.htm\">Austin Bearse</a>, a fellow committee member and captain of the <em>Moby Dick</em>:</p> <blockquote>Some colored men on Long Wharf got the story somehow, and with all speed, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-bowditch.htm\">William I. Bowditch</a>, Henry Kemp, John W. Browne, and four or five colored men, started with me on the \"Moby Dick\" down the harbor to look for the brig.</blockquote> <p>Bearse demanded and secured the release of Swain and took him to shore where Bowditch and Browne \"drove him out to Brookline, and hid him there that night.\" Swain, Bearse said, soon made his way \"to Framingham, and then to Worchester, and so on by the underground railway, to Canada.\"<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Browne also lent his legal skills to the work of the Vigilance Committee following the aftermath of the arrest of freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>. Abolitionists attempted to rescue Burns from the courthouse where authorities held him. In the melee that ensued, James Batchelder, recently deputized as a federal marshal to guard Burns, fell dead, likely from a gunshot wound. Browne and other lawyers in the Vigilance Committee \"appeared as counsel for the prisoners, charged with the murder of James Batchelder.\"<sup>7</sup></p> <p>In addition to his work as an abolitionist and in the Underground Railroad network, Browne also advocated for other social reforms. He worked for criminal reform and served as a leader of the Boston Society for Aiding Discharged Convicts.<sup>8</sup> He also supported equal rights for women and signed an 1853 petition urging an amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution \"striking out the word 'MALE' wherever it occurs in that instrument.\"<sup>9</sup></p> <p>In 1860, Browne died following a fall from a moving train. Though some newspapers immediately reported his death as a suicide, most soon rescinded that claim and reported his death as accidental.<sup>10</sup> According to one friend, Browne \"was returning by rail, from attempted professional duty, when feeling faint he sought relief in the open air. He reached the platform of the car, and fell beneath it.\"<sup>11</sup></p> <p>At the New England Anti-Slavery Convention, held soon after Browne's death, attendees honored his legacy with a formal resolution, stating:</p> <blockquote>the anti-slavery cause has lost a most uncompromising and devoted friend...in him, the cause of woman, of the poor, the intemperate, the imprisoned, and of the slave, lost a ripe intellect, a brave, loving and religious spirit, a vigilant and untiring friend...<sup>12</sup></blockquote> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Irving H.

Enrolling in 1936 at 13 years of age, Wilkins earned his Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at 17 and his Master’s degree at 18. At just 19 Wilkins earned his PhD and began teaching at the Tuskegee Institute soon after. <br /> <br /> In 1944, Wilkins left Tuskegee to join scientists at the University of Chicago’s Met Lab. Alongside Enrico Fermi and Arthur Compton, Wilkins researched ways to produce fissionable nuclear materials with an emphasis on plutonium 239. In the fall of 1944, Wilkins was set to be transferred to Oak Ridge, but segregation laws prevented him from working as a scientist there. Rejected from Oak Ridge, Wilkins teamed with Eugene Wigner to research neutron absorption until 1946. Wilkins did not know what the purpose of his plutonium research at the Met Lab was until after the atomic bombings of Japan. <br /> <br /> After the war, Wilkins worked as a mathematician in Buffalo, NY, obtained a Master’s degree in mechanical engineering from New York University, and advocated for peaceful uses for nuclear power. In 1970, Wilkins joined the faculty at Howard University in Washington, DC, founding the school’s PhD in Mathematics program. In 1976, he became the second African American to be elected to the Academy of Engineering and later became a Distinguished Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory. J.

            "bodyText": "<p>Benedict Arnold was born in Norwich, CT in 1741. He was the great-grandson of the Rhode Island governor of the same name. As a young man during the French and Indian War, he enlisted in the New York Militia twice, and twice deserted; each time under pressure from his family to complete an apprenticeship as an apothecary under his uncles at home.<br /> <br /> Arnold's parents died when he was 21 and he moved himself and his sister to Hew Haven, CT, where he opened a small store. He became one of the most successful merchants of the coast, owning ships that sailed from the Caribbean to Canada. In 1767 he married Margaret Mansfield, who bore him three sons.<br /> <br /> In 1775, Arnold rode as captain of his Connecticut Militia Company to Cambridge, MA to address what had just happened at Lexington. While there he proposed to officials a return attack on the British. In 1775, he was granted permission to lead a force to British Fort Ticonderoga in New York, and capture it. Along the way he encountered Ethan Allen, and the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont, on the same quest. After much argument the two decided to share command; on May 3 they were able to capture the fort with little alarm, as the commander had few guards patrolling the grounds that night. Arnold's party then proceeded from Fort Ti to Crown Point and captured it much the same. If that wasn't enough, the men then captured Fort George (also in the Champlain Valley) all by the end of June 1775. Arnold's wife died that same month.<br /> <br /> Although this success was considered a great one, Arnold was, in his opinion, forced from command of these new American posts. This did not hinder his ambition. In September 1775 Arnold participated in the American invasion of Canada, per orders of Gen. Washington. Though the attempt at adding a \"Fourteenth Colony\" failed with a desperate attack on Quebec, Arnold was considered by most to have served valiantly as a brilliant tactician and hero after being wounded in the leg during battle. For this he was promoted to brigadier general. In the summer of 1776 Arnold's skills as a strategist were once again called upon as he was placed in charge of a new American Naval Fleet in Lake Champlain. His orders from Gen. Horatio Gates were to defend the area and attack only if attacked. Upon learning of a British naval force under Guy Carleton settling in the northern end of the lake, Arnold took his fleet and stationed it towards Valcour Island in October. Several days of battle ensued. Arnold was not able to do much damage to the veteran British fleet. He only saved many of his men after grounding and burning their ships. Yet, in Gates' eyes, he had disobeyed orders by conducting an offensive maneuver.<br /> <br /> Now at odds with not only his superiors, but with Congress over promotions he did not receive, 1777 became Arnold's year to prove himself. The first chance came in August, when Gen. Philip Schuyler ordered him to march west from Albany to prevent a force under British commander Barry St. Leger from over-whelming the beleaguered troops at Fort Schuyler. Arnold was able to turn St. Leger's superior force against him by blackmailing a loyalist man into spreading rumors amongst the Indians about his coming. St. Leger's allies retreated leaving him with no support; he ordered the retreat of his Regular force before Arnold ever arrived on August 21.<br /> <br /> As Arnold returned to Albany the Northern Army, now under command of Gates, was bearing down for a defensive against John Burgoyne to the north near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara\">Stillwater, NY</a>. After the battle at Freeman's Farm and an argument with Gates about whether or not to attack the shaken British force, Arnold was relieved of command. On Oct. 7, Burgoyne struck again closer to the American lines. Seeing the enemy entrenched, Arnold rode to the field of battle to lead an American attack that captured an enemy stronghold all against Gates' orders. This minor victory however, led the Americans to gain the position they needed on the field to force a British surrender. Arnold was wounded in the same leg that suffered injury in Canada. Scorned by Gates, but officially thanked by Washington and Congress, he was promoted to Major General and sent to Philadelphia to recover, as he could not command the field.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Below:</strong> Peggy Shippen (wife of Benedict Arnold) with one of her children, possibly her daughter Sophia (1785–1828).

She is most famous though, for putting him in contact with the British commanders he would later side with. As allegations of his loyalties and conduct surfaced he requested a change of command that would put him back in New York in command of West Point, a well fortified American stronghold along the Hudson River, which he would later try to deliver into the hands of the British. Its capture would have been a great blow to the Americans. Although, he was unable to deliver this prize, Arnold was rewarded by them with a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army, a pension, funds for lost property, and command of deserters and Tories. The reasons for his change of sides have been, and will be, the subject matter of much speculation, conversation, and endless books.<br /> <br /> It has been said that had Benedict Arnold died at the Battles of Saratoga, he would have been considered as one of America's greatest heroes. Instead, he died in England in June of 1801 as Gen. Washington's most brilliant tactician and America's worst betrayer.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Below: </strong>This is a copy of one of Benedict Arnold's coded communications with the British while he was negotiating what eventually became a failed attempt to surrender the fort at West Point in 1780.

            "bodyText": "<p align=\"start\">Friedrich Wilhelm Ludolf Gerhard Augustin von Steuben was born on September 17, 1730 in the fortress town of Magdeburg in the Kingdom of Prussia. Following in his father's footsteps, Steuben joined the Prussian Army in 1747, when he was 17 years old. In May 1756, the Seven Years War began in Europe, and Prussia and Britain were pitted against France, Austria, and Russia. At this time, Steuben was a second lieutenant. He was wounded at the Battle of Prague, where the Prussian army was victorious, despite facing twice as many Austrian troops. In 1758, he served as General Johann von Mayer's adjutant and principle staff officer in a special detached corps. Steuben was promoted to first lieutenant in 1759, and he was wounded at the Battle of Kunersdorf that summer. On June 26, 1761, he was transferred to general headquarters, where he served as a staff officer in the position of a deputy quartermaster. Later in 1761, he was taken prisoner when Major General von Knoblock surrendered at Treptow on the Russian front. In 1762, he was released, promoted to captain, and he eventually became an aide-de-camp to Frederick the Great. Then he joined the King's personal class on the art of war, where young officers were trained in the complicated art of leadership. Shortly following the peace treaty, he was discharged from the Prussian army on April 29, 1763.</p> <p align=\"start\">By 1763, Steuben had gained all of his military experience which would be so valuable in his service to the American cause. He had learned the methods of war in what many considered to be the greatest and most advanced army in the world at the time. Steuben had also received training with a special detached corps and as a general staff officer when the two concepts were virtually unknown to the rest of the world. This prepared Steuben for his work with the American army, where it became his task to bring uniformity and order to the drills and maneuvers of the Continental Army.</p> <p align=\"start\">The road to America began in 1763, when Steuben met Louis de St. Germain in Hamburg. St. Germain later became the French Minister of War during the American Revolution. This casual acquaintance was renewed in France while Steuben was serving as Grand Marshall to the Prince of Hollenzollern-Hechingen. He held this post from 1764-1777. As Grand Marshall, Steuben served as the administrative director for the Prince and his court. During this period, he received the Star of the Order of Fidelity on May 26, 1769, from the Duchess of Wurttemburg, a niece of Frederick the Great, whom Steuben had greatly impressed. In 1771, he received the title of Baron, from the Prince of Hollenzollern-Hechingen.</p> <p align=\"start\">From 1775 onward, Baron von Steuben began looking for work in some kind of military capacity. He inquired about serving in the British, French, and Austrian armies, but no positions materialized. In 1777, he traveled to France, where he heard talk of glories and riches to be won in a revolution across the Atlantic Ocean. Through St. Germain, Steuben was introduced to the American ambassadors to France, Silas Deane and Benjamin Franklin. However, the two ambassadors were unable to promise Steuben a rank or pay in the American army. The Continental Congress had grown tired of foreign mercenaries coming to America and demanding a high rank and pay, based on promises made to them by the American ambassadors. These men would be promoted in rank over deserving American officers, causing discontent in the army. As a result, Congress ordered the ambassadors to stop this practice. Steuben would have to go to America and present himself to Congress strictly as a volunteer. Steuben left these first meetings in disgust and returned to the German kingdoms.</p> <p align=\"start\">There Steuben was unable to find suitable employment. He therefore returned to France and prepared to set out for America, strictly as a volunteer without promise of pay or rank. His passage to America was paid by the French government. On September 26, 1777, Baron von Steuben, his Italian greyhound, Azor, Louis de Pontiere, his aide de camp, and Pierre Ettienne Duponceau, his military secretary, embarked for America to serve in the revolution. They arrived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on December 1, 1777, where they were almost arrested for being British because the Baron had mistakenly outfitted them in red uniforms. Steuben and his party then traveled overland through Boston to York, Pennsylvania, arriving there on February 5, 1778.</p> <p align=\"start\">When the Baron met with Congress, he presented them with a letter of introduction from Benjamin Franklin. The letter introduced him as \"His Excellency, Lieutenant General von Steuben, Apostle of Frederick the Great.\" Actually, Steuben had only been a captain. Through the mistranslation of Steuben's position in the Prussian army, he was presented to Congress as a much higher rank. Steuben's title while in the Prussian army as a staff officer was Deputy to the Quartermaster General. In French, it was \"Lieutenant General Quarters Maitre,\" so Franklin wrote \"Lieutenant General\" in his letter of introduction, which gave the impression that Steuben held this specific rank in the Prussian army.</p> <p align=\"start\">Arrangements were made for Steuben to be paid following the successful completion of the war according to his contributions. Congress told the Baron to report to General Washington at Valley Forge. He arrived at the camp on February 23, 1778. One soldier's first impression of the Baron was \"of the ancient fabled God of War … he seemed to me a perfect personification of Mars. The trappings of his horse, the enormous holsters of his pistols, his large size, and his strikingly martial aspect, all seemed to favor the idea.\"</p> <p align=\"start\">Steuben made a favorable enough impression upon Washington to be appointed temporary Inspector General. He went out into the camp to talk with the officers and men, inspect their huts, and scrutinize their equipment. What he found was an army short of everything, except spirit. He was quoted as saying \"no European army could have held together in such circumstances.\" Steuben set to work.</p> <p align=\"start\">His first step was to write the drills for the army. At this time, each state used different drills and maneuvers, patterned upon various European methods. As Inspector General, Steuben's task was to create one standard method, thus coordinating the entire Continental Army. As he could not speak or write English, Steuben originally wrote the drills in French, the military language of Europe at the time. The drills were then translated into English by his secretary, Duponceau, with help from John Laurens and Alexander Hamilton, two of Washington's aides-de-camp. They were then given to the brigade inspectors, who made copies of the next lesson in the orderly book for each respective brigade and regiment. Copies were taken from the orderly book to each company and then to each officer. The Baron used the Commander in Chief's personal guard unit and men from each state, about 120 men total, as a model company to demonstrate each new lesson. Steuben would write the new drills at night, staying only several days ahead of the whole army. He tried to fit his drills to the men he was teaching in the quickest possible time, by making them as simple as possible. In this way, uniform maneuvers and discipline was given to the army in a very rapid and orderly fashion.</p> <p align=\"start\">Up to this time, the American officers had accepted the British practice of letting the sergeants drill the men, as it was thought to be ungentlemanly for officers to do so. Steuben set a precedent by working with the troops directly. The American officers felt threatened by this practice, as well as by the seemingly unlimited powers of Steuben's office. Consequently, on June 15, 1778, Washington issued orders to govern the Inspector General's office until Congress took further steps. The Baron's willingness and ability to work with the men, as well as his use of profanity (in several different languages), made him popular among the soldiers.</p> <p align=\"start\">On May 6, 1778, the Continental Army showed off its newly acquired skills when they celebrated the news of the French Alliance. Many of the soldiers, officers, and civilians noticed the marked improvement and increased professionalism demonstrated by the American troops. The same day, Steuben was handed his commission from the Continental Congress, as Inspector General, with the rank of Major General. Shortly after the army left Valley Forge, they fought a battle at Monmouth Courthouse, in New Jersey. The battle was essentially a draw, but the Continental Army fought the British to a standstill.</p> <p align=\"start\">In the winter of 1778-1779, General von Steuben went to Philadelphia to write his book of regulations. Lieutenant Colonel Francois de Fleury, a French volunteer serving in the Continental Army, assisted in writing the original French text. Duponceau and Captain Benjamin Walker translated it into English. It was illustrated by Captain Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the man who would later design Washington, D.C. The \"Regulation for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States\" was approved by Congress in March 1779. It became known as the \"Blue Book,\" and it was used by the United States Army until 1814.</p> <p align=\"start\">General von Steuben rejoined the Continental Army on April 27, 1779, and he served throughout the remainder of the war. He was instructor and supply officer for General Nathanael Greene's southern army, which fought the key battles that led to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781. Steuben commanded of one of the three divisions in the Continental Army at Yorktown. In 1783, he helped demobilize the army, and resigned his commission in 1784.</p> <p align=\"start\">Throughout the war, Steuben had continually asked Congress for more money for his expenses. After the war, he continued petitioning for compensation for his services. Congress did pay a portion of the amount Steuben expected, but not all. He was granted land by the states of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, of which he sold portions, but these payments never quite offset his living expenses. Consequently, he was forced to retire from New York City to his land holdings in order to live out the remainder of his life. Steuben never married, and he died on his 16,000 acre farm tract in the Mohawk Valley of New York, on November 28, 1794.</p> <p align=\"start\">Although he never received the financial rewards he expected, Steuben will never be forgotten in the annals of American history. His administrative brilliance in organizing, training, and preparing the Continental Army for battle will ensure his legacy in the cause of American independence.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Born on July 26, 1727, in Maldon, England, Horatio Gates came to America at the age of twenty-two as a volunteer with the governor of Nova Scotia, Edward Cornwallis. In 1754, Gates rose to the position of captain and fought during the French and Indian War, suffering a wound during Major General Edward Braddock's defeat in western Pennsylvania in 1755.<br /> <br /> After the French and Indian War, Gates returned to England and retired from the Royal American Regiment. In 1772, Gates returned to America and purchased a plantation in Berkeley County, Virginia. When the American Revolution broke out in 1775, Gates, a strong supporter of independence, became a brigadier general. Promoted to major general in 1776, he took command of troops in New York (Northern Army), and turned back General Guy Carleton's invasion of northern New York in October 1776. The victory gave the Americans time to prepare for the second British invasion the following year.<br /> <br /> When British troops under the command of Major General John Burgoyne invaded New York in 1777, Gates' army defeated Burgoyne twice, on September 19, 1777 and October 7, 1777. Gates' troops forced Burgoyne to surrender his 5,700 man army near Saratoga on October 17, 1777. This victory, a major turning point of the American Revolution, convinced France to recognize American independence and form a military alliance with the Americans against Great Britain in 1778. Gates received one of seven gold medals awarded by the Continental Congress during the Revolution, the highest possible honor. Of the recipients, Gates proved to be the only one who emerged from the war with his reputation ruined by his conduct at Camden. <blockquote> <p><em>That the thanks of Congress, in their own name, and in behalf of the inhabitants of the thirteen United States, be presented to Major-General Gates, commander in chief in the northern department, and to Major-Generals Lincoln and Arnold, and the rest of the officers and troops under his command, for their brave and successful efforts in support of the independence of their country, whereby an army of the enemy of ten thousand men, has been totally defeated, one large detachment of it, strongly posted and entrenched, having been conquered at Bennington; another repulsed with loss and disgrace from Fort Schuyler; and the main army of six thousand men, under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, after being beaten in different actions and driven from a formidable post and strong entrenchments, reduced to the necessity of surrendering themselves upon terms honourable and advantageous to these states, on the 17th day of October last, to Major-General Gates; and that a medal of gold be struck under the direction of the Board of War, in commemoration of this great event, and in the name of these United States presented by the President to Major-General Gates.</em></p> </blockquote> Tensions between Gates and General George Washington grew immediately following Saratoga, after Gates informed Congress directly of his victory rather than informing his commander-in-chief. Washington was further angered that Gates did not promptly return troops sent to help Gates during the New York campaign. Washington was also convinced that Gates played a role in the Conway Cabal in late 1777, which was a supposed plot to remove Washington from command and replace him with Gates. In November 1777, Gates became president of the Board of War and technically became Washington's superior. Bickering continued between the two men as Gates drew up plans for an invasion of Canada without consulting Washington.<br /> <br /> In the spring of 1778, Gates returned to field command in the north, commanding troops in New York and Massachusetts. Gates took command of the Continental Army in the Southern Department in South Carolina in July 1780 to counter the British advance into the interior after their capture of Charleston. Gates unwittingly marched his army toward the British troops in Camden, South Carolina, despite the fact that his men were running low on supplies. This action led to the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780, which was one of the largest American defeats of the war. As the American troops retreated, Gates left the battlefield and abandoned his army, riding nearly 200 miles in three days. Alexander Hamilton wrote of Gates' conduct at Camden, questioning “But was there ever an instance of a General running away as Gates has done from his whole army? And was there ever so precipitous a flight? One hundred and eighty miles in three days and a half. It does admirable credit to the activity of a man at his time of life.” Accused of cowardice, his reputation was ruined. Gates was removed from command in October 1780. <br /> <br /> Congress briefly reinstated Gates into the army in the summer of 1782, but after uneventful service he left for the final time in 1783. In 1790, Gates sold his Virginia plantation, freed his slaves, and bought an estate in New York. He ended his career serving one term in the New York legislature from 1800-1801. Gates died on April 10, 1806.",

Nicholas followed in his father's footsteps and eventually had a thriving farm and business.<br /> <br /> In addition to his trade operations, Herkimer also made money portaging boats and goods over the \"Little Falls\" area of the valley for a fee.<br /> <br /> During the opening hostilities between England and the colonies, Herkimer was made Colonel of the Canajoharie Regiment of the Tryon County Militia. When <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sir-john-johnson.htm\">Sir John Johnson</a> fled to Canada in 1776, Herkimer was appointed to be Brigadier General of the four Regiments of Tryon County Militia. He would be using the experience he had gained as a militia lieutenant fighting with the British during the French and Indian War. This time however, he would be siding with the rebels and fighting against the British.<br /> <br /> Learning that <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-1777-siege-of-fort-schuyler.htm\">Fort Schuyler was besieged</a> by St. Barry Leger's forces, Herkimer gathered together around 800 men of the Tryon County Militia and some <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-oneida-nation-in-the-american-revolution.htm\">Oneida Indians</a> to march to the relief of the fortress. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/barry-st-leger.htm\">St. Leger</a> learned of Herkimer's advance and sent a portion of his army, made up of loyalists and Indians, to halt him. Herkimer and his troops were ambushed near the Oneida village of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-oneida-nation-in-the-american-revolution.htm\">Oriska (Oriskany)</a> on August 6, 1777. Wounded in the leg early in the fighting, the brave Palatine continued to calmly direct his troops as he smoked his pipe. The battle raged on for hours as former friends, family, and neighbors fought savagely against one another. Finally, St. Leger's forces retreated back to the fort. The militia had failed to reach the fort, but they had stood fast and held their ground.<br /> <br /> Once home, it was determined that Herkimer's leg need to be amputated. A novice surgeon performed the amputation and infection soon set in. Ten days later, while Herkimer was reading from his beloved family bible, the hero of the Mohawk Valley died.",

            "bodyText": "<h3><i>Captain John Smith was an English soldier who played a pivotal role in the establishment of permanent English colonies in the Americas. His leadership of the failing Jamestown colony, his writings and maps, as well as his negotiations with Native peoples were invaluable to both the Virginia Company of London and the Plymouth colony in Massachusetts. His story has lessons to teach us about the origins of America, government-to-government relations, and the troubled legacy of colonialism. </i></h3> <p><i></i></p> <h4><i></i><i></i>Life Before Jamestown</h4> <p>John Smith was born to middle-class farming family in Willoughby, England, either late in 1579 or early 1580. Elizabethan England had a rigid class structure, and Smith was destined to become a farmer like his father. However, when he was 16, Smith left home to become a soldier. He fought in Europe and the Middle East, rising to the rank of Captain. In Turkey, he was captured and sold into slavery, but eventually he escaped. After further campaigns in Europe and Africa, he returned to England in 1605.</p> <h4><b>John Smith in Virginia</b></h4> <p>At age 27, Captain John Smith was one of the 105 colonists who embarked on the first Virginia Company of London expedition to the Chesapeake region. During the voyage, he was accused of mutiny and imprisoned on board the ship. In the spring of 1607, the colonists landed and founded the settlement of Jamestown. Smith’s fortunes changed on arrival when letters of instruction from the Virginia Company named him to the new settlement’s governing council.<br /> <br /> In the winter of 1607, Smith was captured by the chief of the Pamunkey people, Opechancanough. He was then taken to the highest authority in the land, paramount chief <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/powhatan.htm\">Powhatan</a> in his capital town of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cajo/planyourvisit/werowocomoco.htm\">Werowocomoco</a>. While captive there, Powhatan subjected Smith to several ceremonial events which Smith describes in his journals. The most famous of these is the instance involving Powhatan’s young daughter, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/pocahontas.htm\">Pocahontas</a>, though historians have questioned Smith’s version of this event.<br /> <br /> Whatever the case, Smith was released from Werowocomoco with the understanding that he was entering into a trade relationship with Powhatan. Jamestown was expected to pay tribute, or taxes as we might call them today, to Powhatan in the form of English weapons and other goods. In exchange, Powhatan would supply food to the hungry colonists.<br /> <br /> The Virginia Company of London was a private company with a board and investors, much like companies today. While permission for the attempt was given by King James I, the crown provided no funding for the colony. Thus, the company’s first priority was to discover a way to make the Jamestown settlement profitable and provide a return on their investment.<br /> <br /> As part of this effort, John Smith set out on two long, exploratory <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cajo/learn/historyculture/the-voyages.htm\">voyages</a> throughout the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the summer of 1608. He was hoping to find what the Spanish had exploited in South America: gold and silver. Second, he would search for a “Northwest Passage,” a water route connecting the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Any city at the entrance to this passage would have instantly became a center of global trade, though today we know that no such route existed.  <br /> <br /> Instead of a Northwest Passage or precious metals, the voyages resulted in a detailed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cajo/learn/smith-maps.htm\">map</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cajo/learn/historyculture/john-smith-journals.htm\">written documentation</a> of the area’s Indigenous communities and geography. His writings attracted great attention to the Chesapeake region.<br /> <br /> Upon his return, John Smith became president of the colony’s council, bringing his middle-class background with him. He famously proclaimed, “He that will not work shall not eat,” forcing the colony’s gentlemen to labor alongside the rest of the population. For this and other reasons, his relationships with other leaders of the Jamestown governing council were often antagonistic. However, both his style of leadership and his establishment of trade with Powhatan are credited with saving the colony at this critical early stage.  <br /> <br /> Smith had several other dealings with Powhatan before he departed Virginia, some of which were successful and others that were less so. But before he could have further influence on the colony or its relationship with Powhatan, Smith was injured in a gunpowder explosion and returned to England for treatment.</p> <h4><b>Smith and New England</b></h4> <p>In 1614 and 1615, Smith returned to America, sailing the coasts of modern-day Maine and Massachusetts. He published maps and descriptions of New England (which he named), and actively promoted settlement there.The adventures and misadventures that characterized Smith's life followed him to New England. In 1615, he was captured and held hostage for three months by French Pirates. Two years later his hopes of establishing a colony in New England were dashed when mishaps at sea all but destroyed the initial supply ships. Unable to raise more funds for the project, Smith spent the rest of his life writing accounts of his exploits.</p> <h4><b>Legacy </b></h4> <p>Smith died in 1631 at the age of 51. His works were widely read and he would go down as one of the founding figures in American history. But when we remember Smith in our classrooms and history books, what should we say? On the one hand, Smith challenged the social hierarchy of the day to become a name that went down in history. He was also a colonist who supported violence and displacement. Smith was a clever soldier who traveled the world in search of adventure, even learning the Algonquian language. He also referred to American Indians as “savages.” If these statements seem contradictory, it is only because we have come to see Smith as a hero of a one-sided American origin story. In fact, John Smith’s contradictions make him a fascinating historical figure who can help us understand not only the world he came but also its influence on our world today.<br /> <br /> Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cajo/learn/historyculture/the-voyages.htm\">Captain John Smith's voyages in the Chesapeake</a>. </p>",

A Democrat from Hyde Park, New York, upon receiving the “Einstein Letter” on October 11, 1939 warning of Nazi Germany’s attempt to create an atomic bomb, he approved the creation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium, the National Defense Research Council, and the Office of Scientific Research and Development, all precursors to the Manhattan Project. In 1942, Roosevelt approved the creation of the Manhattan Engineer District, officially starting the Manhattan Project, and approved $500 million dollars for the project in December that same year.</p> <br /> <br /> In addition, FDR was instrumental in securing corporate assistance for constructing and maintaining Manhattan Project facilities as well as signing Executive Order 8802 in 1941, which banned racial discrimination in the federal government defense industries, allowing Black and Hispanic workers at Manhattan Project sites. However, these workers still met with segregation at the secret cities.<br /> <br /> His successor, Harry Truman, did not learn of the existence of the Manhattan Project until the day after FDR’s death.

Truman assumed the 33<sup>rd</sup> Presidency of the United States on April 12 upon FDR’s death. A Democrat from Lamar, Missouri, Truman only learned of the existence of the Manhattan Project the day after FDR’s death, though the project had existed for almost three years prior.</p> <br /> <br /> On June 1, 1945, having conferred with top advisors including Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Truman agreed that an atomic bomb should be used against Japan to hasten the war’s end. In late July, 1945, Truman informed Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin of the existence of this powerful weapon. On July 26, the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union issued the Potsdam Declaration, urging Japan’s unconditional surrender lest the country be met with incomprehensible destruction. Japan’s response was unclear, and with Truman’s approval, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, respectively, destroying both cities and killing or wounding hundreds of thousands of people. Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945.<br /> <br /> After the war, on August 1, 1946, Truman signed the Atomic Energy Act, putting nuclear production under civilian rather than military control and creating the Atomic Energy Commission which ultimately replaced the Manhattan Project.<br /> <br /> Learn more about Truman through the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hstr/index.htm\">Harry S.

Upon his appointment to lead this top-secret project, Groves wasted little time getting to work. The following day he purchased 1250 tons of uranium mined from Africa’s Belgian Congo. One day later, September 19, he approved Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as the location of Site X, a secret uranium-enrichment facility. On September 23 he was appointed Brigadier General.</p> <br /> <br /> By mid-October 1942, Groves had secured a contract with the DuPont corporation to oversee plutonium production, visited the Met Lab at Chicago, and chose physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to lead Project Y, of which Groves would approve its location in Los Alamos, New Mexico on November 25, 1942. On January 16, 1943, Groves approved Hanford, Washington as the site for the Manhattan Project’s massive plutonium-production facility.<br /> <br /> During his tenure as head of the Manhattan Project’s operations, Groves oversaw the efforts of over one hundred thousand workers and scientists, observed the Trinity Test first-hand on July 16, 1945, and stayed in his role after the war until late 1947, when the newly-created Atomic Energy Commission took control of the Manhattan Project. Groves retired as a Lieutenant General on February 29, 1948.",

Miles graduated from West Point in 1824 and spent the rest of his life serving in the United States military. He saw action in the Seminole War and the Mexican-American War, and by 1859 had achieved the rank of Colonel.<br /> When the Civil War began Miles was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He was brought back to Northern Virginia and put in command of an infantry brigade under Major General Robert Patterson and shortly thereafter promoted to command a division under Brigadier General Irwin McDowell.<br /> <br /> At the First Battle of Manassas, General Israel Richardson accused Miles of being intoxicated during the battle. A military court of inquiry initially found this accusation to be true but later cleared Miles of the charges. As a result of the inquiry Miles did not see command again until March of 1862 when he was assigned command of the Railroad Brigade and then reassigned as garrison commander at Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> At Harpers Ferry, when not faced with floods and attacks by Confederate forces, Miles drilled the soldiers to better prepare them for battle. The next and last battle for Miles occurred September 13-15, 1862 at Harpers Ferry. Confederate troops led by General \"Stonewall\" Jackson, surrounded the town. Miles, with orders from Major General Wool to \"be energetic and active, and defend all places to the last extremity,\" did not give up hope even when many of the \"green\" troops retreated from Maryland Heights on the first day of battle.<br /> <br /> On the evening of September 13, he instructed cavalrymen to make their way through the Confederate lines and to \"try to reach somebody that had ever heard of the United States Army, or any general of the United States Army, or anybody that knew anything about the United States Army, and report the condition of Harper's Ferry.\" He believed he could defend the place for two days. The next day, Sunday September 14, the Confederates hauled cannons to the mountaintops and Jackson awaited the flag of surrender but his commander on Loudoun Heights, John G. Walker, grew impatient and began firing upon the town about midday. By 7 p.m. that evening, Colonel Miles met with more of the cavalrymen and devised a plan for the remaining 1,400 to escape. Unaware of the departure of the cavalry and now growing impatient that the Federals had not surrendered; Jackson ordered a flanking maneuver during the night, which completely entrapped the Federals.<br /> <br /> As cannons resumed firing on the foggy morning of September 15, Miles began to wave the white flag. He was on horseback, calling for the surrender, when an artillery shell exploded behind him and a fragment ripped into his left calf, mortally wounding the garrison commander. Miles was taken back to his headquarters, the master armorer's house in Lower Town Harpers Ferry, where he would die later that day. <p> </p>",

He was born in the segregated south of Atlanta, Georgia and after graduating from Morehouse College, Crozer Theological Seminary, and Boston University he entered the Christian ministry. He married Coretta Scott King in 1953, and became a pastor in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1954, he joined the leadership of the local NAACP chapter, the Montgomery Improvement Association, and helped create the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an organization formed to provide leadership for the burgeoning civil rights movement.</span></p> <div> </div> <div>Following Rosa Parks' arrest in 1955 for refusing to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, he organized a year-long bus boycott. The \"Montgomery Movement\" led to the integration of the city's buses and launched a non-violent protest movement that spread across the United States. King, along with Fred Shuttleworth and others led the Birmingham Campaign to desegregate Birmingham, Alabama. The brutality displayed towards the Campaign's demonstrators and King's \"<a href=\"http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/letter-birmingham-city-jail-0\">Letter from a Birmingham Jail</a>\", written while he was incarcerated, brought national and international attention to the civil rights movement. Ultimately, King was arrested 30 times for his participation in civil rights activities. In 1963, he was one of the organizers for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm\">March on Washington</a> and the following year he received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1965, King helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. He worked tirelessly to assure the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and was in attendance when President Johnson signed both that Act and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. In the final years of his life, he expanded his focus to include poverty and the Vietnam War.</div> <div> </div> <div>In 1968, Martin Luther King was assassinated while in Memphis, Tennessee, to help striking sanitation workers. His legacy lives on and his writings and speeches, including \"I Have a Dream\", from the March on Washington and \"I've Been to the Mountaintop,\" given just hours before his death, continue to inspire new generations.</div>",

            "bodyText": "Eleanor Butler Alexander Roosevelt was the wife of Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and mother to their four children. Eleanor grew up as on only child to a prominent lawyer, Henry Addison Alexander, and his wife, Grace Green. She was a quiet and reserved child but always selfless. An accomplished adult, Eleanor threw herself into war efforts during WWI and WWII as well as continued to lead a philanthropic life outside war time. In her later years, she pursued photography and wrote a book, The Day Before Yesterday, where she spoke about her life with Ted Jr., and the Roosevelt family. She lived in the Old Orchard House on the Sagamore Hill property until her death in 1960.<i> </i><br /> <br /> Eleanor Butler Alexander was born into wealth in 1888. Growing up in upper class society, she was polite and well-educated but always had an altruistic attitude. She had a reputation for her quiet and reserved nature, but that changed upon meeting the Roosevelts. In her memoir, she wrote about her early memories with the family. Especially those that took place at Sagamore Hill, including a picnic she took with the extended Roosevelt family:<br /> <br /> When the idea of a picnic was first discussed, Eleanor had assumed it would involve dainty sandwiches eaten under the shade of a large tree. Instead, once confirmed, the family raced to the Cold Spring Harbor shoreline along the Sagamore Hill property, and rushed to find the best boats to travel in. This led to Ted Jr. taking off without her, and her having to travel in a leaking boat with one of his younger cousins. After two hours of rowing in the hot sun with mosquitos biting, they reached another strikingly similar shoreline to the one they had left, and rather than eat dainty sandwiches, lunch was boiled oysters. Upon their return, Eleanor assumed that there would be complaints from the heat and lack of food choices, but she was surprised when the family had instead declared it to be “one of the best picnics we ever had.”<br /> <br /> Despite the Roosevelt antics, Eleanor Bulter Alexander married Theodore Roosevelt Jr. on June 10, 1910. They had three children before the outbreak of WWI, which included their daughter Grace, and two sons, Theodore III, and Cornelius Van Schaack. Once the United States joined WWI and Theodore Jr. left to go abroad with the army, Eleanor made some difficult decisions. She wrote, “I would be a terrible wrench to leave my 3 children, but Ted might need me more than they.” She decided to sail to France to be with Ted Jr. and volunteer with the YMCA. During that time, she wrote, “for we knew we would have to work at least nine hours a day and probably more at times.” Eleanor stayed in her aunt’s home in Paris which allowed Ted Jr., and his siblings, Kermit, Archie, Quentin, Ethel, and her husband Dr. Derby, to meet up throughout the war.<br /> <br /> During the war, her father-in-law, Theodore Roosevelt, wrote to her saying, “I hear of you continually, and really the admiration expressed for what the boys have done is no stronger than the tributes paid you for your administrative ability, judgment, tact, decision of character, unselfishness, and ability to accomplish results. I doubt if I have ever known of such hearty and universal commendation being expressed for difficult work of a kind peculiarly apt to produce friction.”<br /> <br /> After the conclusion of WWI and upon their return, they had their third son, Quentin Roosevelt II, who they named after his uncle who died in the war.<br /> <br /> In the following years, Ted Jr. became the governor of Puerto Rico where Eleanor started the Needlework Relief Fund under the Bureau of Commerce and Industry to help Puerto Rican needlewomen make a living wage. She traveled, took professional photography, wrote articles, and went on speaking tours. During WWII, she again followed Ted Jr. to Europe and volunteered for American Red Cross. In June 1942, she established and ran the Red Cross club in Tidworth, England.<br /> <br /> In 1938, the Old Orchard House on the Sagamore Hill property was completed after being designed by her, Ted Jr. and their architect son-in-law. She lived there until her death in 1960. She is buried at the Youngs Memorial Cemetery in Oyster Bay, NY with her in-laws.",

Ruffin stated \"No other class of people can with great propriety meet to pay tribute to the memory of Wendell Phillips than the descendants and representatives of those for whose freedom he labored so long.\"<sup>1</sup> Phillips dedicated his life and career to the causes of abolition and social reform.</p> <p>Born on November 28, 1811, Wendell Phillips came from a family with deep New England ties. Phillips enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1831, passed the Massachusetts Bar, and opened his own law practice in Boston in 1834.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>On October 21, 1835, Phillips witnessed from the window of his Court Street office a mob search for the abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>. The mob took to the streets, angered by Garrison's abolitionist newspaper <em>The Liberator</em> and by the abolition meeting scheduled for later in the day at the headquarters of the Female Anti-Slavery Society on Washington Street.<sup>3</sup> Many accounts cite this October day as the spark for Phillips' work as an abolitionist.</p> <p>Nicknamed abolition's \"golden trumpet,\" one of Phillips' early successes as an orator came during a meeting at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/faneuil-hall.htm\">Faneuil Hall</a> when he denounced the 1837 murder of the abolitionist Elijah Lovejoy by a mob. Enraged by a speech given by Massachusetts Attorney General James T. Austin, Phillips condemned Austin's comparison of the murderous mob to Boston’s revolutionary patriots. Concluding his speech, Phillips stated,</p> <blockquote>Faneuil Hall has the right, it is her duty to strike the key note for these United States. I am glad for one reason, that remarks such as those to which I have alluded, have been uttered here. The passage of these resolutions in spite of them, will show more clearly, more decisively, the deep indignation with which Boston regards this outrage.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Soon after this event Phillips gave up his promising law practice and \"gave himself, heart and soul, to the cause of abolition.\"<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Wendell Phillips served with other prominent abolitionists, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a>, on the Boston Vigilance Committee executive committee.<sup>6</sup> Phillips actively advocated for disunion from the slave-holding South and in 1854 was indicted for his role in the attempt to aide freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>During the Civil War, Phillips staunchly advocated for the raising of Black regiments, including the 54th Massachusetts. He gave many speeches in support of these regiments and encouraging men to join in the war effort.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>After the abolition of slavery, Phillips continued to be a staunch supporter of social reform and civil rights. Phillips fought for women's suffrage and at the 1873 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/boston-womens-tea-party.htm\">New England Women's Tea Party</a>, he notably stated \"…Women shall have her share at the ballot-box. The founders of this great government are represented by them. They are the lineal descendants and representatives of 1776.\"<sup>9</sup> In addition to his work for women's suffrage, Phillips also spoke in favor of equal rights for Native Americans, arguing that the fifteenth amendment granted them citizenship.<sup>10</sup> In 1870, Phillips unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Massachusetts.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>On February 2, 1884 Wendell Phillips died after suffering from heart disease.<sup>12</sup> Following his death, Reverend Joseph Cook wrote of Phillips in a <em>Boston Globe</em> article, \"What cares he for our praise or blame? Fifty years hence men will not ask what Boston thought of Wendell Phillips but what did Phillips think of Boston.\"<sup>13</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Archibald H.

He had a difficult family life. He barely knew his mother, who lived on a different plantation and died when he was a young child. He never discovered the identity of his father. At the age of six, he was separated from his grandmother and sent to Wye House Plantation in Maryland.[1] When he turned eight years old, his slaveowner hired him out to work as a body servant in Baltimore. <br /> <br /> At an early age, Frederick realized there was a connection between literacy and freedom. Not allowed to attend school, he taught himself to read and write in the streets of Baltimore. At twelve, he bought a book called <em>The Columbian Orator</em>. It was a collection of revolutionary speeches, debates, and writings on natural rights.<br /> <br /> When Frederick was fifteen, his slaveowner sent him back to the Eastern Shore to labor as a fieldhand. Frederick rebelled intensely. He educated other slaves, physically fought back against a \"slave-breaker,\" and plotted an unsuccessful escape.<br /> <br /> Frustrated, his slaveowner returned him to Baltimore. This time, Frederick met a young free Black woman named </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/people.htm\"><span style=\"color:null;\">Anna Murray</span></a><span style=\"color:null;\">, who agreed to help him escape. On September 3, 1838, he disguised himself as a sailor and boarded a northbound train, using money from Anna to pay for his ticket. In less than 24 hours, after traveling by train, ferry boat, and on foot, Frederick arrived in New York City and declared himself free. He had successfully escaped from slavery.<br /> <br /> <br /> <span class=\"section_title\">The Abolitionist Movement</span><br /> <br /> After escaping from slavery, Frederick married Anna. They decided that New York City was not a safe place for Frederick to remain as a fugitive, so they settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts. There, they adopted the last name \"Douglass\" and they started their family, which would eventually grow to include five children: Rosetta, Lewis, Frederick Jr., Charles, and Annie.<br /> <br /> After finding employment as a laborer, Douglass began to attend abolitionist meetings and speak about his experiences in slavery. He soon gained a reputation as an orator, landing a job as an agent for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. The job took him on speaking tours across the North and Midwest.<br /> <br /> Douglass's fame as an orator increased as he traveled. Still, some of his audiences suspected he was not truly a fugitive slave. In 1845, he published his first autobiography, <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em>, to lay those doubts to rest. The narrative gave a clear record of names and places from his enslavement.<br /> <br /> To avoid being captured and re-enslaved, Douglass traveled overseas. For almost two years, he gave speeches and sold copies of his narrative in England, Ireland, and Scotland. When abolitionists offered to purchase his freedom, Douglass accepted and returned home to the United States legally free. He relocated Anna and their children to Rochester, New York.<br /> <br /> In Rochester, Douglass took his work in new directions. He embraced the women's rights movement, helped people on the Underground Railroad, and supported anti-slavery political parties. Once an ally of William Lloyd Garrison and his followers, Douglass started to work more closely with Gerrit Smith and </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a><span style=\"color:null;\">. He bought a printing press and ran his own newspaper, <em>The North Star</em>. In 1855, he published his second autobiography, <em>My Bondage and My Freedom</em>, which expanded on his first autobiography and challenged racial segregation in the North.<br /> <br /> <br /> <span class=\"section_title\">Woman Suffrage</span><br /> <br /> Douglass was active with the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society, and it was through this organization that he met <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">Elizabeth M’Clintock</span>. In July of 1848, M’Clintock invited Douglass to attend the </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wori/index.htm\">First Women’s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York</a><span style=\"color:null;\">. Douglass readily accepted, and his participation at the convention revealed his commitment to woman suffrage. He was the only African American to attend. In an issue of the <i style=\"box-sizing:border-box\">North Star</i> published shortly after the convention, Douglass wrote,</span> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><span style=\"color:null;\">In respect to political rights, we hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man. We go farther, and express our conviction that all political rights which it is expedient for man to exercise, it is equally so for women. All that distinguishes man as an intelligent and accountable being, is equally true of woman; and if that government is only just which governs by the free consent of the governed, there can be no reason in the world for denying to woman the exercise of the elective franchise, or a hand in making and administering the laws of the land. Our doctrine is, that “Right is of no sex.”</span></em></p> <span style=\"color:null;\">Douglass continued to support the cause of women after the 1848 convention. In 1866 Douglass, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, founded the American Equal Rights Association, an organization that demanded universal suffrage. Though the group disbanded just three years later due to </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/comrades-in-conflict.htm\">growing tension between women’s rights activists and Africa-American rights activists</a><span style=\"color:null;\">, Douglass remained influential in both movements, championing the cause of equal rights until his death in 1895.<br /> <br /> <span class=\"section_title\">Civil War and Reconstruction</span><br /> <br /> In 1861, the nation erupted into civil war over the issue of slavery. Frederick Douglass worked tirelessly to make sure that emancipation would be one of the war's outcomes. He recruited African-American men to fight in the U.S. Army, including two of his own sons, who served in the famous 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. When black troops protested they were not receiving pay and treatment equal to that of white troops, Douglass met with President Abraham Lincoln to advocate on their behalf.<br /> <br /> As the Civil War progressed and emancipation seemed imminent, Douglass intensified the fight for equal citizenship. He argued that freedom would be empty if former slaves were not guaranteed the rights and protections of American citizens. A series of postwar amendments sought to make some of these tremendous changes. The 13th Amendment (ratified in 1865) abolished slavery, the 14th Amendment (ratified in 1868) granted national birthright citizenship, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-fifteenth-amendment.htm\">15th Amendment</a><span style=\"color:null;\"> (ratified in 1870) stated nobody could be denied voting rights on the basis of race, skin color, or previous servitude.<br /> <br /> In 1872, the Douglasses moved to Washington, D.C. There were multiple reasons for their move: Douglass had been traveling frequently to the area ever since the Civil War, all three of their sons already lived in the federal district, and the old family home in Rochester had burned. A widely known public figure by the time of Reconstruction, Douglass started to hold prestigious offices, including assistant secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission, legislative council member of the D.C. Territorial Government, board member of Howard University, and president of the Freedman's Bank.<br /> <br /> <br /> <span class=\"section_title\">Post-Reconstruction and Death</span><br /> <br /> After the fall of Reconstruction, Frederick Douglass managed to retain high-ranking federal appointments. He served under five presidents as U.S. Marshal for D.C. (1877-1881), Recorder of Deeds for D.C. (1881-1886), and Minister Resident and Consul General to Haiti (1889-1891). Significantly, he held these positions at a time when violence and fraud severely restricted African-American political activism.<br /> <br /> On top of his federal work, Douglass kept a vigorous speaking tour schedule. His speeches continued to agitate for racial equality and women's rights. In 1881, Douglass published his third autobiography, <em>Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</em>, which took a long view of his life's work, the nation's progress, and the work left to do. Although the nation had made great strides during Reconstruction, there was still injustice and a basic lack of freedom for many Americans.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck Douglass's life in 1882 when Anna died from a stroke. He remarried in 1884 to </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/people.htm\"><span style=\"color:null;\">Helen Pitts</span></a><span style=\"color:null;\">, an activist and the daughter of former abolitionists.

They traveled to Europe and Africa in 1886-1887, and they took up temporary residence in Haiti during Douglass's service there in 1889-1891.<br /> <br /> On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting for the National Council of Women.

He was buried next to his wife Anna in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York. His second wife, Helen, joined them in the Douglass family plot after her death in 1903.[3]<br /> <br /> <br /> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-abd45283-c2f1-670f-bec1-588660fcbbc7\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/frederickdouglass.htm\"><span style=\"color:null;\">View more images of Frederick Douglass.</span></a></b><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> [1] Wye House Plantation was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970.<br /> <br /> [2] Frederick and Anna moved into their DC home in 1877, naming it Cedar Hill.

            "bodyText": "Facing racial and gender discrimination, Edmonia Lewis overcame several barriers to achieve international recognition and acclaim as a sculptor.<sup>1 </sup>While her unique background often attracted as much interest as her works of art, Lewis managed to carve out her own identity as an artist. Her success paved the way for artists of color and proved that artistic genius did not belong exclusively to the White race.<br /> <br /> While many accounts of Lewis’s early life exist, specific details remain inconsistent. Believed to have been born in 1844 to an African American father and Chippewa mother, she grew up in Greenbush, New York.<sup>2</sup> Both parents died early in her life, leaving her to live with her aunts. With financial aid from her brother, Lewis left New York to pursue a higher education. In 1859, she arrived at Oberlin College, a school known for its liberal and abolitionist views. There, she studied art until serious allegations threatened her life.<sup>3</sup> Accused of poisoning two schoolmates, a mob attacked her and left her badly beaten. Lewis’s lawyer, John Mercer Langston, convinced authorities to drop the charges against her due to a lack of evidence. Yet she continued to face hostility. Lewis had little choice but to leave the school after being denied the opportunity to register for a final term.<sup>4</sup><br /> <br /> Lewis then moved to Boston to pursue a career in art.<sup>5</sup> The abolitionist community offered her support and encouragement. Notable women including Lydia Maria Child, Maria Weston Chapman and Elizabeth Peabody commissioned her work and gave her career advice. As her skills progressed, Lewis created likenesses of notable leaders including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-brown.htm\">John Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>.<sup>6</sup> Her<i> Bust of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robert-gould-shaw-massachusetts-54th-regiment-memorial.htm\">Robert Gould Shaw</a></i> received praise from the Shaw family and established her as a well-known artist.<sup>7</sup><br /> <br /> Despite the support from the abolitionist community, Lewis did not want to receive praise for being “a colored girl” and felt her race limited her in the United States.<sup>8</sup> Arriving in Rome, fellow American expatriate artists welcomed Lewis and offered her guidance. Lewis developed close relationships with this community of women including Charlotte Cushman, Anne Whitney, and Harriet Hosmer.<sup>9</sup> Her career thrived in Rome and her studio became a fashionable stop for prominent tourists such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>.<sup>10</sup> Over the years, Lewis continued to sculpt leaders of the anti-slavery movement, religious figures, and subjects that her own dual heritage inspired. Lewis lived in Europe for the rest of her life, occasionally traveling back to the United States to showcase her art.<br /> <br /> Little information remains about the later years of Lewis’s life. In 2012, an investigation led by historian Marilyn Richardson uncovered the burial site of Lewis in London. Initially buried in an unmarked grave, Lewis rests in St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Cemetery.<sup>11</sup> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li> <p>Samella S.

He excelled in school and by age sixteen supported himself as a public school teacher. According to his obituary, Bishop's \"deep interest in the anti-slavery question at that period- an interest which did not flag until the question was settled – brought him an opportunity to lend an active hand in its agitation.\" He soon became the business manager, publishing agent, and assistant treasurer of the New York Anti-Slavery Society, and assistant editor of <em>Friend of Man</em>, an anti-slavery publication based out of Utica, New York.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>By the early 1840s, Bishop moved to Boston. He soon clerked in a law office before being admitted to the bar in 1844. While living in this hub of abolitionism, Bishop continued his work in the antislavery movement. He addressed a meeting of the Norfolk County Anti-Society in 1842 and spoke at an abolitionist celebration marking the eleventh anniversary of British Emancipation in 1845. During the latter, he discussed the Latimer war in Boston, referring to the case of George Latimer, arrested as a fugitive in the city several years earlier. Although it is unclear if Bishop participated in the Latimer case, he clearly involved himself in assisting freedom seekers. He served on the Executive Committee of the first Vigilance Committee in the city. This organization, founded by Charles Torrey in 1841, dedicated itself to \"secure to persons of color the enjoyment of their constitutional and legal rights.\"<sup>2</sup> Along with Torrey, Bishop co-authored <em>To the Friends of the Slave, In New-England</em>. In this 1841 letter, published in the <em>Liberator</em>, they wrote:</p> <blockquote>It is well known, that many of the victims of southern oppression, goaded by multiplied wrongs, endeavor, from time to time, to escape their chains; and, guided by the star of liberty, seek a place of refuge in the free North, or in Canada. Often, while the human hounds are on their track, they reach our State, but a few hours in advance of their pursuers...To meet these and similar cases of oppression and hardship, and to secure the prompt enforcement of our own laws, for the protection of the liberties of the colored race, it has been thought advisable to do as our New-York brethren have done, to organize a Vigilance Committee, whose special business it shall be to attend to all these classes of cases, as they may occur, and thus secure a greater efficiency of action, and greater certainty and economy in the employment of every lawful means to accomplish the ends we have in view...it is believed that New-England will soon cease to be the slaveholder’s hunting-ground.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Though this first iteration of the Boston Vigilance Committee disbanded rather quickly, Bishop later joined the 1850 Vigilance Committee, formed in response to the Fugitive Slave Law. He listed his place of employment, where he worked as a \"counsellor,\" as 46 Washington Street on the Vigilance Committee's broadside.<sup>4</sup> Following the courthouse rescue of freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-rescued-from-the-fangs-of-the-slave-hunter-the-case-of-shadrach-minkins.htm\">Shadrach Minkins</a> in 1851, Bishop served as one of the \"counsel for defence\" for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joseph-k-hayes.htm\">Joseph K. Hayes</a>, whom authorities arrested for his alleged role in the successful raid that freed the fugitive.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>With the publication of his legal work <em>Commentaries on the Law of Marriage and Divorce</em> in 1852, Bishop shifted his focus from practicing law to writing about it. Despite withdrawing from the public eye, however, Bishop remained active in the anti-slavery movement and publicly called for \"enfranchising and arming southern slaves during the Civil War.\"<sup>6</sup> He published <em>Secession and Slavery</em> in which he argued for \"Congress to pass an act giving not only freedom, but the elective franchise to the slaves of the seceded States.\"<sup>7</sup></p> <p>In his later years, Bishop \"lived nearly as a recluse, researching and writing on the law, and generally declining to address other issues of public concern.\"<sup>8</sup> According to one obituary, he devoted himself \"to the drudgery of legal authorship\" which garnered him both national and international acclaim. Some scholars considered him to be the \"foremost law writer of the age\" and he even earned an honorary degree from the University of Berne, Switzerland.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>Bishop died in his home in Cambridge in November, 1901.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li><em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>, November 5, 1901, 5.</li> <li><em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>, November 5, 1901, 5; <em>The Liberator</em>, January 28, 1842, 3; <em>The Liberator</em>, August 8, 1845, 3; <em>The Liberator</em>, June 11, 1841.</li> <li><em>The Liberator</em>, June 11, 1841.</li> <li>NPS maps provide the approximate location of 46 Washington Street in the 1850s. \"Members of the Committee of Vigilance,\" broadside printed by John Wilson, 1850, Massachusetts Historical Society.</li> <li>\"Members of the Committee of Vigilance,\" broadside printed by John Wilson, 1850, Massachusetts Historical Society; <em>Boston City Directory</em>, 1854, 39, <a href=\"https://cdm.bostonathenaeum.org/digital/collection/p16057coll32/id/81\">https://cdm.bostonathenaeum.org/digital/collection/p16057coll32/id/81</a>; <em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>, February 27, 1851, 2.</li> <li>\"Joel Bishop,\" <em>American National Biography</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 830-831, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/americannational0002unse/page/830/mode/2up?q=%22Joel+Bishop%22\">https://archive.org/details/americannational0002unse/page/830/mode/2up?q=%22Joel+Bishop%22</a>.</li> <li><em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>, January 29, 1866, 1.</li> <li>\"Joel Bishop,\"<em> American National Biography</em>, 830-831.</li> <li><em>Boston Evening Transcript</em>, November 5, 1901, 5.</li> </ol>",

            "bodyText": "<p>A plaque, inconspicuously attached to 103 Charles Street, recognizes the work of a significant Beacon Hill activist from the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. Mainly a list of accomplishments, its words do not fully capture Ruffin’s “fighting spirit.”<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> An activist at heart, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin assumed many public roles throughout her life, from publisher and clubwoman to community leader and national organizer. Called “a woman of rare force of character, mental alertness and of generous impulses” by Booker T. Washington, Ruffin dedicated her life to bettering the lives of women and African Americans both locally and nationally.<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> </p> <p>Born in the small Black community of Beacon Hill in 1842, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin grew up surrounded by the abolitionist ideals of justice, equality, and political representation. Her earliest public service dates to the Civil War, during which Ruffin recruited African American men for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54<sup>th</sup></a> and 55<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts infantry regiments.<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> After the war, Ruffin served on several charities that helped Southern Blacks.<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> In the following decades, Ruffin participated in numerous clubs and service organizations in the Boston area, often skillfully maneuvering between White and Black communities to do so.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/womans-era-club.htm\">Woman’s Era Club</a>, a club primarily for Black women, was one of Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin’s greatest achievements. Established in 1893, the Woman’s Era Club had two purposes: to offer its members opportunities for self-improvement and to address issues that directly affected the African American community, from local politics and education to the debilitating discrimination and terrorism of Black Americans in the South. The club’s corresponding publication, <em>The Woman’s Era</em>, quickly became the nationally recognized voice of Black clubwomen. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and her daughter, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florida-ruffin-ridley.htm\">Florida Ruffin Ridley</a>, used this publication to bring Black clubwomen to Boston in 1895 for the first <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/1895-convention.htm\">National Conference of Colored Women in America</a>.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a> </sup></p> <p>In her opening address of the conference, Ruffin announced the launch of a new movement, one in which women of color were “coming to the front, willing to join any others in the same work and cordially inviting and welcoming any others to join us.”<a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> She hoped this conference would encourage Black women to unify under a single organization and “in truth bring a new era to the colored women of America.”<a href=\"#_ftn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Ruffin’s dream came true; on the final day of the conference, these clubwomen formed the National Federation of Afro-American Women, which served as a precursor to the National Association of Colored Women.<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Although Ruffin ultimately did not take significant leadership roles in the following organization, she participated in other regional and local Black women's organizations, such as the Northeastern Federation of Women's Clubs and, later, the League of Women for Community Service.</p> <p>In addition to laying the foundation for the Black clubwomen's movement, Josephine Ruffin supported the local suffrage movement. While women’s suffrage was not the only cause that caught Ruffin’s eye, she undoubtedly saw suffrage as a step towards greater equality. Ruffin looked up to the Boston abolitionists and women’s rights activists, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-stone.htm\">Lucy Stone</a> and Julia Ward Howe, who welcomed her into the movement because they “were broad enough to include ‘no distinction because of race’ with ‘no distinction because of sex.’”<a href=\"#_ftn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Through their encouragement, Ruffin joined and accepted leadership positions in local and national suffrage organizations, many of which were dominated by White women, including the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mwsa.htm\">Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association (MWSA)</a>, and the Massachusetts School Suffrage Association (MSSA).<a href=\"#_ftn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> In these roles, she unflinchingly criticized New England for its hypocritical claims of celebrating liberty and equality: “It is my belief that the sentiment of New England favors ‘all rights for all,’ except the ballot for women.”<a href=\"#_ftn11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p> <p>Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin particularly encouraged suffrage in Boston’s African American communities. Under the auspices of the MWSA, Ruffin led an organized effort in 1885 to reach out to men and women in the Beacon Hill and West End neighborhoods, which were home to Boston’s African American community. In the months leading to the election, Ruffin helped organize meetings at churches and private homes on Beacon Hill, during which local leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, Archibald Grimke, Lucy Stone, and Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin herself spoke in favor of women’s suffrage. They encouraged women to register to vote in school elections (a right Massachusetts women had won in 1879<a href=\"#_ftn12\"><sup>[12]</sup></a>), and men to vote for a Ward 9 representative who supported municipal suffrage for women.<a href=\"#_ftn13\"><sup>[13]</sup></a> In 1887, Ruffin helped establish the West End Suffrage League (an affiliate of the MWSA), and served as its first president. Other local Black leaders comprised the club’s 45 founding members, including former state representative <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a> and religious activist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eliza-ann-gardner.htm\">Eliza Gardner</a>.<a href=\"#_ftn14\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The League’s motto, “All rights for all,” reflected the community’s belief in equality across both race and sex.<a href=\"#_ftn15\"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p> <p>Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin’s distinct voice on the suffrage movement’s intersection with race most clearly came through in her editorial in the 1915 special suffrage edition of the NAACP journal <em>The Crisis</em>. Proudly announcing her dedication to “suffrage work in Massachusetts for forty years and more,” Ruffin called on African Americans to support suffrage.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a> </sup>Like many of her contemporary activists who had lived through abolition, Ruffin saw the connections between the plight of women and that of African Americans. As a Black woman, she inherently felt the responsibility to fight against the many forms of injustice on both fronts. For her, women’s suffrage served as a stepping stone to more expansive civil rights: “We are justified in believing that the success of this movement for equality of the sexes means more progress toward equality of the races.”<a href=\"#_ftn17\"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> \"Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin,” <em>Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction</em>, ed.

            "bodyText": "<p>A leader of Boston’s Black community on Beacon Hill, Lewis Hayden took on causes for the protection and benefit of those in his community and beyond.</p> <p>Born enslaved in Kentucky, Lewis Hayden spent the first decades of his life in slavery. His first wife, Esther Harvey, and son had been sold to Kentucky politician <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-clay.htm\">Henry Clay</a>, who later sold them to another slave trader; Hayden never saw them again.<sup>1</sup> He married Harriet Hayden in 1842, and with their son, Joseph, they escaped to freedom in the mid-1840s. The Haydens traveled to Detroit and then Canada. At some point, most likely in 1845, they had their daughter, Elizabeth. They eventually settled in Boston, where Lewis established a successful clothing store.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>An integral figure in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/boston-s-underground-railroad.htm\">Boston’s Underground Railroad</a> network, Lewis Hayden assumed numerous duties in the local abolitionist movement. He served on the executive committee of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, and his and Harriet’s home became a meeting place for abolitionists and a safe house for freedom seekers. Numerous Vigilance Committee records note Lewis Hayden (likely with the help of Harriet) boarding freedom seekers, raising funds, donating clothes, and transporting freedom seekers outside of Boston.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Lewis Hayden’s support for freedom seekers and abhorrence for the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law led to direct and sometimes dangerous action. In 1850, Hayden protected <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">William and Ellen Craft</a>, who had escaped from Georgia two years earlier and had recently been the subject of warrants for their return to slavery. Sheltering William Craft, Hayden barricaded his doorway and threatened slavecatchers if they pursued the Crafts.<sup>4</sup> In two instances, Lewis Hayden led raids on the Boston Courthouse; first in the rescue of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-rescued-from-the-fangs-of-the-slave-hunter-the-case-of-shadrach-minkins.htm\">Shadrach Minkins</a> in 1851 and second in the unsuccessful attempt to free <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a> in 1854.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>In addition to his Underground Railroad work, Lewis Hayden played other prominent roles in his community. He served as Grand Master of the Prince Hall Masons and presided over numerous community meetings, particularly those in response to the Fugitive Slave Law. In the 1850s, he worked with other community leaders, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-cooper-nell.htm\">William Cooper Nell</a>, in the struggle to integrate Boston Public Schools.<sup>6</sup> In the late 1850s, he began serving as Messenger to the Secretary of State, a politically appointed position which gave him access to many high profile leaders in state government. Likely one of the first Black state employees, Hayden held this position for 30 years.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>During the Civil War, Lewis Hayden recruited Black soldiers for the Massachusetts civil war regiments, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">Massachusetts 54th Infantry Regiment</a>. Following the Civil War, Hayden served as one of the first Black members of the Massachusetts General Court, an elected representative in the state legislature.<sup>8</sup> As a representative, Lewis Hayden lent his support in the fight for women’s suffrage, serving on the Committee on Woman Suffrage and advocating for legislative measures to provide women with the right to vote. Remembering the work of women in the abolitionist movement, Hayden recalled, \"My race can never repay the debt we owe to such as these [suffragists]. I should be indeed an ingrate, if I did not work and vote for the enfranchisement of women.\"<sup>9</sup></p> <p>When Hayden died in 1889, William Bowditch wrote, “Lewis Hayden’s career from first to last ought to prove a beacon light to every one of us. God grant that we may not shut our eyes to the way it points out to us.”<sup>10</sup></p> <h2>Learn more...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/lewis-and-harriet-hayden-house.htm\">Lewis and Harriet Hayden House</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=BA117BF0-97CC-43C0-D0B9010B67E016EB\">Fighting for Freedom: Lewis Hayden and the Underground Railroad</a></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Stephen Kantrowitz, <em>More Than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic, 1829-1889</em> (New York: Penguin, 2012) 90.</li> <li>James Horton and Lois Horton, <em>Black Bostonians: Family Life and Community Struggle in the Antebellum North</em> (New York: Holmes & Meier Publishers, Inc., 1999) 58; Kathryn Grover and Janine V.

            "bodyText": "Vernon Baker was born on December 17, 1919, in Cheyenne, Wyoming. When Baker was four years old, his parents died in a car accident. He and his two sisters went to live with their paternal grandparents in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and later in Clarinda, Iowa.<br /> <br /> Baker graduated from high school in Clarinda, Iowa, in 1937. For several years, he worked as a shoeshine and a railroad porter. In April 1941, he tried unsuccessfully to enlist in the U.S. Army. The recruiter told him he could not enlist because “We don’t have any quotas for you people.” Baker tried again in June with a different recruiter, who accepted him. Although he wanted to be a quartermaster, the recruiter assigned him to the infantry. Baker later recalled, “I didn’t say anything because I was going to get in.”<br /> <br /> Baker was sent to Camp Wolters, Texas, for basic training. Afterward, he was stationed with the Twenty-fifth Infantry, one of the historic Buffalo Soldier regiments, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. While at Fort Huachuca, he quickly rose to the rank of staff sergeant. Because of his work ethic and abilities, he was nominated to attend officer candidate school in October 1942 at Fort Benning, Georgia. Initially, Baker hesitated to accept the opportunity because he was comfortable at Fort Huachuca and enjoyed his job and his fellow soldiers. Finally, Baker accepted the opportunity to better himself. <br /> <br /> Baker completed the 13-week officer-training course and was commissioned a second lieutenant on January 11, 1943. He was briefly assigned to Camp Rucker, Alabama, before being transferred back to Fort Huachuca, where he was a weapons platoon leader in the all-Black 370th Infantry Regiment in the 92nd Infantry Division. The 92nd Division was one of two segregated all-Black divisions in World War II. By April 1944, Baker and the rest of the 92nd Infantry Division had completed field maneuvers at Camp Polk, Louisiana, learned they would be soon ship out to join the Fifth U.S. Army in Italy.<br /> <br /> On July 15, 1944, Lieutenant Baker and 7,000 other men boarded the SS Mariposa at Newport News, Virginia. During the two-week voyage to Italy, Baker and his platoon grew close. They arrived in Naples, Italy, on July 28, 1944. <br /> <br /> On October 8, 1944, Baker and his company were ordered to attack a German-held house in Seravezza, Italy. Two days earlier, Baker’s friend, Lieutenant Al Frazier, had been killed in an attack on the same location. During the mission Baker and another soldier were able to kill five Germans inside the house while the rest of his men created a diversion and drew the fire of the German machine gun position nearby. <br /> <br /> While the mission was a success, it came at a cost. Two of Baker’s men were killed by machine-gun fire before the rest of his men were able to take out the position. Although Baker was wounded in the arm, he did not notice his injury until he returned to camp. He spent the next two months recuperating from his wounds at a military hospital in Pisa, Italy. On December 26, he returned to his unit near Sommocolonia, Italy. He witnessed the battle and the artillery barrage that fellow-Medal of Honor recipient <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/johnfox.htm\">Lieutenant John R. Fox</a> called in on his own position to halt the German attack on the area.<br /> <br /> In the pre-dawn hours of April 5, 1945, Baker and the rest of Company C, First Battalion, 370th Infantry led an attack on Castle Aghinolfi, where the Germans had an artillery position and stronghold. Previous attempts to take the German position ended in disaster for the Americans. On the way up the hill, Baker surveyed the terrain and spotted two Germans in an observation post and another two in a hidden machine-gun position. Baker advanced and killed the four Germans with his M1 Garand rifle. He continued to attack German positions to make it safe for his men. By this time, German mortars were landing among Baker’s men. His company received heavy causalities; lacking reinforcements, they were ordered to retreat. Baker was one of the last of his company to retreat. On the way back, he found two more concealed German positions that he neutralized before returning to the American lines. By the time they reached safety, Baker and his men endured 12 hours of intense combat.<br /> <br /> The next day, Baker was assigned to lead another group of men, this time from the 473rd Infantry, up the hill to take the castle. Upon reaching the castle, they saw that the Germans had abandoned the position. They succeeded in capturing the strategic position. On July 4, 1945, Baker was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross at Genoa, Italy, for his actions.<br /> <br /> Baker survived the war and remained in Italy on occupation duty until February 1947. His military service included action during the Korean War, when he commanded an all-white airborne company. He retired from the military in 1968 after 27 years of service. He then worked for the Red Cross for more than 20 years.<br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, the Department of Defense began to study the issue of why no African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II. The investigation looked at historical documents including Distinguished Service Cross paperwork. It was determined that Black soldiers had been denied consideration for the Medal of Honor in World War II because of their race. The report put forward seven men who deserved the Medal of Honor for their actions. Vernon Baker was one of them. President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal of Honor to Baker on January 13, 1997. He was the only one of the seven still alive to receive his Medal of Honor.<br /> <br /> Baker died on July 13, 2010, at the age of 90 in Saint Maries, Idaho. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Section 59, Grave 4408 with full military honors.<br /> <br /> Vernon Baker’s Medal of Honor citations reads: <br /> “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: First Lieutenant Vernon J. Baker distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 5 and 6 April 1945. At 0500 hours on 5 April 1945, Lieutenant Baker advanced at the head of his weapons platoon, along with Company C’s three rifle platoons, towards their objective: Castle Aghinolfi - a German mountain strong point on the high ground just east of the coastal highway and about two miles from the 370th infantry Regiment's line of departure. Moving more rapidly than the rest of the company, Lieutenant Baker and about 25 men reached the south side of a draw some 250 yards from the castle within two hours. In reconnoitering for a suitable position to set up a machine gun, Lieutenant Baker observed two cylindrical objects pointing out of a slit in a mount at the edge of a hill. Crawling up and under the opening, he stuck his M-1 into the slit and emptied the clip, killing the observation post’s two occupants. Moving to another position in the same area, Lieutenant Baker stumbled upon a well-camouflaged machine gun nest, the crew of which was eating breakfast. He shot and killed both enemy soldiers. After Captain John F. Runyon, Company C’s Commander joined the group, a German soldier appeared from the draw and hurled a grenade which failed to explode. Lieutenant Baker shot the enemy soldier twice as he tried to flee. Lieutenant Baker then went down into the draw alone. There he blasted open the concealed entrance of another dugout with a hand grenade, shot one German soldier who emerged after the explosion, tossed another grenade into the dugout and entered firing his sub-machine gun, killing two more Germans. As Lieutenant Baker climbed back out of the draw, enemy machine gun and mortar fire began to inflict heavy casualties among the group of 25 soldiers, killing or wounding about two-thirds of them. When expected reinforcements did not arrive, Captain Runyon ordered a withdrawal in two groups. Lieutenant Baker volunteered to cover the withdrawal of the first group, which consisted mostly of walking wounded, and to remain to assist in the evacuation of the more seriously wounded. During the second group's withdrawal, Lieutenant Baker, supported by covering fire from one of his platoon members, destroyed two machine gun positions (previously bypassed during the assault) with hand grenades. In all, Lieutenant Baker accounted for nine enemy dead soldiers, elimination of three machine gun positions, an observation post, and a dugout. On the following night, Lieutenant Baker voluntary led a battalion advance through enemy mine fields and heavy fire toward the division objective. Lieutenant Baker’s fighting spirit and daring leadership were an inspiration to his men and exemplify the highest traditions of the military service.”<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "William Henry Thompson was born on August 26, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York. Not much is known about Thompson’s childhood. During his teen years, he dropped out of school and spent time on the streets of New York City.<br /> <br /> Thompson enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1945 in the Bronx, New York. After basic training, he was stationed in Adak, Alaska, on the far western tip of the Aleutian Islands. After 18 months in Alaska, Thompson reenlisted, this time with the 6th Infantry Division (ID) stationed in South Korean on occupation duty. After the 6th ID returned to the United States, Thompson transferred to the Twenty-Fourth Infantry in Japan on post-World War II occupation duty. <br /> <br /> On June 25, 1950, the North Korean army invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War. The United States, acting under the auspices of the United Nations, came to the defense of the South Koreans. With the intervention of the United States, the communist Chinese joined the North Koreans in trying to repulse the Americans and South Koreans. <br /> <br /> Thompson first saw combat on July 22, 1950, at the Battle of Sangju. The North Koreans were able to easily disperse the Twenty-Fourth Infantry with rifle fire. From that point forward, many high-ranking officers distrusted the Twenty-Fourth. Viewing the all-Black unit through a racist lens, the officers dismissed the regiment as cowardly. However, historians today point to the lackluster training the regiment received from its white officers. <br /> <br /> On August 6, 1950, Thompson’s platoon from Company M, Twenty-Fourth Infantry, had just cleared the hamlet of Haman, South Korea, when they were attacked by a large group of North Koreans with automatic weapon fire and hand grenades. Because he had one of two heavy weapons in the platoon— a .30 caliber M1917 Browning machine gun—Thompson was ordered to engage the enemy. As the two gunners were getting into place, Thompson’s fellow machine-gunner was killed by a North Korean grenade.<br /> <br /> Thompson continued engaging with the enemy with calm bursts of machine-gun fire. The North Koreans started to focus their fire on Thompson’s position, wounding Thompson numerous times with rifle fire and grenade fragments. Nevertheless, Thompson forced the North Koreans to take cover and delay their advance. During the lull in action Lieutenant Herbert H. Wilson ordered Thompson’s platoon to retreat. Thompson refused multiple times. Thompson’s final words to Wilson were, “Get out of here! I’ll cover you.” <br /> <br /> Wilson and the other men were able to go to higher ground for a better defensive position. As they were setting up, they continued to hear Thompson’s machine gun firing until multiple hand grenades exploded and the sound of Thompson’s machine gun stopped. <br /> <br /> A few days later, fellow members of Company M, Twenty-Fourth Infantry recovered Thompson’s body. Around him were the numerous bodies of the North Koreans that were trying to overrun his position. Thompson was buried at the Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.<br /> <br /> Private First Class William H. Thompson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on June 21, 1951, at a ceremony at the Pentagon. General Omar Bradley presented the medal to Thompson’s mother. Thompson was the first African American to be awarded the Medal of Honor during the Korean War.<br /> <br /> Thompson’s Medal of Honor citation reads: <br /> “Pfc. Thompson distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. While his platoon was reorganizing under cover of darkness, fanatical enemy forces in overwhelming strength launched a surprise attack on the unit. Pfc. Thompson set up his machine gun in the path of the onslaught and swept the enemy with withering fire, pinning them down momentarily, thus permitting the remainder of his platoon to withdraw to a more tenable position. Although hit repeatedly by grenade fragments and small-arms fire, he resisted all efforts of his comrades to induce him to withdraw, steadfastly remained at his machine gun and continued to deliver deadly, accurate fire until mortally wounded by an enemy grenade. Pfc. Thompson’s dauntless courage and gallant self-sacrifice reflect the highest credit on himself and uphold the esteemed traditions of military service.”<br />  ",

His sculptural works continue to influence how Americans view their country, its past, and the United States’ place in the world.</p> <p>Saint-Gaudens was born in Ireland to Mary McGuiness and Bernard Saint-Gaudens, a French shoemaker. Six months later, the family immigrated to New York City. At age 13, he began apprenticing as a cameo cutter for the next six years. After mastering this intricate craft, Saint-Gaudens traveled to France and studied sculpting at the École des Beaux-Arts. He later spent five years in Rome along with many other American artists.</p> <p>The young sculptor returned to the United States in 1875 and the following year received his first major public commission, a monument to Admiral David Glasgow Farragut. After its 1881 unveiling in Manhattan, Saint-Gaudens’ fame grew and other commissions soon followed. During the next 25 years, he completed over 150 artworks including the General William T. Sherman Monument in New York and the Robert Gould Shaw and 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment Memorial in Boston. His vision and technique brought life-like qualities and stirring emotions to bronze, plaster, stone, and wood. The gold coins he designed at the request of President Theodore Roosevelt remain one of his lasting legacies. His numerous pieces changed the way the world regarded American art and artists.</p> <p>The influential sculptor played an outsized role in the drive to construct a singular American identity and public memory. His many monuments placed notable American figures in the aesthetic tradition of Ancient Greece and Rome. These bronze sculptures firmly affixed a model of heroism to symbolic places as Americans everywhere grappled to define citizenship. He further cemented a national identity through planning positions for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the 1901 McMillan Plan to redesign the layout of the National Mall in Washington, DC.</p> <p>Throughout his career, Saint-Gaudens supported the advancement of public art in the United States and taught a new generation of American artists. In 1888, he began teaching at the Art Students League in New York City. Numerous other artists and craftspeople served as assistants to this executive sculptor. Notable students include Annetta Johnson Saint-Gaudens, Fredrick MacMonnies, Henry Hering, and Mary Lawrence. Saint-Gaudens also juried exhibits, administered scholarships to young artists, and served on committees that awarded commissions.</p> <p>In 1873, Saint-Gaudens met Augusta Homer of Roxbury, Massachusetts while living in Rome. They were married four years later and, in 1880, Augusta Homer Saint-Gaudens gave birth to Homer Schiff Saint-Gaudens. In the early 1880s, Augustus Saint-Gaudens began a relationship with the model Albertina Hultgren who became known as Davida Johnson Clark. In 1889, she gave birth to their son, Louis Paul Clark.</p> <p>The Saint-Gaudens family began summering in Cornish, New Hampshire in 1885 where their presence led to the formation of the Cornish Art Colony. Saint-Gaudens initially modified a barn to complete his work and eventually constructed a series of studios for his growing sculptural operations. Upon receiving a cancer diagnosis in 1900, Saint-Gaudens settled year-round at the property he referred to as ‘Aspet’. He continued to live and work there until his death in 1907.</p> <p>Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park continues to preserve and interpret the home, artwork, properties, and life of this renowned American artist.</p>",

Together with her parents, she spent her childhood enslaved on the estate of Johannes, then later Charles, Hardenbergh. Enslaved by Dutch settlers, Dutch was her first language. When she was nine years old, she was sold away from her parents to John Neely near Kingston, New York. He purchased her and a flock of sheep for $100. Baumfree remained at John Neely’s until 1808, when she was sold to tavern keeper Martinus Schryver of Port Ewen, New York, where she stayed for 18 months. In 1810, she was sold to John Dumont, of West Park, New York. She remained his property until 1826, when she escaped to freedom.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">While at the Dumonts, Baumfree experienced tension and harassment from John’s wife, Elizabeth and rape by John. In 1815 Baumfree met and fell in love with Robert, an enslaved man from a neighboring farm. Robert’s owner forbade the relationship, and beat Robert to death for meeting Baumfree against his wishes. Some years later, Baumfree married an older enslaved man named Thomas. She had had two children prior to Thomas - her first child, James, died in childhood. Her second, Diana, was the result of a rape by John Dumont. She had her last three children, Peter, Elizabeth, and Sophia, with Thomas.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">In 1799, New York State passed a law for gradual abolition of slavery. After July 4, 1799, children born to enslaved women were, by legal definition, free, but required to work for their mother’s owner until they were in their twenties (28 for males, and 25 for females). Those born before July 4, 1799 were redefined by law as indentured servants. In reality, they continued to be enslaved for life. An 1817 law declared that all slaves in the State born before July 4, 1799 would become free on July 4, 1827. John Dumont promised to emancipate Baumfree before this final date of emancipation. In 1826, he changed his mind. So, before the year ended, Baumfree freed herself and her infant daughter Sophia. She was not able to bring the rest of her family with her, and would later work to emancipate Peter after Dumont sold him south to Alabama in defiance of the law. Baumfree and her daughter found refuge at the home of Isaac and Maria Van Wagenen in New Paltz, New York. To keep her safe, the Van Wagenens paid Dumont $20 for her labor until emancipation day, July 4, 1827. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">While staying with the Van Wagenens, Baumfree’s focus shifted to finding her son Peter. With the assistance of her hosts, Baumfree brought her son’s case to a legal hearing at court. The drawn out process of finding Peter and fighting to bring him back home ended in 1828, when the court ruled in her favor and Peter returned to New York. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">It was while with the Van Wagenens that Baumfree experienced a religious awakening, becoming a devout Christian. In 1829, she and Peter left New Paltz and moved to New York City. Baumfree worked as a housekeeper in the city, and at one point was accused of poisoning and stealing from one of her employers. She was acquitted of both charges. In 1839, Peter took a job on a whaling ship. Although Baumfree received letters from her son during his journeys, when the ship returned to New York in 1842, Peter was not on board. She never heard from him again. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">In 1843, Baumfree became a Methodist. Called by God to leave the city and “testify the hope that was in her” across the countryside, she took the name Sojourner Truth and began touring the country speaking against slavery. In 1844, she moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, and joined the Northampton Association of Education and Industry.[1] Founded by abolitionists, this utopian community was a stop on the Underground Railroad; it’s members supported women’s rights, religious tolerance, and pacifism. It was in Northampton that she met William Lloyd Garrison and </span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">. After the Association disbanded in 1846, Truth remained in western Massachusetts and began dictating her memoirs to her friend Olive Gilbert. In 1850 her book, <i>The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave </i>was published by Garrison<i>; </i>she bought a house in Northampton, and spoke at the first National Women’s Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts. She paid off her home just three years later, in part by selling photographs of herself captioned, “I sell the shadow to support the substance.”</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">In May 1851, she attended the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention in Akron, where she delivered her speech<a href=\"https://www.thesojournertruthproject.com/compare-the-speeches/\"> “Ain’t I a Woman?”,</a> one of the most famous speeches on African American and women’s rights in American history.[2] For most of her remaining life, Truth continued to travel the United States to speak on matters relating to the rights of African Americans and women, including the right to vote. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">In 1857, Truth moved to Harmonia, Michigan, where she had friends and where her daughter Elizabeth lived. She later moved to Battle Creek. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit African American men for the Union Army. Her grandson, James Caldwell, enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts Regiment. In 1864, she worked for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association in Washington, D.C., where she met President Abraham Lincoln. While in Washington, she traveled on public streetcars in support of their desegregation. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Truth continued to advocate and lobby pressure for the needs of African Americans. Starting in 1870, she advocated to secure land grants from the federal government for former enslaved people, which was an unsuccessful effort. As part of this work, she met President Ulysses S. Grant in the White House.[3] In 1872, she returned to Battle Creek and worked on Grant’s re-election campaign. She went to the polls on Election Day to vote but was turned away. </span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Although her health was in its decline, she continued to travel and speak. She died in her Battle Creek home on November 26, 1883 at age 86. She was buried in Battle Creek’s Oak Hill Cemetery. In her life, she tirelessly advocated for the rights of African Americans, women, and for numerous reform causes including prison reform and against capital punishment. She is memorialized in countless art works, murals, and statues. She provided the namesake for the 1997 NASA Mars Pathfinder robot <i>Sojourner</i>, and for the asteroid <i>249521 Truth</i>. In 2009, Truth became the first Black woman memorialized with a bust in the U.S. Capitol.[4]</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Notes:</strong><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">[1] The only surviving building of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry is Ross Farm at 123 Meadow Street, Northampton, Massachusetts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 8, 2008.</span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> </span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">[2] Sojourner Truth spoke extemporaneously at the meeting in Akron; she did not have a written speech to read from. Therefore, her words survive as written by others. There are many variations of what Truth said; the first record of her full speech, published within a month of her giving it, does not include the phrase, “Ain’t I a Woman.” Twelve years later, in 1863, another version was published by Frances Dana Barker Gage, a suffragist and abolitionist who worked with Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and others. In her version, Truth’s words have the stereotypical characteristics of Southern slaves (even though Truth grew up in New York speaking Dutch), included the phrase “Ain’t I a Woman,” and included embellishments about her life. It is Gage’s version of Truth’s speech, which was republished in 1875, 1881, and 1889, that has become the version most people are familiar with.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">[3] The White House was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">[4] The United States Capitol building was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/20-for-2020.htm\"><img alt=\"More Suffragists You Should Know banner\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|1360|415|3|0|0\" height=\"415\" id=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/20-for-2020.htm||CPIMAGE:6155437|0|\" src=\"/people/images/20-suffragists-banner-w-text.jpg\" style=\"border-width:3px;text-align:center;border-style:solid;\" title=\"20 suffragists banner w text\" width=\"1360\" /></a>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Twenty-five-year-old Prince Johonnot was one of the 119 patriots of African or Native American ancestry who fought in the first battles of the American Revolution. As a former enslaved person, his courage and duty at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> marked the beginning of a life of commitment.</p> <p>Born on July 6, 1749, Prince Johonnot grew up in Boston.<sup>1</sup> Though not much is known about his early life, Johonnot was most likely an educated free man by the time he came to Methuen, Massachusetts. He married Mehitabel Emerson in 1773 and the couple eventually had at least six children.<sup>2</sup> In 1774, when Methuen formed its first minute man company, Johonnot was listed as a member of Captain John Davis' company. He formally enrolled on February 14, 1775, on a ninety-day enlistment. According to Johonnot's 1831 pension request, he wrote that \"said company was kept organized and drilled two half days in each week, when the weather would permit.\"<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the early hours of April 19, 1775, word reached his hometown that British Regulars were marching toward the military stores in Concord. Johonnot, as a member of Davis' Company, attempted to cut off the British retreat in Cambridge. While unsuccessful, the company did join the colonial forces laying siege to Boston. His unit was stationed in the Centre (Harvard) college building. On May 14, 1775, Johonnot re-enlisted. This time he committed to eight months of service as part of Captain Davis' Company, Colonel James Frye's Regiment. The company joined the newly formed Massachusetts Provincial Army.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>\"On the night of the 16th of June A.D. 1775,\" Johonnot wrote in his pension application, \"[we] marched to Bunker Hill, where a breastwork & fort were thrown up during the night and the next day (we were) in the Battle on that hill....\"<sup>5</sup> When the battle started, Johonnot's minute company was positioned inside the redoubt fortification at the top of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/breeds-hill.htm\">Breed's Hill</a>. Soldiers from other companies joined Johonnot in the redoubt, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/salem-poor.htm\">Salem Poor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-salem.htm\">Peter Salem</a>, and Peter Brown. While Johonnot did not describe his experience in the redoubt, Peter Brown, a young white farmer, wrote a detailed account of the battle from the redoubt to his mother. Brown recalled: \"The enemy landed, fronted before us, and form'd themselves, in an oblong square in order to surround, which they did in part -- after they were well form'd they advanced towards us in order to swallow us up, but they found a Choaky mouthful of us...\"<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Lt. John Waller described the scene at the redoubt from the British forces' perspective since his British Marines entered the redoubt where Johonnot and his comrades were fighting on the final assault. \"[W]hen we enter'd it, 'twas streaming with Blood & strew'd with dead & dying Men the Soldiers stabbing some and dashing out the Brains of others.\"<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Prince Johonnot survived the battle, and when his enlistment expired in October, he returned to his hometown of Methuen. He later moved his family to Goffstown, New Hampshire. As a veteran of the war and a respected man, he was chosen to be a surveyor of highways in Goffstown on March 2, 1789.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>When Johonnot turned 78 years old he moved to nearby New Boston, New Hampshire.<sup>9</sup> With every passing year, his health declined to the point that he was unable to support himself. He applied for a military pension and it was granted on August 27, 1832.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>Four years later, on March 25, 1836, Prince Johonnott died, leaving behind a legacy of commitment and sacrifice that we and future generations look at with respect and inspiration.<sup>11</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>United States Revolutionary War Pensions, NARA, Record Group 15, Series M804. 2670 rolls.

            "bodyText": "Cornelius H. Charlton was born on July 24, 1929, in East Gulf, West Virginia. He was one of 17 children born to Van and Clara Charlton. While in West Virginia, Van Charlton supported his ever-growing family by working as a coal miner. In 1944, the Charlton family moved to the Bronx, New York, where Van Charlton worked as an apartment building superintendent. In New York, Cornelius Charlton attended James Monroe High School. Although he expressed a strong desire to enlist and fight in World War II, his parents did not want him to drop out of school to serve. He graduated from high school in 1946 at the age of 17. At that point, his parents relented and signed the papers for him to join the U.S. Army.<br /> <br /> Cornelius completed basic training in November 1946 and was sent to Germany as part of the occupation force. On reenlisting, he was assigned to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland before being sent to Japan in 1950 for occupation duty on the island of Okinawa. When the Korean War broke out, he asked for combat duty and was transferred to Company C, First Battalion, Twenty-Fourth Infantry. The Twenty-Fourth was the last of the segregated Buffalo Soldier regiments to be integrated in accordance with Executive Order 9981 issued by President Harry Truman.<br /> <br /> Company C’s commander, Captain Gordon E. Gullikson, initially took a dim view of Charlton. Gullikson did not understand why Charlton wanted a combat assignment with the Twenty-fourth Infantry. That skepticism soon faded, as Charlton transformed his squad into an effective fighting unit and their morale improved. Gullikson later promoted Charlton to platoon sergeant of Company C’s third platoon.<br /> <br /> On June 2, 1951, as part of Operation Piledriver, Charlton’s platoon was attacking Hill 543. The hill, near the village of Chipo-ri, South Korea, was heavily defended by communist Chinese soldiers. As Charlton and his comrades made it about halfway up the hill, they encountered heavy mortar fire from the Chinese positions. The platoon, including its leader, took heavy causalities. Charlton took command and organized three advances up the hill in the face of strong Chinese opposition. During these attacks, Charlton was wounded numerous times but refused medical evacuation. Charlton and his men were finally able to dislodge the Chinese infantrymen from the crest of Hill 543. When they reached the top of the hill, they noticed Chinese mortar positions on the reverse slope. Charlton charged these positions alone and was able to take them out even though he was again wounded by grenade fragments. Mortally wounded, Charlton died on Hill 543.<br /> <br /> Charlton’s remains were returned to his family, and he was initially buried in the segregated Bryant Cemetery in Bramwell, West Virginia. <br /> <br /> Sergeant Cornelius H. Charlton was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on March 12, 1952, at the Pentagon. His parents accepted his Medal of Honor from Secretary of the Army Frank C. Pace. Only two African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor during the Korean War. On November 12, 2008, Sergeant Charlton was reinterred at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.<br /> <br /> Charlton’s Medal of Honor citation reads:<br /> “Sgt. Charlton, a member of Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. His platoon was attacking heavily defended hostile positions on commanding ground when the leader was wounded and evacuated. Sgt. Charlton assumed command, rallied the men, and spearheaded the assault against the hill. Personally eliminating two hostile positions and killing six of the enemy with his rifle fire and grenades, he continued up the slope until the unit suffered heavy casualties and became pinned down. Regrouping the men, he led them forward only to be again hurled back by a shower of grenades. Despite a severe chest wound, Sgt. Charlton refused medical attention and led a third daring charge which carried to the crest of the ridge. Observing that the remaining emplacement which had retarded the advance was situated on the reverse slope, he charged it alone, was again hit by a grenade but raked the position with a devastating fire which eliminated it and routed the defenders. The wounds received during his daring exploits resulted in his death, but his indomitable courage, superb leadership, and gallant self-sacrifice reflect the highest credit upon himself, the infantry, and the military service.”<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Edward Allen Carter, Jr., was born on May 26, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, to missionary parents. When Carter was nine years old his family moved to Calcutta, India, to start a church. Carter had a difficult relationship with his father and routinely ran away for days at a time. While in Calcutta, Carter became enthralled with the military and envisioned himself serving in the army. During the family’s time in Calcutta, Carter’s mother left them in the care of his father. In 1927, Carter and his family moved to Shanghai, China, on another missionary assignment.<br /> <br /> While in Shanghai, Carter attended the Shanghai Military Academy. His father hoped this school would tame Carter’s rebellious nature. During Carter’s time in India and China, he learned to speak Hindi, German, and Mandarin. On January 28, 1932, the Empire of Japan attacked Shanghai in hopes of controlling natural resources in the area. This became known as the “Shanghai Incident.” The Japanese amassed 30 warships and 7,000 troops just outside of Shanghai and bombarded the defenseless International Zone. Carter and his family took refuge in his father’s church. <br /> <br /> Carter, moved to action by the continuous bombardment, left the relative safety of the church and ran toward the gunfire. In the streets, he met a member of the Chinese 19th Route Army. Although Carter was only 15, the 19th needed all the men it could get, and Carter took up position in the trenches filling sandbags. As the fighting continued, Carter helped wherever possible. When the vanguard of Japanese Marines started attacking Carter’s position, he took up arms instead of escaping to safety. During the fierce fighting, Carter and his comrades were able to repel the Japanese. After the fighting ended, Carter’s superior officer promoted him to lieutenant and in charge of a section. This was the first time Edward Carter was recognized for his military bravery.<br /> <br />  On March 25, 1932, Edward Carter, Sr., arrived at his son’s military camp after looking for him for several weeks. Carter, Sr., met with the general in charge and told him that Carter was only 15 years old. Upon learning that Carter was underage, he was discharged from the military. He returned to his studies at the Shanghai Military Academy with new experience in combat and military tactics. In 1935, Carter left China at the age of 19 and joined the U.S. Merchant Marine, making his way to Los Angeles in 1936.<br /> <br /> In January 1937, Carter made his way to Spain via his contacts within the Merchant Marine. He enlisted to fight alongside government forces against the fascists of General Francisco Franco’s army. Franco’s army was backed by the Germans and Italians at the time. Carter was one of 2,800 Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War. He joined the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, made up of mostly anti-fascist Americans fighting alongside the Spanish government. <br /> As the Spanish Civil War progressed, his commanders took note of Carter’s military acumen; he was given increasingly more responsibility on missions. By late March 1939, the government forces were no match for Franco’s German- and Italian-backed military, and Carter and the rest of the Lincoln Brigade escaped to Paris.<br /> <br /> By 1940, Carter, now 24 years old, returned to Los Angeles. While in California he met his wife, Mildred Hoover. She helped fill the void created by his mother’s abandonment. On March 27, 1941, they had a son, Edward Carter III. Carter III was nicknamed “Buddha” because of to his size at birth.<br /> <br /> Carter enlisted in the U.S. Army on September 26, 1941. He went to Camp Wolters, in Texas, for basic training. At Camp Wolters, he felt racism’s sting. He wrote to his wife, “Conditions here are pretty bad. Only the damned live here in the rotten South. They don’t treat you like soldiers; it’s more like slaves. When this war is over, you’ll see plenty of tough and bitter boys coming home.” <br /> <br /> Carter was able to put this aside when it came to military training, at which he excelled. He was proficient with all types of weapons and scored a near-perfect score in marksmanship. Unfortunately, the Army didn’t see the potential in Carter’s weaponry skills, and he was initially assigned to the 3535th Quartermaster Truck Company at Fort Benning, Georgia. Through hard work and determination Carter was promoted to staff sergeant while at Fort Benning.<br /> <br /> In the fall of 1944, the 3535th received word they were heading overseas to the European Theater of Operations. They arrived in southern France on November 13, 1944, after a brief stop in England.<br /> <br /> Once in France Carter continued to do his job but also kept looking for a way to join a combat unit. He asked for combat duty every day. In December 1944, Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee, deputy commander of U.S. forces in the European theaters of operations, recognized that there were too many African Americans in supply positions but not enough soldiers on the front lines. Lee wanted to change this imbalance by integrating units in Europe on a one-for-one basis. Many generals, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, opposed this one-for-one replacement of white soldiers with Black soldiers.<br /> <br /> On December 26, 1944, the official call for Black volunteers in service units to transfer to white combat units received Eisenhower’s approval. The response by men in service units was overwhelming. More than 4,500 African American men applied in the first two months of the program. Unable to accommodate everyone who requested the transfer, the Army accepted 2,500. Carter was accepted but had to relinquish his sergeant stripes and become a private again. He readily agreed, as combat was the reason he enlisted in 1941. Carter graduated from combat training on March 12, 1945, and was assigned to Company D, 56th Armored Infantry Battalion, 12th Armored Division. <br /> <br /> On March 23, 1945, Company D pushed across the Rhineland toward Speyer, Germany. Carter and his squad were riding on top of a tank when the vehicle in front of them was hit with a German anti-tank weapon from the direction of a nearby abandoned warehouse. The soldiers immediately leapt off the tank and moved toward the abandoned warehouse. Carter set out over 150 yards from the road to the warehouse trying to ascertain the Germans’ strength. Almost immediately, two of his men were killed and the third was wounded. Carter proceeded alone despite his own wounds. He approached to within 30 yards of the target area and was forced to seek cover, where he stayed for two hours. When an eight-man German squad approached his position, Carter opened fire, killing six and capturing the remaining two. He returned to the American lines with the two German prisoners. Fluent in German, Carter interrogated the prisoners on the way back. He had single-handedly eliminated the last German obstacle to the American advance. <br /> <br /> After a month in Luxembourg, Carter recovered from his wounds. He slipped out of the hospital and hitched a ride to the front to be with his unit again. One of the last acts of his Company D commander before he was discharged was to nominate Carter for the Distinguished Service Cross, which Carter received. His commander and others talked about nominating him for the Medal of Honor but were concerned it would not be awarded because of Carter’s race. They thought some recognition was better than none.<br /> <br /> Carter returned to Los Angeles after the war. In 1946, Carter re-enlisted in the Army and served at several locations including Fort Lee, Virginia, and Fort Lewis, Washington. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant first class. In 1949, he tried to reenlist again but was denied because of his previous involvement in China and Spain. The army believed he had ties to communism because of his previous service. He appealed the decision numerous times but failed to change the outcome. Rumors of his involvement with the Communist Party resulted in the loss of two jobs and made it more difficult to find other employment. He did, however, eventually find work in the tire industry.<br /> <br /> Edward A. Carter, Jr., died on January 30, 1963, in Los Angeles at the age of 46 from lung cancer. He was buried at the Veterans Cemetery in Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, the Department of Defense began to study the issue of why no African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II. The investigation looked at historical documents including Distinguished Service Cross paperwork. It was determined that Black soldiers had been denied consideration for the Medal of Honor in World War II because of their race. The report put forward a total of seven men who deserved the Medal of Honor for their actions. Edward A. Carter, Jr., was one of them. President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to Carter on January 13, 1997. The award was presented to Carter’s oldest son, Edward A. Carter, III. The next day, January 14, Carter was reinterred at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.<br /> <br /> Staff Sergeant Edward A Carter, Jr.’s Medal of Honor citations reads:<br /> “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty in action on 23 March 1945. At approximately 0830 hours, 23 March 1945, near Speyer, Germany, the tank upon which Staff Sergeant Carter was riding received bazooka and small arms fire from the vicinity of a large warehouse to its left front. Staff Sergeant Carter and his squad took cover behind an intervening road bank. Staff Sergeant Carter volunteered to lead a three-man patrol to the warehouse where other unit members noticed the original bazooka fire. From here they were to ascertain the location and strength of the opposing position and advance approximately 150 yards across an open field. Enemy small arms fire covered this field. As the patrol left this covered position, they received intense enemy small arms fire killing one member of the patrol instantly. This caused Staff Sergeant Carter to order the other two members of the patrol to return to the covered position and cover him with rifle fire while he proceeded alone to carry out the mission. The enemy fire killed one of the two soldiers while they were returning to the covered position, and seriously wounded the remaining soldier before he reached the covered position. An enemy machine gun burst wounded Staff Sergeant Carter three times in the left arm as he continued the advance. He continued and received another wound in his left leg that knocked him from his feet. As Staff Sergeant Carter took wound tablets and drank from his canteen, the enemy shot it from his left hand, with the bullet going through his hand. Disregarding these wounds, Staff Sergeant Carter continued the advance by crawling until he was within thirty yards of his objective. The enemy fire became so heavy that Staff Sergeant Carter took cover behind a bank and remained there for approximately two hours. Eight enemy riflemen approached Staff Sergeant Carter, apparently to take him prisoner. Staff Sergeant Carter killed six of the enemy soldiers and captured the remaining two. These two enemy soldiers later gave valuable information concerning the number and disposition of enemy troops. Staff Sergeant Carter refused evacuation until he had given full information about what he had observed and learned from the captured enemy soldiers. This information greatly facilitated the advance on Speyer. Staff Sergeant Carter’s extraordinary heroism was an inspiration to the officers and men of the 7th Army, Infantry Company Number 1 (Provisional) and exemplify the highest traditions of the military service.”<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "John Yoshio Kobayashi was a Japanese-American man who was born in Idaho to Japanese immigrant parents in 1921. After graduating high school, Kobayashi served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Even in the face of racial prejudice, he served with valor in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.<br /> <br /> The 442nd was a famous unit composed almost entirely of second-generation American soldiers of Japanese ancestry (“Nisei”). The unit remains one of the most decorated in American military history, helping to win the war with their service in Europe. The Regiment was initially made up of 4,000 men and had to be replaced nearly 2.5 times over. About 14,000 men served, earning almost 10,000 Purple Hearts, as well as 21 Medals of Honor. In July 1946, President Harry Truman presented a Presidential Unit Citation to the 442nd, stating “You fought not only the enemy, but you fought prejudice, and you have won.”<br /> <br /> After Kobayashi returned from the war, he married Sumiko Dorothy Yagi. Sumiko was born in Seattle, Washington to first generation Japanese immigrant parents Genji and Ume Yagi in 1920. Though her parents were not naturalized citizens, Sumiko was granted citizenship per the ruling of U.S. v Wong Kim Ark, as a child born in the U.S. The Yagi family operated a small grocery store in Seattle.<br /> <br /> Sumiko and her family experienced extreme racial prejudice and a sense of wartime hysteria. Like many Japanese Americans on the west coast, they were forced away from their homes and businesses, and sent to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/miin/index.htm\">Minidoka Incarceration Center</a>, in Idaho, as part of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066. That Executive Order authorized the United States Army to remove all persons of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast and imprison them without due process of law. More than 120,000 were held in these camps – the vast majority of whom were citizens born in the United States, like Sumiko and her younger siblings Sachiko and George.<br /> <br /> By the Spring of 1942, Japanese Americans were given just days’ notice that they had to abandon their homes, their businesses, and the lives they had built for themselves. For business owners like the Yagis, that led to the euphemistically named “evacuation sales” – knowing that they had only days, prices were slashed – merchandise, groceries, houses, and cars were all sold, often for pennies on the dollar, as they were only allowed to bring what they could carry.<br /> <br /> Following the war, Kobayashi and Yagi married and moved to Riverton, Wyoming, where they homesteaded as part of the Riverton Reclamation Project, under the 1902 Newlands Reclamation Act. Reclamation homesteading was established in areas where farming was impossible without extensive irrigation, which required federal money and planning to build the necessary expensive infrastructure. As a veteran, John received preference in the lottery drawing for the land, which he successfully proved up in 1952. However, due to a problem with the project, Kobayashi sold his homestead and instead relocated to the Minidoka Reclamation homestead project in Idaho. It must have been difficult for Sumiko to return to Minidoka, site of her family’s forced incarceration under Executive Order 9066. Despite the trauma she may have felt at returning to the area, they successful received a patent there in 1955, receiving 127 acres a few miles west of Minidoka. John and Sumiko lived on the land the rest of their lives.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=1151434&docClass=SER&sid=zjicie3m.0ef\">Kobayashi Bureau of Land Management Homestead-Reclamation General Land Office Records</a><br /> <br />  ",

The following year he wrote:<br /> <br /> \"...I came here last year and found these canyons, and they feel like the heart of the world to me. I'm going to stay and build trails and promote this place, because it should be a national park.\"<br /> <br /> Otto spearheaded fundraising campaigns, collected signatures for petitions, and penned newspaper editorials and endless letters to Washington politicians in support of national recognition for the ancient canyons and towering monoliths of his adopted home.</p> <h4><strong>Trailbuilder, Promoter, and Patriot</strong></h4> <p>Otto lived alone in the canyons and used a pick and shovel to carve out the trails. Always the patriot, he named the rock formations he encountered after great heroes and historic events. Some of the formations, such as Independence Monument and Liberty Cap, still bear the names he gave them. Gradually, through his single-minded pursuit and his Herculean physical efforts, the scenic treasures hidden in the canyons were made accessible to the public.</p> <h4><strong>Efforts Pay Off</strong></h4> <p>Otto sought neither personal recognition nor wealth. He was seen as an eccentric and a recluse. But he would happily abandon his solitude for an opportunity to publicize his beloved canyons. He spoke to reporters and photographers and public representatives, and conducted tours of the area. Some came out of curiosity but were converted into avid supporters. His enthusiasm was contagious. Many joined him in his efforts and deluged Washington politicians with letters of support. Finally on May 24, 1911, President Taft signed the proclamation that established Colorado National Monument.<br /> <br /> \"…keep in mind what this lover of nature, John Otto is doing. He is asking no credit yet he deserves it all. Singlehanded he has opened this great playground to the world.\" -Walter Walker, Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, April 1909</p> <h4><strong>A Wedding in the Canyons</strong></h4> <p>John Otto married Boston artist Beatrice Farnham on June 20, 1911 at the base of Independence Monument. Unfortunately, John and Beatrice's marriage was short-lived. Beatrice found the reality of John's life to be far from her romantic ideal. A few weeks after the wedding, she left, never to return.<br /> <br /> \"I tried hard to live his way, but I could not do it, I could not live with a man to whom even a cabin was an encumbrance.\" -Beatrice Farnham Otto</p> <h4>Life After the Monument</h4> <p>After 16 years as the park's custodian Otto retired and in 1932 left the Grand Valley. He headed west and made a new home in an old Post Office building in Yreka, California. John Otto died June 19, 1952 at the age of 81. He had $44 dollars in cash and four $25 dollar war bonds at the time of his death. Without the money to pay for a proper headstone or funeral he was buried in a pauper's grave in the Evergreen Cemetery in Yreka.<br /> <br /> The John Otto Memorial Headstone Project was started by a group of local John Otto supporters who felt that their hero deserved a fitting memorial. After raising funds for the headstone, they held a ceremony in Yreka on June 19, 2002, the 50th anniversary of Otto's death.</p> <h4><strong>Legacy</strong></h4> <p>John Otto spent over 20 years of his life among the canyons and mesas of the Monument. Today Otto is remembered fondly as the Monument's founder and its most fervent promoter. It is largely through his efforts that we are able to enjoy the unspoiled natural grandeur that is Colorado National Monument.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Dr. Me-Iung Ting worked tirelessly to improve medical care for women, children, and refugees, even when it put her at great personal risk. Ting’s experiences as a foreign student studying in the US illustrate the influence of American medical education <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tellingallamericansstories/roleofunited-states.htm\">around the world</a>. </p> <hr /> <p><em><strong>Describe a time you have made a decision that changed the course of your life.</strong></em></p> <hr /> <h4>Early Life and Education</h4> <p>In 1891, Ting was born in Shanghai, China. Her father Gan-Ren Ting was a well-known doctor and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. Although her parents and grandfather had arranged for her to be married, Ting followed in her father’s footsteps and became a doctor. After she graduated from McTyeire High School for Girls, a missionary school in Shanghai, she left home to prepare for medical school. Ting traveled to Nanjing to work with Dr. Li Yuin Tsao, a fellow graduate of McTyeire High School. After working as Tsao’s assistant for about a year, Ting departed for the United States to continue her education. <br /> <br /> From 1892 until 1943, the United States government severely limited the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/aapi-theme-study-essay-4-immigration.htm\">immigration</a> of Chinese laborers and prohibited Chinese immigrants from becoming US citizens. As a student, Me-Iung Ting was able to come to the US on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship.[1] With hopes of reforming the medical care that women and children received in China, Ting benefited from the standardization of American medical training during the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> In 1914, Ting began preparing for medical school at Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts. She pursued her doctorate at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbour.[2] When Ting arrived in 1916, she was the only Chinese woman studying there. While in Michigan, Ting began to become more interested in global public health. </p> <h4>Medical Career</h4> <p>In 1919, Ting attended the International Conference of Women Physicians held at the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Headquarters in New York City. Ting viewed her American education and participation in the conference as ways to support China’s future. She believed that if she and other Chinese women became educated and worked in medicine, they could bring about the conference’s goals: better public health, equal suffrage, and permanent peace.<br /> <br /> After Ting graduated as a medical doctor in 1920, she interned at the Detroit Woman’s Hospital and Infant’s Home to study obstetrics. To gain experience with infectious diseases, she completed additional internships at a woman’s hospital in Philadelphia and at the Willard Parker Hospital in New York City. After eight years of study in the United States, Ting eagerly returned to China in April 1922.</p> <h4>Return to China</h4> <p>During the summer of 1922, Ting reunited with her mentor Dr. Li Yuin Tsao at the Tientsin (Peiyang) Women’s Hospital in northeastern China. By August, Tsao unexpectedly fell ill and died, leaving Ting to assume her mentor’s responsibilities and become the hospital’s director. Although she longed to return home to Shanghai, Ting realized there was a greater need for her services in Tientsin. Ting served as the director of the Tientsin Women’s Hospital for twenty years. <br /> <br /> Because of her work supporting women’s health, Ting led the Chinese delegation to the first Pan-Pacific Women’s Congress. The conference was held at the Punahou School in Honolulu in August 1928.[3] American settlement house movement pioneer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jane-addams.htm\">Jane Addams</a> served as the honorary chairperson of the Congress. <br /> <br /> That year, the University of Michigan awarded Ting a year-long Barbour Fellowship, an endowed scholarship for female graduate students from Asia and the Middle East. From September 1929 through October 1930, Ting returned to Michigan to research and write a book on prenatal care. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Tientsin’s mayor appointed Ting the director of the Tientsin Infants Asylum, which cared for orphaned girls. Ting was the first woman appointed to a government position in this Chinese city. Around this time, Ting also adopted two of her nieces, who she encouraged to study in the United States and become doctors. <br /> <br /> During the second Sino-Japanese War, Ting resisted restrictions imposed by Japanese authorities so she could help women deliver babies safely. During the 1931-1932 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, she assisted thousands of Korean refugees and offered them medical care in hospitals and camps. For a period of eighteen days in January 1939, Japanese authorities imprisoned Ting. The alumni association at the University of Michigan petitioned her release. Although the Japanese government gave no justification for the arrest, one of Ting’s relatives claimed it was because Ting insisted on flying an American flag from her car during the Japanese occupation. <br /> <br /> During the 1940s, Ting continued to support international peace and relief efforts as a civil war broke out in China between the Nationalists and Communists. She served as the chair of China’s International Relief Committee from 1943 until 1949 and later chaired the United Nations Emergency Fund for Children, which is now known as UNICEF. The unrest eventually culminated with the establishment of the People’s Republic of China and the Communist government under Chairman Mao Zedong.<br /> <br /> Ting eventually decided to flee China. Using a special travel permit, she passed through Hong Kong and England before immigrating to the United States in 1950. To continue working as a doctor in the US, Ting allegedly decreased her age by ten years. Ting continued to practice medicine for the rest of her life and publicly spoke out against China’s Communist government. She taught pre-nursing at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mississippi-tougaloo-college.htm\">Tougaloo College</a> in Mississippi, and worked at a women’s prison in Connecticut and a school in Massachusetts.[4] Ting became a US citizen in 1969. On July 15, 1969, while attending a medical conference in New York City, she died of a heart attack.<br />  </p> <h4><strong>Notes</strong></h4> <p>[1] The Boxer Rebellion of 1900 opposed the presence of foreigners, colonizers, and Christian missionaries in China. When an international coalition put down the rebellion, the members of the coalition required China to pay reparations. To support its economic and political interests, the U.S. government agreed to allow China to pay off some of the reparations as Boxer Indemnity scholarships. These scholarships allowed Chinese students to study at American colleges. <br /> [2] The University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.<br /> [3] The Punahou School Campus was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.<br /> [4] Tougaloo College was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Barry, Sara and Grow, Jennifer. “<a href=\"https://issuu.com/mhcalumnae/docs/mhqspr15_issuu\">To Boldly Go</a>.” <em>Mount Holyoke Alumnae Quarterly</em> 99, no. 2 (Spring 2015): 28-33.<br /> Albino, Donna. “<a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~dalbino/letters/women/mting.html\">Me-Iung Ting x1916</a>.” A Postcard Collection of Mount Holyoke College.

            "bodyText": "<p>Emmeline Pankhurst was one of the most famous and influential British suffrage leaders. Her embrace of protest and direct action in the early 1900s marked a new phase in the battle for women’s votes.<br /> <br /> Fourteen-year-old Emmeline Goulden attended a public meeting about women’s rights in Manchester, England in the early 1870s. By the time she left it, she had become “a conscious and confirmed suffragist.” This work continued throughout her life. She and her husband Richard Pankhurst, a strong supporter of women’s rights, were active in early British suffrage groups. They pushed not only for the vote but also for equality for women in divorce and inheritance law.<br /> <br /> By the early 20th century, Pankhurst had become frustrated with British political parties’ inaction on suffrage. She founded the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903 to take militant action. The group targeted any political party that did not work towards votes for women.<br /> <br /> The WSPU’s motto was “deeds, not words.” Pankhurst and her supporters attracted attention through their confrontational actions. They got themselves arrested and imprisoned for civil disobedience. In prison, several of them went on hunger strikes and endured brutal force-feedings. Others interrupted cabinet meetings and heckled politicians. Some activists even set fires in mailboxes and vacant houses.  <br /> <br /> Pankhurst and the WSPU had a significant influence on the American suffrage movement. While in graduate school in England, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-burns.htm\">Lucy Burns</a> met Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. The pageantry of WSPU marches—the banners, trumpets, coordinated chants, and military-style march organization—inspired them. Paul and Burns began attending English suffrage demonstrations and were arrested several times in 1909.<br /> <br /> Paul and Burns brought these ideas and tactics home to the United States, organizing the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woman-suffrage-procession1913.htm\">1913 Woman Suffrage Procession</a> and the \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">Silent Sentinels</a>\" pickets outside the White House. They also borrowed the English strategy of a single-issue focus on winning suffrage. The organization they founded, the Congressional Union (later the National Woman’s Party), pushed for a constitutional amendment.<br /> <br /> Emmeline Pankhurst also influenced the American suffrage movement through speaking tours. In 1909, Harriot Stanton Blatch (a suffragist and the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/elizabeth-cady-stanton.htm\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>) sponsored her tour through the Northeast, where she spoke in Boston, New York City, and Geneva, New York.[1] She returned in 1913. During a stop in Hartford, Connecticut, she delivered perhaps her most famous speech, “Freedom or Death.” Pankhurst defended the British suffragettes’ militancy. She argued that it was the only option for forcing the government to recognize women’s rights.<br /> <br /> “You won your freedom in America when you had the revolution, by bloodshed, by sacrificing human life,” she reminded her audience. “You have left it to women in your land, the men of all civilized countries have left it to women, to work out their own salvation. That is the way in which we women of England are doing. Human life for us is sacred, but we say if any life is to be sacrificed it shall be ours; we won't do it ourselves, but we will put the enemy in the position where they will have to choose between giving us freedom or giving us death.”<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/suffragistvssuffragette.htm\">Suffragettes</a> won a partial victory in 1918 when the United Kingdom granted propertied women over thirty the right to vote. Pankhurst continued to work for women’s empowerment, though her politics grew less radical. She committed herself to anti-communism, defended British imperialism, and became a member of the Conservative Party late in life. Despite ill health, Pankhurst lived to see suffrage extended to women on the same terms as men in England, Wales, and Scotland in 1928. She died that year at the age of 69.</p> <h4>Notes</h4> <p>[1] Pankhurst spoke at several historic venues during her speaking tours in the United States.

            "bodyText": "<p>Esther Lape was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on October 8, 1881. A graduate of Wellesley College, Esther Lape taught English at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, the University of Arizona, and Barnard College in New York City. She was well known as a journalist, researcher, and publicist. Lape was also associated with the Women's Trade Union League and one of the founders of the League of Women Voters. Her life-partner was the scholar and lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/elizabeth-read.htm\">Elizabeth Read</a>, who was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt's</a> personal attorney and financial advisor. Together Read and Lape published the journal <em>City, State and Nation</em>.</p> <p>It was through Read that Roosevelt met Lape and a professional relationship between Lape, Read, and Roosevelt was established in 1920. The relationship sprang from Roosevelt's work as the director of the League of Women Voters' national legislation committee. In this capacity, Roosevelt was aided by weekly meetings with Read. During these meetings, Read would provide Roosevelt a marked-up copy of the Congressional Record and together they discussed possible league activities.</p> <p>Later in 1921, the three women became close friends, meeting several evenings a week in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/greenwich-village-historic-district.htm\">Greenwich Village</a> as part of the New Women movement, which focused on political power and economic change. In 1923, working with Roosevelt, Lape administered the competition for the Bok Peace Prize. From this work, Lape published twenty of the most interesting proposals from the competition and wrote an introductory analysis. Lape's analysis received great praise. However, in January 1924, the Senate began investigating charges that the Bok Peace Prize was the tool of \"foreign governments or foreign institutions.\" Lape testified before the Senate and identified Roosevelt and Narcissa Vanderlip as two of the most influential members of the selection committee. The hearings were suspended because of President Wilson's death and never brought up again. Throughout the 1920s, Lape continued to work in international affairs, in particular in support of U.S. participation in the World Court.</p> <p>During the 1930s, Lape and Roosevelt conferred regularly on political issues, including U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union and the failure of the 1935 Social Security Act to address health care. World War II pulled health care issues away from the forefront of both the administration and the Congress. Yet, Lape continued her crusade for better health care and in 1955 wrote <em>Medical Research: A Midcentury Survey</em>. This work was sponsored by the American Foundation, when Roosevelt was a board member.</p> <p>Together, Read, Lape, and Roosevelt would remain not only dedicated to political issues but stalwart friends, as well. As first lady, Roosevelt rented a small apartment in a building owned by Lape and Read in Greenwich Village. Roosevelt used this apartment to escape the pressures of her public position and in order to spend time with her friends. Lape and Read also owned a country home in Westbrook, Connecticut, known as Salt Meadow (today part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). Roosevelt also spent time there as well, often writing her \"My Day\" column.</p> <p>After Read's death in 1943, Roosevelt remained friends with Lape and visited her often up until Roosevelt's own death in 1962. In 1965 Lape, along with others, asked the Nobel Committee to consider posthumously awarding Eleanor Roosevelt the Peace Prize. However, the prize that year went to UNICEF. In her later years, Lape served as a source of information for Joseph Lash's biographies on Roosevelt. Lape died on May 17, 1981 in New York City.</p> <p><em>Article courtesy of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, George Washington University.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Participating in women’s rights, civil rights, labor, and peace movements throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Florence Luscomb embodied what it means to be an activist.</p> <p>Raised in Boston by her mother, Florence Luscomb became exposed to social justice issues early on in her life.<sup>1</sup> Hannah Luscomb, her mother, participated in both the women’s suffrage and labor movements, taking Florence to the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in 1892 to hear <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a> speak.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Florence Luscomb attended local Boston schools and became one of the few women admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While studying there, Luscomb joined its chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-cesl.htm\">College Equal Suffrage League</a>, a women’s suffrage organization. Soon after graduating with a degree in architecture in 1909, Luscomb began her career as a suffragist.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Along with other young suffragists, Florence Luscomb helped revitalize the movement by bringing the issue of women’s suffrage to the wider public. She attended the first open-air meetings, campaigned in towns throughout the state, and sold <em>The Woman’s Journal</em> on street corners. Luscomb also joined other innovative suffragists in reaching out to local Boston communities of varying class, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. As a result, Florence Luscomb stood out as one of the state’s most popular and effective suffrage speakers.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>While advocating for women’s suffrage in local Black churches, Florence Luscomb opened her eyes to the injustice against African Americans. She joined the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in its early years of establishment, serving in numerous leadership positions. Recognizing the particular plight of African Americans, Luscomb noted: “Discrimination against women is bitter, but it is to me nowhere near as terrific an oppression as is discrimination against black people.”<sup>5</sup> Florence Luscomb supported the civil rights movement and collaborated with Boston’s Black leaders throughout the course of her life.</p> <p>In the decades following the ratification of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, Luscomb continued her involvement in politics. In 1920, she began working with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-league-of-women-voters.htm\">Boston League of Women Voters</a>, which supported her run for Boston City Council in 1922. Luscomb later ran as a third party candidate in several races, including in the 1936 election for Massachusetts 9<sup>th</sup> District in the House of Representative (People’s Labor Party) and in the 1952 race for Massachusetts Governor (Progressive Party).<sup>6</sup></p> <p>During this time, Florence Luscomb broadened her activism beyond the causes of women and African Americans. She joined a variety of civil rights, labor, and peace organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Massachusetts Civic League (a public welfare organization), the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/international-ladies-garment-workers-union.htm\">International Ladies Garment Workers Union</a>, and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Florence Luscomb’s progressive views often clashed against the views of the state and federal government. Historian Sharon Hartman Strom noted that her FBI file contained over 9,000 pages. Luscomb’s defense of Communism gained the most attention. While not a Communist herself, she criticized the Red Scare and became a target during red-baiting schemes. When subpoenaed by the Commission to Investigate Communism in Massachusetts, Luscomb attended but refused to comply.<sup>8</sup> Instead, she gave a statement condemning the Commission for its unconstitutional activity, stating:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>I will not be an accessory to your subversion. I will not answer compulsory questions by government inquisitors into matters of my conscience and opinions, speech, writings, associations and political views in violation of the constitutional provisions of Article 1 of the United States Bill of Rights...I cannot and will not tear up the Constitution and its guaranteed liberties, won with blood and tears. I cannot and will not be a party with you in destroying American democracy.</em><sup>9</sup></p> <p>Well into her 70s and 80s, Florence Luscomb continued to participate in the peace movement and women’s liberation. Still able to draw a crowd in 1970, Luscomb referenced her early activism in women’s rights during an anti-Vietnam War speech on Boston Common:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Almost 70 years ago I began my activities in the movement which today goes by the name of ‘Women’s Liberation’, but which by whatever name is nothing more nor less than an ultimatum that women shall be acknowledged and treated as full, equal members of the human race. We ask nothing more: we will take nothing less.</em><sup>10</sup></p> <p>After a long and successful life as an activist, Florence Luscomb died at the age of 98 in 1985. Living with a strong moral compass, she always stood firm in her understanding of American patriotism: “To me, patriotism demands not the losing of one’s eyes to the faults and misdeeds of one’s country, but rather the fighting and ending of them, so making America better.”<sup>11</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Read about Florence Luscomb’s connections to Lowell, her town of birth, at Lowell National Historical Park’s webpage: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lowe/learn/historyculture/luscomb.htm\">\"Florence Luscomb.\"</a></li> <li>“Suffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,” <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985; “Feminist Florence Luscomb honored, questions equality,” <em>Boston Herald</em>, February 07, 1977.</li> <li>Sharon Hartman Strom, <em>Political Woman: Florence Luscomb and the Legacy of Radical Reform</em> (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001).</li> <li>Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>, 74-77.</li> <li>“Suffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,” <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985.</li> <li>“Suffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,” <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985; Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>.</li> <li>“Suffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,” <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985; “Feminist Florence Luscomb honored, questions equality,” <em>Boston Herald</em>, February 07, 1977; Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>.</li> <li>Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>, 230-239.</li> <li>\"Statement by Miss Florence H.

            "bodyText": "<p>Mabel Lee was a suffragist who mobilized the Chinese community in America to support women’s right to vote. Because Chinese immigrants were not considered citizens, the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which removed voting restrictions on the basis of sex, did not give Mabel the right to vote.<br /> <br /> Mabel Lee was born in Guangzhou (Canton), not far from Hong Kong in China in 1896. When she was 4, her father moved to the US to serve as a missionary. Lee remained in Hong Kong and lived with her mother and grandmother. She learned English at a missionary school and won a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship. This academic scholarship granted her a US visa and the Lee family settled in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/new-york-chinatown-and-little-italy-historic-district.htm\">New York City's Chinatown</a> in 1905. Mabel attended <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/erasmus-hall-academy.htm\">Erasmus Hall Academy</a> in Brooklyn.<br /> <br /> By the time she was 16, Mabel Lee was a known figure in New York’s suffrage movement. New York City suffragists held a parade in 1912 to advocate for women’s voting rights. Ten thousand people attended the parade. Lee, on horseback, helped lead the parade from its starting point in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/greenwich-village-historic-district.htm\">Greenwich Village</a>. The New York Tribune wrote an article about her before the parade. The article highlighted her academic accomplishments and her desire to improve the lives of women and girls. She was also mentioned in the New York Times’ parade coverage.<br /> <br /> Lee started her studies at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/barnard-hall-at-barnard-college.htm\">Barnard College</a> in New York City in 1912. Barnard College, an all-women’s school, was founded because Columbia University refused to admit women. While there, Mabel joined the Chinese Students’ Association and wrote feminist essays for The Chinese Students’ Monthly. Lee was involved in the suffrage movement throughout college. Her May 1914 essay, “The Meaning of Woman Suffrage,” argued that suffrage for women was necessary to a successful democracy. The extension of democracy (through voting) and “equality of opportunities to women” was, she stated, the hallmarks of true feminism. In 1915, the Women’s Political Union started a Suffrage Shop and invited Lee to give a speech. Covered by the New York Times, her speech “The Submerged Half” urged the Chinese community to promote girls’ education and women’s civic participation.<br /> <br /> Women won the right to vote in New York State in 1917. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women throughout the country the right to vote. But not all women in the US benefitted. Chinese women, like Mabel Lee, could not vote until 1943. This was because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a Federal law in place from 1882 to 1943. The Chinese Exclusion Act limited Chinese immigration and prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming citizens. Without US citizenship, Mabel Lee could not vote. Yet, she and other Chinese suffragists advocated for women’s voting rights, even though they did not benefit from the legislation.<br /> <br /> After graduating from Barnard College, Lee got a PhD in economics at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/low-memorial-library.htm\">Columbia University</a>. She was the first Chinese woman to do so. In 1921, Lee published her research as a book called The Economic History of China.<br /> <br /> Ever since high school, Mabel had wanted to move back to China and start a girl’s school. But after her father died in 1924, she took over his role as director of the First Chinese Baptist Church of New York City. She later founded the Chinese Christian Center which served as a community center. It offered vocational and English classes, a health clinic, and a kindergarten. Lee never married and devoted her life to the Chinese community.<br /> <br /> Mabel Lee died in 1966. We don’t know if Mabel Lee ever became a US citizen or if she ever voted in the US.<br />  </p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Brooks, Charlotte (2014) “Suffragist Landmark.” <a href=\"https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/asianamericanhistorynyc/?p=435\">Asian American History in NYC: Finding the Asian American Past in the Five Boroughs</a>, August 25, 2014.<br /> <br /> Harvard University Library (2018) “Chinese Exclusion Act (1882).” <a href=\"http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/exclusion.html\">Aspiration, Acculturation, and Impact: Immigration to the United States, 1789-1930</a>, Harvard University Library Open Collection Program.<br /> <br /> Lee, Mabel (1915) “<a href=\"https://timtsengdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mabel-lee-speech-china_s-submerged.pdf\">China’s Submerged Half</a>.” (.pdf)<br /> <br /> New York Times (1912) “Suffrage Army Out on Parade; Perhaps 10,000 Women and Men Sympathizers March for the Cause.” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1912/05/05/archives/suffrage-army-out-on-parade-perhaps-10000-women-and-men.html\">New York Times</a>, May 5, 1912. <br /> <br /> New York Tribune (1912) “Chinese Girl Wants Vote.” <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1912-04-13/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1912&index=5&date2=1913&searchType=advanced&language=&sequence=0&lccn=sn83030214&words=LEE+Lee+Mabel+MABEL&proxdistance=5&state=New+York&rows=20&ortext=Mabel&proxtext=&phrasetext=&andtext=Lee&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1\">New York Tribune</a>, April 13, 1912, p. 3.

As a result, they could afford to send their daughter to college. Terrell received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Oberlin College in Ohio.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Terrell moved to Washington, DC in 1887 and she taught at the M Street School, later known as Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. Her involvement in the early civil rights movement began in 1892 when her friend was lynched by a white mob in Memphis, TN.  Along with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/idabwells.htm\">Ida B. Wells</a>, Terrell brought attention to the atrocity of lynching.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">She was also dedicated to racial uplift. Terrell believed that African Americans would be accepted by white society if they received education and job training. She hoped that if black men and women were seen as successful, they would not be discriminated against. She dedicated herself to educating and helping other African Americans. In addition to serving as president of the National Association of Colored Women, Terrell also supported the black woman’s right to vote. She even picketed the White House demanding women’s suffrage.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Terrell also worked to end discriminatory practices of restaurants in Washington, DC. In the early 1870s, DC passed anti-discrimination laws. Places such as restaurants could not turn away customers due to the color of their skin. But by the 1890s, African Americans were once again being banned from public places. Terrell launched a campaign to reinstate anti-discrimination laws. On February 28, 1950, she and several colleagues entered segregated Thompson Restaurant. When they were refused service, they promptly filed a lawsuit.  Terrell targeted other restaurants, this time using tactics such as boycotts, picketing, and sit-ins. In 1953, the court ruled that segregated eating places in Washington, DC, were unconstitutional.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Terrell helped achieve many civil rights gains during her lifetime. Her home at 326 T Street, N.W. stands as a reminder of her tireless advocacy.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p> <h4 dir=\"ltr\">Sources</h4> <p dir=\"ltr\">Oberlin College. <a href=\"https://terrell.oberlincollegelibrary.org/scalar/mct/index\">Mary Church Terrell: An Original Oberlin Activist</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/mary-church-terrell <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/20-for-2020.htm\"><img alt=\"More Suffragists You Should Know banner\" data-render=\"1|0|0|0|1360|415|3|0|0\" height=\"415\" id=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/20-for-2020.htm||CPIMAGE:6155437|0|\" src=\"/people/images/20-suffragists-banner-w-text.jpg\" style=\"border-width:3px;text-align:center;border-style:solid;\" title=\"20 suffragists banner w text\" width=\"1360\" /></a></p>",

Prince recalled, “My stepfather was stolen from Africa, and while the vessel was at anchor in one of our Eastern ports, he succeeded in making his escape from his captors, by swimming ashore.”<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a></sup></p> <p>Prince also enjoyed a close relationship with her maternal grandfather, Tobias Wornton, or Backus, who spent a portion of his life enslaved to a ship captain from Gloucester, Massachusetts.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]</a></sup> From a young age, Prince became well-acquainted with the horrors of slavery and the courage of self-emancipation.</p> <p>As an adult, Prince moved to Boston in search of work to support her family. Baptized by the Reverend Thomas Paul at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/african-meeting-house.htm\">African Meeting House</a> in 1817, she joined the free Black community on the north slope of Beacon Hill.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref4\">[4]</a> </sup>In 1824, Prince married her husband, Nero Prince, who served the Russian Princess Purtossof. A few months later, she moved to Russia with him.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref5\">[5]</a></sup> For nearly a decade, they resided in Russia until her declining health forced her to return to Boston. Prince departed Russia ahead of her husband, who died before he could follow her.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref6\">[6]</a></sup></p> <p>Over the following years, Prince made several voyages to Jamaica to participate in anti-slavery work, always returning to Beacon Hill where she remained an active and visible member of her community.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref7\">[7]</a></sup> In the spring of 1839, Prince delivered lectures on Russian culture at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/abiel-smith-school.htm\">Abiel Smith School</a> and the AME Zion Church on Cambridge Street.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref8\">[8]</a></sup> That same year, she became a founding member of the abolitionist organization the New England Non-Resistance Society.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref9\">[9]</a></sup> By 1840, Prince had established herself as a dedicated abolitionist, in part due to her continued membership in the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society.</p> <img alt=\"Newspaper clipping about a lecture by Mrs. Prince\" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|500|332|0|5|5\" height=\"332\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6631825|0|\" src=\"/people/images/lecture-by-Mrs.PNG\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;border-style:solid;\" title=\"lecture by Mrs. Prince\" width=\"500\" /> <p style=\"font-size: .75rem;\"><em>Published in an 1839 edition of the newspaper The Liberator, this article advertises a lecture to be delivered by Nancy Prince on “the manners and customs of Russia,” in Boston at the AME Zion Church.

In 1847, a slave catcher named Woodfork arrived in Boston to arrest a suspected fugitive on the north slope of Beacon Hill. As many Bostonians deduced, Woodfork sought to recapture Mrs. Dorsey, “…a woman who, by some means, had succeeded in shaking off oppression’s yoke and reaching Boston.”<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref10\">[10]</a></sup></p> <p>In the mid-morning, at a time when all the men were away at work, a commotion arose at the end of Smith Court. A group of young boys reported that a slave-catcher had entered Mrs. Dorsey’s house. Led by Nancy Prince, the women of the neighborhood immediately responded, coming to the rescue of Mrs. Dorsey. Bostonian Thomas B. Hilton recounted the moment:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Only for an instant did the fiery eyes of Mrs. Prince rest upon the form of the villain, as if to be fully assured that it was he, for in the next moment she had grappled with him, and before he could fully recognize his position she, with the assistance of the colored women that had accompanied her, had dragged him to the door and thrust him out of the house.</em><sup><a href=\"#_ftnref11\">[11]</a></sup></p> <p>In the moments that followed, the slave-catcher Woodfork made a hasty departure from the scene, aware of his inability to recapture Mrs. Dorsey. Hilton recalled that Woodfork did not return to the north slope of Beacon Hill, nor Boston, for another three years. With little warning and few resources, Nancy Prince and the women from her community successfully protected a woman from recapture and ejected a slavecatcher from the city of Boston.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref12\">[12]</a></sup></p> <img alt=\"A historic map of Beacon Hill of Boston, with Smith Court. \" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|600|319|0|5|5\" height=\"319\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6631929|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Smith-Court-map.PNG\" style=\"margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;\" title=\"Smith Court map\" width=\"600\" /> <p style=\"font-size: .75rem;\"><em>This image of the 1875 Boston Smith map depicts the north slope of Beacon Hill.

            "bodyText": "<p>Born in 1861 at Lihue, Kauai in the Kingdom of Hawaii, Wilhelmina Kekelaokalaninui Widemann was the daughter of Mary Kaumana Pilahiulani, a Native Hawaiian, and German immigrant Hermann A. Widemann. Part of the Royal Hawaiian family, her father was a cabinet minister for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/did-you-know-queen-liliuokalani.htm\">Queen Lili’uokalani</a>. Due to these connections, King Kalākaua and Queen Kapi’olan were present at her wedding to Jack Dowsett in 1888.<br /> <br /> Five short years later, pro-American interests, with the assistance of US Marines, overthrew Queen Lili’uokalani and established the Republic of Hawai’i. The former island nation was annexed to the United States in 1898. With the introduction of this new territory to the Union, the mainland suffragists turned their eyes towards the Pacific to see if any progress could be made.<br /> <br /> Written by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a> and other officers of the NAWSA, the “Hawaiian Appeal” of 1899 asked the US Congress to give Hawaiian women the right to vote “upon whatever conditions and qualifications the right of suffrage is granted to Hawaiian men.” While Anthony and others wanted all women to have voting rights, they were especially concerned about non-Christian Native Hawaiian men gaining that power before the white and Native Hawaiian women of the territory. The Hawaiian Appeal received criticism from almost all corners. Local women, like Dowsett, felt that petitioning the territorial government for greater civil rights was the way to go.<br /> <br /> In 1912, Dowsett founded the National Women’s Equal Suffrage Association of Hawai’i (WESAH), the first Hawaiian suffrage organization. Modeling its constitution on that of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), they invited mainland suffragists to speak to the group. One of these women included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">Carrie Chapman Catt</a> in 1918, who spoke in positive terms about the group after the meeting. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the efforts of women like Dowsett and WESAH, President Wilson signed a bill allowing the residents of the territory to decide for themselves. Gathering both Native Hawaiian and white suffragists at the capitol building on the morning of the Senate vote on March 4, 1919, Dowsett declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Sister Hawaiians, our foreign sisters are with us. Senator Wise asked us yesterday if the so-called ‘society women’ were leading us, and we told him that this was not so. We are working all together, and we want the legislature to know this. And we must also remember our Oriental sisters, who are not here today but who will also unite this great cause.”’</p> </blockquote> <p>While many in the territory, like those on the mainland, were against granting the right of suffrage to Asian women, Dowsett included them in her vision of Hawai’i’s future. The bill passed the Hawaiian Senate that day, but a fresh battle was waiting in the House. Instead of granting women’s suffrage immediately, the House decided to put it to a vote of the Hawaiian electorate in 1920. Furious with that response, Dowsett and 500 other women of “various nationalities, of all ages” poured onto the House floor with banners demanding “Votes for Women.” Forced to reckon with the demonstrators, the House held hearings the next day for proponents and opponents to make their case. Standing alongside Dowsett were a wide variety of Hawai’ian women including Princess Kalaniana’ole and Lahilahi Webb, former lady-in-waiting to Queen Lili’uokalani’s court.<br /> <br /> A month later, the House had not budged and the suffragists of Hawai’i were losing their patience. Regrouping, Dowsett and her group began to lobby directly to the U.S. Congress through the territorial representative, Prince Kūhiō. They also began to create grassroots groups throughout the territory to prepare women for the vote when that opportunity arrived. Hawaiian women became enfranchised along with their mainland sisters when the 19th Amendment became part of the U.S. Constitution in August 1920. As residents of a U.S. territory, however, their elected representation was limited.<br /> <br /> It would take another 39 years for Hawai’i to become the 50th state in the Union, and for the residents of Hawai’i, both male and female, to gain full US voting rights. Dowsett did not live long enough to see that day; she died December 10, 1929. She is buried next to her husband in Oahu Cemetery, Honolulu.<br />  </p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Barker, Joanne.

            "bodyText": "<p>Andrew Richardson filed his Homestead Application No. 2180 in the New Orleans, land office on March 1, 1871 for 40.20 acres of land. He paid the fee of seven dollars to the Homestead Receiver’s Office for this entry located at South West quarter of North East Quarter of Section Thirty-four (34) in Township, Two (2) South of Range Four (4). Andrew died in 1876 in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana, leaving his wife Sarah to continue the application process.<br /> <br /> As reported in the 1900 United States census, Andrew Richardson was born in St. Helena Parish in about 1852. According to the 1880 United States Federal Census, he lived in the 2nd Ward within the parish of St. Helena. These records show that his father was from Virginia and his mother was from Georgia. His primary occupation was farming. Nathan and Dicy Harden Richardson were his parents. Among his siblings were: Dan Richardson, Wesley Richardson, and Mary Richardson. <br /> <br /> Nathan and a woman named Carrie were enslaved on the Benjamin and Celia Bankston Plantation in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana. Through oral history accounts from the late Luella Vining Richardson, Nathan and Carrie were believed to be brother and sister. Nathan can be found on the inventory of Benjamin and Celia, dated May 30, 1855.<br /> <br /> Andrew Richardson and his family are listed on a July 13, 1866, Freedman Bureau’s Labor Contract for Joseph Richardson in St. Helena Parish. It states that Miles Leave 38, Marion 26, and Verily Womack are to receive one half of the cotton raised upon the farm after deducting all expenses including the expenses of the laborers and of the said Richardson family. Richardson is to purchase everything necessary. Miles Leave is to furnish mules, and said Richardson agreed to feed mules only when they work, and they are not to be sold are taken away with the consent of Richardson. The laborers will receive two summer sets and one winter set of working clothes; medical attention was to be provided as necessary as one of the expenses of the farm. The following named hands are governed by the same agreement but, are to work a piece of land known as the Carruth place: \"Nathan Richardson 40, Dicey 40, Wesley 16, Caroline 20, Mary 20, Andrew 15, George Wilson 29 and Joseph Womack 20, Dotia Fisher 18, Henderson Womack 18. Each will receive $5.00 per month and were to be paid when the crop was sold. During the year they were to receive two suits of working clothes and one pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Andrew and his wife Sarah Jane Foster Richardson had seven children living with them (Alonzo, Monroe, Girtie, Clacie L., John H., Margaret, and Leonard) when the 1900 United States census was taken. The 1900 census taker spelled his name as \"Anna”. Another element of complexity was in the land entry papers which stated that Andrew died in 1876 yet, he appeared in the 1880 and 1900 census. In the latter census, he and Sarah were married for twenty-four years.<br /> <br /> Sarah Jane Foster Richardson was born on October 9, 1861 and died on July 9, 1912. She was buried in Black Greek AME Cemetery in St. Helena Parish, LA., where Andrew was buried.<br /> <br /> Two witnesses testified on behalf of Sarah’s homestead claim: William H. Smith and Benjamin Pierce, stating they had known Sarah Richardson for eight years. They confirmed that Andrew “built an 18x12 feet square house containing four rooms and lived in the house from the 7th day of March 1871 until his death.\" He made the following improvements to the land that included a stable and shed; a vegetable garden; dug a water well and also had a peach and other fruit trees.<br /> <br /> Sarah swore that she was the lawful widow of Andrew Richardson who died on October 10, 1876 at their home in St. Helena Parish. She continued to live there, made improvements and claimed it her home since her husband passed away.<br /> <br /> On August 10, 1878, she appeared for her claim and requested that the final Land Affidavit and Final Homestead Proof submitted be accepted, and was granted the land patent in her name.<br /> <br /> <strong>~ Contributed by Dr. Antoinette Harrell</strong><br /> Dr. Antoinette Harrell is a historian and genealogist who specializes in research at the Louisiana Florida Parishes. Dr. Harrell is committed to researching and documenting the untold stories of African Americans in the Louisiana Florida Parishes.<br /> <br /> <strong>More from the contributor:</strong>  Andrew Richardon's father Nathan had a sister named Carrie who was my 4th great-grandmother. During the 1931 wedding of my maternal grandmother Josephine Richardson Harrell and my grandfather Jasper Leon Harrell, Sr., Andrew's son John Wesley Richardson and Andrew’s grandson Emmitt Nathaniel Richardson served as her witnesses. Emmitt and my grandmother Josephine were one year apart. The oral history and family connections of the Richardson family perished when many of the elderly members of the family passed away. This Homestead Entry provides evidence that Andrew Richardson and my Thomas Richardson had a family connection.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/services/land-records\">Land Records | Bureau of Land Management (blm.gov)</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "Isaiah Mays was born enslaved on February 16, 1858, in Carter’s Bridge Virginia. In 1865, after the Civil War ended, Mays and his family moved to Ohio. When he was 23, Mays enlisted in the Twenty-Fourth Infantry at the Columbus Barracks. By 1889, he had achieved the rank of corporal in the Twenty-Fourth’s Company B.<br /> <br /> On May 11 of that year, Mays and other members of Company B escorted Major Joseph W. Wham from Fort Grant to Fort Thomas in the Arizona Territory to deliver $28,345.10 in gold coins for the military payroll. Major Wham had been delivering payroll in this fashion for 12 years. The Buffalo Soldiers traveling with him had a combined 85 years of military service. Nevertheless, en route, the two-wagon convoy was attacked in what came to be known as the Wham Paymaster Robbery.<br /> <br /> The first wagon had Wham, his assistant, and Private Hamilton Lewis of the Twenty-Fourth, who drove the mule team. It also held the gold coins weighing 250 pounds in an oak strongbox. Behind Wham’s wagon, the escort wagon carried eight members of the Twenty-Fourth Infantry along with two members of the Tenth Cavalry riding beside on horseback. As the group traveled the road toward Fort Thomas and Wham’s wagon crested the hill, Lewis noticed a large boulder pushed into the middle of the road. As the men of the Twenty-Fourth tried to move the boulder out of the road, a shot came from a fortified position 50 feet above. A volley of about 20 guns followed, according to Wham’s after-action report. For about 30 minutes the soldiers exchanged gunfire with the ambushers.<br /> <br /> As casualties among the soldiers continued to mount, Corporal Mays took it upon himself to go for help. He knew that if help didn’t arrive that he and his comrades would not survive the assault. Mays crawled and ran more than two miles to the nearest ranch for help. By the time more soldiers arrived the bandits had taken the gold and fled. While most of the soldiers were wounded no members of the escort died during this confrontation.<br /> <br /> In Wham’s report, he stressed the bravery and valor of the Black soldiers who were with him that day. He wrote, “I never witnessed better courage or better fighting than shown by these soldiers, on May 11, 1889.” A U.S. Marshal who investigated the robbery concurred. In his report, he wrote, “I am satisfied a braver or better defense could not have been made under like circumstances, and to have remained longer would have proven a useless sacrifice of life without a vestige of hope to succeed.”<br /> <br /> Wham recommended Mays for the Medal of Honor in September 1889, which he was awarded on February 19, 1890. His citation read, “Gallantry in the fight between Paymaster Wham’s escort and robbers. Mays walked and crawled 2 miles to a ranch for help.”<br /> <br /> Shortly after the robbery, several suspects were arrested. Although during their trial, some members of the escort including Major Wham and Corporal Mays testified and identified some of bandits, the jury found the defendants not guilty. No one was ever held accountable for the robbery, and the $28,345.10 was never recovered.<br /> <br /> Corporal Mays served in the army until 1893 when he was given his discharge so he could return home to take care of his elderly parents. His discharge came with the condition that he pay his own travel costs. However, there is no evidence that Mays ever went to care for his parents. After his discharge he worked as a laborer in San Carlos, Arizona, close to Fort Grant. In 1922, he applied for a military pension; it was denied because he had not completed his enlistment when he was discharged in 1893. Mays died on May 2, 1925, in Phoenix, Arizona, at age 65. He was buried at Arizona State Hospital Cemetery in Phoenix.<br /> <br /> For 76 years, Mays’s Arizona grave was marked only by a brick with a number etched on it. In 2001, an official Medal of Honor headstone was put in the marker’s place. And in 2009, the military reinterred Mays’s remains at Arlington National Cemetery, in Section 1, Grave 630-B.",

            "bodyText": "Henry Johnson was born on July 15, 1892, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In his early teens, Johnson and his family moved to Albany, New York. He held various jobs including soda mixer, coal-yard laborer, chauffeur, and redcap porter at Albany’s Union Station. <br /> <br /> Johnson enlisted in Company C, Fifteenth New York (Colored) Infantry Regiment on June 5, 1917. The Fifteenth New York was originally founded in 1913 in the New York Army National Guard. In line with the military’s racial segregation policies, the unit was all-Black. Once the United States entered World War I, the Fifteenth New York was called into federal service and redesignated the 369th Infantry Regiment. The 369th Infantry was assigned to the 93rd Division, which was one of two divisions comprising African Americans. General John J. Pershing, American Expeditionary Force commander, avoided placing the 369th Infantry or other Black units on the front lines, reflecting the military leadership’s view that African Americans could not be effective combat soldiers. They were deployed in logistics and support roles.<br /> <br /> In March 1918, General Pershing assigned the 369th Infantry to the beleaguered French, who needed combat troops and were accustomed to deploying their own Black colonial troops. While the Americans warned the French not to treat the 369th Infantry and other African Americans the same as white troops, the French ignored this advice and welcomed the 369th Infantry into their fighting force. After training the men with French weapons, the French sent the 369th Infantry to the Argonne Forest in the Champagne region. <br /> <br /> The transfer to the front lines in the Argonne Forest was the beginning of 191 days straight in the frontline trenches during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The Germans fighting against them called the 369th Infantry men “Hollenkampfer,” meaning Hellfighter. This is how they received the nickname Harlem Hellfighters. They called themselves the Harlem Rattlers, after the snake on the Revolutionary War-era Gadsden flag.<br /> <br /> On the evening of May 14, 1918, Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts, a fellow soldier in the 369th Infantry, had observation-post duty forward of the main line. About 2 a.m. on May 15, Johnson and Roberts saw approximately 25 German soldiers approaching their position. They soon engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Germans. Leaving the cover of his position, Johnson used his gun as a club and his bolo knife when he ran out of bullets. He saw two German soldiers trying to capture his comrade and managed to prevent them from capturing Roberts. Both men sustained severe wounds. <br /> <br /> The Germans took heavy casualties and retreated before French reinforcements arrived and evacuated Johnson and Roberts to an aid station behind the main lines. During the battle, Johnson received 21 wounds. It is estimated that he killed four Germans and wounded 10 to 20 others.<br /> <br /> For his actions on May 15, 1918, Johnson was awarded the French Croix de Guerre avec Palme, France’s highest award for valor. He was one of the first Americans to receive this honor. The French orders, dated May 16, stated that Henry Johnson “gave a magnificent example of courage and energy.” Johnson was also dubbed “Black Death” for his fierce fighting that night. <br /> <br /> Johnson returned home with the rest of the 369th Infantry in February 1919 to a hero’s welcome. During the 369th Infantry’s victory parade in New York City he led his unit as it marched up Fifth Avenue. Still recovering from his wounds, he traveled in an open car, waving to the spectators. During this time, the government used Johnson’s image to sell victory stamps and on Army recruiting materials. <br /> <br /> Despite his valor, the Army discharged Johnson shortly after his return home. His discharge papers made no mention of his wounds or the valor he displayed. He did not receive disability pay after the war. After his discharge, the government and the American people forgot him. <br /> <br /> Johnson returned to Albany, where he resumed his job as a redcap porter. Because of his injuries, work was difficult, and he was not able to support himself and his family. These hardships led to the breakup of Johnson’s marriage. His wife and children left him; he died alone and penniless on July 1, 1929, in New Lenox, Illinois. He was given a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and was buried in Section 25, Site 64.<br /> <br /> In the 1990s, Johnson’s story was rediscovered during a reexamination of African Americans’ World War I military records. In 1996, President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded Johnson the Purple Heart. In 2002, the U.S. Army awarded Johnson the second-highest military honor, the Distinguished Service Cross. Finally, on June 2, 2015, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Johnson the Medal of Honor during a White House ceremony.<br /> <br /> Johnson’s Medal of Honor citation reads:<br /> “Private Henry Johnson distinguished himself by extraordinary acts of heroism at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a member of Company C, 369th Infantry Regiment, 93d Infantry Division, American Expeditionary Forces on May 15, 1918, during combat operations against the enemy on the front lines of the Western Front in France. In the early morning hours, Private Johnson and another soldier were on sentry duty at a forward outpost when they received a surprise attack from a German raiding party consisting of at least 12 soldiers. While under intense enemy fire and despite receiving significant wounds, Private Johnson mounted a brave retaliation, resulting in several enemy casualties. When his fellow soldier was badly wounded and being carried away by the enemy, Private Johnson exposed himself to grave danger by advancing from his position to engage the two enemy captors in hand-to-hand combat. Wielding only a knife and gravely wounded himself, Private Johnson continued fighting, defeating the two captors and rescuing the wounded soldier. Displaying great courage, he continued to hold back the larger enemy force until the defeated enemy retreated leaving behind a large cache of weapons and equipment and providing valuable intelligence. Without Private Johnson’s quick actions and continued fighting, even in the face of almost certain death, the enemy might have succeeded in capturing prisoners and the outpost, without abandoning valuable intelligence. Private Johnson’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, Company C, 369th Infantry Regiment, 93d Infantry Division and the United States Army.”<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "John Hanks Alexander was born on January 6, 1864, in Helena, Arkansas. His parents were James Milo Alexander and Fannie Miller Alexander. The elder Alexander was a prosperous barber and grocery salesman, who succeeded in purchasing a home and several other properties in Helena by the time John was born. Mrs. Alexander was a sought-after domestic servant whose favorable reputation kept her consistently employed.<br /> <br /> Education played a significant role in the lives of all the Alexander children. As a youth, John Hanks ranked first in his class. After graduating from high school, he worked as a teacher in Carrollton, Mississippi. In 1881, at the age of 17, he enrolled in Oberlin College in Ohio. <br /> <br /> At Oberlin, he was an excellent student. A fellow Oberlin classmate recalled that he “got a perfect mark on the daily recitations…and also the highest marks possible on examinations for a period of two years.” At the end of his second year at Oberlin, he decided to try for an appointment to West Point, passing his initial examination on May 14, 1883. John Hanks was appointed to the United States Military Academy by Congressman George W. Geddes of Mansfield, Ohio.<br /> <br /> The news of Alexander’s appointment garnered widespread notice in the press. Both The New York Times and the New York Tribune reported on his acceptance. The story got wide coverage in African American newspapers in Little Rock and Hot Springs, Arkansas, Cleveland, Ohio, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.<br /> <br /> During his time at West Point, Alexander did well academically. In 1884, a West Point official noted that he was “making a better record than any other colored cadet ever admitted” and described him as “a splendid scholar, getting along finely.” Despite his exceptional academic standing, John Hanks Alexander was not welcomed at West Point. He suffered racial slurs from his classmates. He was excluded from extracurricular activities. Most of the time, he was “silenced,” a form of extreme social ostracism; other cadets would speak to him only in official capacities. When attending Sunday Chapel, Alexander routinely sat in a pew by himself or with the other Black cadets, including Charles Young. The white cadets refused to sit near him. The academy did not allow Alexander to room with white cadets. <br /> <br /> In all these ways, Alexander spent his first years at the academy in social isolation. However, after his second year, he roomed with Charles Young until he graduated. This helped alleviate some of the stress both men felt in this hostile environment. Alexander helped mentor Young, who was two years behind him at West Point, and helped Young navigate the academic and social realities of the academy.<br /> <br /> From the moment Alexander was accepted to West Point he looked forward to having his mother attend his graduation. He regularly put money aside so that he could buy a train ticket for her from Helena to West Point. Alexander graduated 32nd out of 64 cadets in his class on June 11, 1887. He received his diploma from General Philip Sheridan with “thunderous hand clapping.” His mother, who was born enslaved, was fiercely proud of her son.<br /> <br /> On September 30, 1887, Alexander reported to his first duty station at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. He was assigned to the Ninth U.S. Cavalry, one of two segregated all-Black cavalry regiments in the U.S. Army. Alexander was the first African American officer to serve in the Ninth Cavalry. At the time, he was the only Black officer in the military; Henry O. Flipper, the first African American to graduate from West Point, was dismissed from the army in 1882.<br /> <br /> Alexander remained at Fort Robinson until March 1888, when he and M Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry, were transferred to Fort Washakie, Wyoming. During his time at Fort Robinson and Fort Washakie, he performed the duties of a second lieutenant. On June 11, 1888, Alexander along with M Troop started a 17-day march from Fort Washakie to Fort Duchesne in Utah. Alexander described the land as “beautiful and grand beyond description.” In 1891, Alexander was transferred back to Fort Robinson, where he received a commendation from superior officers for his accomplishments as an assistant commissary officer in charge of the post exchange.<br /> <br /> On January 6, 1894, the War Department assigned Alexander to detached service at Wilberforce University in Ohio as professor of military science and tactics. The military science and tactics program at Wilberforce University was the first of its kind for African Americans in the country. Alexander’s appointment got a great deal of coverage in Black newspapers. Wilberforce University, founded in the 1850s as a joint venture of the Cincinnati, Ohio Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), was the nation’s first private college for African Americans. By the 1890s, the AME Church owned the university.<br /> <br /> On March 26, 1894, while at a barber in Springfield, Ohio, Alexander complained of a severe headache, collapsed, and died. The official cause of death was listed as apoplexy. A white militia company escorted Alexander’s body back to Wilberforce for burial. With his brother in attendance representing the family, John Hanks Alexander was buried with full military honors at Cherry Grove Cemetery in Xenia, Ohio.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Clem Horn filed Homestead Application #14524 for 160.4 acres of land in Coffee County, Alabama on August 11<sup>th</sup>, 1883 and received his land patent certificate #7508 on June 8<sup>th</sup>, 1891.<br /> <br /> Clem Horn was born enslaved in Georgia in 1825. After emancipation, he moved across the Chattahoochee River into Henry County, Alabama. He was enumerated on the 1870 census in the community of Lawrenceville with his wife, Sarah, and two of their daughters: Elizabeth and Jane. In 1873, Elizabeth (later known as Betty) married Warren Law at the historic Piney Grove Baptist Church in Headland, Alabama. They were married by Reverend Jesse Grant, a Black Homesteader who may have been the catalyst for Clem finding his own homestead land.<br /> <br /> Clem became a widower and moved 60 miles southwest to Coffee County, Alabama in the late 1870s. Betty separated from her husband, relocated along with her father, and fell in love with a homesteader from Coffee Springs named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/vandy-hutchinson.htm\">Vandy Hutchins</a>. Clem married a young woman named Caroline McGowan and settled less than a mile away from Vandy’s farm.<br /> <br /> On August 11th, 1883, Clem went to the office of Benjamin M. Stevens, Judge of Probate Court in Elba, Alabama. He filed Homestead Application #14524 for 160.4 acres of land in Coffee County, and also a Homestead Affidavit for settlers that couldn’t travel to the District Land Office in Montgomery. He testified that he settled on the land on January 1st, 1881, and that he made $75 worth of improvements, including a one room dwelling house and 25 acres of cleared land. He signed the document with an X, indicating that he could not read or write. Clem’s application, as well as a fee of fourteen dollars, reached the Receiver’s Office at Montgomery on August 15th, 1883.<br /> <br /> On October 15th, 1888, Clem returned to the courthouse in Elba to make his Final Affidavit. He testified that the property was “ordinary pine timberland valuable only for farming”. He explained that he bought the land from Stephen Stokes, who had built the 16x18 log house that the Horn family was living in. Within the house was one bed, five chairs, and one table, which Clem claimed to have owned “since freedom”, confirming his former enslavement. The value of the improvements was now $85, including a smokehouse that was worth $10. He also owned an ox, a plow, and five head of cattle. Clem raised 20 acres of crops in 1888, such as corn and cotton. He stated that he had cultivated up to 25 acres of produce in the past.<br /> <br /> Clem’s family at that time consisted of his wife Caroline and their five children, but they went on to have 12 children together. He said he had never voted before, citing his status as an “old negro” as the only reason. Clem signed his affidavit with his name, instead of an X, showing that he had learned to write by 1888. His witnesses were two young men: Caroline’s brother William McGowan, and Green Thompson. Green testified that Clem’s land was worth $1.25 per acre, while William claimed it was worth $1.50 per acre. Both men lived a half mile away from Clem’s homestead and listed a white man named Abraham Chancellor as another close neighbor. The unincorporated community of Chancellor, Alabama was named after Abraham’s father.<br /> <br /> On November 13th, 1888, the Land Office at Montgomery received Clem’s final payment of four dollars and issued him Certificate 7508, proclaiming that he was entitled to a land patent for the south half of the northwest quarter and the north half of the southwest quarter of Section 28 of Township 3N. The southern perimeter of Section 28 is the Coffee/Geneva County line. Clem’s land is currently bordered on the north by County Road 732 and on the east by Thomas Road in Chancellor, Alabama. The patent was signed by President Benjamin Harrison on June 8th, 1891, over ten years after Clem made his settlement.<br /> <br /> Clem was not living on his homestead by the 1900 census, but appeared to be living on the farm of William Bridges Noblin in Geneva County, Alabama. William had his own homestead 17 miles southeast of Clem’s. They both received their patents in June of 1891, but William Noblin was not a Black Homesteader. He retained his homestead lands until his death, and even had a census-designated place named after him.<br /> <br /> Clem died before the 1910 census, most likely in Noblin, Alabama. His widow, Caroline, moved 90 miles west to Castleberry, Alabama, where she died on December 15th, 1944. Clem fathered at least 14 children between 1850 and 1899, many of whom spread throughout the Wiregrass Region of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.<br /> <br /> <strong>~ Contributed by Orice Jenkins, descendant</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Man in blue blazer, glasses, and beard sits holding a crown.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6980614|0|\" src=\"/people/images/IMG_5400.jpeg\" style=\"width:200px;\" title=\"Orice Jenkins\" /><br /> Orice Jenkins<br /> Photo Credit: Edward LaRose<br /> <br /> Orice Jenkins is from Hartford, Connecticut and is the 3x great-grandson of Clem Horn.

            "bodyText": "<p>Robert Smalls was born in 1839, enslaved by a local planter in Beaufort, South Carolina. By the time he was 23 years old, Smalls had won freedom for himself and his family, and was a famous war hero. He became a prominent leader in the community during the Reconstruction era, including service in both the state and national legislature. His story illustrates the transformative potential of Reconstruction throughout the southern United States.</p> <h4>Growing Up In the Lowcountry</h4> <p>Smalls was the son of Lydia Polite, and lived in a small slave cabin behind the home of Henry McKee at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort, South Carolina. McKee enslaved both Smalls and his mother, who served in the house in Beaufort. When Smalls was 12 years old, McKee sent him to Charleston to be hired out. He worked as a waiter in a hotel before eventually hiring out in the city’s docks. There, he met an enslaved woman, Hannah Jones, and they were married around 1856. As enslaved people, their marriage was not legally recognized by the state of South Carolina.</p> <h4>The Civil War and Freedom</h4> <p>By the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Robert Smalls was an enslaved crewmember on a ship called the Planter, operating in the Charleston Harbor. The owners of the ship contracted the vessel out to the Confederate army as a transport ship, and Smalls found himself as a pilot on board the ship. In early 1862, the Confederacy had achieved numerous battlefield victories, and it seemed as if the quest to create an independent slaveholders’ republic might succeed. Robert Smalls decided not to wait and find out. He devised a plan to free not only himself, but his family as well. <br /> <br /> On the night of May 12, 1862, the white crewmembers of the Planter went ashore in Charleston, leaving Smalls and the enslaved crewmembers unattended. Around 3 am, Smalls and his fellow freedom seekers fired up the ship’s boilers and sailed to a wharf to pick up their waiting family members. From there, the sixteen enslaved people passed the Confederate forces at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fosu\">Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie</a>. Being a pilot, Smalls knew the proper signals to give, and even donned a captain’s hat to help disguise his identity as they steamed past the unsuspecting rebels. Smalls sailed the group out to the naval blockade squadron and turned the Planter over to the United States Navy. Robert Smalls and his family were free. </p> <h4>An Emerging Leader</h4> <p>In addition to turning the Planter over to the United States Navy, Robert Smalls provided valuable intelligence on Confederate operations around Charleston Harbor. Using his vast knowledge of the waters there, Smalls served as a pilot on a number of naval vessels operating in action against Confederate forces there, including the Keokuk, an ironclad which was sunk by enemy fire in April 1863, injuring Smalls in the process. <br /> <br /> He was eventually promoted to captain and given command of the Planter. In 1864, Smalls took the Planter to Philadelphia to be overhauled and re-outfitted, and it saw service throughout the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Throughout his military career, Smalls made an effort to return to Beaufort when he could. By January of 1864, using prize money from the capture of the Planter, he had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-robert-smalls-house.htm\">purchased the mansion</a> of Henry McKee - the man who had once enslaved him. He did this during a tax auction of properties belonging to white residents who had fled when the city fell into US hands in 1861. Suddenly this formerly enslaved man found himself not only a war hero and national celebrity, but the property owner of a planter’s mansion.  <br /> <br /> The military and civilian populations of Beaufort turned to Smalls as a natural leader. His status as a war hero partially endeared him to the military authorities in the Lowcountry, and his connections to the thousands of enslaved people, including those of Gullah heritage, made him a natural leader in the emerging Reconstruction era. In April of 1864, Smalls and his wife Hannah hosted, in their new mansion, the wedding of Lavinia Wilson, a formerly enslaved woman who had escaped on the Planter, to a soldier in the 33rd United States Colored Troops. In attendance was the military governor, General Rufus Saxton, and his staff - indicative of the high stature that Smalls held within the region. <br /> <br /> It was later in 1864 that Smalls began his career in politics. While in Philadelphia he was arrested for riding in a segregated streetcar. In response, he organized a boycott that ultimately led to the desegregation of Philadelphia’s transit system in 1867. Also in 1864, Robert Smalls served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention - the start of his decades long political career through the Reconstruction. </p> <h4>In Beaufort During Reconstruction</h4> <p>Shortly after the Civil War ended, Smalls went into business with Richard Gleaves, and they opened a store for Freedmen. Smalls became an advocate for public education, including for himself. In 1868, he served as a delegate to the South Carolina state convention that wrote a new state constitution. Smalls lobbied for public education to be a key component of the new document. That same year he was elected to the state House of Representatives, and was elected to the state Senate in 1872. In 1874, as most areas of the South were falling back under white Democratic control, the citizens of Beaufort elected Robert Smalls to serve in the United States Congress. He eventually served five terms in the House of Representatives between 1875 - 1887. <br /> <br /> Back in Beaufort, Smalls had amassed a good deal of wealth. According to the 1870 Census, when he was just 31 years old - the Smalls family had $6,000 worth of personal property and $1,000 worth of real estate - the value of his former enslaver’s mansion that he now owned. He was also a member of First African Baptist Church in Beaufort, one of the city's several historically Black churches that served as the center of political and social life during Reconstruction. Throughout downtown Beaufort, formerly enslaved people purchased and built homes, and the city became a symbol of the success of Reconstruction policies regarding education, political participation, and land ownership.  </p> <h4>Robert Smalls and the Legacy of Reconstruction</h4> <p>By the time Robert Smalls died in February 1915, southern Democrats had completely retaken the political landscape of the south and instituted harsh segregation policies. The rise of the Lost Cause rewrote the history of Reconstruction, and the successes of men and women like Robert Smalls disappeared from the mainstream narrative. In the 2000s, community members in Beaufort began to lobby for the creation of a national park site to tell the story of Smalls and the importance of Reconstruction. In January 2017, President Barack Obama issued an executive order establishing Reconstruction Era National Monument in Beaufort County, noting the significance of Robert Smalls to our national story. In 2019, the park was renamed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/reer\">Reconstruction Era National Historical Park</a> with a visitor center located just a few blocks away from both Robert Smalls’s home and his final resting place at Tabernacle Baptist Church in Beaufort.  </p>",

But because she was a woman, she didn't have the opportunities that men had. They were designing public parks; her work was in the private realm.\" Landscape architect Diane K. Maguire, quoted in the <i>New York Times, </i>2003.<br /> <br /> Beatrix Farrand was an acclaimed landscape gardener (she preferred the term to architect) whose designs can still be enjoyed in many cultivated spaces today. Among the existing examples of her work are the terraced garden rooms of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dumbarton-oaks-park.htm\">Dumbarton Oaks</a>, and the carriage roads of Acadia National Park. She also worked with both Ellen and Edith Wilson to design a First Lady's Garden for the East Wing of the White House. The area was re-envisioned by Jacqueline Kennedy in 1962 and is now the Rose Garden.</p> <h3>Dumbarton Oaks</h3> <p>Beginning in 1921, Beatrix Farrand transformed the grounds around the Georgian Revival mansion from farmland into terraced gardens that combined American and European elements. She worked with owner Mildred Bliss for decades to cultivate a landscape that evolved over time in harmony with natural changes to the environment. The Dumbarton Oaks gardens represent Farrand's signature style and are her best-known work.</p> <h3>Growing Acadia</h3> <p>\"Her most significant project was working with John D. Rockefeller Jr. on preserving and beautifying the carriage roads in the park. Impressed with her abilities in orchestrating work on the gardens at The Eyrie and her passionate interest in native plants, Rockefeller engaged her to consult on the roadside plantings in the park. They spent afternoons driving along the roads and inspecting the plantings. She injected quantities of native plants in naturalistic groupings so that they looked as if they had always been growing there, sometimes moving clumps from one location in the park to another. In all, sixty varieties of trees, shrubs, and perennials were used, and most of them were native to the island. The plantings remain one of Farrand's most significant legacies in Maine.\"</p> <p>Judith B. Tankard, <em>Beatrix Farrand: Private Gardens, Public Landscapes </em>(The Monacelli Press/Random House, 2009).</p> <p> </p> <h4><strong>Biography of Beatrix Farrand </strong>(from <a href=\"http://tclf.org/pioneer/beatrix-farrand/beatrix-farrand\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a>)</h4> <p>Beatrix Farrand was one of America’s most celebrated landscape architects, renowned for the private estate gardens she designed for East Coast society as well as her work as a landscape consultant at some of the country’s most prestigious private universities and colleges. Dumbarton Oaks, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden (Maine), and the old campus at Princeton University are among her most visible masterpieces today. To this list several recent landscape restorations help enhance our understanding of this important early design professional.</p> <p>Variously hailed as “the Gertrude Jekyll of America” and “the doyenne of the profession,” Farrand owed her success to her unerring eye for design, profound knowledge of horticulture, and deep commitment to her profession that inspired others to follow in her footsteps... She was famous for her complex flower borders as well as her advocacy of native landscapes and plants, which she wove into a classical design framework. In her university work, she championed the concept of vertical gardening, pinning shrubs and climbers to walls to save space, and the selection of plants that would provide interest during the school term. Her landscapes always showed restraint, and many lasted as long as they did because of her vigilance about maintenance.</p> <p>During her fifty-year career, Farrand received more than two hundred commissions, mostly from Old Guard families from New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. In addition to work for private clients, Farrand also established a landscape study center at Reef Point, Maine, where students benefited from demonstration gardens, a herbarium, and an extensive reference library that she had assembled over many years. Farrand was asked to assist in designing a large rose garden for public enjoyment at The New York Botanical Garden. Up until that time, her commissions had included several residential rose gardens, but nothing on the scale envisioned by the botanical garden. Farrand followed the natural lines of the topography—a natural bowl formed by a former pond—to produce an asymmetrical triangular configuration of approximately one and a quarter acres, surrounded by iron lattice fencing. The project, a collaboration with the Horticultural Society of New York, reached the planting stage, but the fencing and ornamental features were not completed until 1985, when the garden was renamed the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden. In 2007, the garden underwent a major renovation that brought the collection of roses into the twenty-first century under the direction of a new garden curator, with 600 varieties of plants representing both historic and modern roses.</p> <p>The recently renovated gardens for the Edward and Mary Harkness summer estate near Waterford, Connecticut, present an excellent example of Farrand's mid-career work. Now known as Harkness Memorial State Park, Farrand began her work here in the early 1920s, around the time she was working on Dumbarton Oaks, several Long Island estates, and campus consultations at Yale and Princeton. Some of the grounds had originally been laid out by Wayne E. Stiles of Brett and Hall. In addition to replanting the existing Italianate garden, Farrand created several new gardens, mainly an East garden with an Asian theme, an alpine rock garden, and a boxwood parterre. The garden restoration, which was initiated by a volunteer group, is now under the direction of the State of Connecticut.</p> <p>Farrand's gardens at Bellefield, The New York Botanical Garden, and Harkness Memorial State Park are all open to the public and provide insight into her diverse design skills. Her final legacy, however, is the ongoing restoration of a small, personal garden she designed for herself at Garland Farm, her last residence, in Mount Desert, Maine. After the loss of Reef Point in 1955, due to financial issues, Farrand moved to Garland Farm to spend the remaining years of her life. Now the headquarters of the Beatrix Farrand Society, Garland Farm is presently restoring her gardens—a formal flower garden and an Asian-inspired garden—as well as establishing the educational center with a library and archives that Farrand envisioned at Reef Point.</p> <h4><strong>References</strong></h4> <p>\"<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/may-flowers-bloom-closer-look-white-house-gardens-past-present/\">As May Flowers Bloom, A Closer Look at White House Gardens Past and Present,</a>\" Whitehouse.gov, May 4, 2018.<br /> <br /> \"<a href=\"https://www.doaks.org/library-archives/garden-archives/biographies/mildred-barnes-bliss\">Mildred Barnes Bliss</a>,\" Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collections.<br /> <br /> \"<a href=\"https://www.doaks.org/library-archives/garden-archives/biographies/beatrix-farrand\">Beatrix Farrand</a>,\" Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collections.<br /> <br /> Jennifer Harbster, \"<a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2010/04/women-in-horticulture/\">Women in Horticulture</a>,\" Library of Congress, April 9, 2010.<br />  <br /> Edward G.

Mary Ward Dorr, his mother, was instrumental in shaping George and his persuasive ability to get the momentum for founding Acadia National Park </h3> <p paraeid=\"{ca20f81d-ddd0-4302-b62c-44c2911cccf1}{214}\" paraid=\"1126836808\">Born in 1820 to an affluent and prestigious family, Mary grew up in an urban Boston environment before the advent of the Civil War. As a young woman, she held friendships with transcendetalists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fiis/learn/historyculture/margaret-fuller.htm\">Margaret Fuller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/julia-ward-howe.htm\">Julia Ward Howe</a>. She married Charles Hazen Dorr in 1850, bringing together two families of high traditional social status and immense wealth. Mary and Charles lived in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston and had two sons, William and George, between the years of 1851 and 1853.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2a9be46a-79e5-48d9-aab7-3d121538f3f1}{19}\" paraid=\"938679860\">In 1868, Charles Dorr purchased the land that would become the Old Farm estate on Mount Desert Island. However, it wasn’t until the death of William in 1876 that the family began to invest in the property’s development more intentionally. Through the 1870’s Mary and her family enjoyed traveling abroad. She had a particularly keen interest in the styles of European gardens. During their time in Europe, the Dorr family was invited to visit various estates that highlighted beautiful gardens and woods. Mary spent these years exploring Spiritualism and landscape artistry while coping with her son’s death.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{2a9be46a-79e5-48d9-aab7-3d121538f3f1}{75}\" paraid=\"322395662\">In 1881, the Old Farm manor was completed, and the Dorr family began to establish their presence at the estate. Through the 1880’s Mary Dorr turned her attention to the development of the property gardens, planting a variety of shrubs, flowers and fruits; many of which were transplants from their home in Jamaica Plain. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/beatrix-farrand.htm\">Beatrix Farrand</a>, who would eventually work on landscaping of the park’s carriage roads, wrote journal entries detailing the plantings at Old Farm during these early years.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2a9be46a-79e5-48d9-aab7-3d121538f3f1}{133}\" paraid=\"1585141926\">In the early 1880’s, Bar Harbor saw quick development and commercialization. Mary and her husband were some of the incorporators of a new organization called the Bar Harbor Village Improvement Association (VIA). The VIA’s mission was to “preserve and develop the natural beauties of the place, and to enhance their attractions”. Mary took on the role as chairman of the Committee on Trees, a committee focused on the clearing of downed trees and installation of new plantings. She authored annual reports for the committee and was recognized for her “good taste in planning improvements and energy in carrying them out”.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2a9be46a-79e5-48d9-aab7-3d121538f3f1}{191}\" paraid=\"1921430520\">Mary passed away in 1901 before the 19th amendment was ratified, granting women the right to vote. Yet, she was skilled in her ability to make her voice heard. In honor of his mother, in 1909 George donated the land for a bicycle path he had constructed for her that led from the Old Farm estate to Beaver Dam Pool. This was his first large donation of land to the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservation, which would become a part of Acadia National Park. <br /> <br /> <strong>References:</strong><br /> Epp, RH 2016. <i>Creating Acadia National Park: The Biography of George Bucknam Dorr</i>.

            "bodyText": "<p>Anne Mills Archbold was born in New York City, New York on November 24, 1873. She had a sister, Mary Lavina Archbold, who was two years older.<br /> <br /> Anne and Mary's parents were Annie Eliza Mills of Pennsylvania and John Dustin Archbold. Archbold was one of the earliest oil refiners and became a close associate of John D. Rockefeller. Archbold took over many of the business elements of the Standard Oil Company which allowed Rockefeller to focus on his charitable works and philanthropy. <br /> <br /> The Archbold family grew after Anne's birth to include Frances Dana Archbold (b. 1875) and John Foster Archbold (b. 1877). In 1885, the family moved from New York City to Tarrytown, New York where they lived on a large estate called \"Cedar Cliff.\" Anne lived a privileged life as her father amassed more wealth and more power in his involvement with the Standard Oil Company businesses. She was educated in Paris, France and Florence, Italy and in 1903 was painted by Frederick MacMonnies. The portrait is now in the Comenos Fine Arts in Boston.</p> <h4>Travel</h4> <p>John Archbold's wealth allowed his daughter to travel when she reached adulthood. Her name appears on ships lists throughout the 1890s. In 1906, she traveled to the \"far east\" where she was one of the first western women to visit Tibet.<br /> <br /> While there, she met Armar Dayrolles Saunderson, an Irishman. Armar was the son of Colonel Edward James Saunderson who was a member of the English House of Commons and lead the Irish Unionist Party there. The seat of the Saunderson family was Castle Saunderson, Ireland.</p> <h4>Marriage</h4> <p>On June 14, 1906, it was announced in newspapers across the United States that Anne was engaged to marry Armar Saunderson. Two days after the announcement of the engagement hit American Newspapers, an English newspaper stated that the wedding had already happened and that it had taken place in the club house of Cuttyhunk Island in Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts. The Evening Standard of London called the island \"one of the most romantic spots on the Atlantic coast.\" Friends later said that the wedding had come as a surprise due to the suddenness of it.<br /> <br /> The couple traveled to Ireland and in October they were celebrated on the estate at Castle Saunderson in conjunction with Colonel Saunderson's birthday.<br /> <br /> The couple honeymooned in Europe and were written about on their travels. In 1907, their first child, Lydia Ann, was born while they were still in France. At her baptism, she was sponsored by Grand Duke Michael, who gifted her with a full table service made of silver. Anne was later presented at the English court.<br /> <br /> The marriage, and death of his father in 1906, allowed Armar to buy his own estate in England. He pursued his interests in agriculture and had a dairy farm.</p> <h4>Big Game</h4> <p>In 1908, the newspapers were full of news about passengers arriving on the ship Lusitania. The Saunderson family were passengers, but Lydia and her two pet lion cubs were the stars of the show. Baby Lydia (or Princess Lydia as the papers dubbed her) was seen playing on decks with two lion cubs who had been captured alive by Anne while she and her husband had been hunting big game in Africa. When the ship docked in New York, Lydia and Anne were distraught at not being able to take the lions home with them. The cubs had to remain in quarantine on the docks and were eventually taken to the Bronx Zoo where they were star attractions for many years.<br /> <br /> Throughout 1908, Anne made several donations of big game trophies to natural history museums and was frequently featured in newspaper articles talking about decorating with exotic furnishings.<br /> <br /> The Saundersons were guests at Oyster Bay in 1910, where they spoke with Theodore Roosevelt about their African excursion and the game to be hunted there. He was preparing for his own African safari and was gathering information for that trip.</p> <h4>Family</h4> <p>The Saunderson family continued to grow throughout the 1910s. Armar Edward was born in 1909 and a second son, John Dana, was born in 1911 in Bar Harbor, Maine. The youngest child was a girl, Moira, who was born in 1912. The family lived on an estate in England called Foxlease. Little is known about their early lives or time in England.</p> <h4>Death of her father</h4> <p>John D. Archbold died in December of 1916 of appendicitis. His illness was followed in the paper and included several blood donations from staff. The Rockefellers were remained close to the Tarrytown estate as John Archbold's health failed. He'd been Rockefeller's right hand man for many years.<br /> <br /> After his death, papers at the time tracked Anne's journey across the Atlantic to arrive for the reading of her father's will. The will was very simple, leaving 1/3 of his property to his wife Anne and the remainder to be shared equally between his three surviving children.<br /> <br /> Tax documents filed in Colorado show that John's one hundred and eighty shares of stock in the Continental Oil Company held a valuation of $99,900. Anne's share of just this portion of the estate was $10,779.20. Additional shares sold in Wisconsin brought Anne an additional $43,000. <br /> <br /> In the end, the estate was valued having a net worth of $38,239,895.68 of which Anne inherited $9 million. </p> <h4>Divorce</h4> <p>Anne divorced Armar Saunderson in 1922. American papers claimed that she and her children were \"held virtually captive\" by her husband and that she was \"rescued\" along with her children on a Standard Oil Steamer. The divorce was certainly bitter and Anne may have \"stolen\" her children from England as they had been made wards of the court to prevent her from taking them from English soil.<br /> <br /> Anne had retained Foxlease in the divorce and in an effort to sever all ties with England she offered the property, which included over 60 acres of land, to the Girl Guides. The Girl Guides did not buy the property as the upkeep was thought to be beyond their means. They still acquired the property in 1922 when the estate was gifted to Princess Mary, who was a sponsor of the Girl Guide association. Anne gave the estate to Princess Mary as a wedding present, who then presented it as a trust to the Girl Guides. In 1922, Olave Baden-Powell, then World Chief Guide, wrote to Juliette Gordon Lowe, founder of the Girl Scouts in the US to discuss the benefits of Foxlease which came with \"a lovely big house with 24 bedrooms, nine bath-rooms(!), electric light, central heating, lovely garden, camping grounds, etc. Too perfect for description.\"<br /> <br /> Today, Foxlease is still a training and activity center for Girl Guides in the United Kingdom.<br /> <br /> After divorcing Armar Saunderson and returning to the United States, Anne took up her maiden name of Archbold and had her children's names legally changed to Archbold. None of the children used the Saunderson name ever again.</p> <h4>Feminist, Individualist, Philanthropist</h4> <p>Anne went by \"Mrs. Anne Archbold\" for the remainder of her life. She rented an estate called \"Greystones\" close to Rock Creek Park when she first returned to Washington, DC after her divorce. The estate was popular with Secretary of State Hughs, who rented it for his family when he was in town. Anne lived at Greystones for six months and made plans to purchase land west of town. She settled on a 60-acre tract of land on Reservoir Road to the west of Georgetown. She hired a female architect, Josephine Wright Chapman, to design her new home. She called it \"Hillandale\" and it was described as a Spanish style home, sometimes described as a villa. It faced south and offered visitors views of the capital dome and Washington Monument in the distance. To date, the Hillandale buildings are the only known examples of Chapman's design in the city of Washington.<br /> <br /> Anne used the Hillandale estate to train German shepherds as guide dogs for the visually impaired and others to be used by police forces. Her children were often in society papers, especially Lydia who was captain of the Washington polo team and was a fashionable debutante.<br /> <br /> Hillandale was not her only home. She had houses in Maine and Rhode Island and frequently traveled to Florida, New York and the Bahamas.<br /> <br /> Anne Archbold joined the National Woman's Party and was a proponent of the Equal Rights Act. In 1923 she was photographed with a group of women who were \"about to invade the offices of the senators and cogressmen from their states, to ask them to vote for Equal Rights.\" She also joined a delegation that petitioned President Harding directly.<br /> <br /> Anne and Lydia's names frequently appeared in newspapers across the country--Anne's for philanthropic work and Lydia's for horses and descriptions of society events. Lydia's debut gown and March 1928 wedding to Lieutenant Elliott Strauss were described in great detail in newspapers across the United States. She was photographed many times with her champion horses and once in her costume for the Mardi Gras ball, where she's seen wearing what appears to be a Tibetan headdress.<br /> <br /> Anne followed in her father's footsteps. She was an affluent heiress who donated money, land and time to causes. She donated to hospitals in the DC area, Maine, and New York. Some of the causes she supported included occupational therapy, social welfare programs and the Gallinger Hospital.<br /> <br /> Moira Archbold's 1938 wedding to a Southeast Asia explorer may have spurred Anne to build a diesel powered copy of a Chinese Junk from the 15th-century. She participated in two cruises on the vessel and collected seeds and plants for botanical studies.</p> <h4>Glover Archbold Park</h4> <p>Charles Carroll Glover donated 77-acres of land to the National Capital Parks commission in 1924. Anne Archbold added 28-acres of land to the south of this holding to the donation. This was to become the Glover-Archbold Parkway which would extend from Canal Road north to Wisconsin Avenue NW. The parkway would have included a 100-foot right-of-way and was to be named Arizona Avenue. The parkway was never constructed and the land was used by neighbors as a local urban oasis. <br /> <br /> In 1947, plans for the right-of-way were developed which would have included a four-lane divided highway. Opposition to this plan was strong and Anne Archbold was a leader in voicing her displeasure at the thought of a four-lane-parkway going through the valley: <br /> <br /> <em>“It is beautifully wooded, with a wealth of wild flowers and bird life. Quiet pathways lead down its sides along the meandering creek bed with its sycamore-tulip tangles, furnishing restful retreats for adults and fascinating children. Such a beautiful park cannot be eliminated if Washington is to grow as a living organism with its parts in proper balance.”</em><br /> <br /> The plan for the roadway was amended in the 1950s to include an eight-lane bridge over the Potomac River to connect with the four-lane highway through the Foundry Branch Valley. This spurred Anne and Charles Carroll Glover, Jr. to file an injunction against the District Commissioners to prevent the project from happening. They argued that the project was a violation of the public trust and advocated for the land to remain a park. Anne and Charles had support from Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall and legislation was put forward to transfer the right-of-way to the National Park Service. The idea for Three Sisters Bridge and the highway between Canal Road NW and Wisconsin Avenue NW was considered up until 1967, when it was abandoned and the right-of-way was finally transferred to the National Park Service. Anne said “It was my purpose that the beautiful wooded valley be preserved perpetually for the benefit and pleasure of the public. It should remain and be enjoyed by all as a natural sanctuary.” </p> <h4>Death</h4> <p>Anne died at her winter home in Nassau on March 26,1968, of a heart attack. She was 94 years old. As newspapers printed her obituary, her colorful life was splashed across the pages. She was called a non-conformist for spending her honeymoon on safari and for taking her maiden name back for herself and her children after her divorce. The Bangor Daily News published the notice of her death under the headline \"Sportswoman Dead At 94.\" The brief article mentions that Anne had held records for big game fish and her travels to Tibet. Her funeral was held at her Hillandale estate in Washington and she was eventually buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery, near her son John's Upperville estate, which he called \"Foxlease Farms.\"</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Dana rose to fame as the author of <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em>, and spent his legal career advocating for the rights of sailors and the abolition of slavery.</p> <p>Richard Henry Dana Jr. was born in Cambridge at 6 Green St., the second child of Richard Henry Dana Sr. and Ruth Charlotte (Smith) Dana. He attended schools in Cambridgeport and Westford, MA. He entered Harvard College but became embroiled in a student rebellion at the end of his second term and was suspended for six months. He returned to Harvard and at the end of his sophomore year contracted measles which apparently damaged his eyes. Richard resolved to go to sea as a sailor before the mast: \"I can hardly tell which predominated, a desire to cure my eyes, my love of adventure & the attraction of the novelty of a life before the mast, or anxiety to escape from the depressing situation of inactivity & dependence at home.\"</p> <p>Dana left Boston August 14, 1834 on the brig <em>Pilgrim</em>, sailed around Cape Horn and along the California coast, and returned two years later on September 22, 1836 on the <em>Alert</em>. Dana wrote an account of his trip in 1838 and <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em> was published in 1840. The success of his story and the subsequent publication of <em>The Seaman's Friend</em> established Dana's reputation as a writer and a supporter of the fair treatment of sailors.</p> <p>After his long absence, Dana returned to Harvard as a senior and graduated in 1837 with excellent grades and prizes. He went on to enter the Dane Law School at Harvard and studied with Judge Joseph Story and Professor Simon Greenleaf. He left the law school in 1840 and went into the law office of Charles Greely Loring. In 1854, he was a leading defense lawyer for freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>, in an unsuccessful effort to prevent Burns's return to slavery. In 1862, Dana successfully argued the case of the <em>Amy Warwick</em> before the U.S. Supreme Court, thereby ratifying the Federal blockade against southern shipping. After 1866 his legal practice was sufficiently successful so as to achieve financial security.</p> <p>In 1852, his neighbor and friend <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> observed of Dana: \"His head is full of politics. It is impossible to resist the fascinations of dealing with the great active questions of life.\" Dana was one of the founders of the Free-Soil party and a delegate from Boston to the Buffalo convention in 1848. He was also a delegate of the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1853 and helped establish the Massachusetts Republican Party in 1855. Biographer John F. Lucid describes Dana's politics as, \"being labeled a conservative within the Free-Soil party, however, outside that party he was coming more and more to be regarded as a radical.\" In 1861, President Lincoln appointed Dana U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. </p> <p>In 1868, Dana's nomination by a faction of the Republican Party to run for the seat of the incumbent Ben Butler ended in disaster. Dana received only 10 percent of the vote and the lasting enmity of Butler. Eight years later, in 1876, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish appointed Dana to the post of Ambassador to Great Britain, but Butler and others succeeded in blocking Senate confirmation.</p> <p>Dana married Sarah Watson of Wethersfield, Connecticut on August 25, 1841. They had six children, born in Boston and Cambridge, MA.</p> <p>In 1878 Dana gave his law practice to his son Richard Henry Dana III as a wedding present upon Richard's marriage to Edith Longfellow, daughter of the poet. Richard Henry Dana Jr. and Sarah Dana moved to Paris where they lived until the death of his father, Richard Henry Dana Sr., in 1879. After settling his father's estate, he and Sarah moved to Rome where they lived until his death in January of 1882.</p> <p><em>Adapted from the biographical note in the </em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/long/learn/historyculture/archives.htm#DFP\">Finding Aid to the Dana Family Papers</a><em> in the Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site collections.</em></p>",

            "bodyText": "George Mortimer Pullman was an American engineer and industrialist. He designed and manufactured the Pullman sleeping car and founded a company town, Pullman, for the workers who manufactured it. His Pullman Company also hired African-American men to staff the Pullman cars, who became known and widely respected as Pullman porters, providing elite service.<br /> <br /> Pullman developed his first railroad sleeping car, the Pullman sleeper or \"palace car\" in 1864. They were designed after the packet boats that traveled the Erie Canal of his youth. After President Lincoln was assassinated, Pullman arranged to have his body carried from Washington, D.C. to Springfield, Illinois on a sleeper car, for which he gained national attention, as hundreds of thousands of people lined the route in homage. Orders for his new car began to pour in. The sleeping cars proved successful although each cost more than five times the price of a regular railway car. They were marketed as \"luxury for the middle class.\"<br /> <br /> In 1867 Pullman introduced his first \"hotel on wheels,\" the President, a sleeper car with an attached kitchen and dining car. The food rivaled the best restaurants of the day and the service was impeccable. The company hired African-American freedmen as Pullman porters. <br /> <br /> In 1880 Pullman bought 4,000 acres, near Lake Calumet 14 miles south of Chicago, on the Illinois Central Railroad for $800,000. He hired Solon Spencer Beman to design his new plant there. Trying to solve the issue of labor unrest and poverty, he built a company town adjacent to his factory; it featured housing, shopping areas, churches, theaters, parks, hotel and library for his factory employees. The 1,300 original structures were designed by Beman. The centerpiece of the complex was the Administration Building and a man-made lake. The Hotel Florence, named for Pullman's daughter, was built nearby.<br /> <br /> Pullman believed that the country air and fine facilities, without agitators, saloons and city vice districts, would result in a happy, loyal workforce. The model planned community became a leading attraction for visitors who attended the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. <br /> <br /> In 1894, when manufacturing demand fell off, Pullman cut jobs and wages and increased working hours in his plant to lower costs and keep profits, but he did not lower rents or prices in the company town. The workers eventually launched a strike. When violence broke out, he gained the support of President Cleveland for the use of US troops. The strike and boycott shut down much of the nation's freight and passenger traffic west of Detroit.<br /> <br /> The newly created American Railway Union was led by Eugene Victor Debs, a pacifist and socialist who later founded the Socialist Party of America. Under the leadership of Debs, sympathetic railroad workers across the nation tied up rail traffic to the Pacific. Strikers and Debs gave Pullman five days to respond to the union demands but Pullman refused to negotiate.<br /> <br /> On June 26, all Pullman cars were cut from trains. When union members were fired, entire rail lines were shut down, and Chicago was besieged. One consequence was a blockade of the federal mail. Violence broke out between rioters and federal troops that were sent to protect the mail.  By the end of the July, 34 people had been killed, the strikers were dispersed, the troops were gone, and the courts had sided with the railway owners, and Debs was in jail for contempt of court.<br /> <br /> Pullman's reputation was soiled by the strike. In 1894, in an effort to conciliate organized labor after the strike, President Grover Cleveland and Congress designated Labor Day as a federal holiday. Legislation for the holiday was pushed through Congress six days after the strike ended.<br /> <br /> In 1897, George Pullman died of a heart attack at the age of 66, only three years after the strike. In his will, Pullman bequeathed $1.2 million  to establish the Pullman Free School of Manual Training for the children of employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company and the residents of the neighboring Roseland community. In 1950, the George M. Pullman Educational Foundation succeeded the Pullman Free School of Manual Training, also known as Pullman Tech, after it closed its doors in 1949.  The city of Pullman, Washington is named in his honor. <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "Florence Hawley Ellis broke new ground in archeology through use of dendrochronology, statistical analysis, chemical analysis, ethnohistory, and ethnoarcheology -- often, all together. An advocate for women and equality, Florence taught and mentored students until her retirement. She is remembered as a tough teacher, a careful and thorough researcher, and a mentor to a generation of archeologists.<br /> <br /> Florence and her father excavated sites together around their home in Arizona while she was a child. She received a Bachelors degree in 1927 with a major in English and a minor in anthropology and a Master's degree in 1928 in anthropology, both from the University of Arizona. While working on her Master's degree, Florence consulted with her father, an expert in chemical analysis, from whom she gained skill in precise descriptions of pigments for black pottery. Her Master's thesis distinguished three closely successive stages of pottery, separating three sequential types (Early, Middle and Late Gila Polychrome) and relating them to certain Mexican Indian pottery types.<br /> <br /> Florence began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1928. The following year, 1929, she attended the archeological field school at Chaco Canyon run by Edgar L. Hewett, a professor at the University of New Mexico. Hewett was controversial for his time because he allowed, even encouraged, women to attend the field school alongside men. When the University of Arizona began laying off professors due to the war, Florence took a course in statistics, pocketed her savings and went to the University of Chicago, where she earned her doctorate in 1934. For her dissertation, Florence analyzed hundreds of wood and charcoal samples from Chetro Ketl at Chaco Canyon National Monument. When she became an instructor at Chaco Canyon, Florence trained students in artifact analysis. Florence took part in 11 out of 15 seasons between 1929 and 1942.<br /> <br /> Florence's work at Chetro Ketl was seminal for archeology. In addition to her dendrochronology findings, she also identified that the many different styles of pottery in the stratified layers at Chetro Ketl could be analyzed to understand the changes to decoration patterns over time. Florence used tree ring dates to confirm her ceramic chronologies. Florence first used statistics to understand how the amounts of each pottery type differed between the midden layers. She then used bits of charcoal found within the layers to date each one. Using this method, she saw how the ancient Chacoans changed their pottery decorations and exactly when they did so. The project was one of the earliest uses of form statistics in archeology, setting a milestone for archeological analysis.<br /> <br /> Beginning in the 1930s, Hawley conducted dendrochronological research across the United States. She did the first tree-ring dating work in the east at Norris Basin in Tennessee. Beginning in 1934, she and others implemented a six-year project to establish tree sequences within the central U.S. People from all over the country send wood samples from all kinds of places, like forest stumps and historic structures, to the University of Chicago laboratory. The results were analyzed, then compiled into master charts for dating ancient sites. In 1937, Florence collected 1,000 living-tree specimens in eight different states to identify the climate signal recorded by trees across the Midwest. This work was summarized in <em>Tree-Ring Analysis and Dating in the Mississippi Drainage </em>(1941).<br /> <br /> She taught at the University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology beginning in 1934 until her retirement in 1971. She taught over 20 courses; indeed, despite teaching more than anyone else in the anthropology department, was paid less than the men. From the late 1950s through the early 1970s, Florence directed field schools through the university at ancestral pueblo sites, including at San Gabriel de Yunge, Sapawe, and Tsama.  Later in her life, she also taught field schools at Ghost Ranch and in the Gallina mountains. She continued to work and to teach students after retiring from the university. <br /> <br /> In the 1950’s, Florence worked on the Wetherill Project at Mesa Verde National Park. She brought groups of Rio Grande Pueblo Indians to Mesa Verde to examine archeological materials in the laboratory and invited their comments. She also worked with Keres-speaking peoples from Acoma, Laguna, Zia, and Santa Ana, and with the Tanoan speakers of Taos on oral tradition studies. Throughout her career, Florence advocated for using ethnography with archeology in order to remember that people made the things archeologists studied, and that their descendants still lived.  <br /> <br /> Florence was an equal rights advocate for men and women, both in economic terms and professional recognition. For her leadership as an archeologist and a woman, she was honored at the \"Daughters of the Desert\" symposium and featured in a traveling Smithsonian exhibit of the same name. She served as President of the American Society for Ethnohistory in 1969 and in 1987. The University of New Mexico awarded Florence an honorary doctorate of letters in 1988.<br /> <br /> Full image credit:<br /> Florence Hawley Ellis at Sapawe, 1959.

            "bodyText": "<h3><i>Although Pocahontas (c. 1597 – March 1617) lived only twenty years, different versions of her story became a part of an American mythology that persists centuries later. But who really was the woman we know as Pocahontas? And how did history come to misremember the true details of her life?</i></h3> <p> </p> <h4>Childhood</h4> <p>Sometime around 1597, a girl named Amonute was born the daughter of Powhatan, a paramount chief (<i>mamanitowik</i>) who had brought numerous tribes together under a powerful alliance. The identify of Pocahontas’s mother is unknown, evidence supports that her marriage to Powhatan was not a political one. And since their people followed a matrilineal pattern of inheritance, Pocahontas was not in line to inherit political power.<br /> <br /> However, she would still enjoy a greater degree of wealth and safety as Powhatan’s daughter. For example, Amonute was raised in Werowocomoco, her father’s town, which was in a secure location and guarded by forty warriors. It was there she earned the nickname “Pocahontas,” meaning “playful” or “mischief.”But childhood was not all fun and games at Werowocomoco.<br /> <br /> Pocahontas would have been expected to learn a wide variety of skills before she reached marriageable age. Women in Virginia Indian culture had many responsibilities, including farming, building and maintaining the home, preparing food, collecting water, edible plants, and firewood, as well as making essential items like clothing, pottery, baskets, utensils, and rope.<br /> <br /> But the rhythms of daily life in Tsenacomoco were about to change. In May 1607, when Pocahontas was about ten years old, the English arrived and built a settlement they called Jamestown just a day’s journey south of Werowocomoco.<br /> <br /> In December of that year, an English soldier named Captain John Smith was captured by Opechancanough, the brother of Powhatan, and brought to Werowocomoco. In his journals, John Smith describes being subjected to a series of ceremonies during his stay with the paramount chief. Famously, he describes his head being lain on two large stones and, just before his head is struck, a young girl named Pocahontas throwing herself over him to spare his life.<br /> <br /> The notion that a ten-year-old girl would have held sway over the decisions of Powhatan and his advisors is suspicious. Historians suspect that Smith either misinterpreted or embellished this event. One theory is that what Smith actually experienced was an adoption ritual. In addition to creating new heirs through marriage, symbolic adoption was a common way to expand one’s power in Powhatan’s culture. Having undergone the ritual, Smith and his countrymen would have been expected to respect Powhatan as their paramount leader. For example, in the days following the event Smith writes,<br /> <br /> “Powhatan…came unto him and told him now they were friends, and presently he should go to Jamestown, to send him two great guns, and a grindstone, for which he would give him the Country of Capahowosick, and for ever esteem him as his son Nantaquoud.”<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)<br /> <br /> Smith did not mention the adoption in his writings until 1624, preferring to tell the story of Pocahontas’s mercy instead. Perhaps he thought it made for a better story. It is also possible he thought that the latter story would be more attractive to potential supporters of the colony.  <br /> <br /> As a result of their meeting at Werowocomoco, Smith and the Jamestown colonists had a cooperative albeit tenuous relationship with Powhatan. Returning to Jamestown, Smith sent other gifts in lieu of the guns that Powhatan requested, and over the following months, Powhatan sent food and furs to the starving colonists.<br /> <br /> Pocahontas was sometimes a member of the envoys Powhatan sent. She had learned some English from Thomas Hunt, a teenage boy the colonists had dispatched to live at Werowocomoco. She was even responsible, as Smith describes, for negotiating the release of political prisoners.<br /> <br /> While it is clear that Smith developed a respect and admiration for Pocahontas during her visits, the nature of their relationship was not romantic, as she was still a child when Smith permanently departed Virginia in 1609. At some point during this time, John Smith continued her English language instruction. He recorded perhaps the only full sentences that remain from her language:<br /> <br /> <i>\"Kekaten pokahontas patiaquagh ningh tanks manotyens neer mowchick rawrenock audowgh </i>(Bid Pokahontas bring hither two little Baskets, and I will give her white beads to make her a chaine.)<br /> <i>Mowchick woyawgh tawgh noerach kaquere mecher </i>(I am verie hungrie, what shall I eate?)<br /> <i>Casa cunnakack, peya quagh acquintan uttasantasaough? </i>(In how many daies will there come hither any more English ships?)\"<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)</p> <h4>Young Adulthood</h4> <p><br /> By the time Pocahontas was 13 years old, she was married to a young man named Kocoum. Not being in line for a political position, she would have been free to choose her husband. The couple lived together for about three years, but Kocoum’s fate is unknown. It is also unknown whether the couple had a child together. Whatever the case, a plot was underway that would irreversibly change the course of Pocahontas’s life.<br /> <br /> In the years since her childhood trips to Jamestown, relations between the colonists and Pocahontas’s people had deteriorated. Several factors, including a drought, led Powhatan to stop trading with the English. In return the English began to lead violent raids on surrounding towns. Powhatan’s goal became clear: he wanted the English gone from his country.<br /> <br /> As part of this warfare, prisoners were frequently captured and exchanged between the Indians and colonists. Samuel Argall, a recent arrival to the Jamestown colony, devised a plan to kidnap Pocahontas and bring her to Jamestown in hopes that she would become a powerful bargaining chip in negotiations with her father.<br /> <br /> His plan was successful, and in 1613 Pocahontas was separated from her family and taken to Jamestown. And as negotiations and hostilities showed no sign of resolving, Pocahontas remained a hostage as the months went by. We cannot know what toll this had on Pocahontas, as her thoughts were never recorded. Scholar of Pocahontas Dr. Camilla Townsend suggests,<br /> <br /> “The women in Pocahontas’s world grew up knowing they might be kidnapped by enemy war parties, forced to change their allegiance and their identity. It had almost certainly happened to girls known to her; some of the women living in Werowocomoco had not originally come by choice. The event was always…traumatic, but the women also understood that they would be treated kindly…that they might hope to become wives rather than slaves. But these English men, Pocahontas knew, were different. They had different agendas.”<br /> (<i>Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma, Camilla Townsend (2004)</i><br /> <br /> While a prisoner, Pocahontas was sent to the nearby settlement of Henrico. There, she would be instructed in Christianity and English by a young Reverend Alexander Whitaker and be cared for by his servants. Whitaker’s mission in coming to the Virginia colony was to convert the Indians, and Pocahontas would be his first test. On Sundays, when Whitaker spent the day in town to preach, Pocahontas would have interacted with the wider community, including a man named John Rolfe.<br /> <br /> Rolfe had recently come from England as an aspiring merchant. He was accompanied by his pregnant wife, though both she and their newborn child would not survive the journey. A widower in a new world, Rolfe seems to have quickly fallen in love with Pocahontas. Though 12 years his junior, she too had been separated from her spouse by unfortunate circumstances. Even if Kocoum was still alive at that time, the church would not have recognized a “pagan” marriage, leaving Rolfe free to pursue Pocahontas.<br /> <br /> A year passed and the question of Pocahontas’s ransom wore on. Sir Thomas Dale, acting governor of the colony, led a fleet of ships to see Powhatan at Werowocomoco, bringing Pocahontas and Rolfe along. When they arrived, Powhatan was not at home, and they sailed on to the town of Matchcot. There, Pocahontas spoke with two of her brothers, probably telling them of Rolfe’s interest in marrying her.<br /> <br /> The brothers stayed onboard as “collateral” while Rolfe went to speak with Opechancanough, Powhatan’s brother. Simultaneously, Dale was given a letter written by Rolfe asking his permission to marry Pocahontas. Both Opechancanough and Dale agreed to the arrangement. Opechancanough also promised to return all English weapons within fifteen days, which appeased Dale. Hostilities, for a short while, would cease.<br /> <br /> Why would Pocahontas agree to such an arrangement? Perhaps she did care for Rolfe. She may have seen him as a worthy option, a well-liked gentleman who was willing to make sacrifices in order to be with her. There are several other explanations, too. Having been a hostage for over a year, she may have seen marriage as an improvement on her situation. Additionally, it was a standard as well as respected practice to marry among the enemy as a way of resolving conflicts. We cannot ever know for certain how Pocahontas and her husband felt, though it is clear that the fairytale love story that emerged in American culture years later was not the full picture.<br /> <br /> Thus, in April 1614, Pocahontas was baptized “Rebecca” and married to John Rolfe. They moved to a house with land enough to grow food and, famously, tobacco. The strain of tobacco that Rolfe developed would go on to make the colony profitable and permanent. It is possible that Pocahontas shared with him her people’s techniques for processing tobacco. They had servants to help them with their housework, and some of them were likely Indian. In 1615, the couple had a son, who they named Thomas. For two years, Pocahontas lived a domestic life.<br /> <br /> But in 1616, she and Rolfe were asked to cross the sea. In April, they sailed to London with their son Thomas, Thomas Dale, and a group of native servants and nobles. These included some of Pocahontas’s servants and relatives, including Powhatan’s advisor and son-in-law Uttamatomakin. Powhatan, through Pocahontas’s marriage, was able to send a delegation to England in order to gather more information about his enemy.<br /> <br /> Lady Rebecca, as she was known in England, was taken on a tour of London society. She attended, for example, a “masque,” an elaborate play, hosted by King James. The Virginia Company of London, who funded her stay, hoped that the “Indian princess” would distract the public and its investors from its troubled finances.<br /> <br /> For all the good press Pocahontas generated for the Virginia colony, an impression too was made on herself and the other Indians in her party. Uttamatomakin was able to report back to Powhatan what he experienced.<br /> <br /> Pocahontas also sat for a portrait while she was in London. Engraved by the Dutch-German artist Simon Van De Passe, there are some interesting details in the portrait which may have been requested by Pocahontas herself. For example, the name used in the byline is Matoaka, her private family name, instead of her more recognizable but also childish nickname Pocahontas.<br /> <br /> Another place where Pocahontas’s voice may be heard is in an account by John Smith of the last time he saw Pocahontas, one autumn day at in Brentford:<br /> <br /> “You did promise Powhatan what was yours should bee his, and he the like to you; you called him father being in his land a stranger, and by the same reason so much I doe you…Were you not afraid to come into my fathers Countrie, and caused feare in him and all his people (but mee) and feare you here I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and you shall call mee childe, and so I will bee for ever and ever your Countrieman. They did tell us alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other till I came to Plimoth; yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seeke you, and know the truth, because your Countriemen will lie much.”<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)<br /> <br /> Then, in March, Pocahontas and her family made to depart for home. Just before their departure, Rolfe was given a sum of money to go towards the conversion of the Virginia Indians to Christianity. As they ventured down the Thames towards the ocean, something wasn’t right. Many of the Indians in the party were ill, and soon Pocahontas and her son Thomas fell too ill to continue. Pocahontas would die and be buried there, in the town of Gravesend, at the age of 20.</p> <h4>Legacy</h4> <p><br /> Thomas survived his illness, and while John Rolfe initially tried to care for his son himself, he decided to send Thomas to live with his brother Henry in England instead of bringing him back to Virginia. Rolfe would remarry, dying of an illness himself at the age of 37. Thomas Rolfe would not return to Virginia until he was in his 20s. Amid conflicts, Thomas was forced to choose sides in a war between his mother’s and his father’s people. Not surprisingly, he sided with those that had raised him. He and his family became elite members of the colony.<br /> <br /> Despite only living to the age of twenty, Pocahontas’s life was the stuff of legends. Indeed, Pocahontas’s story has become legendary. Now that you’ve read what we know about Pocahontas’s life, what do you think about the stories you grew up hearing about her? Why do you think those stories were told? What do you think Pocahontas herself would have wanted people in the future to learn from her story?</p> <p><i></i></p>",

He was a seventh generation descendent of one of the founders of Hartford, James Olmsted, who had emigrated from Essex, England in 1632.<br /> <br /> John married Charlotte Law Hull in 1821 and Frederick Law would be their first son (his brother John Hull would be born 3 years later). John had little formal education, but he was gifted with a mind for business. He came to co-own a very successful fabric store called Olmsted & King that specialized in importing silks from France and wool from Germany. John was proud of his city, and contributed funds to local institutions such as Hartford’s first art museum as well as a local asylum. He was also proud of his sons. He and “Fred” would have a very close and significant relationship throughout their lives. He was reported to have been stern, but with a soft heart - especially towards his two sons. He regularly took them for walking adventures in the Connecticut countryside, instilling in young Frederick a love and appreciation of nature. During one long walk where his father was carrying him home and Frederick was speaking about the things he saw and pointed up at a star in the sky. His father hugged him closely and remarked on the “infinite love” that he felt for his son. This memory stayed with Frederick throughout his life. John would go on to support Frederick in his endeavors as he strove to find his way in the world. This included buying him a farm in Connecticut and later a second one on Staten Island. He also funded trips to Europe so that Frederick could learn more about farming. It was on one such trip to England that Frederick became inspired by English parks, particularly Birkenhead Park in Liverpool, which was a public park, a “people’s garden” as Olmsted told his father.<br /> <br /> In 1873, John fell on ice and broke his hip and Frederick rushed to Hartford from New York to be at his side. John Olmsted died on January 25, 1873 at the age of 81. Although he seldom outwardly praised his son, after his passing Frederick found dozens of newspaper articles his father had saved following Olmsted’s career over the years. Frederick wrote, “He was a very good man and a kinder father never lived. It is strange how much of the world I feel has gone from me with him. The value of any success in the future is gone for me.”",

Augusta Homer Saint-Gaudens went on to cross the world with independence and root the artwork of an innovative sculptor in the American consciousness.</h4> <br /> Augusta Homer traveled to Rome in 1872 to complete her education and took private painting lessons. She progressed from an amateur copyist of Old Masters to an assured artist who captured the likenesses of friends and of the Italian peasants who worked as models. A smaller number of works are landscapes painted with a looser, softer stroke mostly of the places she visited. She was stylistically conservative, seemingly not interested in pushing her artistic expression beyond conventional taste.<br /> <br /> In 1873, she met the artist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/augustus-saint-gaudens.htm\">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> who would play an inescapable part of her life and shift the course of what had been expected for her. Augustus Saint-Gaudens belonged to the artisan class, but his cosmopolitan character—with an Irish birth and a French last name—made their courtship seem acceptable. He proposed to Augusta Homer two months after meeting and they were finally married in 1877. From the start, Augusta Saint-Gaudens was an active partner in her husband’s growing career. She advised him on business and helped usher him into the upper-class social circles that would provide commissions for his art.<br /> <br /> The couple lived demanding lives in the years following the birth of their son, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/homer-schiff-saint-gaudens.htm\">Homer Schiff Saint-Gaudens</a>, in 1880. Her own artistic aspirations were subsumed by marriage, motherhood, and supporting her husband’s ambitions as his career exploded. In the early 1890s, the routine of work and family took a dramatic turn when she learned of her husband’s intimate relationship with one of his models, Davida Johnson Clark.<br /> <br /> For most of her life, Augusta Saint-Gaudens experienced hearing loss that worsened over time. She traveled at first to find a cure to the constant ringing of Tinnitus. Unsuccessful, she continued to embark on new tours. Now, she increasingly left the comfort of Europe and the East Coast to explore the wider world from the frozen edge of the Arctic Circle to the searing sands of the Sahara. The married couple still maintained their New York townhouse, and would meet there and in Cornish, New Hampshire, where they spent summers from 1885 to 1897 among fellow artists. At a time when unaccompanied women could rarely venture far, she pushed against the strict social conventions of her upbringing.<br /> <br /> When her husband was diagnosed with cancer in 1900, Augusta Saint-Gaudens assumed the role of caregiver. As his life ebbed away, she shielded him from pain and difficulty as much she could. The two lived together in New Hampshire until his eventual death in 1907.<br /> <br /> Even after a tumultuous marriage, Augusta Homer Saint-Gaudens’ devotion to shaping and preserving her husband’s legacy contributed largely to our knowledge of his art today. She assured the completion of unfinished works, found new employment for the studio assistants, and settled into a successful business producing bronze reductions of her late husband’s principal sculptures. She eventually conceived the idea of creating a living memorial to him and helped establish the Saint-Gaudens Memorial in 1919. <br /> <br /> Augusta Saint-Gaudens continued summering in New Hampshire and spent winters at her substantial home in Coconut Grove, Florida. Upon her death in 1926, the Saint-Gaudens Memorial retained her New Hampshire estate and began exhibiting the artwork of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/augustus-saint-gaudens.htm\">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>. In 1965, this private foundation transferred ownership of the property and collection to the National Park Service. Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park continues to preserve the property, display the artwork, and interpret the life of Augusta Saint-Gaudens.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

            "bodyText": "<b>Clara Barton's Lifetime of Service</b><br /> <br /> Clarissa \"Clara\" Harlowe Barton was born in North Oxford, Massachusetts in 1821, the youngest of Stephen and Sarah Barton's five children. When Clara Barton was 11 years old, her older brother David fell from a rafter in a barn he was helping to build. She spent the next two years caring for him by administering all of his medicines, which included the application of leeches.<br /> <br /> In 1854, she moved to Washington, D.C. where she became one of only a few female clerks at the US Patent Office and the only woman in her office receiving a salary equal to the male clerks. On April 19, 1861 a trainload of Massachusetts men responding to President Lincoln's call for Union soldiers were attacked in a Baltimore, Maryland riot. After arriving in Washington, D.C. they were sent to a makeshift hospital housed in the US Senate chamber. Clara Barton brought them food and supplies and tended to their needs. Following the First Battle of Manassas, she cared for the wounded as they returned to Washington, D.C. In 1862, after constant badgering of political and military chiefs, she was finally granted passes to the front.<br /> <br /> Following the Battle of Cedar Mountain, she appeared at a field hospital around midnight with a wagon-load of supplies. The beleaguered field surgeon later likened her to an angel, which led to her nickname, \"the angel of the battlefield.\" Clara Barton continued to aid wounded on the front lines, including at the Battle of Antietam. Arriving at the northern edge of the infamous \"Cornfield\" at about noon, she watched as harried surgeons dressed the soldiers' wounds with corn husks. They were forced to use anything they could find because the supply trains were so far behind the fast-moving troops on the field at Antietam. Upon her arrival, Barton quickly handed over to grateful surgeons a wagon load of bandages and other medical supplies that she had personally collected over the past year.<br /> <br /> After passing on her supplies to the surgeons Miss Barton got down to work. As bullets whizzed overhead and artillery boomed in the distance, Miss Barton cradled the heads of suffering soldiers, prepared food for them in a local farm house, and brought water to the wounded men. As she knelt down to give one man a drink, she felt her sleeve quiver. She looked down, noticed a bullet hole in her sleeve, and then discovered that the bullet had killed the man she had been helping.<br /> <br /> Undaunted, the unlikely figure in her bonnet, red bow, and dark skirt moved on--and on, and on. Working non-stop until dark, Barton comforted the men and assisted the surgeons with their work. When night fell, the surgeons were stymied again--this time by lack of light. She then produced some lanterns from her wagon of supplies, and the thankful doctors went back to work.<br /> <br /> Barton's timely arrival at the battlefield had not been easy. Only the day before, her wagon had been mired near the back of the army's massive supply line. Prodded by Barton, her teamsters drove the mules all night to get closer to the front of the line.<br /> <br /> Within a few days after the battle, the Confederates had retreated and wagons of extra medical supplies were rolling into Sharpsburg, MD. Barton collapsed from lack of sleep and a budding case of typhoid fever. She returned to Washington lying in a wagon, exhausted and delirious. She soon regained her strength and returned to the battlefields of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> In 1863, Barton traveled to the Union-controlled Sea Islands south of Charleston, South Carolina. On July 14, 1863 she moved from Hilton Head Island to Morris Island to tend the growing number of sick and wounded soldiers - a list that greatly increased after the failed Union assault on Battery Wagner on July 18, 1863. <br /> <br /> Later in the Morris Island campaign, Barton passed out fresh food and mail to the men in the trenches. Because of her exposure to the terrible, unsanitary conditions endured by the soldiers, she herself became gravely ill and was evacuated to Hilton Head. She later wrote of the largely forgotten campaign:<br /> <br /> <em>“We have captured one fort - Gregg - and one charnel house - Wagner - and we have built one cemetery, Morris Island. The thousand little sand-hills that in the pale moonlight are a thousand headstones, and the restless ocean waves that roll and breakup on the whitened beach sing an eternal requiem to the toll-worn gallant dead who sleep beside.”</em><br /> <br /> In 1864, she was appointed by Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler as the \"lady in charge\" of the hospitals of the Army of the James. After the war ended, Barton continued her work as a humanitarian. She established The Office of Correspondence with Friends of the Missing Men of the United States Army and directed a four-year search for missing soldiers. She also accompanied an army expedition that identified and marked the graves of nearly 13,000 Union prisoners of war and established the Andersonville National Cemetery in Georgia.<br /> <br /> Clara Barton is probably best known for her founding of the American Red Cross, for which she was also the first president. She led the organization for twenty-three years. It was her idea to incorporate natural disaster relief into the core mission of the American Red Cross. This idea was adopted by the International Red Cross and her influence changed the course of world-wide relief that carries forward to this day. So it may well be said that the success of the American Red Cross is largely due to the hands on battlefield experience of Clara Barton during the Civil War. She is truly the Angel of the Battlefield and a great American hero. <p> </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>William Beard was born enslaved in Leaksville, Mississippi on January 14,1854. He was one of three children, two boys and a girl, who were born to Joe Beard and Sarah (McKinnis) Beard. In the 1870 US Census, he and his siblings were living with their grandmother Hannah in Jackson County, Mississippi. Shortly after that time he married Ann Moffett and lived in Wilmer, Mobile, Alabama. In 1880 US Census, his occupation was listed as working in the Timber Industry and had four children (Joseph, William, E. John and Ellen). William and Ann had seven children before her death in 1885.  <br /> <br /> William submitted Homestead Application # 714 on November 21,1877. He built a house and fenced and cultivated about six acres of land. In addition, he also built a stable, corn crib, and other out houses. He eventually farmed a large amount of the land and was able to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables. He also raised animals and had a smoke house for storing meat. The Beard family was never hungry and was able to share food with other families when they were in need. Although William Beard could read and write, he used an X on his land entry document as his signature. <br /> <br /> William Beard had the following witnesses to testify to support his final homestead claim - Jackson Moffett – the brother of his wife Ann, and Wesley Taylor, a neighbor.  William Beard's brother-in-law Jackson testified on the homestead land application that Beard settled in Wilmer/Moffettville, Alabama on September 4,1871. The final Homestead Application was submitted on November 21,1877 for 159.98 acres of land. Beard received his Homestead Land Patent # 364 on December 30,1879.<br /> <br /> In addition to farming the land, William was a logger by trade. His last living daughter, Eleanor, provided an account of some of his life during that time. She said that her daddy was a Straw Boss in the logging business which meant that he had to supervise the workers, plus count and document logs that were shipped to other merchants. He also harvested logs and took them up and down the river. Beard had a logging team in Alabama and in Mississippi. Because he was unable to personally supervise this team in Mississippi, Beard lost a large sum of money and had to close the business there. However, the business in Alabama was profitable and employed family members and others in the community.<br /> <br /> William was a Christian by faith. His in-laws (Cyrus John Moffett and Rachel Banks Moffett) founded the Moffettville Baptist Church on Wilson Road on December, 1868 and later organized in August, 1876. He served as Chairman of the Deacon Board and was actively involved in his community offering counseling and support to people to uphold the moral standards of Christ in the Wilmer/ Moffettville community. <br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Moffettville Baptist Church Founders\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7168141|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Moffettville-Baptist-Church-Founders.jpg\" title=\"Moffettville Baptist Church Founders\" /><br /> Moffettville Baptist Church Founders<br /> photo credit: Marcia Green Lamar<br /> <br /> Upon the death of his wife Ann, William continued to raise his children on the farm. He later married her sister Sabrie Ella in April, 1889. He felt that by marrying Ann ‘s sister she would better take care of the children. From this union, they had ten additional children. Sabrie Ella died in 1905. William then married Ada Bales Robinson. Ada died in 1918. William married once more to Cynthia Ann Adams. Cynthia, a widow, had two sons prior to her marriage to William and later had a daughter. This daughter lived until 2013 and was able to share family information.      <br /> <br /> As of today there are few family members who still own or live on parts of this land. The home that William built is no longer standing. After the death of his last wife, the home was vacant and later destroyed by a hurricane.<br /> <img alt=\"Moffettville Cemetery William Beard stone born 1/14/1854 died 5/31/1939\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7168159|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Moffettville-Cemetary.jpg\" title=\"William Beard's Moffettville Cemetery grave stone.\" /><br /> William Beard gravestone at Moffettville Cemetery<br /> photo credit: Marcia Green Lamar<br /> <br /> <b>Contributor: Marcia Green Lamar, descendant</b><br /> <img alt=\"Marcia Green Lamar\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7168127|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Marcia-Green-Lamar.jpeg\" style=\"width:200px;\" title=\"Marcia Green Lamar\" /><br /> Marcia Green Lamar<br /> photo credit: Marcia Green Lamar<br /> <br /> Marcia is a wife, mother of four and a grandmother of seven.

And Wesley Taylor, a neighbor and witness for William Beard's claim, became my great grandmother Deland Ramsey's second husband. I remember going to Wilmer/Moffettville to visit relatives. We would ride horses, pick fruit off the trees and vines, eat great food, attend church and home comings. I would see lots of family members and clean the cemetery with my mother and grandmother. Now,  my husband and I try to keep the tradition alive by going to the cemetery to make sure that all of the graves are cleaned.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=AL1400__.254&docClass=STA&sid=rfmtwnqy.0vm\">Patent Details - BLM GLO Records</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "Susan Juliet Gay Beatrice Klingle was born in the house now known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/rock-creek-park-headquarters-klingle-mansion.htm\">Peirce-Klingle Mansion</a> on July 18, 1867. Her parents were <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joshua-peirce-klingle.htm\">Joshua Peirce Klingle</a> and Laura Tiernan. The baby was known throughout her life as Beatrice. The other names given to the baby honored the women in the lives of her parents: Susan was Joshua Klingle's aunt and adoptive mother's name while Juliet was the name of his birth mother. Gay was the name of Laura Tiernan's mother. <br /> <br /> Beatrice Klingle lived a privileged life on what was then known as the Linnaean Hill estate started by Joshua Peirce. Few details about her childhood are known. Newspapers described her as \"a popular belle in select society\" in the city of Washington when she was a teenager. Unfortunately, her mother died in 1885 when Beatrice was 18-years-old. <h4>Scandal!</h4> Beatrice caused quite a scandal in Washington in September of 1885.<br /> <br /> On the 15th of September, her father received a note from Beatrice. It was given to him by a servant who had driven her into town. The note was supposed to have said:<br /> <br /> <em>\"Dearest Papa: You won't think it strange and you won't be angry with me. I told you I loved him. I couldn't help it. Now I am off to Baltimore with him to be married, but we shall return to the city to-night, and shall stay at the Hamilton House: now you won't be angry with me, papa, for loving my darling, will you?\"</em><br /> <br /> Klingle assumed that the man his daughter referred to was Edward Irving Darling, a composer who had been socializing in Washington with his mother at the time he and Beatrice met. Edward's mother, Sophronia \"Flora\" Adams Darling, was well connected through her family ties, literary pursuits and legal battles.<br /> <br /> In newspaper accounts, it was believed that Edward Darling was almost a full decade older than Beatrice. In reality, there was only a four year age difference between the two. He visited the Klingle home but Klingle thought that Darling was paying too much attention to Beatrice. Klingle warned his daughter's suitor off and told him that \"anything further than a friendship for his daughter was not desired.\" Though Darling later left his original lodgings at Hamilton House, he remained in Washington and Klingle felt that Darling and Beatrice were still meeting each other in spite of his warning, but could never prove it.<br /> <br /> Beatrice went into the city by carriage on September 15th, and went into a store before having the servant drop her off in town. She claimed she was staying late in town to go to the theater and had the servant deliver the note to her father. Klingle was not fully convinced that his daughter had left Washington right away, as her note suggested, and he spent a tense evening searching for her in the city.<br /> <br /> Newspapers from September 19, 1885 indicate that Edward and Beatrice did in fact go to Baltimore and were married there in the evening of September 15th. Newspapers in Baltimore and Washington ran the following story about the event:<br /> <br /> <em>\"After the marriage, at 8:30 o'clock on Tuesday evening, at the Rev. Mr. Wroth's residence, No. 82 St. Paul street, the young couple went to Barnum's hotel. The father, who did not think his daughter was serious when she wrote in a note to him that she was going to Baltimore to get married, found them at Barnum's on Wednesday after they were married sure enough. They all returned to Washington the same day. The Rev. Mr. Wroth says he was very favorably impressed with both the young lady and the young man. They were very self-possessed, especially the young lady, and as they had a license and were both of age, and wanted to be married, he could not refuse. The license bore date some time previously, showing that the affair had been carefully planned. Mr. Wroth says the young man turned to the witnesses after the ceremony and thanked them, an act of courtesy he never before saw exhibited under such circumstances. The witnesses were persons who had been called in by Mr. Wroth, and were, of course, strangers to the bride and groom.\" -Baltimore Sun, September 19, 1885.</em> <h4>Life after elopement and tragedy</h4> Beatrice and Edward first settled in New York after their marriage. They lived there for a time and had two children while living in the city, their eldest daughter Nancy Adams Peirce Klingle Darling in 1887 and their son Charles Tiernan Darling in 1889. The family moved to Detroit some time before 1890. The couple had one more child, Harvey Adams Darling who was born and died in 1890. Beatrice took care of the children and managed the home while Edward composed several \"light operas\" and worked with others on compositions. He submitted articles to political and historical journals and was well connected through his own network and that of his mother.<br /> <br /> Edward took up a job as manager for the Grinnel Brothers Music House in Detroit in the 1890s. During a severe storm, Edward was thrown from a second story window of the Grinnel Brothers building. He was apparently trying to prevent a sign from falling through a large plate glass window when he fell. He broke 27 bones and required extensive medical care, but survived the fall. He was not the same after the accident.<br /> <br /> On July 4, 1892, Beatrice received word that her father had died suddenly in Washington, DC. By that point, most of the land that had been Beatrice's childhood home had been aquired by the federal government and made into Rock Creek Park. Klingle was still a leading citizen and had amassed a great amount of wealth. As the only child, Beatrice inherited a large portion of the estate (the rest went to her step mother, Klingle's second wife). The estimated value of her inheritance at the time was rumored to be close to $1,000,000 in real estate and government bonds. Edward and Beatrice traveled to Washington for the funeral and to deal with the inheritance. Though somewhat recovered from his injuries, Edward took violently ill while staying in Washington, supposedly due to drinking bad milk.  <h4>A second scandal</h4> Beatrice's name was in all of the papers in 1895. By that point, Edward had been suffering from the lingering effects of his fall and an additional illness for several years. He died on February 13, 1894. <br /> <br /> Edward's mother almost immediately accused Beatrice of poisoning him, and claimed that he had made a deathbed declaration stating as much. Beatrice was supposed to have had an accomplice in murdering her husband---the doctor who had been treating him since his fall from the Grinnel Brothers building. Flora Darling brought her suspicions to the District Attorney Frazier of Detroit. Frazier heard the case but ultimately had to dismiss it. However, stating \"the suspicion, while perhaps well founded, was not strong enough to warrant the arrest of the doctor and her daughter-in-law.\" Frazier is also said \"to have announced at the time that should the wife ever marry the doctor the motive would become plain.\"<br /> <br /> Beatrice and Dr. Francis X. Spranger were married publicly at the Corpus Christi cathedral in Baltimore, Maryland on March 6, 1895. They left shortly after for California to honeymoon. <h4>Damning testimony </h4> Newspapers all over the country took up the story of the Washington heiress who poisoned her first husband and married the doctor who helped her commit the crime. Flora Adams used her connections and several attorneys were involved in investigating Edward's death. Documents and attestations were put into the court record, including a dying declaration from Edward that stated in part that \"the variety and quantity of drugs he (Dr. Spranger) poured into me was sufficient to justify classing me as an annex to his laboratory. He gave no prescriptions, only medicine.\"<br /> <br /> Edward's detailed account of the treatment he received from his wife and Doctor Spranger accused Beatrice of becoming openly hostile and abusive towards Edward after his injury. He claimed that the reports of any reliance on drugs and alcohol on his part were spread by Beatrice and Dr. Spranger to paint him in a poor light. The testimony provided a timeline that supposedly reported on the instances of poisoning and showed evidence that whenever Edward attempted to travel away from Beatrice and Dr. Spranger, his health improved. The declaration also claimed that when he left for New York on a brief trip in 1893, \"She, with the children, was to go to Washington. She did not go. As soon as I left, December 8, she filed a bill for absolute divorce for drunkenness, non-support, cruelty and assertion, which she expected to obtain with alimony through default.\" <br /> <br /> Dr. and Mrs. Spranger vehemently denied the accusations made against them. When the newspapers first picked up the poisoning story a reporter visited them where they were staying in California. Beatrice is reported to have stated \"this charge is simply monstrous, utterly ridiculous, too, when taken into the slightest consideration.\" They claimed that Mrs. Darling was insane and that many of the claims were untrue.<br />  As evidence of Flora's mental instabilities and cruelties, they reported that Flora had taken Beatrice and Edward's young daughter, Nancy, and put her in a convent, which traumatized the child. They also used Flora's constant altercations with organizations she was involved in. She was a founding member of organizations like the Daughters of the American Revolution and Daughters of the War of 1812 but was often removed from those boards or left them due to butting heads with others.<br /> <br /> Evidence was collected, testimonies gathered and the news was picked up by newspapers from coast to coast. Flora Adams Darling made sure that the story of the death of her son stayed in the papers and that Beatrice had no rest from suspicion while trying assert her innocence from California.<br /> <br /> Beatrice was never brought up on charges for the possible poisoning of her first husband. She died in Los Gatos, California on June 20, 1895, supposedly of diabetes and the stress of the charges brought against her. She was interred in the vault of friends she and her second husband had made on their honeymoon. Over the months following her death, her will was filed in Washington, DC and it was shown that her estate was not in fact worth $1,000,000. Trusts were set up for Charles and Nancy and Dr. Spranger was one of the men listed by Beatrice for guardianship. Though some newspapers stated her remains would be taken to Detroit, that was not the case and in September of 1897 Beatrice's name appears once again in newspapers. Apparently her remains stayed in a rented alcove in the Gribner family vault. Thieves broke into the crypt and attempted to break into Mrs. Spranger's casket. It was believed the robbers were attempting to relieve her of any valuables that may have been buried with the deceased heiress. Grave markers exist for her in Los Gatos, California as well as in the Peirce family vault in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, DC.<br />  ",

Europe was married twice; his first wife was Violy (Vicie) Allen.<br /> <br /> According to the 1870 and 1880 United States Federal Census, Europe and Vicie were the parents of Sallie, Ellen, Susan, and Howell Bates. After the passing of Vicie in 1893, Europe married Eliza Jackson Bates in 1894. According the 1900 United States Federal Census, Europe and Eliza were still living in Beat 5, Amite, Mississippi, with Eliza’s children and two of Europe’s grandchildren. He owned his home and farm. He died in 1910 in Amite County, Mississippi and is buried in the Bates Cemetery there.<br /> <br /> Europe Bates submitted application #3582 at the Land Office in Jackson, Mississippi on November 19, 1869 for 165.64 acres of land. This entry was submitted under the provision of the Act of Congress approved in 1866 for “Homestead Settlements in the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Florida”. He signed his (x) solemnly swearing that he was the head of his family, over the age of twenty-one and, a citizen of the United States.<br /> <br /> Abraham Taylor and Adam Harness were witnesses to Bates' homestead claim, and attested that they had known Europe Bates for fifteen years (Adam Harness and his brother Esau were also homesteaders in the area).

            "bodyText": "Joshua Peirce was the youngest child of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/isaac-peirce.htm\">Isaac Pierce</a> and Elizabeth Cloud Peirce. He grew up in what is now Rock Creek Park in the new District of Columbia.<br /> <br /> Joshua experienced loss at a young age when his eldest brother, Job, died in 1804. Job's widow and daughter came to live with the rest of the Peirce family in the Rock Creek Valley. His older sisters and brother <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abner-peirce.htm\">Abner </a>also lived at home at the time. <br /> <br /> Joshua took a keen interest in horticulture and in 1823, he left his father's home to build his own estate. His father gifted him a significant tract of land adjacent to the family homestead and Joshua began his business there.<br /> <br /> There is some question as to whether Joshua had the stone mansion built or if he added to an existing structure. The house sat atop a hill and overlooked the Rock Creek Valley and the distant city of Washington. He called his estate Linnaean Hill, after the Swedish scientist, Carl Linnaeus, who formalized binomial nomenclature and was a noted botanist.<br /> <br /> Joshua married Susan Coates of Pennsylvania sometime between 1823 and 1830. By the time the 1830 census was taken, her nephew, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joshua-peirce-klingle.htm\">Joshua P. Klingle</a> was living with them.  <h4> </h4> <h4>A man of science and standing</h4> Joshua Peirce's name appears in newspapers all over the country in the 19th century. He was interested in the natural world and established himself as a skilled botanist. He sold trees, shrubberies and plants locally from a nursery yard on 14th Street NW, and from the grounds of his estate in what is now Rock Creek Park. He showcased new plants and flowers with friends who also enjoyed botany and he was well respected in that sphere.<br /> <br /> Peirce was paid by the DC government to manage trees along avenues in the city and was responsible for beautifying many of the early streets. Many of his plants were also installed in the garden of the White House. <br /> <br /> Peirce experimented with silk worms in the summer of 1827 and was involved with trying to introduce them to the area. He held an exhibition of them at Linnaean Hill and invited anyone seriously interested in silk spinning to come and view them. Notice of the efforts reached newspapers as far north as Vermont.<br /> <br /> Peirce also took part in scientific observations. An account from a St. Louis, Missouri paper dated April 1835, discusses the cold temperatures across the country.<br /> <br /> \"<em>Mr. Joshua Pierce, at Linnaean Hill, four miles north west of Washington, communicates the following interesting fact. At an hour before sunrise, on the 8th January, he placed his thermometer in an exposed situation on the summit of the hill, where his house stands. At thirty minutes before sunrise, it had fallen to four degrees below zero; he then removed it to the valley, and at twenty minutes before sunrise it fell to eighteen degrees below zero; he then returned it to the summit of the hill, and found it as before, four degrees below zero, exhibiting the astonishing difference of fourteen degrees between to locations not more than four hundred yards distant. The height of the hill is from ninety to one hundred feet.\" </em>Niles National Register, St. Louis, MO April 11, 1835<br /> <br /> Peirce was well respected. In October of 1840, he was part of a grand jury and by the end of the 1840s he was being repeatedly appointed as a member of the Levy Court.  <h4>Peirce as an enslaver</h4> Though Joshua Peirce's father had been a Quaker, a faith which did not believe in slavery, Joshua had spent his entire life in the District of Columbia, which permitted it. Both Isaac and his son Joshua enslaved people to run their large plantations and farming operations.<br /> <br /> The 1830 census shows three white people living on the Linnaean Hill estate in addition to six enslaved persons and two free colored persons. <br /> <br /> In 1840, census records show the Peirce enslaved thirteen people and had one free colored person living on the estate.<br /> <br /> Both the 1850 and 1860 Slave Schedules for Washington, DC list ten enslaved persons under Joshua Peirce's name.<br /> <br /> The April 1862 Emancipation records finally list the names of the enslaved persons. Joshua is compensated for eleven enslaved persons--including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-h-beckett.htm\">William Beckett</a>, who he listed as being an invaluable part of his business.  <h4> </h4> <h4>Later years</h4> Joshua Peirce continued to employ William Beckett on his estate and relied on him to run part of his nursery business. Acquaintances who knew him stated that he did not want his nephew (and heir) Joshua Peirce Klingle bothering William Beckett in the running of the business and that William's salary was to be several hundred dollars a year.<br /> <br /> The nursery on 14th street proved to be too much for Peirce and he sold it in 1868.<br /> <br /> Joshua Peirce died in 1869. His will had several codicils and comprises nearly 40 hand-written pages. He made sure that his living sisters and their relatives received money as well as his nephews who were running the Peirce estate next door. Many of the codicils to his will involve the people listed on the 1862 Emancipation Records. He set aside a house, land and an annuity to the two oldest people that appeared on the record, Jeremiah Gibson and Nancy Carroll. To the other Carroll, Rhoades and Beckett family members he left large sums of money that were to be paid to them at the time they reached adulthood. <br /> <br /> To his nephew, Joshua Klingle, he left the house, the land and the bulk of the estate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<div>Homestead #6214 - Application Number 14748 – March 17, 1892<br /> <br /> America Hunt, a mulatto woman, was born into slavery in Kentucky in approximately 1820. By 1840, she belonged to Henry Hunt and lived on his plantation near Liberty, Amite County, Mississippi. America had children by her slave owner, Henry Hunt (proven through DNA). Two were Margaret and Peter Hunt. Oral family history states that Margaret was a weaver on the plantation, and Peter was a Tanner of animal hides. America eventually married Joshua Hunt, a former slave of Henry Hunt. In total, America had seven children.<br /> <br /> In approximately 1856, Henry Hunt moved them to Franklin County, near Roxie, Mississippi. Emancipation occurred on January 1, 1863. Yet, in 1865, Josh, America, and other family members were farming on the same property enumerated on the Registry of Freedmen residing on the plantation of Henry Hunt in Franklin County, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> By 1870, Joshua and America changed their name from Hunt to Harrell along with their daughters, who were Jane Harrell-Oats (John), Harriet Harrell-Pickett (Richard “Jake”), Louisa Harrell-Jackson (Winston), and Sarah Harrell. Their former owner, Henry Hunt, also died in 1870.<br /> <br /> America was a widow by February of 1883 when she filed for a 39.35 acre homestead under the Homestead Act of 1862. Within nine years, America, with her children’s help and hired hands, built a 16-foot square log cabin, which consisted of a bed, bureau, chair, and table. They also made three log corn cribs. America farmed fifteen acres of the land, planting corn and potatoes, as the rest of the land was piney woods.<br /> <br /> The neighbors who were witnesses for her final homestead application were J.M. Halford, “G.C.” George Columbus Adams, and Joe Turner. The two closest people living next to America were her son, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/peter-hunt.htm\">Peter Hunt</a>, and neighbor Ben Lands. When America proved up on her homestead her farm yielded 100 bushels of corn and 50 bushels of potatoes. She owned plows, hoes, a turning plow, a weeder, one horse, five heads of cows, and one yearling. Her land, home, and corn cribs’ total value were noted at $130.00 in 1892<br /> <br /> The descendants of America Hunt-Harrell are proud of her. She was a tenacious, hard-working woman, despite her life circumstances. Although America was born a slave, after 20 years of freedom, she purchased land, lived in her own home, worked for herself, never being enslaved again in any capacity. She died approximately in 1895.<br /> <br /> ~ Contributed by Denise Griggs, descendant<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Denise Griggs\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7164933|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Denise-Griggssmall.jpeg\" title=\"Denise Griggs\" /></div> <div><br /> <br /> <strong>About Denise Griggs</strong><br /> Denise I.

Born and raised in Oakfield, Maine in Aroostook county, she graduated from Merrill High School and taught one term at a local school before enrolling in Houlton Business College. On April 25, 1930, her 25th birthday, Ms. Tarbell began her first day of work at the recently re-named Acadia National Park, reporting directly to Superintendent George B. Dorr.<br /> <br /> For the next 14 years until Dorr’s death, Ms. Tarbell worked tirelessly alongside the Superintendent to support the maintenance and growth of Acadia National Park. Throughout her career, she was continuously promoted: from Clerk, to Chief Clerk, to the Administrative Officer for Acadia. By the time Ms. Tarbell retired in 1969, she had supported Acadia through some of its most complex periods in history: the Great Depression, World War II, and the Great Fire of 1947.<br /> <br /> Ms. Tarbell’s mark on this park may be easy to miss. Yet, her service is similar to many who have and continue to work behind the scenes supporting Acadia National Park and Mount Desert Island’s most precious resources, in uncertain times.<br /> <br /> She is pictured at Sieur de Monts Spring to the left of her close friend, neighbor and colleague, Bar Harbor native Sylvia Cough. Ms. Cough worked as the secretary to Acadia National Park’s second Superintendent Benjamin L. Hadley until 1953.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Edward Lee Baker, Jr., was born on December 28, 1865, in Platte River, Wyoming, near Fort Laramie. Baker was the son of a white French father and a Black American mother. He grew up with his family in eastern Wyoming where he learned horsemanship and roping skills. Along with learning the skills of a frontiersman Baker had a fondness for education. He learned French from his father and later studied Spanish, Russian, and Chinese.<br /> <br /> On July 27, 1882, at the age of 16, Baker enlisted in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry. During this enlistment he was promoted to trumpeter. Baker reenlisted on August 25, 1887, in the Tenth U.S. Cavalry. While in the Tenth he held various positions including chief trumpeter, quartermaster sergeant, and eventually sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank in a regiment.<br /> <br /> Baker traveled with the Tenth Cavalry from Western forts to Tampa, Florida, to await transport to Cuba during the Spanish American War. On the morning of July 1, 1898, Sergeant Major Baker and the rest of the Tenth Cavalry took up their positions around San Juan Heights in Cuba. The Tenth Cavalry along with the First Cavalry and the First Volunteer Cavalry, the Rough Riders, held the far right of the American line that hot, humid morning. Their position was in tall grass along the San Juan River.<br /> <br /> The Spanish troops were entrenched on San Juan Hill and Kettle Hill firing down on the Tenth’s position. The Spanish had found the range of the cavalry, and their rifle fire began to take a serious toll. Baker later wrote in his journal about this time, recounting, “the atmosphere seemed perfectly alive with flying missiles from bursting shells overhead, and rifle bullets, which seemed to have an explosive effect.” <br /> <br /> Walking up and down the line of the Tenth’s position talking to the troops, Baker reassured them while bullets whizzed by. As Baker made his rounds, he heard a groan and saw Private Lewis Marshall of C Troop wounded and struggling face down in the San Juan River. Baker ignored the advice of other soldiers who told him it was too dangerous to try to save Marshall. Baker pulled Marshall from the water and carried him to safety. After carrying Marshall to safety, Baker alerted the regimental doctor to attend to Marshall’s wounds. Marshall survived thanks to Baker’s actions.<br /> <br /> Baker joined the rest of the Tenth Cavalry in their fighting up the San Juan Heights. During the battle, Baker was wounded by shrapnel in his left side and left arm. He continued picking his way through barbed wire entanglements on his way to the summit. He later wrote that the troopers “advanced rapidly…under a galling, converging fire from the enemy’s artillery and infantry.” Finally, Baker and the remaining members of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry reached the summit and forced the Spaniards to retreat.<br /> <br /> On July 3, 1902, Baker received the Medal of Honor for his gallantry on July 1, 1898, as a member of the Philippine Scouts. His Medal of Honor citation reads, “Left cover and, under fire, rescued a wounded comrade from drowning.”<br /> <br /> Baker retired from the military on January 12, 1910, with a total of 28 years of service. He served in the Ninth and Tenth U.S. Cavalry as well as the Tenth U.S. Volunteer Infantry, Forty-ninth U.S. Volunteer Infantry, and the Philippine Scouts.<br /> <br /> On August 26, 1913, Baker died at the age of 47 in San Francisco. He was buried at Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Section 3, Lot 130, Grave 2 SE in Los Angeles, California.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Remembered as someone “pointed and convincing in speech, winning in manner, [and] overpowering in appeal,”<sup>1</sup> community and religious leader Eliza Ann Gardner exemplified the social activist tradition within Black churches.</p> <p>Born in New York in 1831, Eliza Gardner moved with her family to the West End community of Boston during her youth. Attending the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/abiel-smith-school.htm\">Abiel Smith School</a>, Gardner came of age in Beacon Hill’s center of abolition. Historian Hallie Quinn Brown noted, “[Eliza Gardner’s] home was a veritable ‘Bethel,’ being one of the stations of the famous ‘Underground Railroad.’”<sup>2</sup> During this time, Gardner became acquainted with local and national anti-slavery leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis </a>and Harriet Hayden, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-tubman.htm\">Harriet Tubman</a>.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Eliza Gardner also grew up actively involved in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church. She started teaching Sunday school in 1865, eventually becoming Boston's Sunday school superintendent in the 1880s.<sup>4</sup> During this time, Gardner assumed other leadership positions in the regional AME Zion Church. She served in the Daughters of Conference, which raised money to support ministers and erect churches, and she organized AME Zion Woman’s Home and Foreign Missionary Society, a women-run organization that supported missionaries.<sup>5</sup> Through this work, Gardner supported equality for women in religious institutions, particularly within the church hierarchy. She grew frustrated with male church leaders who often opposed women taking on leadership positions or diminished women's contributions. Gardner protested this injustice in the 1884 AME Zion Church’s General Conference:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>...if you commence to talk about the superiority of men, if you persist in telling us that after the fall of man we were put under your feet and that we are intended to be subject to your will, we cannot help you in New England one bit.</em><sup>6</sup></p> <p>As Gardner became a respected leader in the AME Zion Church, she also grew as a community leader in Boston. Eliza Gardner became one of the founding members of the Boston-based Black women’s club, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/womans-era-club.htm\">Woman’s Era Club</a>.<sup>7</sup> Working alongside <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin.htm\">Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/maria-l-baldwin.htm\">Maria Baldwin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florida-ruffin-ridley.htm\">Florida Ridley</a>, and others, Gardner helped organize the first <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/1895-convention.htm\">National Conference for Colored Women in America</a> in 1895, serving as the convention’s chaplain.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Gardner continued to blend her religious and moral leadership with her social activism, contributing to the temperance, women’s rights, and anti-lynching movements.<sup>9</sup> In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Gardner often spoke at events that commemorated the abolitionist era of her youth, during which she adeptly related the past struggles of Black Americans to the current discrimination they faced. At a 1917 event honoring the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">Massachusetts 54<sup>th</sup> Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, Gardner, over 90 years old at the time, gave some remarks that echoed this tone:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>The North...met with defeat in the civil war until it called on the black man, and yet after all the sacrifices of our race he is not considered worthy of this companionship of the whites. Yet as there was no victory without us in the past, so there will be none without us in the future.</em><sup>10</sup></p> <p>Eliza Gardner died in 1922, after many decades of service to her religious and social communities.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>William J.

Once in Boston, he became one of the most prominent abolitionists and Underground Railroad operatives in the city.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>By most accounts, Smith first arrived in Boston in the mid-1830s. At this time, he worked as a waiter at the Mount Washington House, where he may have begun a friendship with the Shaw family.<sup>2</sup> By 1843, he is listed as living with clothing dealer and activist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/john-coburn-house.htm\">John Coburn</a> on Southac (now Phillips) Street.<sup>3</sup> At some point, he began working for \"Mr. Thacker, the leading colored caterer at that time, but soon established himself on his own account.\"<sup>4</sup></p> <p>As the head of his own business, Smith became \"recognized as the Prince of Caterers, in these parts.\"<sup>5</sup> He employed many people, including freedom seekers, and used his public position to \"'keep an eye on slave hunters, who were always looking for fugitives in Boston restaurants.'\"<sup>6</sup> He also used his status in the city to take highly visible political stands. For example, he once refused to cater an event in honor of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/daniel-webster.htm\">Daniel Webster</a>, who had thrown his crucial support behind the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.<sup>7</sup> Likewise, during the Fugitive Slave Law case of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a> in 1854, \"Mr. J.B. Smith, the caterer, (himself a fugitive,) could not induce his colored assistants to work in preparing refreshments for the troops\" sent to the city to ensure the rendition of Burns.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Smith's documented work as an Underground Railroad operative dates to the early 1840s. He joined the first Boston Vigilance Committee, established by abolitionist Charles Torrey in 1841, and later served in the 1846 iteration of the Vigilance Committee as a \"Relief Agent.\"<sup>9</sup> He also co-founded and served as vice-president of the New England Freedom Association, an African American organization that assisted freedom seekers.<sup>10</sup> He later joined the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/boston-anti-man-hunting-league.htm\">Anti-Man-hunting League</a> as well.<sup>11</sup> With the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, Smith met with others at the African Meeting House in a call to arms. According to the <em>Liberator</em>, Smith \"hoped no one in that meeting would preach peace, for, as Patrick Henry said, '<em>there is no peace</em>.'\" He continued:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">If liberty is not worth fighting for, it is not worth having. <em>He advised every fugitive to arm himself with a revolver – if he could not buy one otherwise, to sell his coat for that purpose. As for himself, and he thus exhorted others, he should be kind and courteous to all, even the slave-dealer, until the moment of an attack upon his liberty. He would not be taken ALIVE, but upon the slave-catcher's head be the consequences. When he could not live here in Boston, a FREEMAN, in the language of Socrates, </em>'He had lived long enough.'<em> Mr. Smith, in conclusion, made a demonstration of one mode of defence, which those who best know him say would be exemplified to the </em>hilt<em>.</em><sup>12</sup></p> <p>Smith said, \"Be cool and deliberate...wait as they did at Bunker Hill, until you can see the white of the hunter's eye, and then give him 'old Kentuck',\" referencing a weapon.<sup>13</sup> Smith soon joined the third and final iteration of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/1850-boston-vigilance-committee.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, serving as a member of the Executive Committee. He is listed several times in the account book of that organization as providing funds for freedom seekers to secure passage to Canada.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>In 1850, Smith married E.J. Sprague and they moved to Cambridge a few years later.<sup>15</sup> During the Civil War, Smith \"engaged in providing food for and catering to the wants of the thousands of soldiers passing through this city, towards the seat of war.\"<sup>16</sup> Another account claimed Smith “was an active promoter of recruiting and was liberal to the soldier or his family who required his aid.”<sup>17</sup> Following the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-54th-massachusetts-and-the-second-battle-of-fort-wagner.htm\">Battle of Fort Wagner</a> in 1863, Smith became one of the earliest and most vocal supporters of a monument to commemorate <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-g-shaw.htm\">Robert Gould Shaw</a>, a close friend and the colonel of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/shaw.htm\">54<sup>th</sup> Regiment</a> who lost his life in the assault.</p> <p>In October 1867, he became a member of the St. Andrew's Lodge of Freemasons, and the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, \"being the first colored man who ever held a seat in that body.\"<sup>18</sup> He served as an elected member of the legislature in 1873 and 1874 where he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations. Smith also advised his close friend <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-sumner.htm\">Senator Charles Sumner</a> as he crafted what became the federal Civil Rights Act of 1875.<sup>19</sup></p> <p>After a life dedicated in service to others, Joshua Smith died of stomach cancer in 1879 and is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>See Kathryn Grover, <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/saga/learn/historyculture/to-heal-the-wounded-nation-s-life.htm\">To Heal the Wounded Nation's Life: African Americans and the Robert Gould Shaw/54th Regiment Memorial</a></em>, Special History Study, Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park, 2021.

Several pieces of land in Georgetown were purchased for or gifted to Mary and her sister Harriott. They are often listed as co-owners of the lots throughout their childhoods.<br /> <br /> Mary married Richard Smith in 1776. Records indicate that over the next eleven years they had seven children. In 1787, Richard died, leaving Mary to pay his debts and care for their children. Mary sold most of Richard’s property—including enslaved persons. Robert Peter, a family friend, purchased several of the enslaved people and held them in trust for her. He also absolved her of all debts owed to him. Mary moved her family into the home owned by her mother on Lot #3. She is listed as head of household and living with six of her seven children—the youngest, Clement, may have passed away before or shortly after Richard.<br /> <br /> Mary lived in Georgetown in what is now called Old Stone House for the next ten years. Over the course of this time period, Robert Peter helped to ensure both Harriott and Mary would be comfortable after their mother’s death. He saw to it that Mary would inherit all of Lot #3 while Harriott would inherit a different lot in entirety. Mary’s mother still owned Lot #3 and was using parts of the property to earn money by renting buildings or shop spaces out. Documents indicate that Cassandra rented the first floor shop space to John Suter, Jr. for his use as a clock shop in the 1800s while Mary continued to live upstairs in the residential portion of the house.<br /> <br /> It is through Suter's watch shop business that Mary may have met her second husband, Joseph Brumley. Joseph was a cabinet maker. Documentation indicates that he was making the tall cases that John Suter, Jr’s clocks were placed in. It is also around this time that Mary’s eldest daughter Barbara met and married John Suter, Jr.<br /> <br /> After Mary and Joseph were married, they moved off the lot and Barbara and John moved into Old Stone House for a time. Mary inherited Lot #3 when Cassandra died in 1808. As her mother had done, Mary used the property at lot #3 to earn money and leased it out to a series of other people until her death in 1825 or 1826.<br /> <br /> Lot #3 was an important part of Mary’s will and was divided as follows: ½ to her daughter, Harriott Smith,  ¼ to her daughter, Cassandra Chew McKenzie, ¼ to her granddaughters Sarah Maria and Ann Suter.<br /> <br /> Cassandra McKenzie gave her 1/4 share of the lot to Sarah Maria in 1835. She and Harriott split the earnings from the lot 50/50 for the next fifty years.<br /> <br /> In 1875 Richard Marcey and Calvin Payne purchase Lot #3. For the first time in over 100 years it was not owned by women or by a descendent of Cassandra Chew.",

Board of Education, </i>and influential in key moments during the Little Rock desegregation crisis. <br /> <br /> Born in 1908 in Baltimore, Marshall pursued his undergraduate studies at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania alongside Cab Calloway and Langston Hughes. Hughes later said that Marshall was “rough and ready, loud and wrong.” Barred by a segregated admissions policy from attending the University of Maryland Law School, Marshall instead attended Howard University Law School and was the valedictorian of his graduating class. While at Howard, his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the Dean of the Law School and his mentor, Charles Hamilton Houston.<br /> <br /> Following graduation, Marshall opened his own private law practice in Baltimore. In 1936, he became a staff lawyer alongside Houston for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Two years later, Marshall became the lead chair in the legal office of the NAACP; by 1940, he was the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF). While Marshall would argue many critical lawsuits on behalf of the NAACP LDF (<i>Smith v. Allwright</i>, <i>Shelley v. Kramer</i>, <i>Sweatt v. Painter</i>, and <i>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents</i>), his most significant victory would come with the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision in 1954.<br /> <br /> <i>Brown</i> argued that the Supreme Court decision<i>, Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)</i>, could not be applied toward public schools because “separate educational facilities” were “inherently unequal.” His involvement in this case would eventually bring Marshall to Little Rock in 1957 after Governor Orval Faubus attempted to defy federal law by prohibiting integration of Central High School.<br /> <br /> On September 20, 1957, Marshall and attorney Wiley Branton appeared in Little Rock before US District Judge Ronald Davies requesting an injunction against Governor Faubus' use of troops to prevent integration. The injunction was granted - three days later, the Little Rock Nine would make a second attempt to integrate Central High School.<br /> <br /> In 1958, the Little Rock School Board requested permission to delay their original plan of gradual integration by 30 months and asked to be relieved of the burden of desegregation until the U.S. Supreme Court better defines \"all deliberate speed,\" as specified in <i>Brown v. Board of Education II </i>(1955). In response, Marshall represented the families of Little Rock seeking a stay of this delay in this case, <i>Cooper v. Aaron</i>. In a rare decision, the US Supreme Court issued a joint opinion authored by all nine justices. The Court stated that while they felt the Little Rock School Board had acted in good faith, the problems in the state of Arkansas had stemmed from the state government. The Court ultimately ruled it was unconstitutional to allow the delay under the Equal Protection Clause. Ultimately, Governor Faubus - buoyed by the results of a local vote to determine integration's immediate future - closed the four public high schools in the city of Little Rock; this one-year cessation of education is known now as the Lost Year. <br /> <br /> Further, the court ruled that since the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution and the 1803 decision Marbury v. Madison meant that the Supreme Court was the final interpreter of the Constitution, then that meant the earlier Brown decision was the supreme law of the land and thus was binding in all states, despite state laws that may exist to contradict the ruling. This subsequently led to the court rejecting the doctrines of nullification and interposition.<br /> <br /> In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; four years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Marshall as Solicitor General – making him at the time that the highest ranking African American government official in the US. Perhaps the most significant moment of Marshall’s career and contribution to US history occurred in 1967; in a 69-11 vote, Thurgood Marshall became the 96th justice appointed to the United States Supreme Court and the first African American to serve in this capacity.<br /> <br /> Thurgood Marshall served on the Supreme Court for 24 years. In 1987, he famously generated controversy during the bicentennial celebration of the US Constitution with these statements:<br /> <br /> “The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights we hold as fundamental today.”<br /> <br /> “Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.”<br /> <br /> Citing poor health, Marshall retired from the US Supreme Court in 1991. He died in 1993 at age 84 in Bethesda, Maryland. Thurgood Marshall – “Mr. Civil Rights” - was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery and was survived by his second wife Cecilia and their two sons. </span></p>",

This controversial law empowered enslavers and their agents to capture and return freedom seekers to bondage with the full backing of the federal government. It also mandated the assistance of local and state officials and the public at large. Members of the Vigilance Committee provided funds, shelter, transportation, medical attention, and other assistance to freedom seekers escaping enslavement on the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>We have not been able to find much information on Dennis Bigelow. The 1850 United States Census lists a Dennis Bigelow (b: 1778, d: 1851) living in West Boylston, Massachusetts, but given his age and the distance between his home and Boston he does not appear a likely candidate. Although another \"Dennis Bigelow\" lived in Boston in 1848 and 1849, he had apparently left by 1850.<sup>2</sup> While Dennis Bigelow is listed as a Vigilance Committee member by Bearse, there are no other accounts linking him (or any \"D. Bigelow\") to the Vigilance Committee, Underground Railroad, or antislavery activity. He does not appear on other lists of Vigilance Committee members, anywhere else in Bearse's <em>Reminiscences</em>, or in the <em>Account Book of Francis Jackson</em>, Treasurer of the Boston Vigilance Committee.</p> <p>There is one intriguing possibility. In 1851, \"Darius Bigelow,\" one of the \"anti-slavery fraternity\" signed a petition condemning the Mayor and Aldermen of Boston for their recent decision denying “the Free Soil citizens of this city and Commonwealth” the use of Faneuil Hall for a meeting.<sup>3</sup> The Free Soil Party focused its attention on stopping the expansion of slavery into the western territories of the United States. Could this Darius Bigelow be connected to Dennis Bigelow? Could Bearse have gotten the name wrong? Unfortunately, public searches have not turned up any further record of a Darius Bigelow living in Massachusetts or connected to the anti-slavery movement.</p> <p>For now Dennis Bigelow's identity and contributions to the Vigilance Committee remain a mystery.

            "bodyText": "William Henry Jackson is best known as the first person to photograph the wonders of Yellowstone. His images adorned the parlors of millions of American households and aided in the effort to create the world's first national park. Jackson was also an accomplished artist who recorded his experiences as a young man. His drawings and paintings provide valuable insights to life in a time when America was suffering through the Civil War and venturing westward in search of a national identity.<br /> <br /> Growing up in Keeseville, New York, the oldest of seven children, William Henry Jackson was born to George Hallock Jackson and Harriet Maria Allen on April 4, 1843. Harriet was a talented watercolorist, and Jackson had the opportunity to learn from her at a young age. He spent much of his childhood mastering the arts of drawing and painting. At the age of 10, Jackson was given the book <em>The American Drawing Book: A Manual for the Amateur </em>by John Gadsby Chapman. From this book, Jackson learned how to use perspective and form, color, and composition. As a teenager, Jackson was introduced to photography in Troy, New York, and Rutland, Vermont. There, he worked as an assistant in a photographer’s studio, helping to stage and retouch photos. During this time, he learned how to use cameras and the darkroom techniques of the time.<br /> <br /> Jackson might have continued to learn his trade and settle into a stable and lucrative career, but events beyond his control would soon take him in a new direction. In August of 1862, the 19-year old William Henry Jackson enlisted as a member of the Light Guard from Rutland, Vermont. With the exception of occasional guard duty, there was little for the aspiring artist to do. Jackson passed the long, boring hours sketching his friends and scenes of camp life to send home to show his family he was safe. In June of 1863, Jackson’s regiment participated in the climactic Gettysburg campaign, but never saw action in the battle. Soon after his term of enlistment expired, William Henry Jackson returned to civilian life. Luckily, his mother saved the pencil sketches created during his wartime service, and they survive today as a record of an infantryman’s life in the Union army.<br /> <br /> On his return home, the young veteran quickly found employment in another photographic studio. His obvious skills won him a fine salary, which enabled him to buy fancy clothes and live the good life. After a year, during which he had received substantial raises and promotions, he became engaged to a young woman from a prominent family. Every indication pointed to a happy, successful life and career. However, a lover’s spat in 1866 brought Jackson’s world crashing down around him. Too ashamed to face his family after the breakup with his fiancé, the heartbroken young man decided to leave Vermont and seek his fortune in the gold mines of Montana. Jackson and two friends set out for the western frontier, making their way to Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory – a jumping off point for freighting caravans headed west. There the three young easterners signed on as bullwhackers for a freight outfit bound for Montana. Despite knowing nothing about oxen or hauling freight, Jackson soon grew proficient in handling the powerful draft animals.<br /> <br /> The hard work and new country did much to mend Jackson’s broken heart. Soon he was back to his old habits of sketching the things he saw and the people he met. Forsaking his dream of striking it rich, Jackson left the freight train near South Pass in Wyoming and headed south for Salt Lake City and eventually California. His experiences in the West struck a chord in Jackson, and he began to realize that documenting the settling of the frontier might become his life’s work.<br /> <br /> With assistance from his father, Jackson established his own photographic studio in Omaha, Nebraska in 1869. He began photographing American Indians from the nearby Omaha reservation and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. These photographs came to the attention of Dr. Ferdinand Hayden, who was organizing an expedition that would explore the geologic wonders along the Yellowstone River in Wyoming Territory. Hayden realized that a photographer would be useful in recording what they found. Jackson was invited to participate in the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. As a member of the survey, he observed and captured via photographs and paintings the wonders of the region that would become Yellowstone National Park. He served as official photographer for the US Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories until 1878.<br /> <br /> Anyone else might have been daunted by the thought of transporting delicate camera equipment and glass plate negatives across the West, but Jackson’s experience as a bullwhacker would serve him well. The images he brought back caused a sensation. For many years, stories about geysers and waterfalls were thought to be tall tales, but Jackson provided proof of their existence. Public interest resulted in the U.S. Congress officially designating Yellowstone National Park in 1872, and Jackson’s name became a household word.<br /> <br /> For the next seven years, Jackson worked with Dr. Hayden for the United States Geological Survey. The Survey took him to such unique and unexplored places as Mesa Verde and Yosemite, which Jackson documented with thousands of photographs.<br /> <br /> One of his most famous images would be taken in 1873. For years, stories of a mountain with a large cross etched in its side had been circulating, but it wasn’t until Jackson risked climbing Colorado’s Notch Mountain in the heart of the Rocky Mountains for a clear photographic view that its existence was proven. Within a few months of the photograph’s publication, his image of the Mount of the Holy Cross adorned the parlors in thousands of American homes. Jackson’s work for the U.S.G.S. ended in 1878. He continued to work in the West, opening a studio in Denver, Colorado, returning to portrait photography as well as documenting railroad construction to mining towns in the Rockies.<br /> <br /> At an age when most men have already retired, William Henry Jackson embarked on a new career. He chose to return to the paintbrush at the age of 81, working as a muralist for the new U.S. Department of the Interior.  Jackson’s eye for composition, coupled with the fact that he had experienced the transformation of the West firsthand gave added credibility to his work. Soon his paintings of western scenes were in demand for illustrating books and articles. Jackson completed 100s of paintings, mostly dealing with historic themes such as the Fur Trade, the California Gold Rush and the Oregon Trail. Jackson revisited many of the sites he depicted in his paintings so he could paint them as accurately as possible. For those scenes that predated his own lifetime, he sought out and interviewed surviving participants. <br /> <br /> William Henry Jackson died on June 30, 1942 at the age of 99 in New York City from injuries resulting from a fall. Recognized as one of the last surviving Civil War veterans, he was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. His long and active life paralleled the formative years in the life of the United States, and his many contributions as a soldier, bullwhacker, photographer, explorer, publisher, author, artist, and historian have left a lasting legacy that the National Park Service is proud to honor.<br /> <br /> Mount Jackson, just north of the Madison River, in the Gallatin Range of Yellowstone National Park is named in honor of Jackson.<br /> <br /> The archives of Scotts Bluff National Monument, in Gering, Nebraska, house the <a href=\"https://nps.gov/thingstodo/the-william-henry-jackson-collection.htm\">world's largest collection of original William Henry Jackson sketches, paintings, and photographs.</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/whj/index.html\">A virtual exhibition of the Scotts Bluff National Monument William Henry Jackson collection</a> is available thanks to the NPS Museum Management Program. <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "William Othello Wilson was born on September 16, 1869, in Hagerstown, Maryland. Wilson enlisted in I Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry, on August 21, 1889, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Before joining the cavalry, he was a skilled upholsterer. He quickly rose in rank to corporal. <br /> <br /> On November 19, 1890, the Ninth U.S. Cavalry left its posts in Nebraska and Wyoming en route to the Sioux reservations to settle the nerves of the Indian Agents. The Indian Agents and White settlers in the area were panicked due to the Sioux participating in the Ghost Dance. Many whites living near the reservations regarded the Ghost Dance as a prelude to renewed American Indian militance, although it was a religious ritual that had spread among American Indian tribes throughout the West.<br /> <br /> The Ghost Dance found many backers among the Sioux. The Ghost Dance blended traditional indigenous rituals with the expectation that a messiah would come and restore the Sioux and others to their traditional lands and former glory. To the Sioux the Ghost Dance held out hope of a return to days when they roamed at liberty and the bison were plentiful.<br /> <br /> Ultimately more than 5,000 soldiers from several regiments converged on the Sioux reservations. While the increased soldier presence was intended to bring stability to the area, it had the opposite effect. As December unfolded, increasingly fervent ceremonies took place throughout the reservations. Groups of Sioux were leaving the reservations, heading into the hinterland to avoid Army scrutiny and control.<br /> <br /> In late December 1890 a battalion of Ninth Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers left the Pine Ridge Agency on patrol pursuing Sioux groups that had left the reservations. The battalion was led by Major Guy V. Henry and comprised troopers from D, F, I, and K Troops. On the evening of December 29, the battalion was about 50 miles away from the Pine Ridge Agency in South Dakota. As the troopers were feeding their horses and making dinner some Army scouts entered the Buffalo Soldier camp and alerted them about the Wounded Knee Massacre that took place earlier in the day. The battalion was ordered to return immediately to Pine Ridge. Most of the battalion arrived at the Pine Ridge agency as the sun rose on December 30. <br /> <br /> The battalion supply train was about 90 minutes behind the main battalion. Two miles from their destination the supply train was attacked by 50 Sioux warriors. At the first signs of the attack Captain John S. Loud, in charge of the supply train, circled his wagons for protection. Captain Loud knew the situation was desperate; bullets were coming from multiple directions. He scribbled a note to Major Henry asking for help.<br /> <br /> Corporal Wilson was nearby and overheard Captain Loud asking for volunteers to deliver the message. Wilson volunteered. He mounted his horse and rode the two miles to the agency and Major Henry. Ten Sioux warriors saw Wilson leave the encircled wagons and pursued him. Wilson made it safely to the agency to raise the alarm.<br /> <br /> Major Henry ordered the battalion to resaddle its horses after Wilson delivered the note. They rode to the rescue of their comrades and the supply train. Once the battalion arrived, the Sioux warriors retreated.<br /> <br /> For his actions that day, Wilson received the Medal of Honor on September 17, 1891. His Medal of Honor citation simply states “bravery.” On December 17, 1891, a more detailed citation was published in General Order 100. It praised Wilson “For gallantry in carrying a message for assistance through country occupied by the enemy. When the wagon train under escort of Captain Loud was attacked by hostile Sioux Indians, near the Pine Ridge Agency, South Dakota.” Wilson was the last American soldier to receive the Medal of Honor for actions on American soil.<br /> <br /> Two years after receiving the Medal of Honor, Wilson was stationed at Fort Duchesne near Vernal, Utah. On September 5, 1893, while traveling to Denver, Colorado, after participating in an Army marksmanship event, Wilson deserted. He made his way back to Hagerstown, Maryland. The Army never apprehend Wilson, who lived the rest of his days in Hagerstown rarely talking about his military service. <br /> <br /> William O. Wilson died on January 18, 1928, at the age of 58. He was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in his hometown of Hagerstown, Maryland.",

After Downing’s death in 1852, Vaux continued to practice architecture. In 1857, Vaux convinced the city of New York to have a competition for a new design for a major public park, known today as Central Park. <br /> <br /> He convinced the park’s superintendent, Frederick Law Olmsted, to join him in submitting a plan, and their design, named “The Greensward Plan,” won first place. An original feature of their design was the separation of traffic routes for carriages, pedestrians and horseback riders to avoid collisions, by using a series of underpasses and scenic bridges that Vaux designed.  <br /> <br /> After their Central Park success, Vaux and Olmsted continued to practice together until 1872, working on diverse projects, such as Prospect and Morningside Parks, the residential community of Riverside, Illinois among other public and private landscapes. <br /> <br /> After they had dissolved their partnership, Vaux continued to work on both architectural and landscape projects and occasionally collaborated again with Olmsted, such as on the 1887 project to improve the New York State Reservation at Niagara Falls.<br />   <p>Partner: 1857-1872<br /> <br /> <strong>Notable Project Involvements while at the Firm:</strong><br /> <br /> Central Park, New York, New York<br /> Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York<br /> Riverside, Illinois<br /> South Park (now Kennedy Park), Fall River, Massachusetts<br /> New York State Reservation at Niagara, Buffalo, New York</p>",

While Olmsted traveled across the country studying project sites, Eliot, along with fellow apprentice Harry Codman, worked in the office under the supervision of John Charles Olmsted.<br /> <br /> Eliot eventually left to begin his own practice, but returned to the firm as a partner in 1893 when Codman’s sudden death left the Olmsteds understaffed in the middle of the work at the World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago. During the 1890s he worked on significant office commissions such as the Boston and Cambridge park systems and Biltmore Estate, but his major focus was on the development of a visionary regional park concept for Greater Boston. <br /> <br /> He identified and assessed diverse landscapes of woodland, river basins and beaches with special scenic features in the Boston metropolitan area, and worked with the various municipalities to acquire these lands for a regionally managed system of public reservations with linking parkways.  <br /> <br /> This original concept formed one Eliot's most enduring landscape legacies. Eliot died unexpectedly at age 37 in 1897, and in his honor the first formal degree program in landscape architecture was established at Harvard University in 1900.<br />   <p>Years at Firm & Positions:<strong> </strong>Apprentice: 1883-1887, Partner: 1893-1897<br /> <br /> <strong>Notable Project Involvements while at the Firm:</strong></p> <p>Boston/Brookline Park System, Boston, Massachusetts<br /> Boston Metropolitan Park System, Massachusetts<br /> World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago Illinois </p>",

To carry out his work, Olmsted developed a firm where he supervised the education, not only of his sons, John Charles, and Frederick Law, Jr., but of his many apprentices, such as Henry S. Codman and Charles Eliot, who he felt had the talent and temperament to advance the evolving landscape design profession. The senior Olmsted believed that landscape architects needed more than knowledge of plants and soil; they needed to understand the artistic nature of their work and how designed landscapes could influence human activity and social values. When he retired in 1897, he left a legacy of diverse and well-designed landscapes and a new generation of landscape professionals who understood his vision and could interpret it for the next century.<br /> <br /> Years at Firm & Position:Partner:1857-1897<br /> <br /> <strong>Notable Project Involvements while at the Firm:</strong><br /> Central Park, New York, New York<br /> Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York<br /> Riverside, Illinois<br /> US Capitol Grounds, Washington, D.C.<br /> Park System, Boston and Brookline, Massachusetts<br /> World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois<br /> Biltmore Estate, Asheville, North Carolina",

Following his father's design philosophy, he had an abiding concern that cities be comprehensively planned to provide for healthy living and working conditions and scenic recreational opportunities.His national reputation was established with his early work for the McMillan Commission in Washington, DC to return the nation's capital to its intended beauty.He continued this urban planning work with reports on numerous cities across the country, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;New Haven, Connecticut;and Boulder, Colorado. He was a passionate advocate for the preservation of natural areas throughout the country and wrote the key language of the 1916 Organic Act that established the National Park Service. In 1928 he helped establish the first state park system in California.Toward the end of his life, Rick continued in the forefront of the conservation movement as an active member of the Sierra Club and the California Save-The-Redwoods-League.A grove in Redwoods National Park now bears his name.He would say it was his father who instilled in him the idea that it was his mission \"to protect and perpetuate whatever of beauty and inspirational value [is] inherent in that landscape.\"<br /> <br /> Years at Firm & Positions: Apprentice:1895-1897, Partner: 1897-1949, Consultant: 1949-1957<br /> <br /> <strong>Notable Project Involvements while at the Firm:</strong><br /> <br /> Baltimore Park System, Baltimore, Maryland<br /> Fort Tryon Park, New York, New York<br /> Palos Verdes Estates, California<br /> Boulder Park System, Boulder, Colorado<br /> Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, New York<br /> Acadia National Park, Mount Desert, Maine<br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>Rosika Schwimmer was a Hungarian peace activist, suffragist, and feminist. When she applied for United States citizenship, officials rejected her petition. The application asked if new citizens would be willing to take up arms to defend the country. Due to her pacifist beliefs, Schwimmer refused. Officials viewed her refusal as a sign of disloyalty and lack of commitment to the Constitution. In 1929, Schwimmer’s challenge to their decision went to the Supreme Court.</p> <hr /> <p><b><i>Can a peacemaker be dangerous?</i></b><b><i></i></b></p> <hr /> <h4>Early Life and Activism</h4> <p>Rosika Schwimmer was born in Budapest, Hungary on September 11, 1877. She was the oldest child in a middle-class Jewish family.<br /> <br /> Schwimmer devoted her early career to organizing working women in Hungary. During her twenties, she founded several national associations to improve working conditions and wages for women. She also advocated for birth control, marriage reform, and ending child labor.<br /> <br /> In 1904, Schwimmer was invited to speak at the International Congress of Women in Berlin. She met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">Carrie Chapman Catt</a>, a leader in the American women's suffrage movement and the president of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm\">International Woman Suffrage Alliance</a> (IWSA). Under Catt’s mentorship, Schwimmer began to advocate for women’s suffrage in Hungary and became the press secretary of the IWSA in London.<br /> <br /> In 1911, Schwimmer married Paul (or Pál) Bédy, a journalist. They had no children and divorced two years later.</p> <h4>Women’s Suffrage Activism</h4> <p>On July 28, 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand sparked the outbreak of World War I. Due to hostility toward Hungarians in Great Britain, Schwimmer came to the United States. She became involved with the American suffrage movement. Catt sent Schwimmer on a national tour to gain the support of German-speaking immigrants. In the span of months, she visited 60 cities.<br /> <br /> Schwimmer also used her suffrage work to promote peace. She believed that if women could vote, they could pressure elected officials to support mediation in Europe. Schwimmer also gave lectures, collaborated with peace organizations, and participated in conferences for peace and women’s rights.<br /> <br /> Although Schwimmer was an asset to the American suffragists, she and Catt had different priorities. Schwimmer disagreed with Catt’s single-minded focus on women’s suffrage and shifted her attention to ending the war in Europe.</p> <h4>Anti-War Activism and the Peace Ship</h4> <p>Schwimmer collaborated with American peace activists to urge President Woodrow Wilson and other prominent Americans to intervene in WWI. Although Wilson remained committed to neutrality, Schwimmer convinced Henry Ford to act. In addition to seeking peace, Ford was motivated by publicity and the antisemitic belief that Jewish bankers financed the war for their own gain.<a id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosika_Schwimmer#/media/File:Schwimmer,_Ford.jpg\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosika_Schwimmer#/media/File:Schwimmer,_Ford.jpg'\"><img alt=\"A woman and man sitting with another man standing\" id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosika_Schwimmer#/media/File:Schwimmer,_Ford.jpg||CPIMAGE:7163541|0|\" src=\"/people/images/rosika-schwimmer-2.jpg\" style=\"width:50%;float:left;margin-top:7.5px;margin-bottom:7.5px;margin-left:7.5px;margin-right:7.5px;\" title=\"Rosika Schwimmer, Henry Ford, and Louis Lochner aboard the Peace Ship Oskar II\" /></a><br /> <br /> In late 1915, Ford joined Schwimmer and other peace activists aboard the “Peace Ship.” The photo at left depicts Schwimmer, Ford, and anti-war activist Louis P. Lochner on the ship. The delegation departed for Stockholm to organize a mediation conference among neutral nations in February 1916. The campaign failed to influence European leaders and was ridiculed by the press. Ford blamed its poor reception on Schwimmer and accused her of mismanaging his money.<br /> <br /> After this effort failed, Schwimmer remained in Europe to advocate for peace. When the war ended in 1918, she became an official and diplomat within Hungary’s new government, until the communist revolutionary Béla Kun overthrew it in 1919. When Schwimmer refused to serve under his regime, she was exiled from Hungary and returned to the U.S.</p> <h4>United States v. Schwimmer</h4> <p>By the time Schwimmer moved to Chicago in 1921, public opinion had turned against her. During wartime, journalists criticized her peace activism as unpatriotic and depicted her as a troublemaker. Reporters, including “Searchlight” columnist Fred Marvin, frequently questioned her loyalty and accused her of being a German spy, a Bolshevik, the source of Henry Ford’s antisemitism, and a threat to national security. To combat these claims, Schwimmer filed several anti-libel lawsuits, but failed to restore her reputation.<br /> <br /> In December 1924, Schwimmer applied for naturalization. She was convinced that \"getting citizenship is the only means to disprove all the accusations and rumors against me.” Question 22 on a preliminary form asked “If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?” Schwimmer responded: “I would not take up arms personally.” Due to her pacifist beliefs, she was a conscientious objector to military service.<br /> <br /> Schwimmer also believed that the question did not apply to her. As a woman approaching 50 years old, she was ineligible for combat. At a naturalization hearing, she testified that if taking up arms was a requirement of her citizenship, she would not comply. When naturalization officials objected to Schwimmer’s pacifism, she insisted her beliefs did not diminish her loyalty.<br /> <br /> Some of Schwimmer’s opponents, including the Military Intelligence Association of Chicago, also tried to prevent her from gaining citizenship. The Association was a superpatriotic professional organization for reserve officers who monitored the population for “dangerous” and “subversive” people and activities. In 1926, Schwimmer wrote the organization's leader to defend her beliefs. “I have no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family,” she explained. Naturalization officials later used Schwimmer’s statement to claim that she could not be truly committed to the Constitution.<br /> <br /> In late 1927, a Federal District Court Judge in Illinois rejected Schwimmer’s petition for citizenship. The following spring, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.[1] On May 27, 1929, the Court issued its 6-3 decision denying Schwimmer’s eligibility for citizenship.<br /> <br /> The Justices determined that Schwimmer’s influence on others was more harmful than her individual refusal to bear arms. Schwimmer had openly expressed that she intended to defend and contribute to the U.S. through her civic participation, which the Justices believed would spread disloyalty. They argued that Schwimmer’s gender-based argument was also invalid because her gender did not diminish her ability to influence others.</p> <h4>Later Life</h4> <p>After the case, Schwimmer continued to advocate for peace. Her friends and allies remained committed to her quest for citizenship. Due to her diabetes and deteriorating health, Schwimmer was unwilling to restart the extensive citizenship process. She also continued to draw the ire of journalists and superpatriotic organizations.<br /> <br /> Near the end of her life, Schwimmer lived in New York City with her sister Franciscka. After a prolonged illness, Schwimmer died at Mount Sinai Hospital on August 3, 1948. Even then, she remained a woman without a country.</p> <h4>Impact</h4> <p>In the 1946 case Girouard v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned its decision in United States. v. Schwimmer. As a result of this ruling, people who apply for citizenship cannot be disqualified for being conscientious objectors.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h4>Places of Rosika Schwimmer</h4> <p>[1] The Supreme Court met in the Old Senate Chamber of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/us-capitol.htm\">U.S. Capitol Building</a> between 1860 and 1935.

            "bodyText": "Rudolph Ernest Brunnow served as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/village-improvement-associations.htm\">Bar Harbor Village Improvement Association</a> Path Committee chairman from 1912 to 1917. He is the primary designer of the Precipice and Beehive Trails, as well as many other historic trails in Acadia National Park.<br /> <br /> While park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/founding.htm\">founder </a>George B. Dorr expanded the trail network in the Sieur de Monts Spring area, Brunnow was simultaneously involved in the construction of several of the most rigorous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historic-trails.htm\">trails </a>on the island. During this time he laid out the Precipice Trail and Orange & Black Path on Newport [Champlain] Mountain and The Beehive Trail. These routes, carefully designed to lead walkers through boulder fields and up precipitous cliffs, testify to the skill of Brunnow for laying our remarkable trails, much like the talents of his predecessors, Herbert Jaques and Waldron Bates. Like Door's memorial trails, Brunnow's trails held to high standards of construction with long rows of cut and uncut steps, yet contained much more iron work.  <br /> <br /> Like Jaques, Brunnow concentrated most of his trail construction on Newport [Champlain] Mountain near his summer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/rusticators-tourism.htm\">cottage </a>known as \"High Seas.' You can still see \"High Seas\" (private property) from Champlain Mountain today. Brunnow named the Orange and Black Path, built in 1913, after the school colors of Princeton University, where he was a Professor of Semitic Philology. The Precipice and Beehive Paths were funded by the Bar Harbor VIA, but Brunnow donated his own funds to the cause. Both trails were immediately popular due to the iron rungs and ladders but others complained that the increased popularity scared off eagles that once nested there. <br /> <br /> Brunnow's contributions to the trail system were cut short when he died suddenly from pneumonia in the spring of 1917 but he left behind some of the most challenging, controversial, and highly crafted trails in the Bar Harbor system. <br /> <br /> Brunnow was the only son of a German father and American mother. After his first wife died, he and his 5 children moved to New Jersey where he accepted a position as professor of Semitic philology (language studies) in 1908 at Princeton University. He first summered with his children in Bar Harbor in 1909.<br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historic-trails.htm\">Pathmakers</a><br /> Don Lenahan \"<a href=\"https://swhplibrary.net/digitalarchive/items/show/11673\">Rudolph Brunnow and the Myths about Him</a>\"",

            "bodyText": "<p>Hiram Ulysses Grant was born April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, the first child of Jesse and Hannah Grant.<br /> <br /> When Ulysses was one year old, his family moved to the nearby town of Georgetown. Jesse Grant supported the family as a tanner making animal hides into leather. Ulysses did not like working at the tannery. Instead, he would take care of the family farm, and care for the animals, especially horses. He attended several grade schools in Ohio and in Maysville, Kentucky, and thought about becoming a math teacher. When Grant stated that he would like to go to college, his father got him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. By mistake, his name was listed on the roster as Ulysses S. Grant, and although he tried to correct it upon entering the Academy, they informed him it would require a new appointment. Knowing this would upset his father, Ulysses accepted the change. His classmates soon nicknamed him United States or Uncle Sam Grant, and then called him Sam Grant.<br /> <br /> Ulysses graduated from West Point in 1843, 21st out of 39 cadets graduating that year. He was assigned to the 4th U.S. Infantry regiment stationed at Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Ulysses' roommate his last year at West Point was Fred Dent, who had grown up at a nearby plantation called White Haven. Grant was invitied to visit the home, and during a visit in February 1844 he met one of Fred's sisters, Julia Dent Grant. The two fell in love and became engaged before Ulysses was stationed further south. During the Mexican War, Grant served in nearly every major battle of the war and was twice brevetted for bravery. Ulysses and Julia married in St. Louis in 1848 after the conclusion of the Mexican American war. Grant was assigned to several different posts before resigning from the army in 1854 to try his hand at farming in St. Louis at White Haven. Grant struggled on the farm, however, and in early 1860 the family moved to Galena, Illinois, where Ulysses worked as a clerk at his father’s general store.<br /> <br /> With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, Grant offered his services to the U.S. military and quickly rose to fame following his victories at Forts Henry and Donelson, where he earned the nickname \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant. He rose through the ranks and was appointed by President Lincoln to become commanding general of all Union armies in March 1864. Grant supported Lincoln's war aims of union and freedom for the nearly 4 million African American enslaved individuals in the South. Following Lincoln's enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation, Grant made sure that the enslaved men, women, and children who escaped to Union lines were protected and cared for. After being promoted, Grant worked diligently to bring an end to the war. He accepted Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, effectively ending the Civil War.<br /> <br /> After the Civil War Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868.  During his two terms, Grant supported and signed the 15th Amendment to the Constitution, giving African American men the right to vote. His Native American “peace policy” revised government relations with Native Americans and attempted to protect Indians from people who wanted their land, although the results of these policies were mixed. He sought free public education for all, regardless of race, gender, or religion. On March 1, 1872 Grant signed legislation establishing Yellowstone as the nation's first national park. In international affairs, he peacefully settled major disputes with England over its support for the Confederacy during the Civil War, setting up a framework for international arbitration. And, contrary to popular depictions of Grant’s administration being one of the most corrupt in U.S. history, President Grant instituted civil service reform in the executive branch to reduce the negative effects of patronage and the spoils system. The recommendations of the Civil Service Commission would not become law until after President Garfield's assassination in 1881.<br /> <br /> Once the Grants left the White House, they embarked on a two-year world tour and settled in New York City. To offset the loss of his personal fortune to a Wall Street scam, Grant wrote his memoirs of the Civil War, which were completed just a few days before his death from throat cancer on July 23, 1885. Published posthumously, The Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant is still considered one of the best military commentaries ever written.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Andrew Emery Liscomb was one of the first men hired by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/village-improvement-associations.htm\">Bar Harbor Village Improvement Association's</a> (BH VIA) Path Committee in 1892 as the Superintendent of Paths. He remained Superintendent of Paths for 40 years.<br /> <br /> He was the son of a farmer and was a landscape gardener and farmer by profession.He was born and raised in the Salisbury Cove area of Mount Desert Island (MDI). Liscomb's responsibilities as Superintendent of Path's included physical improvements such as putting up signs and pointers, removing fallen trees, widening and cleaning paths, placing large stones in wet areas, building footbridges, and constructing new paths. Liscomb also supervised other laborers hired to work on the path system. Liscomb served as BH VIA Superintendent of Paths until 1931 and was responsible for the construction of many trails in Acadia's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historic-trails.htm\">historic trails system</a>. <br /> <br /> Acadia National Park founder and first Superintendent George B. Dorr credits Liscomb as the landscape designer responsible for the layout and construction of the Sieur de Monts Spring area. Dorr and Liscomb laid out memorial path routes in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/sieur-de-monts.htm\">Sieur de Monts Spring</a> area that are exemplary examples of trail building. Fellow trail builder and Bar Harbor VIA Path Committee chairman (1912-1917) Rudolph Ernest Brunnow credited Liscomb for supervising the construction work on the Orange and Black path on Champlain Mountain (then known as Newport Mountain) and various examples of exquisite rustic dry stone masonry includng stone steps.<br /> <br /> Andrew Liscomb died of a heart attack in December of 1931. He was 69 years old and otherwise in great health. His death was a great shock to the community. In his 40 years of leadership, he worked in association with fellow pathmakers including Goddard, James, Bates, Kate, Mitchell, Brunnow, Dorr, Opdycke, Weekes, and Peabody to construct many of the finest trails on Mount Desert Island. When these trails and their surrounding lands were donated to the national park service they became an everlasting legacy for future generations. Many of these paths continue to be lovingly maintained by park staff and volunteers to this day.  <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Melvin Colvin Hazen was born in Catlett, Virginia on a large estate that had been owned by his grandparents. The house sat on the border between two Virginia counties and though both Melvin and his sister were born in the house, they were technically born in different counties.<br /> <br /> Hazen grew up around horses and farming. In his later years he bred horses on his estate and rode in fox hunts, some of which went through what is now Rock Creek Park. <br /> <br /> Hazen graduated from the University of Maryland in 1886. </p> <h4>Surveying corps</h4> <p>Melvin Hazen joined the surveying corps of Washington, DC after graduating from the University of Maryland and began work as an \"axeman,\" a worker responsible for clearing brush on survey teams.<br /> <br /> The surveying corps of the District of Columbia was responsible for laying out the street grid beyond the 1792 L'Enfant-Ellicott plan. This would extend Washington's streets to the north into what had previously been farm land.<br /> Hazen rose through the ranks of the survey corps and by 1908, he was made Surveyor of the District of Columbia by the Board of Commissioners.<br /> <br /> As Surveyor, Hazen was responsible for street layout, building setbacks, cadastral maps and the recording of the location of public lands. He was a supporter of the McMillan Plan, which was a comprehensive plan for the \"monumental corridor\" or <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama/index.htm\">National Mall</a> and the parks system. He was also a supporter of congressional acts thought sought to 'clear out' alley dwellings. This culminated in the 1934 Alley Dwelling Authority which would eliminate all alley dwellings and encouraged economic redevelopment of the squares that were the original part of the L'Enfant-Ellicott plan. </p> <h4>President of the DC Board of Commissioners</h4> <p>In 1933, Hazen was made president of the DC Board of Commissioners. The DC Board of Commissioners served as city planners and managers of the District of Columbia while it was under congressional oversight. The president of the commission was essentially the mayor of Washington.<br /> <br /> As president of the board, Melvin Hazen was a leading force in the systematic dismantling of Reno City in Northwest Washington during the 1930s and 1940s. As early as 1914, Hazen had supported the removal of the community around the site of the old fort and suggested that it be used for a park and a school. He made repeated proposals in the 1920s and testified before congress. Others took the project over but as president of the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners he was instrumental in the displacement of Black residents from the area that is now <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-reno.htm\">Fort Reno Park</a>.<br /> <br /> Hazen died at his desk on July 15, 1941 at the age of 74. </p> <p> </p> <h4>Memorialization and Reservation 630</h4> <p>On May 20, 1942, the National Park Service administratively renamed what was then known as the Bureau of Standards Valley to Melvin Hazen Park. This was in response to a recommendation by the National Capital Park and Planning Commission. </p> <p>In 2020, community members questioned whether it was appropriate to name the area after Hazen. The park service established that the naming of Melvin Hazen Park was administrative rather than congressional. History, current law, regulations and policies that govern the actions of the National Park Service were taken into consideration and it was concluded that the National Park Service had the administrative authority to remove the name. In 2022 work began to replace signs and refer to the area by its reservation number, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/reservation-630.htm\">Reservation 630</a>, as is the case with many parcels of land in the District of Columbia. <br />  </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Charles Ball was born into slavery on a Maryland tobacco plantation sometime around 1781. He lived there with his mother and siblings until about 1785 when the owner’s death forced the estate to be sold up and the slaves sold away. Ball was sold to Jack Cox, a farmer with several slaves, who treated Ball “with humanity.” But at around age 12 following Cox’s death, Ball was sold again to a much more severe owner who furnished little food or clothing for his slaves, keeping Ball in a constant state of cold and hunger. When he was approximately 20 years old, around 1800, Ball’s master hired him out to the Navy.</p> <p>When Ball arrived at the Washington Navy Yard, he was stationed as a cook aboard the USS <em>Congress. </em>For a hungry young man used to a hard life as a field slave, this hardly seemed like work at all. Ball was eager to please officers, and in turn was gifted with hand-me-down clothing and for the first time in his life some spending money. After nearly two years in the service of the Navy, Ball encountered a novelty – a free man of color and sailor from Philadelphia. Together, they devised a scheme to smuggle Ball to freedom in the North, but no sooner did they complete their plan than Ball’s former master returned to reclaim him and sell him again, eventually away from his family down to South Carolina.</p> <p>After seven years in slavery in South Carolina, Ball escaped back up to Maryland to be closer to his family. Declaring himself a free man, Ball worked at small farms until war broke out in the Chesapeake. Although Ball could have secured his freedom by joining with the British and being evacuated from the United States, instead he chose to stay and enlist under Commodore Joshua Barney as a free man, attempting to convince other escaped slaves to stay in the United States and fight rather than defect to the British. Ball served as a seaman and a cook in the Chesapeake flotilla, serving at the Battles of St. Leonards Creek and Bladensburg. In his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/slaveryinunit00ballcha/page/n4/mode/2up\">1837 memoir</a>, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: “I stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down… if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, cold have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs.”</p> <p>After the war, Ball remained in Baltimore, living as a free man and eventually purchasing land for a home. This peace would be short, however: in 1830, he was seized as a fugitive slave and sold to a plantation in Georgia. Although he eventually escaped and returned to the north, living outside Philadelphia, he never was able to reunite with his family. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>George Roberts was born in Baltimore sometime in 1766, although little is known of his early life. At age 46, he signed up to serve on Captain Richard Moon’s privateer <em>Sarah Ann</em>, sailing out of Baltimore in July 1812.</p> <p>Serving at sea was an easy way for men of color – free or especially enslaved – to escape bondage and the prejudices of land. At sea, men came from all over the world, practicing many religions, representing many ethnicities and many backgrounds. Although a free man of color would be a novelty in Baltimore and subjected to constant scrutiny, at sea he was a simple sailor, and could enjoy freedoms that did not exist on land.</p> <p>The crew of <em>Sarah Ann </em>quickly had success in capturing a British merchant boat brining coffee and sugar from the Caribbean to Canada once they left Baltimore, but encountered trouble in September. Encountering the British frigate <em>Stratira, </em>Roberts and five other sailors were impressed and accused of being British. They were taken to Jamaica in irons, with the intention of returning them to the British naval fleet. Captain Moon vouched for Roberts, knowing him to be a free American, with papers, and a family back in Baltimore. This effort was successful, and Roberts and other prisoners were freed.</p> <p>Roberts crewed several other privateer vessels in the next two years before making his way back to Baltimore. In July 1814 he signed as a gunner on the privateer <em>Chasseur </em>under Captain Thomas Boyd, called the “Pride of Baltimore.” They boldly sailed east to British Isles and spent the next 10 months capturing and sinking British vessels.</p> <p>When <em>Chasseur </em>and her crew returned to Baltimore in April 1815, after the conclusion of the war, although they played no role in the Battle of Baltimore, the ship’s successes at sea elevated its crew to the status of war heroes. The <em>Chasseur </em>crew, including George Roberts, would participate annually in Battle of Baltimore commemorative events at Fort McHenry for years to come.</p> <p>Although welcomed in the celebrations every year, as a free man of color, Roberts had fewer and fewer rights leading into the Civil War. Roberts had far fewer liberties as a veteran in his old age living in a time of increased racial tensions than he enjoyed as a sailor at sea.</p>",

However, Robinson did not receive his freedom and was eventually sold into the deep South. <br /> <br /> In 1814, General Andrew Jackson needed more men to join his ranks in order to defend New Orleans from the British. As he traveled to the city, he asked enslavers if they would allow their enslaved men to fight in the battle. Many agreed, including Robinson’s new enslaver. During the military training of these enslaved men, their owners encouraged Jackson to tell the men that if the battle was won, they would all earn their freedom. Robinson, alongside many other enslaved African American men, fought in and won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.<br /> <br /> However, Jackson ordered them all to return home to their enslavers. Upon hearing this, Robinson pointed a pistol at Jackson. (It was not loaded, but Jackson did not know that at the time.) He asked Jackson why he promised freedom if he did not intend on following through. Jackson replied, “You are not my property, and I cannot take another man’s property and set it free.” Robinson also stated that Jackson made a speech warning people to never again arm African Americans because they would fight for their freedom, stating that “before a slave of mine should go free, I would put him in a barn and burn him alive.”<br /> <br /> When Robinson returned home, he asked his enslaver if he could be freed for his service but was denied and almost punished for even questioning his status. <br /> <br /> Although it is unclear when Robinson was freed, he appears in the 1840, 1850, and 1860 U.S. Censuses as a free man. Robinson resettled in Ohio, then Detroit, Michigan. He married, had children, wrote a narrative describing his experiences under the pen name James Roberts, and was celebrated on Defender’s Day every year until his death in 1868 at 115 years old.<br /> <br /> However, his military accomplishments were not nationally acknowledged until 2019. During a public ceremony recognizing his exceptional military service, James Robinson was honored with a three-volley rifle salute. <br /> <br /> To read James Robinson’s narrative, please visit <a href=\"https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/roberts/roberts.html\">this ebook</a> made available by the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p>",

Some credit Jennings rather than Dolley Madison with saving the portrait of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart from the burning White House in 1813, but perhaps Jennings’ most valuable contribution to history is his memoir, “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/coloredmansremin00jenn\">A Colored Man’s Reminiscences of James Madison</a>.” Although this document, published in a magazine in 1863 and again as a memoir in 1865, allows us to know much more about James Madison, little is known about Jennings himself.</p> <p>Jennings was born into slavery on James Madison’s Virginia plantation, Montpelier, in 1799. He was the son of a female slave of mixed African and American Indian heritage, and English trader Benjamin Jennings. Although plantation life was undoubtedly hard, Jennings reflected that slaves were treated with respect, and that he “never knew [Madison] to strike a slave, although he had over one hundred; neither would he allow an overseer to do it.” As a house slave and personal servant to such an important statesman as James Madison, Jennings was allowed a basic education. Unlike most slaves of the time, he was literate, educated in mathematics, and could even play the violin. In 1809, he accompanied the Madisons as they moved to the White House. Jennings spent his teenage years as a slave there, likely serving as a butler and serving on the family and their guests.</p> <p>Jennings’ memoir reveals intimate details of life in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/white-house.htm\">White House</a>, especially on the evening of August 23, 1814, when an invading British army arrived in Washington, D.C. He reflects that “Mrs. Madison ordered dinner to be ready at 3, as usual.” As Jennings and the other slaves prepared the dinner, word arrived that the British had landed. Frenzied, Dolley Madison carried off only “the silver in her reticule, as the British were thought to be but a few squares off, and were expected at every moment.” As for the <a href=\"http://www.georgewashington.si.edu/portrait/\">Lansdowne portrait</a>, Jennings attributes its salvation to door-keeper John Susé and the president’s gardener, Magraw.</p> <p>After two terms of the presidency, the Madisons returned to Montpelier in 1817. Jennings was promoted to James Madison’s primary manservant, responsible for dressing and shaving James as well as accompanying him on trips, a position which he held until James Madison’s death in 1836.</p> <p>In 1822, Jennings married Fanny Gordon, a slave on a neighboring plantation, and had five children together. Despite being married for 22 years, Jennings and his wife never spent more than a weekend together at a time. The same year as Fanny’s death, Dolley Madison sold the Montpelier estate. Jennings was retained as Mrs. Madison’s personal servant, however was sold to pay off debt in 1848. Shortly after, he was purchased and freed by Massachusetts senator Daniel Webster.</p> <p>Jennings was freed in Washington, D.C., home to one of the largest populations of free people of color in the United States. Almost immediately, Jennings began working with white abolitionists to arrange one of the largest – albeit unsuccessful – slave revolts in the United States. In April 1848, 77 slaves were sent aboard the schooner <em>Pearl </em>to freedom in the north. Although obviously opposed to slavery, Jennings seemed to harbor no ill-will to his former owners. Jennings described James Madison as “one of the best men that ever lived,” and Dolley Madison as “a remarkably fine woman” in his memoir.</p> <p>Through working in the Pension Office, a unit of the Department of the Interior, Jennings was able to save enough money to purchase a home in Washington. His colleague, John Brooks Russell, found his story of life as a slave in the White House fascinating, and first recorded the story for publication in the January 1863 issue of <em>Historical Magazine and Notes and queries concerning the Antiquities, History and Biography of America. </em>Brooklyn publisher George C. Beadle published the story as a memoir in 1865.  </p>",

            "bodyText": "When European <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/colonization-and-settlement.htm\">colonizers </a>first landed on the shores of Mount Desert Island, the <em>sakom </em>(sagamore or chieftain) of the greater Mount Desert Island area was recorded as Chief Asticou. <br /> <br /> He is first mentioned in a 1608 English document as headman of an Indian village on what became known as the River of Mount Desert – later segmented and renamed Union River, Union Bay River and Blue Hill Bay. Five years later, his name appears in French records as the sakom who welcomed the French to his summer village on the southeastern shore of Somes Sound (near present-day Acadia National Park). Of course, Asticou and his people lived a whole and complete life outside of European documentation. As was typical of European colonizer documentation,much of what is recorded about 'Chief Asticou,' including his name, may be incorrect.<br /> <br /> In his paper, <em>Naming the Dawnland, </em>George Neptune (Passamaquoddy) shares, \"According to native speakers, Astuwikuk is a location near Northeast Harbor. The root of the place name, astuwi, is translated as “moving toward each other,” “coming into contact with each other,” or “face-to-face.” The ending kuk denotes a place, so astuwikuk can be defined as “meeting place....Based on the survival of the place name, I propose that Astuwikuk may not have been the Chief’s name, but the name of the location he represented.\"<br /> <br /> As sakom of an Algonquin-speaking community inhabiting the Mount Desert Island area, Asticou headed a district that formed part of a political confederacy known as Mawooshen. Headed by a grandchief, Bashaba of Penobscot, this was an inter-tribal alliance of neighboring <a href=\"https://www.abbemuseum.org/about-the-wabanaki-nations\">Wabanaki </a>groups in Maine, each with their own districts and headed by their own chiefs. Complex family relationships, political negotiations, and trade networks existed between these districts. Chiefs like Asticou always headed a much larger extended family and several closely related families formed clusters sometimes identified as clans or kin-groups. Chief Asticou was the son of Chief Bashabez. Chief Asticou, like many Chiefs of his time, obtained his position through his father.  <br /> <br /> After Bashabez's death in 1615, Chief Asticou of the Mount Desert Island area became his successor in a time of growing turmoil. Chief Asticou's domain included not only Mount Desert Island, but also its hinterland encompassing the Sullivan and Union River drainages. (Sullivan River runs into Frenchman Bay on the east side of Mount Desert Island, and Union River flows into Blue Hill Bay on the island’s west side). Asticou’s district stretched beyond the Schoodic Peninsula as far east as the Narraguagus River, and probably west of Naskeag Point to the Benjamin River, and from there inland. This eastern territory was important for thousands of years of trade and transportation, and in the 1600s, due to the contact with European colonizers.<br /> <br /> Within a few decades of contact by Europeans, up to 90 percent of the Wabanaki perished in this American Indian holocaust. We do not know if Chief Asticou survived the onslaught. Two major waves of European diseases swept the Wabanaki homeland from 1616 to 1619 and then again from 1632 to 1634. It is unknown of Chief Asticou was killed by these diseases or died of other means. He was recorded 'sick unto death' in a French document dated 1616. Another French document recorded \"When we arrived at Asticou’s cabins [at Manchester Point, on the eastern shore of Somes Sound], we found him truly sick. But not unto death, for it was only a cold that troubled him; so having assured ourselves of his good condition, we had plenty of leisure to go and visit this place...\" English colonial attacks on French settlements within Asticou's demand also took place around this time. it is possible that Chief Asticou survived for his name is the first in a group of six \"Sagamores to the East and North-east\" recorded by English setter William Wood's 1634 documentation.<br /> <br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/wabanaki-people.htm\">Asticou's Island Domain</a>. <br /> <a href=\"https://www.abbemuseum.org/educatorhub\">Naming the Dawnland, by George Neptune</a>, Passamaquoddy.

Enslaved at birth, Young gained his freedom in 1847, and through the success of his business became one of the wealthiest men in Independence, Missouri. <br /> <br /> Young opened his business in 1851 on North Liberty Street in Independence. The modest wagon shop eventually evolved into a large operation, with census records indicating that Young completed 6,000 yokes and 300 wagons in 1860. Young’s wagons were popular on the trails, built to haul around 6,000 pounds. To keep up with demand at the height of his business’s success, Young employed between 50-60 men. <br /> <br /> In 1861, Young’s business was devastated as Civil War tensions along the Kansas-Missouri border forced Young and his family to flee from the area. Though he maintained his business in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the loss of business caused by the war was significant. He filed a lawsuit against the US government for war-related losses but passed away before it was resolved. After the war, his family returned to Independence where he started the first local school for African American children and was a founding member of Saint Paul’s African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. </p> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Learn more about National Historic Trails</a></h3>",

Annetta Johnson Saint-Gaudens (1869-1943) was a sculptor, activist, and member of the Cornish Art Colony.</strong></h4> <p><br /> Creating ideal works and portraits, Annetta often worked in relief and terra cotta miniatures. She is best remembered in New Hampshire for the bronze birdbath, now in the Meriden Bird Sanctuary, that she made to commemorate the presentation of Percy MacKaye’s <i>Sanctuary: A Bird Masque</i>. In 1913, she was awarded the MacMillan Prize from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and exhibited seven works in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. <br /> <br /> Annetta Johnson began her art training at the Columbus Art School before coming to New York to study at the Art Students League. Instructor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/augustus-saint-gaudens.htm\">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> identified her “as a student of the right feeling and with a firm foundation for sincere work” and asked the promising young artist to join his studio in 1894. For two years, she assisted the prominent sculptor create the <i>General Logan Monument</i> to be installed in Chicago.<br /> <br /> Annetta Johnson also worked alongside Louis Saint-Gaudens, brother to Augustus and fellow sculptor himself, whom she married in 1898. The couple then moved to Ohio and gave birth to their son, Paul. At the request of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the three joined him in Cornish, New Hampshire in 1902. The family continued to summer there after her brother-in-law’s death in 1907 where she assisted her husband complete commissions and created ceramic and terra cotta pottery pieces herself. Aside from her original works, Annetta became the primary assistant to Louis and played important roles in the creation of sculptures attributed to her husband. This including modeling portions of <i>Electricity</i> at Union Station in Washington, DC and the final carving of <i>Painting</i> at the St. Louis Art Museum. <br /> <br /> Throughout her life, Annetta remained a reformer and activist. She was a member of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and the Equal Suffrage League in Cornish. In the last decade of her life, she advocated for international peacebuilding institutions writing that “No people wish war. They are driven by fear and abnormal appeals to their loyalty to country rather than humanity.” Her sculpture <i>Salvation</i> depicts a Christ-like figure rising above the suffering of militarism and alcohol.<br /> <br /> She eventually moved to California where she continued sculpting and worked as an art educator. In 1927, she described her work in a public school, “I am teaching because of the tradition back of me. Surely the years of study and training that I have had ought to be given toward the upbuilding of the real American art, which may come with a younger generation. I have given them all they could take. They are not ready for very much. But then, nothing of value comes quickly nor easily.”<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/saga/learn/historyculture/artists-associated-with-saint-gaudens.htm\">Link to page</a> with example of her art.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Siddons Mowbray, Daniel Chester French, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens at the Art Student’s League, 1896-1898. <br /> <br /> In 1901 she started assisting Saint-Gaudens in Cornish, NH. When the Cornish Large Studio burned in 1904, Ward dragged a ladder to the side of the completely clay model of the <i>Charles Parnell Monument</i> and wrested the head off of it, thus saving the most important part of the piece from the flames. She was also instrumental in the completion of the statue of General Sherman and <i>“The Seated Lincoln.”</i> After Saint-Gaudens died in 1907, she completed several unfinished works including the tomb for George F. Baker. Augusta Saint-Gaudens, wife of the late executive sculptor, formed a warm personal relationship with Elsie Ward, inviting her to stay in her guestroom.<br /> <br /> Her own works include the <i>Women’s Christian Temperance Union Drinking Foundation</i> and the <i>George Roger Clark Statue</i>, both executed in plaster for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and the <i>Schermerhorn Memorial Font</i> in the Chapel of our Saviour in Denver, Colorado. Her work, <i>Boy Teasing a Frog</i>, won a bronze medal at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition and was included in an exhibition of Cornish artists at Dartmouth College in 1916.<br /> <br /> She married another former assistant to Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Henry Hering, in 1910 and the two moved to New York City. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/saga/learn/historyculture/artists-associated-with-saint-gaudens.htm\">Link to a page</a> with an example of her art.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Grimes was an artist best known for her marble portrait busts and delicate low relief sculptures. Aside from her own pieces, she also worked as a studio assistant for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/augustus-saint-gaudens.htm\">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> and saw to completion some of his unfinished commissions after his death.</h4> <p><br /> The daughter of two physicians, Grimes displayed an early interest in art. As a young adult, she enrolled in the ‘Normal Art Course’ at Pratt Art Institute in Brooklyn. After graduating in 1894, she worked as a studio assistant to her former modeling instructor, Herbert Adams. He thought very highly of his former pupil and considered her \"the best marble-cutter in America.\" Through Adams, Grimes met Augustus Saint-Gaudens and became his principle assistant and confidante from 1900 until 1907. Saint-Gaudens believed that “there was no one on whose fidelity to his own mind’s wish he could so wholly rely.” She assisted Saint-Gaudens with <i>The Pilgrim</i> and remained in the studio for a year after his death to finish the uncompleted <i>Phillips Brooks Monument </i>at Trinity Church, Boston. She also executed the remaining caryatids which adorn the Albright (Knox) Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York.<br /> <br /> She established her own studio in New York where she completed many portrait commissions. In 1911, Grimes completed a bust of Bishop Potter for Grace Church in New York City. Several years later, she executed a relief evoking the Legend of Sleepy Hollow for the Washington Irving High School (now the Washington Irving Campus) in Manhattan. Grimes was recognized by the National Sculpture Society, 1915 Panama-Pacific Exhibition, and National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors.<br /> <br /> Grimes was a strong advocate for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">women’s suffrage</a> and other reform causes in both New Hampshire and New York City.<br /> <br /> While the group of well-known artists in Cornish largely dissolved later in her life, Grimes retained strong connections to the community. She regularly summered in Cornish by the 1920s, served as a trustee of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, and consulted on the display of Saint-Gaudens’ work at his former estate. Her late in life interviews and writing life shed light on the history of the Cornish Colony. She died at the age of 94 in New York and is buried in Cornish.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/saga/learn/historyculture/artists-associated-with-saint-gaudens.htm\">Link to a page</a> with an example of her art.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

            "bodyText": "<h4>“I think all of us who worked with Louis felt there was lodged in him a knowledge of what was completely right, completely beautiful,” remembered fellow sculptor Frances Grimes. Louis St. Gaudens was a gifted sculptor who also often assisted his well-known brother, Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</h4> <p><br /> Notable works by Louis St. Gaudens’ include two marble lions at the stairway of the Boston Public Library (1889-1890) and a figure of the Greek poet, Homer, in the Rotunda of the Library of Congress (1896). Every day, hundreds of travelers walk beneath his army of heroic figures in the interior and exterior of Union Station in Washington, DC (erected 1913). Beginning in 1905, he created three versions of Roman soldiers bearing shields representing the then-46 states. St. Gaudens also sculpted six allegorical figures for the transit hub near the United States Capitol: Fire, Electricity, Freedom, Inventive Imagination, Agriculture, and Mechanics.<br /> <br /> The career and personal life of Louis St. Gaudens was deeply entwined with his elder brother. He began working with Augustus in cameo cutting in New York and later followed his brother to Rome where Augustus’ studio was located. St. Gaudens began courses at the French Academy and, like his brother, soon continued studies at the Ecoles de Beaux Art from 1879 to 1880. In the early days of their artistic careers, Louis St. Gaudens assisted Augustus in decorations for the Cornelius Vanderbilt II house (1881-1883) and the Admiral David Glasgow Farragut Memorial (1877-1880).<br /> <br /> Unlike the elaborate operation of his brother’s studio, Louis St. Gaudens remained largely indifferent to the commercial pressures of gaining and completing his own commissions. “He felt no necessity to create what he was capable of imagining,” recounted Grimes. St. Gaudens found stability assisting his brother in New York and in Cornish, New Hampshire. He relied on his familial relations personally and professionally particularly through an ongoing struggle with alcoholism.<br /> <br /> In 1898, Louis St. Gaudens married sculptor Annetta Johnson. The newlyweds then moved to her home in Ohio where they remained until Augustus called the couple to assist him in 1900. St. Gaudens arrived in Cornish ahead of his wife and infant son, Paul and the family rented a nearby home. In 1903, they purchased an eighteenth century Shaker meetinghouse in Enfield, New Hampshire and reconstructed the structure in Cornish.<br /> <br /> While surrounded by his family and other fellow artists, those close to Louis St. Gaudens often noted his forlorn disposition and deep introversion. When walking the close distance to and from his brother’s estate, he often carried an umbrella which “added to the impression he gave of melancholy for it indicated a man who suspected that out of the clearest sky might come a shower,” according to Grimes. There was a “solitude which he could not leave,” she added. Louis died at his home in Cornish from pneumonia in 1913.<br /> <br /> Note: Louis St. Gaudens chose to use the abbreviated version of “Saint” in his last name. His brother, Augustus, more often used “Saint-Gaudens” or “Saint Gaudens”.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <h4>Paul St. Gaudens was an innovative ceramicist and pioneering member of the American art pottery movement of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. As the nephew of the renowned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and son of a sculptors Louis and Annetta St. Gaudens, Paul St. Gaudens started his artistic career at a young age.</h4> <br /> When asked why he did not pursue sculpture like his parents and uncle, St. Gaudens replied, “I don’t think I have just that kind of talent. I’ve always loved to draw, but I think I should choose pottery because it gives you both form and color to experiment with. And, besides, the mechanical and chemical processes are infinitely fascinating.” <a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a><br /> <br /> Paul St. Gaudens was born to Louis and Annetta St. Gaudens on June 15, 1900 in Flint, Ohio. At Augustus Saint-Gaudens’ request, the family migrated to Cornish, New Hampshire in 1902 to assist with Augustus’s studio. Paul St. Gaudens grew up around Cornish and engaged with the surrounding Cornish Colony members as a child. In 1905, at the age of 5, he participated in the ‘Masque of the Golden Bowl’ on the Aspet property. In 1913, St. Gaudens participated in his second masque as a Scarlet Tanager in Percy Mackaye’s ‘Bird Masque,’ which occurred at the Meriden Bird Club Sanctuary in Meriden, New Hampshire. This pivotal performance in the conservation movement was where St. Gaudens cultivated lifelong friendships with his generation of the Cornish Colony.<br /> <br /> Both Paul St. Gaudens and his mother Annetta shared their interest in the ceramic arts and they explored the medium together. In 1918, Paul and Annetta St. Gaudens grew their talents while working with the renowned potter Frank Applegate in Plainfield, NH. In 1921, Paul and Annetta St. Gaudens established their own kiln in Cornish: Orchard Kiln Pottery. The kiln remained in operation from 1921 to 1944.<br /> <br /> St. Gaudens’s artistic training would take him all around the country and beyond. He studied ceramics in many locations including the Museum of Fine Arts School of Drawing and Painting in Boston, the Trenton School of Industrial Arts in New Jersey, and Omar Khayyam Pottery in Chandler, North Carolina under Oscar Batchelder. Paul and Annetta St. Gaudens also travelled Europe in 1922 to gain a deeper understanding for their own practices. The mother-son duo journeyed to London, Paris, Rome, Naples and Florence and visited many pottery workshops and art academies along the way.<br /> <br /> Paul St. Gaudens created a vast scope of work over his lifetime, including ceramic flower pots, tiles, figurines, and plates; many of these reside in the Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park collection today. St. Gaudens mixed his own glazes, creating vibrant colors that are present throughout all his work. He was also deeply interested in Mayan, Persian and African motifs from his travels with his mother.<br /> <br /> In 1936, St. Gaudens married a fellow artist, Margaret Parry. They settled down in Florida, where Margaret worked on her jewelry and Paul and Annetta worked on their ceramics. St. Gaudens also had his own studio in Coconut Grove, Florida: Pelican Pottery. He was very impacted by the death of his mother in 1943 and quietly divorced Margaret in 1948. During the last few years of his life, Paul St. Gaudens wrote many articles and publications that transcribed his technical knowledge and thoughts on the craft. On February 1, 1954, Paul St. Gaudens died from Hodgkin’s Disease.<br />  </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Alice Van Leer Carrick, “The Orchard Potteries,” <i>Country Life</i>, January 1926, p. 50</p>",

            "bodyText": "<h2>Early Life and Education</h2> <br /> Francis Griffith Newlands was born in Natchez, Mississippi, on August 28, 1846. His parents were James and Jessie Newlands, who had both immigrated from Scotland. James Newlands, a doctor trained at Edinburgh, died in 1851. The five children in the Newlands family would be raised in Illinois and Washington, DC.<br /> <br /> Francis attended Yale for one year in 1867 but returned to Washington City to complete his advanced degree. He graduated from Columbian College in 1869. At the time, Columbian College occupied a 46-acre campus on the hill where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/meridian-hill-park.htm\">Meridian Hill Park</a> now sits. Today, Columbian College is known as George Washington University Law School. <h2>Life in the American West and Family</h2> <br /> After being admitted to the bar, Newlands moved to San Francisco, California. In 1874, Newlands married Clara Adelaid Sharon, daughter of Nevada senator William Sharon. The newlyweds moved into the Palace Hotel, San Francisco. In addition, he helped his father-in-law reopen the Bank of California. Francis and Clara had three children and, for a time, the whole family lived in the hotel. Clara, a socialite and heiress, eventually convinced Francis that--elegant as the Palace was--a hotel was no place to raise a family. They moved shortly before Clara died giving birth to their fourth child in 1882. Upon her death, Newlands inherited the Sharon estate making him a millionaire.<br /> <br /> Newlands travelled frequently for business. In 1888, he departed New York and went to England. While there he met and married Edith McAllister who was 14 years younger. When they returned to the United States, they moved to Nevada. The family relocated in the 1890s at least part time to Washington, DC, where Edith McCallister Newlands gave birth to two boys who didn't live long past infancy.  <h2>Developing Northwest Washington, DC</h2> Newlands formed the Chevy Chase Land Company to begin buying up land in northwestern Washington, DC, and Montgomery County, MD. The farmland in the area was no longer arable, so land was being used for other purposes. As a result, he was able to design a \"streetcar suburb\" for Washington. In addition to buying 1700 acres to develop the community, Newlands also chartered the Rock Creek Railway to operate a streetcar line to the new community. The railway opened in 1892 and operated on tracks that had been laid on roads built by The Chevy Chase Land Company. The company had constructed two bridges and five miles of road to connect the capital city to the new suburb.<br /> <br /> A small tributary of Rock Creek was dammed to create Chevy Chase Lake, which supplied water to an electric generating plant. This plant provided electricity to the community and to the railcars. An amusement park that operated on the lake served as a way to draw prospective buyers to the area. Visitors would pay to take the streetcars to the amusement park, which kept money coming in.<br /> <br /> In addition to roads and the amusement park, Newlands made sure the new community had schools, churches, clubs, water, and sewage systems. He designed tree-lined streets and opened a hotel in the area. Groceries and other items were brought by railcar from Washington City for the residents of the community.<br /> <br /> Newlands began to replicate the success of The Chevy Chase Land Company in another location -- Burlingame, California--in 1893. The property had been inherited through his first wife's estate. The Burlingame community started out with a country club and a few 'cottages' before the addition of a train station in 1894. <h2>Community Standards</h2> Newlands and The Chevy Chase Land Company set prices in the new community so high that affluent citizens (primarily White) could afford it at the time. The covenants created forbade the buliding of homes under certain amounts. Between the cost of the land and the building of the homes on the lots, only society members with access to wealth were able to move to the new neighborhood. Immigrants, Jews, and people of color were not welcome at the amusement park or on the rail lines either. <h2>Political Career</h2> Newlands' political career kicked off in 1893, when he represented the state of Nevada. He served for 10 years, during which he created the \"Newlands Resolution,\" The resolution was responsible for creating a new territory out of the Republic of Hawaii in 1898. In addition, he helped pass the Reclamation Act of 1902. This act helped to create the Bureau of Reclamation.<br /> <br /> In 1903, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was a proponent of conservation and supported the protection of national forests under the U.S. Forest Service and pushed for the creation of the National Park Service in 1916 to help manage national park lands.<br /> <br /> Newlands was also an outspoken White supremacist and promoted those beliefs. He actively sought to repeal the 15th Amendment, which had given African-American men the right to vote. In a 1909 journal article published in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Newlands argued that the country should develop policies to return all Black people to Africa or the Caribbean. He went on to argue that immigrants from Asian countries would take over the West Coast and used stereotypical langauge and beliefs to describe them. He advocated that the United States should be a \"homeland for whites.\" A 1912 <em>New York Times</em> article quoted him as saying, \"“I believe this should be a white man’s country and that we should frankly express our determination that it shall be.\" In addition to promoting the repeal of the 15th Amendment, Newlands proposed a \"White Plank\" which would restrict immigration to Whites only.<br /> <br /> Newlands died in Washington, DC, on December 24, 1917, of heart failure. <h2>Memorialization</h2> In 1932, Congress authorized the construction of a fountain in Chevy Chase Circle. Funds were provided by Edith McCallister Newlands and, in 1938, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/senator-newlands-memorial.htm\">fountain</a> was dedicated as a memorial to Senator Newlands. <br /> <br /> Some people believe the fountain has become a symbol of racial discrimination and injustice, and that Newlands' name should be removed from the fountain. ",

When George Washington was born in 1732, the property was known as \"Popes Creek Plantation.\" In the 1760s, it was renamed \"Wakefield.\"<br /> <br /> In 1932, Superintendent Hough hired Johnson to, \"tend to the tobacco crop\" beginning the following spring. This began a roughly 10-year working relationship between Hough and Johnson. During this period, Johnson, who by then was in his 70s or 80s, would start each workday by walking five miles to the park. He would tend to the tobacco and later, cotton, and ground peas (peanuts) crops, and speak to park visitors about his recollections of being enslaved. At the end of each workday, he would then walk five miles home. <br /> <br /> Johnson claimed to have been born on \"Wakefield,\" and was believed to be the last living \"Wakefield\" slave. Although Johnson worked at the park during a time of Jim Crow laws in the South and was subjected to the racial biases of the era, from surviving accounts, Johnson enjoyed his time working at the park and meeting people from around the world.<br /> <br /> Johnson’s relationship with the park lasted from 1932 until the early 1940s. It is known by May 15, 1947, Annanias Johnson had died. Superintendent Hough lamented his death in his Superintendent’s Monthly Report for that month. In his report, Hough had this to say about Johnson, “Annanias Johnson, the last “Wakefield” slave has passed away. According to the best information he had, underestimated his age by ten years, and was in fact 96 years old. He was born a slave on “Wakefield” farm and worked its acres, most of his life…He worked for the monument from 1932 until 1940 when blindness obliged him to stop.”<br /> <br /> Annanias Johnson is buried in Westmoreland County, not far from where he was born, lived, and worked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> [Information taken from George Washington Birthplace National Monument Administrative History 1930 - 2000 by Seth Bruggeman]",

            "bodyText": "<p>Albert Bierstadt was born in Solingen, Prussia (modern Germany) on January 7, 1830. At the age of two, his family moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where his father found work as a cooper. Primarily self-taught, Bierstadt advertised his services as a drawing instructor in 1850. Three years later he departed for Europe to obtain formal instruction. Arriving at Dusseldorf, he studied with the American painters Emanuel Leutze (1816-1868) and Worthington Whittredge (1820-1910). After three years, Bierstadt joined Whittredge on an extended sketching tour through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. He returned to New Bedford in 1857 a technically mature painter.</p> <p>He made his New York debut when, in 1858, he contributed a large painting of Lake Lucerne and the Swiss Alps to the annual exhibition at the National Academy of Design. Critics were favorable, impressed with Bierstadt's technical expertise. Soon after, he was elected an honorary member of the academy.</p> <p>In 1859, Bierstadt joined Frederick W. Lander's survey party bound for the Rocky Mountains. While on tour, Bierstadt took countless photographs and drafted the many sketches that would become the studies for massive paintings depicting the American west.</p> <p>Upon his return, Bierstadt moved to New York, established himself in the Tenth Street Studio Building, and began to exhibit his paintings of the west. These canvases, immense in scale and grandiose in effect, would soon make his reputation. Bierstadt exhibited at the Boston Athenaeum, the Brooklyn Art Association, and the Boston Art Club. His paintings found their way into public and private collections at staggeringly high prices for his time.</p> <p>In 1863, Bierstadt traveled to the Pacific Coast where he spent several weeks in Yosemite Valley painting and sketching studies he would later use to compose several of his most important paintings. From California, he continued north through Oregon to the Columbia River, making studies of the landscape. By the end of the decade, Bierstadt completed a remarkable series of large scale paintings that secured his position as the premier painter of the American west.</p> <p>In 1867 Bierstadt was invited to exhibit two of his most important paintings, privately before Queen Victoria. He remained in Europe for more than two years, traveling, sketching, and cultivating a European market for his work.</p> <p>In 1871 he returned to California, where he stayed two years, painting views of the Sierra Nevada, including Yosemite. Though Bierstadt continued to maintain his New York studio and travel widely in the, he found new subject matter in the tropics during visits with his wife, who suffered from consumption and was advised to spend winter months in a warm climate.</p> <p>Bierstadt’s last trip west was in 1889. Changing tastes in the 1880s brought a decline in the popularity of his art, and he narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1895. His entry for the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris—<i>The Last of the Buffalo</i>—was rejected, described as too large, but more likely judged old-fashioned. This event marked the end of Bierstadt's series of monumental western landscapes. He died suddenly in New York on February 18, 1902, largely forgotten.<br />  </p> <hr /> <p><strong>Sources</strong></p> <p>National Gallery of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University, a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/founding.htm\">founder </a>of Acadia National Park, father to two other prominent players in Acadia's history, summer resident, philanthropist, Eugenicist. <br /> <br /> Charles W. Eliot was born into a wealthy Boston family and graduated from Harvard in 1853. He was bright and ambitious and taught there until 1863. He traveled in Europe and studied education and business methods there. Early in 1869, Eliot published his ideas about reforming American higher education in The Atlantic Monthly. “We are fighting a wilderness, physical and moral,” he declared in setting forth his vision of the American university, “for this fight we must be trained and armed.” The articles resonated powerfully with the businessmen who controlled the Harvard Corporation, and shortly after their appearance, he was elected at 35 as the youngest president in the history of the nation’s oldest university. <br /> <br /> An often untold story surrounding President Eliot, was his involvement in the Eugenics movement which used unscientific and racially biased views to advocate for a reproductive approach to human populations to increase the occurrence of 'desirable' human characteristics. Eliot was a prominent voice in the Eugenics movement due to his position at Harvard University. The eugenics movement had various intersections with the conservation movement and founding of the national parks, which continue to be explored and researched today.</p> <h3>Inspiration</h3> <p>As impressive as his early years in education were, for us he is best known for his role in the creation of Acadia National Park. A summer resident of Mount Desert Island, Eliot found an article by his deceased son Charles for Garden and Forest, noting the increase in private land ownership in Maine might eliminate public access to its scenic beauties: The younger Eliot wrote:<br /> <br /> <em>It is time decisive action was taken, and if the state of Maine should encourage the formation of associations for the purpose of preserving chosen parts of her coast scenery, she would not only do herself honor, but would secure for the future an important element in her material prosperity.</em><br /> <br /> He died at 38 and didn’t have the opportunity to act upon these preservation ideas; his father, however, took decisive action. Charles W. Eliot brought these ideas to Mount Desert Island in 1901, and the wealthy summer community was receptive. Since the 1880s, these summer visitors had organized themselves into public-spirited Village Improvement Societies. Their concerns ranged from sanitation and cultural events to the building of hiking trails. Eliot proposed they create an organization to set aside special lands.</p> <h3>Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations</h3> <p>On September 12, 1901, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/hctpr.htm\">Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations</a> was incorporated for the purpose of “…acquiring, owning and holding lands and other property in Hancock County for free public use.” Donations were slow at first, but the tracts kept growing through the tireless work of the Trustees. Eliot continuously lobbied that every resident should treat the entire island as if it were a park.<br /> <br /> The efforts of the Trustees were not without criticism. The withdrawal of so much land from town tax rolls provoked a challenge in the Maine legislature to repeal the group’s tax-exempt status, which would make the land too expensive to retain. The measure was defeated, but Trustee George Dorr feared they would be challenged again, and he believed the only way to truly protect Trustee lands was to attain national park status. With Eliot’s blessing, Dorr pursued national park status, and in 1916, presented 5,000 acres to the American people in the form of a national monument, penned into existence by President Woodrow Wilson. An act of Congress in 1919 designated the area as the first national park east of the Mississippi River.<br /> <br /> While Charles W. Eliot earlier transformed a provincial college into a preeminent American research university and served the longest term as president in Harvard’s history, his work to honor the vision and ideals of his son developed into a lasting gift for all who live and visit here, preserving for all time pristine and unique landscapes. For that he will be remembered for generations.</p>",

Rockefeller, Jr., one of America's preeminent philanthropists.</p> <p>Born in 1874. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was the fifth child and only son of John D. Rockefeller, the builder of Standard Oil. The elder Rockefeller became America's first billionaire. After graduating from Brown University in 1897, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., joined his father's business, where he learned that making money held little appeal. After 1910 John D. Rockefeller, Jr., devoted his life to philanthropy. With his father, he participated in the creation of notable philanthropic institutions such as the Rockefeller Institute, the General Education Board, and the Rockefeller Foundation. He was the major contributor to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a general purpose foundation. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., is probably best remembered for the sponsorship of the construction of the Rockefeller Center in New York City, funding the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, and donating land in New York City for the United Nations complex.</p> <p>In the field of conservation, Mr. Rockefeller's contributions to national parks are no less important. He purchased and donated thousands of acres of land to parks using finances or foundation grants. For example. through the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, he donated $5 million to buy private lands in the Great Smoky Mountains <i>\"in the beautiful spirit of my mother.\"</i> Acadia, Shenandoah, and Grand Teton national parks also received generous donations of land from Mr. Rockefeller. In the 1920s, when commercial loggers threatened to destroy large stands of sugar pines adjacent to Yosemite, he provided more than $1 million to save 15,000 acres of forest. Mr. Rockefeller financed the construction of museums in Mesa Verde, Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone national parks. In 1972 Congress honored his contributions by creating a memorial parkway between Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, which bears his name. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., symbolizes the philanthropic spirit of many American families, foundations, and individuals that have been vital to the national parks.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Sanford Gifford was born in Greenfield, New York to a prosperous family that supported and encouraged his artistic leanings. He attended Brown University from 1842-1844, but did not graduate, but instead moved to New York City in 1845 to study drawing, perspective and anatomy with British watercolorist and drawing-master, John Rubens Smith. He also attended anatomy classes at the Crosby Street Medical college and took drawing classes at the National Academy of Design. Under Smith, Gifford trained to be a portrait painter, but inspired by the work of Thomas Cole, redirected his attention toward landscapes.</p> <p>Gifford spent the summer of 1846 touring and sketching in the Shawangunk, Catskill, and Berkshire mountains. By 1847, he had begun to show his work at the American Art-Union and the National Academy of Design in New York, where he was elected an associate in 1850 and an academician in 1854.</p> <p>In 1855, Gifford spent two-and-a-half years in England, Scotland, France, the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, studying art and sketching. While there, Gifford painted his first major work, <i>Lake Nemi</i> (Toledo Museum of Art), establishing his reputation as a master of light and atmosphere.</p> <p>When he returned to the United States in 1857, Gifford rented rooms at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City where Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Church, and several other landscape painters became his neighbors. Over the next few years, he made regular summer sketching trips to the Catskills and the Adirondacks in New York, the Green Mountains in Vermont, and the White Mountains in New Hampshire and Maine. During the early years of the Civil War, Gifford served in New York's Seventh Regiment as a national guardsman stationed in defense of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in the summers of 1861–63. Gifford’s reputation rose rapidly through the Civil War years, during which time he created some of his masterworks amidst service in the war. Soon after, two of Gifford's paintings were chosen, along with one by Winslow Homer, to represent American art at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867.</p> <p>In 1868 Gifford went abroad for a second and last time, spending more than a year traveling in Europe and the Middle East. In 1870 Gifford visited Colorado with Worthington Whittredge and John Frederick Kensett, and accompanied a United States Geological party under Dr. Hayden in the exploration of Wyoming, Utah, and the Colorado Territories. Gifford then continued along the Northwest Coast, traveling through California, Oregon, British Columbia, and Alaska, producing only a few western landscape subjects.</p> <p>Gifford died from respiratory ailment in 1880. A founder of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870, Gifford was honored by the institution’s first monographic retrospective in 1881.<br />  </p> <hr /> <p><em><strong>Sources</strong></em></p> <p>National Gallery of Art</p> <p>Smithsonian American Art Museum (Avery and Kelly, eds., Hudson River School Visions: The Landscapes of Sanford R.

How many of them wonder about the story of the man on the plaque, Waldron Bates?</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Bostonian. Harvard graduate. Lawyer. Pathmaker. Pathmaker? How and why did Mr. Bates become known as a pathmaker? Bates began exploring Mount Desert Island in the 1880s during family trips. An active sportsman, he wrote articles for fish and game publications, toured Yellowstone Park in 1889, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Kebo Valley Golf Club. Like many others at the turn of the century (and today as well), he came to love this island and dedicated much of his life to making it better. Nowhere is this more evident than in his energetic devotion to hiking trails.<br /> <br /> From 1900 to 1909, Bates was chairman of the Path Committee of the Bar Harbor Village Improvement Association (VIA). Beginning in the 1890s, VIAs in each of the four island towns created most of the island’s hiking trail system we know today. Twenty-five miles of trails were added under Bates’ leadership, among them the Giant Slide, Canon Brook, Gorham Mountain, and Cadillac Cliffs Trails. The hiking map you use today is a direct descendant of the very first comprehensive island path map published in 1896; the lead author of that map was Waldron Bates.</p> <h3>Trails</h3> <p>We don’t know if Bates worked on trails himself (local men were usually hired), but we do know he wrote the first trail handbook for those men, establishing construction and maintenance standards. One standard he developed was for building cairns in a unique style we now call the Bates cairn. Acadia National Park is re-establishing this simple and historic style of cairn on the many east-side trails developed by this trail pioneer.<br /> <br /> You can help us recover and retain this little piece of history. Please do not add to or build cairns or other rock objects. With thousands more hikers today than in Bates’ era, tampering with rocks is damaging to the mountain environment. Leaving rocks where you find them preserves thin and fragile mountain soil, vegetation, and a more natural landscape.<br /> <br /> Waldron Bates died tragically in 1909 at age 52 in a train accident, but his legacy of paths continues. So the next time you hike the Gorham Mountain Trail, tip your hat to the pathmaker on the plaque, Waldron Bates, and say thanks.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Ethel C. Mackenzie was a white suffragist from California who married a Scottish national. When she tried to register to vote, officials turned her away. Under a 1907 law called the Expatriation Act, American women lost their own citizenship if they married men who were not U.S. citizens. In 1915, Mackenzie's challenge to the law went to the Supreme Court.</p> <hr /> <p><strong><em>What does it mean to belong to a country?</em></strong></p> <hr /> <h4>Early Life</h4> <p>Ethel Coope was born in Woodside, California on March 12, 1885. Her parents J.F. and Bertha Coope were wealthy, white landowners in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. J.F. Coope was also a member of the Sempervirens Club, in which he and other wealthy, white men worked to “Save the Redwoods” and other natural resources. During the early 1900s, many wealthy, white Californians supported the conservation of the redwoods, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/how-women-saved-muir-woods.htm\">women in the California Club</a>. Their efforts led to the creation of Big Basin Redwoods State Park.[1]<br /> <br /> Ethel grew up in San Francisco and studied music.[2] On August 14, 1909, she married Mackenzie Gordon, a professional singer from Scotland and member of San Francisco’s elite Bohemian Club and Family Club.[3] The couple had one child, Mackenzie Gordon, Jr.<br /> <br /> While living in San Francisco, Ethel Coope Mackenzie became involved in the woman’s suffrage movement. She joined the Club Woman’s Franchise League around 1911, the same year that Californians narrowly approved women's suffrage.</p> <h4>The Expatriation Act</h4> <p>After the referendum passed, Mackenzie tried to register to vote in January 1913. Local election officials rejected her application due to her marriage to a “foreign alien.” They based their decision on the Expatriation Act of 1907. Under this law, any American woman who married a man who was not a U.S. citizen took on the nationality of her husband, and consequently lost her citizenship. On the other hand, American men could marry non-citizen women without losing their U.S. citizenship. Furthermore, non-citizen wives took on the nationality of their American husbands.<br /> <br /> The Expatriation Act was based on coverture, a common law precedent from the Middle Ages that linked a woman’s legal status to her husband. Under coverture, courts considered a husband and wife to be one legal \"person.\" As a result, they could not be citizens of two different states. Coverture had also prevented married women from owning property and entering into contracts. Women's rights activists had criticized it for decades.<br /> <br /> Under the Expatriation Act, Ethel Mackenzie could only regain her rights if her husband chose to naturalize. Although Mackenzie Gordon had lived in the United States for many years, he had not applied for citizenship.</p> <h4><em>Mackenzie v. Hare et al., Board of Election of San Francisco</em></h4> <p>Ethel Mackenzie sued San Francisco’s Election Commissioners to register as a voter. She based her argument on the Fourteenth Amendment’s natural-born citizen clause, which states that anyone who is born in the U.S. is automatically a U.S. citizen. Mackenzie argued that her citizenship “became a right, privilege, and immunity which could not be taken away from her except as a punishment for crime or by voluntary expatriation.”<br /> <br /> When the California courts rejected Mackenzie’s argument, she took her case the Supreme Court of the United States. But in 1915, the Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts that the Expatriation Act was constitutional. The Court viewed a married couple as a legal entity represented by the husband. Furthermore, Mackenzie’s decision to marry her husband was equivalent to “voluntary expatriation.”<br /> <br /> Despite her frustration with the decision, Mackenzie urged her husband to naturalize, so that she could regain her citizenship and right to vote in state elections.</p> <h4>Independent Citizenship and Women’s Suffrage</h4> <p>Mackenzie v. Hare gained significant attention from local and national newspapers. Reporters portrayed Mackenzie as an advocate for American women. They also repeated attorneys’ claims that the case would be as significant as the pre-Civil War decision <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jeff/planyourvisit/dredscott.htm\">Dred Scott v. Sanford</a></em>. The press helped Mackenzie to rally support for married women’s independent citizenship among women’s suffragists.<br /> <br /> After the ratification of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">Nineteenth Amendment</a> in 1920, the League of Women Voters sought to help women regain their citizenship and voting rights. The League lobbied for the Cable Act, or Married Women’s Independent Nationality Act, which partially repealed the Expatriation Act in 1922.<br /> <br /> Under the Cable Act, white and Black American women who married white or Black foreign men could reapply for naturalization. Yet, American women still lost their citizenship if they married men who were ineligible for citizenship. Under the Immigration Act of 1924, all Asian immigrants were considered “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” As a result, Asian American women who married Asian men did not only lose their citizenship, but also became ineligible to reapply for it. Several states also had anti-miscegenation laws that prevented interracial marriage.</p> <h4>Later Life</h4> <p>On March 8, 1916, Mackenzie Gordon applied for U.S. citizenship. When his application was accepted, Ethel Mackenzie’s citizenship and associated rights were automatically restored. After the passage of the Cable Act, she told the press: </p> <blockquote> <p>“I am glad that an injustice to women has at last been recognized. By gradual unfoldment women are winning equal rights with men. My fight was not brought for personal motives. It was a matter of principle with me. I feel that my fight was not in vain.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Mackenzie remained a wealthy socialite in San Francisco. She traveled with her husband and mother to their winter home in Arizona. Mackenzie eventually moved to Palo Alto, California, where she died on April 4, 1959.<br />  </p> <h4>Places of Ethel C. Mackenzie</h4> <p>[1] The Headquarters Administration Building of Big Basin Redwoods State Park was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.<br /> [2] San Francisco is part of the Certified Local Government (CLG) program. CLGs partner with the National Park Service to promote local preservation.<br /> [3] The Family Club building is a contributing property within the Lower Nob Hill Apartment Hotel District. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Brown, Tanya Ballard. “That Time American Women Lost Their Citizenship Because They Married Foreigners.” NPR Code Switch (podcast).

She steered Mesa Verde National Park to implement a rich and complex interpretive program before leading critical archeological and stabilization work at Pecos National Monument.<br /> <br /> Jean was born in Miami, Arizona. She graduated <em>cum laude</em> with a degree in Anthropology and Archaeology in June 1933 from the University of Arizona, then earned her Master's degree in archeology there in 1936. After graduation, Jean went to work at the National Park Service. Her first assignment for NPS was Museum Assistant at Mesa Verde National Park in 1939, for which she was selected from the Civil Service Register of Junior Park Archaeologists.<br /> <br /> Jean married Addison Pinkley, the son of Frank \"Boss\" Pinkley of the Southwestern National Monuments, in 1942. Jean left her NPS position to accompany Addison when he joined the Navy. In 1943, Addison was killed when Japanese forces destroyed his submarine.<br /> <br /> Returning to Mesa Verde, where she worked for the next 26 years, Jean was selected over a number of men to become Chief of the Interpretive Division. Her responsibilities covered all aspects of park interpretation, including advising the Superintendent, supervising research about the park, operating museums, creating exhibits and visitor programs, and excavation and stabilization of Mesa Verde's ruins. She participated in and coauthored a report on one excavation led by James A. Lancaster, the chief of maintenance. She directed the interpretive program through profound changes at the park and American society, including the post-World War II era and Mission 66. Between 1946-1959, Jean contributed to the development of the archeology museum at Mesa Verde, which featured a broader presentation of the people who had lived in the area. She played a significant role in planning and carrying out the Wetherill Mesa Archeological Project, a joint undertaking of the National Park Service and the National Geographic Society.<br /> <br /> In April 1966, after an abrupt reorganization at Mesa Verde, NPS transferred Jean to the Southwest Archaeological Center. Her first assignment was to supervise the excavation and stabilization of the church and convento of Pecos National Monument. She led excavators to rediscover a large, circa A.D.1600 church which contemporary observers had recorded but which historians had written off as a myth. Interpretation at Pecos was thus enriched by Jean's archeological work.<br /> <br /> In recognition of her outstanding career and her success as a woman in the Federal Service, the First Lady, Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson, invited Jean to lunch at the White House on March 22, 1966. She was the only Federal career woman present, and was honored along with about a dozen other women from other professions in the U.S. and foreign countries. In October, 1967, Jean was given the Department of the Interior's Meritorious Award \"in recognition of outstanding professional archaeological services and contributions to interpretive programs of the National Park Service.\"<br /> <br /> Mrs. Pinkley worked at the Southwest Archaeological Center for the last three years of her life. It was at this desk where she was striken. She died at a hospital a few days later.<br /> <br /> Publications:<br /> <br /> Lancaster, J.A. and J. M.

            "bodyText": "<p>Thomas Cole (1801-1848) was an American artist and early environmentalist. Cole founded the first major art movement of the United States, now known as the Hudson River School of landscape painting. The themes that Cole explored in his art and writings—such as landscape preservation and our conception of nature as a restorative power—are both historic and timely.</p> <p>Thomas Cole was born in 1801 at Bolton, Lancashire in Northwestern England and emigrated with his family to the United States in 1818. During the early years Cole lived for short periods in Philadelphia, Ohio, and Pittsburgh where he worked as an itinerant portrait artist. Although primarily self-taught, Cole worked with members of the Pennsylvania Academy, and his canvases were included in the Academy’s exhibitions.</p> <p>In 1825, Cole discovered the haunting beauty of the Catskill wilderness. His exhibition of small paintings of Catskill landscapes came to the attention of prominent figures on the New York City art scene including Asher B. Durand, who became a life-long friend, and his fame spread. While he was still in his twenties, Cole was made a fellow of the National Academy.</p> <p>In 1829-1831, Cole returned to Britain for study, to attend to family business and to travel to France and Italy. These years were among the most productive of his life. Cole met a large number of wealthy Americans traveling abroad and received numerous commissions from them, increasing his reputation and stature.</p> <p>Cole returned to New York City in November of 1832 and mounted an exhibition of his European paintings, which aroused considerable public interest. Shortly thereafter, Cole first established his rural studio in Catskill, New York, when he rented a small outbuilding at Cedar Grove, now the Thomas Cole National Historic Site. There, he met the Bartow/Thomson family, who resided at Cedar Grove.</p> <p>It was during this period that Cole began his relationship with Luman Reed. A native of Coxsackie, New York, Reed was a successful local merchant who had moved to New York City and opened a private art gallery there. He became Cole’s patron, and for Reed, Cole produced one of his best-known and popular series of paintings, known as “The Course of Empire.”</p> <p>During the winter of 1835-1836, Cole stayed in Catskill working on “The Course of Empire.” During this period Cole began to express strong views concerning the impact of industrial development and its negative consequences for the wild beauty of the Catskills landscapes that were the source of inspiration for his work. The growth of the railroad by “copper-hearted barbarians” was of particular concern. In 1836, both Cole’s father and his patron Luman Reed died, but there was happiness in that year as well.</p> <p>On November 22, 1836, Thomas Cole and Maria Bartow were married at Cedar Grove, which became Cole’s home. The couple was given a suite of rooms on the second floor of the house. Many of the great painters and literary figures of the day began to visit the Coles at their Catskill home. Among the calling cards in the Cole papers of the Albany Institute of History and Art is that of James Fenimore Cooper. On January 1, 1838, the Cole’s first child, Theodore Alexander Cole was born.</p> <p>In March of 1839, Cole agreed to produce four paintings to be known as “The Voyage of Life” for Samuel Ward, a wealthy banker and philanthropist. The price agreed upon was $5000. Ward would die in November of that year without seeing his commission completed in December of 1840.</p> <p>On August 7, 1841, Cole traveled to Europe once more, visiting relatives in England. Again, he visited France and Italy and journeyed to Switzerland. Cole was a welcome and popular guest. He painted a second “Voyage of Life” while in Italy and shipped the series to New York. Cole returned from his second European tour on the steamship “Great Western” in July of 1842.</p> <p>After his return from Europe, Cole made the decision to receive baptism, confirmation and communion in the Episcopal Church and became a member of Saint Luke’s Episcopal Church in Catskill. Cole later designed a new church building for Saint Luke’s and for his friend and eventual biographer, the Reverend Louis L. Noble, the Church Rector.</p> <p>By February of 1843, Thomas Cole was realizing that he had become a public figure and commented on this in his letters. Cole was also having financial troubles. Throughout the subsequent years, he continued to worry about selling his paintings. During this time, a number of Cole letters and poems were published in New York papers and magazines.</p> <p>In May of 1844 Cole agreed to accept Frederic E. Church as a student in his studio. Church’s father agreed to pay $300 per year for young affluent Church’s instruction. This agreement lasted until June, 1846. Room and board was three dollars a week. Cole took on a second student, Benjamin McConkey, on the same terms.</p> <p>In February 1846, Cole began another series of paintings to be called “The Cross and the World.” Cole’s second studio, some distance from the main house, was built during this period and was used by the artist from this time on. Cole designed this building himself, which came to be known as the <em>“New Studio</em>.”</p> <p>On February 6, 1848, the Cole family attended a morning service at Saint Luke’s Episcopal Church in Catskill. After lunch, Cole complained of lassitude and by midnight his condition worsened and the doctor was summoned. An attack of pleurisy and congestion of his lungs followed. Thomas Cole died in the Main House at Cedar Grove at 8 pm on Friday, February 11th, 1848. The funeral was held at Saint Luke’s Church and burial was in the family vault at Cedar Grove on February 15th. Due to extremely cold weather, however, very few friends could attend these last rites. Cole’s body was later moved to the Thomson Street Cemetery.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Nicholas was born circa 1757, to Ryckert and Marytje Huyke Bovee in the British Colony of New York. He had at least five siblings including a sister, Sarah. He was 5 feet 4 inches tall with brown hair.<br /> <br /> While still living with his parents in Hoosick, NY in August of 1776, Bovee first enlisted Captain John Brandt’s Albany County Rangers, and then in Captain Garrett S. Veeder’s Company of the 4<sup>th</sup> NY Regiment. These were likey 3-month terms. At about the same time, a brother-in-law left to serve on behalf of the British. Immediately after Bovee’s second term expired, he reenlisted on January 2, 1777, into Captain Aaron Aorson’s Company of the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment for the duration of the war. This was to be a much shorter term than expected.<br /> <br /> In spring of 1777, the regiment marched up the Mohawk River to be stationed at American Fort Schuyler (formerly Stanwix). As summer set in, British allied forces lead by Walter Butler began to harass the garrison; and on July 3 of that year, Bovee and 16 other men were ambushed while cutting sod for the walls a mile to the west of the fort. One soldier was murdered and mutilated, another wounded mortally, and six captured. Bovee himself was shot twice through his right arm, tomahawked in his right hip, scalped, and left for dead. When he was found a little later by fellow soldiers John J. Schermerhorn, James Lighthall, and Gideon Vanderheyden, they were shocked to see him alive. He was rushed to the fort’s hospital and received treatment by Doctor Hunloke Woodruff. Of his injuries, his hip wound was said to be the worst. The medical treatment for scalping was simple, bandage it and make the victim as comfortable as possible, as infection would surely set in and they'd be dead in a few days. Defying the odds, Bovee survived. <br /> <br /> Just the day after the attack, Colonel Peter Gansevoort, commader of the fort, invoked it in a letter addressed to General Schuyler detailing why the fort needed reinforements. On July 28, Bovee was shipped to Schenectady, NY with the other wounded, sick, women, and children in preparation for an anticipated British attack upon Fort Schuyler (the Siege of 1777). In October of 1777, he was sent to Albany, NY where his mother and an uncle retrieved him. On April 1, 1779, he was placed on the “Invalid Pension” rolls in consequence of his disability and received a total of $60 a year. From that point on his friends and neighbors referred to him as “Sculpennick,” or “Scalped Nick” in Dutch. He suffered from mobility problems for the rest of his life.<br /> <br /> Bovee married Polly Cotrel in White Creek, NY on April 15, 1779, in a small ceremony presided over by Reverend William Waite and attended by Bovee’s mother, sister Sarah, and a brother and some of Polly’s family and friends. His mother was said to have objected to the marriage because of his disability. Despite his new marriage and likely much to his mother’s chagrin, Bovee spent much of the next 18 months at the General Hospital at Albany, still suffering from his injuries. He was not officially discharged until 1781 when New York consolidated its military.<br /> <br /> Bovee and Polly had ten children: Phillip, Elizabeth, Daniel, Jacob, Catharine, Sally, John, Harper, Esther, and Isabel. Philip died in infancy. Over the years they lived in Montgomery County, Mapleton, and Schenectady, NY. He died there on March 11, 1796, at the approximate age of 40. Twenty years later, while being interviewed for a widow’s pension, Polly claimed his death was in direct consequence of the injuries suffered on that fateful July day in 1777. Polly went on to marry another Revolutionary War veteran and was deposed to prove her claim of a widow’s pension. Much of Bovee’s story came from these records.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Alexander Lemmon was born in Ireland around the year 1749. At some point in his younger life, he emigrated to the Colony of New York. He was a weaver by trade but also served as a barber for his fellow soldiers. He was left-handed.  <br /> <br /> In the summer of 1775, at about the age of 26, in Esopus he enlisted as a fifer in the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment commanded by Colonel James Clinton in Captain Elias Hasbrook’s company. From there he marched north, participating in the capture on St. John’s on November 3, 1775, the capture of Montreal on November 13, 1775, and the attack on Quebec, Canada under command of General Richard Montgomery. Montgomery was killed in the attack on the night of December 31, 1775. Lemmon bore scars on his face from gun powder burns suffered during the attack for the rest of his life. Most of the American’s spent that cold winter living in the outskirts of the old city in Quebec before fleeing south the following spring. He continued his original enlistment for two extra months and upon his return to Albany, NY he was discharged.<br /> <br /> A few months later, on January 12, 1777, he reenlisted as a private in the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment in Captain James Gregg’s Company. He and the regiment made their way to Fort Schuyler (Stanwix) in spring of that year. In July, Captain Gregg himself was scalped about a mile from the garrison walls. Gregg was sent to Albany to recover. With two weeks of that attack, the fort was surrounded by a coalition of British forces and allies. They were besieged from August 2 – August 22, 1777. The 3<sup>rd</sup> NY was kept at Fort Schuyler for another year.<br /> <br /> On August 29, 1779, Lemmon fought at the Battle of Newtown (near present-day Elmira, NY), which was part of the larger Sullivan-Clinton Campaign against the western members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. He continued with the regiment as it was consolidated into the 1<sup>st</sup> NY. Some point later took ill and appears to have not traveled with his company to Virginia to participate in the Siege of Yorktown.<br /> <br /> Sometime later he was married and moved west to start a family, settling in Hamilton County, OH, near Cincinnati. He and his wife had at least 6 children (Rachel, Dow, James, Alexander, Mary, and Sam).<br /> <br /> In March of 1818, the U.S. Congress passed “An act to provide for certain persons engaged in the land and Naval Service of the United States during the Revolutionary War,” which allowed for pensions to be given to veterans of the American Revolution. On January 2, 1821, in Hamilton County, OH, Lemmon was deposed to prove his claim. He still lived with his wife and the six children listed, and owed several persons a total of $17. He said stated his eyesight was “failed” and he was unable to continue the practice of weaving and therefore required assistance.<br /> <br /> His claim listed the value of all his belongings at the time. This included:<br /> 1 Mare 13 years old $10.00<br /> 1 Cow and Calf 10.00<br /> 1 Sheep 6.00<br /> 1 Loom & Tackle 12.00<br /> 2 chairs .50<br /> 1 table .50<br /> 1 8 Gallon Kettle 2.00<br /> 1 Dutch oven 1.50<br /> ½ Doz Knives & Forks .50<br /> 2 tin cups .12 ½ cents<br /> 2 Plates .12 ½ cents<br /> <u>1 saw and 6 shoals valued at 4.00</u><br /> Total value of = $47.25<br /> <br /> His pension was granted at a rate of $8 a month for life. He also turned in two letters, written by friends whom he had known during the war, to support his claim.<br /> <br /> David Munroe was a veteran who had met Lemmon in the Hudson highlands. He described Lemmon as a barber and “<em>and from the fact of his using his left hand in his business, he was known in his Regiment by the name of the left handed barber and from his being marked with gunpowder in the face, which deponent then understood and believing, the said Lemmon received in the expedition into Canada under General Montgomery</em>…”<br /> <br /> John Lafler, a batteauxman that met Lemmon at Fort Schuyler in 1777, said of him: “<em>from the circumstances of his being a barber and in consequence of his using his left hand he was called the left handed barber, he was besides an </em><em>Irish</em><em> man, by birth & and a </em><em>humorous</em><em> & eccentric man</em>…”<br /> <br /> <strong>In about 1824, Lemmon passed in Hamilton County, OH. Although not many details of his life are known, the personal descriptions in his story go to show the humanity of all the forgotten soldiers of the American Revolution.</strong><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Below: </strong>An image of Alexander Lemmon's pension deposition record.

            "bodyText": "Adam Paine was born to Black Seminole parents near Alachua, Florida in 1843. He sometimes spelled his first name as Adan.<br /> <br /> During the U.S. government’s Indian removal efforts, from 1830 to 1850, many tribes including Seminole people, were forcibly moved West to Indian Territory, modern-day Oklahoma. The Black Seminoles endured starvation and disenfranchisement as did other native peoples during that time. Upon arrival in Indian Territory, they remained vulnerable to kidnapping and re-enslavement.<br /> <br /> In 1850, this threat became too much for the Black Seminole Indians, including the Paine family. A group led by John Horse and Coacoochee, known as Wild Cat, left Indian Territory and traveled to Mexico, where they could live without fear of re-enslavement. The Mexican government received them warmly and welcomed their help in fighting against Apache and Comanche raiding parties that crossed into Mexico. They also helped fend off bandits and slave raiders attempting to annex parts of Mexico to create a pro-slavery state.<br /> <br /> After 20 years in Mexico, the Black Seminoles were interested in returning to the United States. They hoped to reclaim their land rights set out in original treaties at the time of Indian Removal. Major Zenas R. Bliss of the Twenty-Fifth Infantry encouraged the Black Seminoles to emigrate back to the United States and offered them positions as scouts. <br /> <br /> The first group of Black Seminoles enlisted at Fort Duncan on August 16, 1870. They were led by John Kibbetts. He was appointed sergeant upon enlistment. He gave his name as Sittee Tustenuggee (pronounced as “Sit-tee-tas-to-nachy”), or Snake Warrior when he enlisted. Paine enlisted on November 12, 1873. He was known as be rebellious as he was known to wear a leather headpiece with buffalo horns. The other Black Seminole Indian Scouts called him ‘Bad Man’ as a nickname.<br /> <br /> The scouts quickly adapted to their new environment. Major Bliss said they were “excellent hunters, and trailers, and brave scouts…splendid fighters.” Bliss and other officers were more than happy to give the scouts and their families a place to live in exchange for their skills on the frontier.<br /> <br /> On September 26, 1874, Paine and other Black Seminole Indian Scouts were attached to Colonel R.S. Mackenzie and the Fourth Cavalry. Paine and the scouts tracked a group of Comanches to the Comanche camp in Palo Duro Canyon on the Red River in the panhandle of Texas. They were tracking the Comanches due to being attacked by them the day before. Paine helped the cavalry immobilize the camp. The soldiers and scouts took and destroyed 1,400 horses and well as massive amounts of camp equipment and supplies. After the battle Colonel Mackenzie recommended eight of his white soldiers for the Medal of Honor along with Adam Paine.<br /> <br /> Paine was discharged from the Army on February 19, 1875 at Fort Clark, Texas. He was awarded the Medal of Honor eight months later on October 13. Paine worked as a teamster for the U.S. Quartermaster Department at Fort Brown, Texas in retirement. <br /> <br /> Paine was killed on January 1, 1877 by Sherriff Clarion Windus. Windus was looking for Paine regarding a murder two years earlier. Witness stated Windus “blasted him [Paine] from behind” without asking any questions. Adam Paine was later buried at the Seminole Indian Scout Cemetery in Brackettville, Texas.",

In 1776, he was enlisted by his enslaver into Learned's Brigade (Massachusetts). He was discharged March 1780, at West Point, NY.<br /> <br /> Dunsick and Hannah Venison were married on October 10, 1780 in Hanover, Plymouth, MA. They moved to Maine. In June of 1819, he was deposted while claiming his veteran's pension and two years later he found himself testifying again on his own behalf, for his rightly owed pension. He was eventually awarded a pension of about $8 a month. Years later on September 5, 1835, Dunsick received a bounty of two hundred acres of land, from the State of Maine. <br /> <br /> <strong>Dunsick, men like him, and their forgotten families, stepped out of the fringes to serve a nation that kept them and their descendants in the shadows for nearly another two centuries.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>The following narrative is drawn from his own words recorded in his various pension depositions:<br /> <em>June 1819</em></strong><br /> \"I Prince Bailey the person named in the Pension Application and papers hereunto annexed, testify and say, that when I was about eight years of age, I was stolen from Africa my native country and brought to America; my original name was Prince Dunsick—but on my arrival I was called by my masters name which was, Bailey. By this name of Prince Bailey, I enlisted and served in the Revolutionary War, agreeably to the declaration annexed and was discharged by the same name. I never lived with my old master Bailey afterwards, and resumed my former name of Dunsick. It was this circumstance which led me, accidentally indeed to subscribe my name Prince Dunsick, which is my original name, instead of Prince Bailey under which name I enlisted and served and which name I ought to have written.\"<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Below: </strong>An image of the muster roll recording Dunsick's (Bailey's) discharge in New York. </em><br /> <img alt=\"An old, faded document with a list of handwritten names. \" bailey=\"\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7372706|0|\" prince=\"\" src=\"/fost/images/PrinceDunswick.jpg\" /><br /> <br /> <strong><em>December 13, 1821</em></strong><br /> \"I Prince Bailey of Leeds in the County of Lincoln & Commonwealth of Massachusetts a resident citizen of the United States of America on oath declare that in the month of March AD 1777 at Hanover in said Commonwealth I enlisted into the army of the United States aforesaid on the continental establishment in the company commanded by Capt. Seth Drew in the regiment commanded by Colonel John Bailey in Genl Learned’s Brigade in the Massachusetts line & served in the same in the war of the revolution as a private soldier the term of my enlistment which was three years thereafter at the expiration of which term I received an honorable discharge signed by Col. Bedler, which is since lost.<br /> <br /> \"I further testify that by reason of my reduced circumstances in life I am in need of assistance from my country for support. Wherefore I pray that this application may be transmitted to the Secretary at War to the end that I may be placed on the pension list of the United States agreeably to an Act of Congress passed March 18th 1818, entitled “An Act to provide for certain persons ingaged [engaged] in the land & naval service of the United States in the revolutionary war.<br /> <br /> \"I Prince Bailey, lagged fifty five years—pensioner under the Law of Congress of<br /> March 18th 1818, do upon oath testify and declare that the land thust mentioned in my schedule of the 13th June 1820. I have conveyed to Simeon Rose and Marc Sylvester to whom I was justly indebted. I held this property upon the strength of my pension, from the government, & when it was known that I was stricken from the Pension Roll, my creditors all called upon me, and I was obliged to sell my land, so that I now have no Real Estate, and no personal property except two cows and a few articles of old furniture. All not exceeding thirty dollars in value. I am old and quite infirm, am a native of Africa, having been stolen by the Americans before the Revolutionary War, and taken by them from my native land. I served three years in the war of the Revolution; was in both of the Battles at the taking of Burgoyne; and was in the Battle of Monmouth. I am not nearly past labor upon which I have heretofore depended for support; my wife is also quite feeble and able to do but little labor if I am not again restored to the pension Roll, I must depend upon charity for my support—at the time I was stolen and taken from my native land, I rec’d a severe wound in my head by means of a fall down the vessels hole, which wound very much afflicts me at the present time.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>SOURCE:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://digitalmaine.com/revolutionary_war_me_land_office/44/\">The Penison and Bounty Land Records of Prince Bailey</a></p>",

He was educated at Trinity College in Dublin, but as the son of a British officer who fought in the Seven Years’ War, there was little doubt that he would follow in similar footsteps. Robert Ross enlisted as an officer in the 25<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot in 1789 at 23 years of age. </p> <p>Ross worked his way up the ranks through distinguished service in the Napoleonic Wars, participating in the capture of Alexandria, the Battle of Maida, and was wounded in the Battle of Orthes during the Peninsular War in Spain. By 1814, after 25 years of service, he was elevated to Major General. With the British government looking for experienced officers to lead the troops in the east coast of the United States, he was sent across the Atlantic to serve.</p> <p>Upon arrival in Bermuda in the summer of 1814, Ross was given command of 4,500 troops, and transported to the Chesapeake by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane’s fleet to rendezvous with Rear Admiral George Cockburn. They navigated up the Patuxent River, moving by land, but keeping the Royal Army close by. The army sieged small towns on the march, but Ross’ eyes were firmly set on Washington. The primary mission was to seek retaliation on the capital city for the American invasion and burning of York, Canada the year prior.</p> <p>Ross personally led the victorious sieges, including at the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814. When the invading army arrived in Washington, Ross took command easily, ordering the burning of all public buildings, including the White House, Capitol, and Library of Congress. He was insistent on preserving private property and punished troops that disobeyed that order. Although appreciated by the Americans, it was a controversial order among the British.</p> <p>Upon retreating following the successful attack on Washington, Ross (along with Cochrane and Cockburn) ordered the attack on Baltimore commencing on September 12, 1814. Ross was a popular leader, and always rode out first to lead his men into battle. During the Battle of Baltimore, this bravery and leadership proved fatal. He was killed by American snipers early in the battle.</p> <p>Ross’ body was eventually sent to Canada for burying in British protectorate soil. He is memorialized by an obelisk near his birthplace in Ireland, a monument in St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, and even in the American Capitol – a building he personally ordered destroyed – a portrait honoring him hangs. </p>",

Born in Saratoga, New York, Louis had an African father and a Saint-François Abenaki mother.<sup>1</sup> His parents probably named him Nia-man-rigounant, which means “variegated bird.”<sup>2</sup> In 1745, a joint French-Kahnawà:ke raid took the family captive. The Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke formally adopted the child, and renamed him Akiatonharónkwen, which translates to “he unhangs himself from the group.”<sup>3</sup> He grew up near a Jesuit mission, where he learned to read and write. The young man converted to the Roman Catholic religion and received the name Colonel Louis at his baptism.<sup>4</sup><br /> <br /> “Intelligent, ambitious, and fluent in French, English, and Mohawk, Louis became a prominent chief.”<sup>5 </sup>In the French and Indian War, Louis joined the Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke in their campaigns against the British near Lake George and Lake Champlain. He took up arms again with the revolution, aiding the 1775 Patriot invasion of Quebec, which ultimately failed and forced Louis to retreat with them. He later fought at Oriskany and in the Saratoga Campaign.<br /> <br /> In May 1778, Louis joined the Oneida delegation to Valley Forge. General Steuben’s military secretary Peter Stephen Du Ponceau described walking in a wood near his quarters one morning, only to stumble upon a tall Indian figure in American regimentals singing a fashionable French opera. A surprised Du Ponceau stated, “He would have been a valuable acquisition to the French Opera, where I have never heard a voice of such extraordinary power, and at the same time susceptible of modulation.”<sup>6</sup><br /> <br /> Instead of pursuing a career in opera, Louis continued in his wartime leadership role, where his powerful voice likely aided his oratorial skills. On June 15, 1779, he received a commission of Lieutenant Colonel from the Continental Congress. It remains “the only known commission given to a man of African descent.”<sup>7</sup><br /> <br /> After the American Revolution, Louis convinced the Oneida to lease approximately 5 million acres. He cited the prosperity derived from leases by the Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke. Subsequently, the Oneida leased their land to Colonel John Livingston for 999 years, thinking that they could maintain territorial control as landlords.<sup>8</sup> Yet, the New York government declared the leases invalid, took the land by military force, and then resold it. Despite these losses, Louis continued to represent the Oneida in negotiations between 1792 and 1796.<sup>9</sup><br /> <br /> By then, he had settled in Akwesasne, a Mohawk community in the St. Lawrence valley.<sup>10</sup> Despite his advanced age, Louis fought at the 1814 Battle of Lundy’s Lane, where American forces were defeated when they invaded Canada. He fell from his horse, and later died of his injuries at the approximate age of seventy-four. Louis was buried near Buffalo, New York—with military honors given at his funeral.<sup>11</sup></p> <hr /> <h4>Endnotes</h4> <p>1.

            "bodyText": "<p>Peter Green was born in around 1751 in Africa. He was kidnapped at a young age and enslaved shortly after the end of the French & Indian (Seven Years) War by someone in Massachusetts. It is unknown if Peter Green was his name by birth or by enslavement.<br /> <br /> He was enlisted into the Continental Army in 1779 for the \"duration the war,\" the American Revolution. He served with the 2<sup>nd</sup> NY Regiment in Captain Samuel Pell’s Company until 1783. He was stationed at Fort Schuyler in Spring of 1781 and fought at the Battle of Yorktown in the fall of that year. He was honorably discharged in 1783 and it is believed that he was given his freedom as a result of his service.<br /> <br /> After the war, Green was awarded bounty land by New York State, which he sold shorty after acquiring it to a James Reed, and then moved back to Colrain, MA. In 1818 under “An act to provide for certain persons engaged in the land & naval service of the United States in the Revolutionary War” he petitioned for a military pension, which he was granted.<br /> <br /> He married Violette (also born in Africa and enlsaved) shortly after the American Revolution came to an end and had two sons. Their oldest, Peter Jr., was born on July 3, 1787 just after the war. Their youngest, Charles, was born on January 11, 1791. Both appear to have become blacksmiths. In 1840, Charles took in a ten year old girl as his daughter when her employers attempted to sell her into enslavement. There is a possibility that the couple also had a daughter, Lettie, born around 1789. They had multiple grandchildren.<br /> <br /> Green was still living in Colrain, when he passed in September 1836 at the approximate age of 86. His sons continued to live in Colrain as immediate neigbors until each them passed in the mid-1860s.</p> <h4>Sources:</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=w8GdfTeLv5YC&pg=PP3&lpg=PP3&dq=List+of+Black+servicemen+compiled+from+the+War+Department+collection+of+Revolutionary+War+records.+Compiled+by+Debra+L.+Newman.+Washington+:+National+Archives+and+Records+Service,+General+Services+Administration,+1974.&source=bl&ots=dTwj_dFCOL&sig=ACfU3U28O1-PwggYYiVTA9Yz9f9jcIYJIQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRkOHfivL6AhWGFzQIHaJKCv8Q6AF6BAgbEAM#v=onepage&q=List%20of%20Black%20servicemen%20compiled%20from%20the%20War%20Department%20collection%20of%20Revolutionary%20War%20records.%20Compiled%20by%20Debra%20L.%20Newman.%20Washington%20%3A%20National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Service%2C%20General%20Services%20Administration%2C%201974.&f=false\">List of Black servicemen compiled from the War Department collection of Revolutionary War records.

His father, James Borglum, had immigrated to this country from Denmark a few years earlier. Shortly after Gutzon's birth his family moved to Utah. By the time Borglum was seven they were living in Fremont, Nebraska.</p> <h4>Early Years</h4> <p>Gutzon's interest in art developed early but he didn't receive any formal training until he attended a private school in Kansas. Shortly after being awarded the equivalent of a high school diploma he moved with his family to California. He worked there for a time as a lithographer's apprentice, but after six months he struck out on his own. After opening a small studio, he executed a few noteworthy commissions and gradually made a name for himself. In 1888, he completed a portrait of General John C. Fremont, and this marked an important point in his young career. Not only did it bring him recognition and acclaim; it also earned him the friendship of Jessie Benton Fremont, the General's wife. She encouraged the young artist and helped him sell many of his works. This eventually earned him enough money to pursue studies in Europe.</p> <p>Shortly before his departure for France, Borglum married Elizabeth Putnam, an artist and teacher 20 years his senior. This marriage lasted only a few years. The constant traveling in Europe was too much for Elizabeth; they separated while Borglum was living in England and subsequently divorced.</p> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">The Artist Matures</span> <p>Borglum's two years in Paris were spent studying art at the Julien Academy and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He had successful showings at major Paris salons and developed some valuable friendships, including a close relationship with the great French sculptor, Auguste Rodin, who carved <em>The Thinker</em>. After leaving France, Borglum spent a year in Spain and then returned to California. Three years later in 1896, he once again left for Europe; this time settling in England. Here he achieved some success. Some of his works were displayed at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria. He returned to the United States in 1901.</p> <p>Back in this country, Borglum led a life marked by artistic success, public service, and occasional controversy. During this period he created many of his finest works. His <em>Mares of Diomedes</em> was accepted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He did a large equestrian bronze of General Phil Sheridan which Theodore Roosevelt unveiled in Washington. He also created a memorial to Pickett's Charge on the Gettysburg Battlefield. For Newark, New Jersey, he created the <em>Wars of America</em> memorial and the <em>Seated Lincoln</em>.</p> <p>Sometimes Borglum's art led to controversy. He was commissioned to do some statues for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. One day a clergyman who was visiting the studio commented that one of the angels needed a sterner and more masculine face. This led to a debate over the gender of angels which the press followed with relish. Borglum eventually complied to the request, making the two angels outside the church more manly, however the angels inside remained more feminine. He saved the model of one of the offending faces for himself and later cast it in silver. Years later the story was repeated as evidence of Borglum's temper: in this version he smashed all of his angels and started over. This story was laid to rest by an official of the cathedral, who stated that, \"The angels still stand serene in their places where Gutzon Borglum first placed them.\"</p> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Other Interests</span> <p>Controversy in Borglum's life was not limited to art. He led an active political life, campaigning for Theodore Roosevelt in his reelection bid of 1912. During the First World War, he was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to investigate practices in the aircraft manufacturing industry. He discovered and reported such a scandalous state of affairs that Wilson appointed Chief Justice Hughes to conduct further investigations.</p> <p>During most of this period, Borglum lived near Stamford, Connecticut, where he maintained a home and studio with his second wife Mary Montgomery Borglum, whom he married in 1909. Two children were born of this marriage, James Lincoln and Mary Ellis. He divided his working time between Stamford and New York where he also had a studio. It was in this New York studio that he created a work that was to have far-reaching consequences.</p> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Developing a New Style</span> <p>Since his return to the United States, Borglum had worked to create a distinctly \"American\" art. He began to experiment with the \"emotional impact of volume.\" Out of a large block of marble, he fashioned a colossal head of Abraham Lincoln, The work was completed and taken to a shop window in New York. When Robert Lincoln, the son of the late President, was taken to see the work, he exclaimed, \"I never expected to see father again.\" The bust was later purchased and donated to the people of the United States and placed in the rotunda of the Capitol Building where it remains today.</p> <p>It was the bust of Lincoln that prompted Helen Plane, President of United Daughters of the Confederacy, to contact Borglum about the Possibility of doing a head of Robert E. lee on the side of Stone Mountain in Georgia. He agreed to visit the site in 1915 but upon seeing the size of the place he said, \"Ladies, the head of Lee on the side of that mountain would look like a postage stamp on a barn door!\" Having thus crushed their dream, he proceeded to give them a new one –a large group featuring Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Jefferson Davis on horseback followed by a column of soldiers.</p> <h4>Borglum Carves Mountains</h4> <p>Because of World War I, work at Stone Mountain did not begin until 1923. Carving was limited to jackhammers and chisels until a visiting Belgian engineer taught Borglum the use of dynamite for precise work. The head of Lee was unveiled in 1924. Soldiers in the audience who served with the Confederate leader were moved to tears by the likeness.</p> <p>However, trouble had been brewing between Borglum and the businessmen directing the project, and Borglum was abruptly dismissed. He destroyed his models in order to protect his design and this so angered the directors that a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was forced to flee Georgia. Borglum's head of Lee was removed when another artist was engaged and none of his work survived when the carving was finally finished in 1970. However, the spirit of his original design remains.</p> <p>In 1923, Doane Robinson, the State Historian of South Dakota, read of the Stone Mountain venture and wrote to Borglum about the possibility of doing a mountain carving in the Black Hills. Borglum came to South Dakota in 1924 at the age of 57 and agreed in principle to do the project. His dismissal from Stone Mountain made it possible to return to South Dakota in the summer of 1925 and set in motion the machinery that eventually led to the creation of Mount Rushmore. Work on the sculpture began in 1927. Borglum remained devoted to the project until his death in Chicago following surgery on March 6, 1941, several days before his 74th birthday. He was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California. After his death, the project fell to his son Lincoln who in turn put the finishing touches on his father's vision.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Zopher Hawkins was born on January 24, 1757 to Samuel and Mary (Green Hawkins) on Long Island in New York. He was the middle of five children. On November 21, 1776, he was 19 years old and enlisted as a private at New Haven, CT in the 4<sup>th</sup> NY Regiment Continental Army.<br /> <br /> He spent his first winter as a soldier in with his company at Fiskill, NY. In spring of 1777, Hawkins regiment moved from New York, to New Jersey, to Pennsylvania, and back to New York to participate in the Battle of Saratoga. From their, the regiment moved back to New Jersey and participated in the Battle of Monmouth. The next two years of his service become murky, although he recalled frequently being along the frontier and engaging in skimishes with the Natives and their British Loyalist allies. He likely was remembering the Battle of Newtown, which was part of the larger Sullivan-Clinton Campaign against the Six Nations Confederacy. <br /> <br /> In fall of 1780 he band his company spent the winter at garrisoned Fort Schuyler (Stanwix). On March 2, 1781, a wood chopping party was sent out under Corporal James Betts with a covering party to protect the woodchoppers for a total of sixteen men plus the corporal. They were attacked by Mohawk warrior Joseph Brant and his Loyalist forces, killing William Morpeth, who attempted to resist, and captured the rest of the party including Hawkins.<br /> <br /> Brant understood the value of fear, and keeping his enemies on edge, uncertain and scared. When the captives had been led about three miles from the fort, Brant stopped them, cut the shoe buckles off each of the men’s shoes, and lined them up in the snow. When a rescue party came out from the fort, other than the dead guard, the only trace of the others they found was their shoe buckles lined up in the snow. It was Joseph Brant’s way of reminding those in the fort that he was always out there watching them, and they would never know when or where he might strike at them again. <br /> <br /> Hawkins was taken to the area of Fort Niagara and was kept as a prisoner by members of the Haudenosaunee untll about 1783. During to this time, according to family account, he was taken in by the Natives, took a Native wife, and was allowed to hunt and fish with little supervision while amongst them. After the Treaty of Paris was signed, he made his was back home to Long Island. By some accounts he escaped while on a hunting expedition and was chased for several days, hiding multiple times to escape recapture. Upon his return he was supposedly was more concerned about the state of the family livestock than explaining what had happened to him during the past three years. <br /> <br /> At age 43, he married Julianna Bayles and became father to Moses, Mary, Ruth, Sarah, Elizabeth, and Samuel. In July of 1790, Hawkins was issued 600 acres of bounty land in Hannibal, NY. In October of 1832, he applied for and received a veteran's penision in Suffolk County, NY. In 1851, his estate in Brookhaven, NY was valued at $2,200 for 70 acres of land. <br /> <br /> Hawkins died at the age of 91 in 1847. He is buried in a family cemetery and the inscription on his headstone reads:<br /> <em>He served his country faithfully in the Revolution and was a captive among the Indians for 3 years.<br /> He lived a quiet and peaceful life, was happy and resigned in death.</em><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Below:</strong> An image of Hawkins signature on his 1832 pension deposition.</em><img alt=\"In old, faded handwriting, the name \" hawkins.=\"\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7404724|0|\" src=\"/fost/images/ZophHawkins.jpg\" zopher=\"\" /></p>",

Genevieve in the 1790s, Antoine became involved in a relationship with a mixed-heritage enslaved woman named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/marie-louise-janis.htm\">Marie-Louise</a>. Because of the social norms at the time, this relationship caused the Janis family and local townspeople to become very upset. In January of 1796, Lt. Governor Zenon Trudeau of the Upper Louisiana Territory received a letter from Spanish Governor Carondelet in New Orleans. This letter informed Trudeau of the relationship and claimed that the couple had two children in Ste. Genevieve. He also added that Marie-Louise's enslaver, Vital Bauvais was planning to \"rent\" her to his son-in-law in St. Charles, Missouri. <br /> <br /> Marie-Louise was sent to work in Marie Bauvais’ home on what would become Decatur Street in St. Charles’ Frenchtown (St. Charles was referred to as \"Petite Cotes\" in the historical record). Undeterred by Marie-Louise's relocation, Antoine moved to St. Charles to be close to her. She eventually bought her freedom, likely with money raised by Antoine, and lived with him on a lot adjoining the home of her former enslaver Marie Bauvais. They had eight children, and Antoine became a “Marguillier” (a churchwarden or lay official for the parish) at the newly built St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church. Antoine received several Spanish land grants and was one of the first grand jurors in the American Circuit Court for the St. Charles district.  </p>",

They soon married and lived on a lot adjoining where she had previously been enslaved. They had eight children and were both very active in the community. Marie-Louise's name appears frequently in church records noting that she attended baptisms of her children, participated in the baptisms of about 17 enslaved children, and later in weddings and burials. Marie-Louise's story is somewhat unique because she was born into slavery without a surname, but she appears in early registers as a free woman of color, and shortly after as the wife of Antoine Janis.</p>",

September 14th, 1808), and Felix Janis (b. November 21st, 1810). Francois acquired the Janis House in 1796 from his father, Nicolas, although Nicolas continued to live in the home. In 1803, Francois entered into a contract with stone masons for the stone wall in front of the building in order to keep the house from sliding down the hill. It may have been around this time that Francois opened <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-tree-tavern.htm\">Green Tree Tavern</a> and Inn, after his father had passed. It is possible Francois used the attic space for the inn, the south end of the house as living space, and the north end as the tavern.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6dfed48c-1a81-4067-a1e6-708a479c1c1b}{13}\" paraid=\"1203784947\">After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, members of the Freemasons moved to the area. In 1806, a group of Masons sent a petition to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania requesting to form Louisiana Lodge 109 in Ste. Genevieve. It was approved on July 17, 1807, making it the first Masonic Lodge west of the Mississippi River. Francois’ tavern was used as the first meeting place on November 14, 1807. Francois passed away in 1832 and left the building to his family. In 1833, the Janis family sold it to the Mathias Ziegler and his family, who continued the businesses.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6dfed48c-1a81-4067-a1e6-708a479c1c1b}{23}\" paraid=\"543771249\">During a stay at Green Tree Tavern and Inn, a traveler named Thomas Ashe wrote of the place and family: “I...

            "bodyText": "<p>For decades John and Delores Moaney were there, through it all alongside Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower<br /> <br /> From 1942 until Dwight Eisenhower’s death in 1969—from the battlefields of World War II to the White House, and from their home in Gettysburg and beyond—John Moaney served as Ike’s personal valet and near constant companion, while for nearly thirty years his wife, Delores Moaney, served as the Eisenhowers’ cook and housekeeper and later as Mamie’s personal maid.<br /> <br /> But to Dwight, Mamie, and the entire Eisenhower family, however, John and Delores Moaney were much more than just valet and housekeeper; they were close friends, indeed, they were considered part of the family.</p>   <h3>A Sergeant Named Moaney & A General Named Eisenhower: 1942-1945</h3> <p><br /> John Alton Moaney was born on June 7, 1914, in Easton, Talbot County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, a son of John W. Moaney (1886-1956) and Mary Ethel Drake Moaney (1889-1976). The Moaney family long had ties to that part of the Eastern Shore. Indeed, according to one source, John’s great-grandfather was reportedly enslaved on a large plantation along the Wye River near Easton. [1] After attending local schools for a few years, young Moaney found employment working as a landscaper, gardener, and as a farm laborer. In October 1941, two months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Moaney, at age 27, was drafted into the United States Army. Following America’s entry into the global conflict, Moaney was sent to London where he joined the 751st Quartermaster Company. He remained with this unit throughout the spring and summer of 1942, largely performing vehicle maintenance and upkeep.<br /> <br /> Then, in the summer of 1942, his life changed forever.</p> <figure><img alt=\"A faded yellow draft registration card of John Moaney lists some biographical information\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/download_23.png\" title=\"Moaney John Draft Registration Card\" /> <figcaption><em>John Moaney's Draft Registration Card ca. 1940, National Archives and Records Administration</em> <p><br /> A call had gone out for volunteers to serve on a general’s personal staff. The identity of the general was not revealed but even if it was, it would not have made a difference, for, according to John Moaney, he had never before heard of a general named Dwight David Eisenhower. By this time a corporal, Moaney responded and interviewed in London for the position. As Moaney later remembered, those conducting the interview (Eisenhower was not among them) made it clear that the position would essentially be that of a “houseboy;” that he would be expected to cook for, care for, even help dress the general; that he was to be the general’s personal valet who was to help the general feel “at home.” And even though he was to become part of the general’s personal staff there was to be absolutely no military formality. He was not to discuss anything pertaining to the military or the war; he was not to salute the general nor even stand at attention. [2] Moaney must have surely impressed, for he was one among the three men who were selected for Eisenhower’s personal staff. This would thus be the start of a nearly 30-year relationship between John Moaney and Dwight Eisenhower.<br /> <br /> After being selected for ths position, Moaney was ordered to Telegraph Cottage, on the outskirts of London, a small house in a secluded setting that General Eisenhower used every now and then as a personal get-away, and from where he helped plan what later became known as Operations Torch and Overlord. It was there, at Telegraph Cottage, where Moaney and Eisenhower for the first time met. They soon discovered they had some things in common, including a love of the outdoors and a background in farming. Ike spent most of his time at that point in the war cooped up in a London hotel, except for weekends and some scattered evenings when he would be at Telegraph Cottage. Moaney, meanwhile, remained at Telegraph Cottage, keeping house with several other members of Ike’s personal staff.<br /> <br /> Ike often used Telegraph Cottage as a refuge; a place where he could unwind and relax. Moaney remembered that most of the time there General Eisenhower would take walks around the yard, read, play the piano, and otherwise just “lounge around.” He awoke early, which meant that John Moaney also had to wake up early. [3] Moaney prepared Ike’s meals. For breakfast, it would usually be a fried egg, a piece of bacon, and toast with pineapple jam, which Ike washed down with a cup of orange juice. Eisenhower “always liked just plain cooking,” said Moaney, nothing ever really fancy, and that lunch, most of the time, was what Moaney called “ordinary.” During their time together at Telegraph Cottage, Eisenhower taught Moaney how to prepare vegetable soup and potato salad just the way he liked them. Unofficially, Moaney was also placed in charge of Eisenhower’s two beloved Scottish terrier dogs: Telek and Khaki. Moaney grew attached to the dogs and took special care of the puppies Telek and Khaki produced throughout the war, naming each one when they were born. At Telegraph Cottage Moaney would also help guests with their bags, shine their shoes, make coffee, open the shutters, set the table, wash the dishes, and start up coal fires. All-in-all, he said, he did “a little bit of everything.\" [4]</p> </figcaption> </figure> <figure> </figure> <img alt=\"John Moaney, wearing his World War II Army uniform, stands next to an unidentified young woman\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/ENHS3907J.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Sergeant John Moaney and Unidentified Woman ca. 1945\" /> <em>Sergeant John Moaney, US Army, With Unidentified Woman ca. 1945, Eisenhower National Historic Site</em><br />   <p>Promoted to Sergeant, Moaney accompanied General Eisenhower to Africa during Operation Torch, and remained with him daily during this campaign. After D-Day in June 1944, Moaney remained in London for only “about a week or so” before he traveled to France to join up once again with Eisenhower. He remained with the Supreme Allied Commander for the duration of the conflict, as the General moved from place to place across western Europe. Whenever Ike traveled, it was Moaney who helped pack everything up—the footlockers, the gear, equipment, and the General’s uniforms and clothing. He also accompanied Eisenhower whenever Ike visited with his top lieutenants.<br /> <br /> Following the end of the war, most of Eisenhower’s staff were eligible for discharge and most elected to return to civilian life. But not John Moaney. Moaney chose to continue working for Dwight Eisenhower, who was now the Army Chief of Staff. As a five-star general, Eisenhower was entitled to retain a personal staff and Ike was glad Sgt. Moaney elected to stay. [5]</p> <h3>John & Delores and Dwight & Mamie: 1946-1952</h3>  <br /> <img alt=\"Delores Moaney stands for a photograph; she is wearing a dress. In the background is an image of the US Capitol Building\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/webpage-ENHS4315bJ-In-DC-1944-from-Delores-Moaney-2.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Delores Moaney ca. 1944\" /> <em>Delores Moaney ca. 1944, Courtesy of Delores Moaney</em> <p>Returning stateside in 1946, John Moaney married Delores Butler, who also was originally from the Eastern Shore. Born on November 14, 1916, Delores had grown up within a few miles of Moaney and their families were well acquainted. [6] Delores later said that she knew John during their childhoods, though he was a couple years older. After their nuptials, John and Delores Moaney lived for a time in a home at Ft. Meyer, Virginia, and they also maintained an apartment in Washington, D.C. John continued to work for General Eisenhower, who at this time was working on his book <em>Crusade in Europe</em>. In 1948, however, Eisenhower accepted the position of President of Columbia University and the Moaneys traveled to New York City with Dwight and Mamie. It was there that Delores Moaney began working for the Eisenhowers, helping prepare meals for the family and assisting with day-to-day chores. John Moaney later recalled that while Dwight served as President of Columbia, their house “was all full of help—they had all kinds of help there: aids and cooks. That was before Delores started cooking. She stayed there—she wasn’t cooking in the beginning; she was just taking care of Mrs. Eisenhower, or Mrs. John Eisenhower,” who was Barbara Eisenhower, Dwight and Mamie’s daughter-in-law. Moaney also joked that this was also the first time he had ever seen Dwight Eisenhower in civilian clothing. “He didn’t have but three good suits,” Moaney later remembered. “He’d wear one one day and one the next day—then he’d start back over again.” [7]<br /> <br /> It was while serving as president of Columbia that Eisenhower took up painting, a hobby he honed for the rest of his life, and John Moaney was there the day Ike first put brush to canvas. According to Eisenhower, he was watching an artist work on a portrait of Mamie. One day when he finished painting, the artist and Mamie toured their New York city residence to find a proper place to hang the portrait once it was finished. Now alone with an easel, paints, and an unfinished portrait of Mamie in front of him, Dwight Eisenhower decided that he wanted to “make use of the paints remaining on [the artist’s] palette to try poking away on my own.” But there was nothing upon which to paint. Just then, John Moaney walked into the room, and Ike had an idea. He told Moaney to go into his room and find a little wooden box he knew to be in there, knock out the sides, then “take any kind of white cloth you can find, and stretch it on the board by tacking the edges.” Within just a few minutes, Moaney returned with the box sans the sides and with a clean dust cloth fastened onto it. It was John Moaney who thus provided Dwight Eisenhower with his very first canvas. [8]</p> <br /> <br /> <img alt=\"A painting by Eisenhower of Telegraph Cottage features green grass, blue skies, and a yellow two-story cottage with reddish brown roof. I tree without leaves stands to left of cottage in painting.\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/webpage-ike_painting_oil_ike_painting-resized-600.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Eisenhower Oil Painting of Telegraph Cottage\" /> <em>Dwight Eisenhower presented this painting he did of Telegraph Cottage to his friend and valet, John Moaney, Found at http://blog.americanheritage1.com/blog/bid/57074/DWIGHT-EISENHOWER-OIL-PAINTING-TELEGRAPH-COTTAGE-WORLD-WAR-11</em> <p><br /> John Moaney remembered that Eisenhower “would paint every chance he had,” and this was especially true in Ike’s later days, post-presidency. Apparently, however, Eisenhower was not fond of most of his artwork and threw most of his paintings away. He later discovered that Sgt. Moaney would rescue Ike’s discarded art from the trash. From then on, Eisenhower painted a large red “X” over the paintings he threw away, but this did not deter Moaney from rescuing these ones, too. But not all of John Moaney’s Eisenhower artwork was gathered from the refuse pile. In what was a very heartfelt gift, Eisenhower, in 1949, presented Moaney with a painting he did of Telegraph Cottage, the place where the two of the met and first got to know one another back in 1942. [9]<br />  </p> <img alt=\"A smiling John Moaney stands for a photograph; he is wearing a white shirt and grey pants\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/webpage-ENHS3908J-In-France-With-Ike-as-head-of-NATO.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"John Moaney ca. 1950\" /> <em>John Moaney ca. 1950 in France, Eisenhower National Historic Site</em> <p> </p> <p>In 1950, Dwight Eisenhower took an extended leave-of-absence from Columbia to accept the position as Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and to assume command of all NATO forces in Europe. Breaking the news to Moaney, Eisenhower said, “Well, I guess this is the end of the line for us. You’ll have to stay here with your young wife,” while he traveled to Paris to begin his new duties. According to Eisenhower’s son John, Moaney insisted on going with Eisenhower, telling Ike in jest that he had known him much longer than he had known Delores. [10] So, while Delores remained at home in New York with her two daughters who were still in school, John Moaney accompanied Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower to Europe.<br /> <br /> After two years overseas and after much convincing, Dwight Eisenhower decided to return to the United States and enter the political arena, running for the presidency of the United States. This decision meant that Eisenhower would have to resign from the military, which he did, during the summer of 1952. This also meant he would lose his personal military staff, including the service of Sgt. John Moaney. Eisenhower told this to Moaney and that the two of them would now be separated since he would no longer be entitled to Moaney’s service. As Ike later remembered the moment, Moaney “quietly replied that if I left the Army, he was going to do the same. He did not hesitate a second in casting his lot with me in my new undertaking.” Eisenhower warned that if he was elected president, Moaney would be reinstated in the Army at his old grade, and that if he lost the campaign then they both would be out of work. “I shall never forget his smiling answer,” recorded Eisenhower. “‘Don’t worry, General,’ he said, ‘I think you and I can always make a living.’” [11]<br /> <br /> Of course, the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower did not lose the campaign; in fact, he won by a landslide, carrying 442 Electoral Votes compared to just 89 for his Democratic Party challenger, Adlai Stevenson. He triumphed over Stevenson again in 1956, this time carrying 457 Electoral Votes. In both elections, Eisenhower also trounced Stevenson in the popular vote. On January 20, 1953, Dwight David Eisenhower took the Oath of Office to become the 34th President of the United States. And when he and Mamie once again relocated to yet another residence—this time the White House—John and Delores Moaney went along with them.</p> <h3>The White House Years: 1953-1961</h3> <p><br /> In terms of duties for John and Delores Moaney, the White House years were little different from those previous, except for the change in venue. As in years past, the Moaneys attended to Dwight and Mamie’s personal needs. Officially, John Moaney was Ike’s valet, while Delores was sometimes identified as one of Mamie’s maids and a cook. Each day, John was responsible for waking up the president and reminding him of the day’s schedule, but only very seldomly did President Eisenhower oversleep. Typically, when John would enter the president’s bedroom at the appointed time between 645-7:00 a.m. every morning, Ike was already awake. Moaney would sometimes bring Ike his breakfast and the morning newspapers. He would also set out the clothing Eisenhower was to wear—his socks, shoes, pants, shirt, jacket, even his underwear—and helped him get dressed. Moaney also packed luggage for the many trips Eisenhower took as president. And even though the White House chef and large kitchen staff prepared most of the meals, occasionally John and especially Delores Moaney cooked for the Eisenhowers as well, especially since Delores knew exactly what Ike and Mamie liked, and how they liked it prepared. She became known in the press as “the expert in the White House kitchen.\" [12]<br /> <br /> In one tale, oft told, Dwight Eisenhower authorized John Moaney to shoot and kill the squirrels that were roughing up the putting green that the American Public Golfing Association had installed on the South Lawn of the White House. Apparently, Eisenhower’s predecessor, Harry Truman, liked to feed the White House wildlife and the squirrels had become quite tame. Ike cared less for squirrels than did Truman, and once told Moaney: “The next time you see one of those squirrels go near my putting green, take a gun and shoot it!” Moaney did not like the idea of discharging firearms on the White House grounds and so, working with Secret Service, they trapped the pesky animals and removed them to other locations. [13]</p>   <figure> </figure> <img alt=\"President Eisenhower helps Grandson David put a golf ball; John Moaney is standing at the hole, holding a flag\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/webpage-ENHS3410J-At-Camp-David-8.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Dwight and David Eisenhower Putting With Moaney Nearby\" /> <em>President Eisenhower helps grandson David with his golf game at Camp David while John Moaney looks on. Eisenhower National Historic Site.</em> <p> </p> <p>Since Ike was an avid golfer, Moaney spent a lot of his time shagging Eisenhower’s golf balls, whether on the South Lawn of White House or at Augusta National or at Camp David or wherever Ike chose to play his preferred game. According to one report, Moaney was able to “judge his boss’ distance so well that he places himself so the ball stops almost at his feet. When the president shifts clubs, Moaney changes his distance accordingly.” In addition to golf outings, Moaney accompanied Eisenhower on his various fishing trips. Several times, it was just the two of them in a rowboat on a lake casting their lines. [14]<br /> <br /> As is the case with all modern Presidents, Eisenhower as Chief Executive and Head of State traveled often, all over the country, and to a good part of the world. In almost every case, whether stateside or to distant countries, he was accompanied by the ever-present John Moaney. And when Mamie traveled with Ike, Delores Moaney traveled with them as well. This was true whether the purpose of Ike’s trips was official business or simply for pleasure. The Moaneys traveled with the Eisenhowers on their vacations, whether it was to Palm Springs, California, Augusta, Georgia, or elsewhere. Of course, in many places in the 1950s, segregated facilities were commonplace. According to Delores Moaney, Ike and Mamie would oftentimes threaten to leave a place and patronize another business if the Moaneys were not allowed to accompany them. As Delores once recalled, “The President would tell them that if they couldn’t accept us, then they couldn’t accept him.\" [15]</p> <figure> </figure> <img alt=\"A seated Delores Moaney, wearing a white dress, reads a book to the young granddaughters of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/webpage-ENHS3157J-Delores-at-Camp-David-August-1954-EISE-Library.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Delores Moaney Reads to the Eisenhower Grandchildren at Camp David ca 1954\" /> <em>Delores Moaney reads to Dwight and Mamie's granddaughters at Camp David, 1954. Eisenhower National Historic Site. </em> <p> </p> <p>It was tough for the Press to find out much about John and Delores Moaney, and this was by design. Throughout his years as President Eisenhower’s valet, John Moaney had “one hard, firm rule,” said one of his friends; “He won’t talk to reporters.” While he was always ready with a pleasant greeting and warm smile, Moaney very seldom, if ever, talked to the press. [16]</p>   <p>Perhaps the proudest day in John Moaney’s long career serving Dwight Eisenhower came on June 11, 1957, when the President and First Lady welcomed Moaney’s family and friends from Moaney’s hometown church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Copperville, near Easton, Maryland, to the White House. John’s mother, Mary, was there, as were about 40 members of the church. President Eisenhower welcomed the group inside the Oval Office then they all stepped onto the patio for a photograph. “Moaney, a shy man of 43, edged to the back row and had to be urged by the cameraman to move down alongside the President, who cheerfully made room for him,” reported the <em>Associated Press</em> of the event. At that point, Mamie Eisenhower called for Delores Moaney to also report “front and center” for the photograph, at which Ike said, “My goodness we have to have Delores in this.” Said the report, John Moaney “beamed with pride” that day. [17]</p> <h3>The Moaneys at Gettysburg: 1955-1969</h3> <p>While serving the President and First Lady, John and Delores Moaney sometimes resided in the White House’s Third Floor Servants’ Quarters. Most of the time, they resided in the apartment they rented in Washington, D.C., but they also spent a good amount of time at the Eisenhowers’ home in Gettysburg.<br /> <br /> In 1950, two years prior to Dwight’s first run at the White House, the Eisenhowers purchased a home and farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; it was the first—and, as it turned out, only—home they ever owned. Because of extensive renovations, however, it was not until 1955 that they “moved in.” By then, of course, Dwight was President of the United States.<br /> <br /> John and Delores Moaney were provided with a room of their own on the first floor of the Eisenhowers’ Gettysburg home and whenever the Eisenhowers traveled to Gettysburg, the Moaneys traveled there with them. In many cases, John and Delores were sent ahead to prepare the house for Dwight and Mamie’s arrival. While there, John and Delores Moaney did just about anything and everything for the First Family. Among other things, John would lay out Ike’s clothing each morning, set up the grill at the tea house, serve formal meals, tend to the vegetable garden, and continue to shag Eisenhower’s golf balls. Delores would be housekeeper and cook, and together they would wash the dishes and prepare for any and all visits from government or military officials.<br /> <br /> While the White House remained their primary residence during the remainder of Dwight’s Presidency, the Eisenhowers used their home as a retreat, a getaway, a refuge. They would oftentimes spend weekends at the farm and some Holidays there as well. In all, it is believed that between 1955 and 1961, the Eisenhowers spent a total of 365 days at their home in Gettysburg.</p> <br /> <br />   <figure> </figure> <img alt=\"With John Moaney looking on, smiling, President Eisenhower cooks up some food on a grill\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/BBQ.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Eisenhower and Moaney at the Grill\" /> <em>President Eisenhower and John Moaney Grilling Up Some Steaks. Eisenhower National Historic Site. </em> <p><br /> They would spend much more time there, of course, following Ike’s presidency. After eight years, Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency ended on January 20, 1961 and he looked ahead to a quiet and peaceful retirement at his Gettysburg farm. His successor, John F. Kennedy, almost immediately reinstated Eisenhower’s five-star general’s rank that he had resigned when he first ran for president in 1952. The reinstatement of rank meant that Eisenhower was again able to retain a personal staff and this included Sergeant John Moaney, who was then 47 years of age. After having served Ike so well and so faithfully in World War II and through the White House years, now John Moaney—along with his wife Delores—would serve the general and his family in this next chapter of his life: retirement.</p>   <figure> </figure> <img alt=\"A young David Eisenhower stands with John Moaney on the banks of a pond on the Eisenhower property; both are holding fishing rods.

Eisenhower National Historic Site. </em> <p> </p> <p>As the years passed, the pace of life for the Eisenhowers, once so busy, began to slow. Visitors to the farm became fewer. As John Moaney later put it, “Everybody is getting along in age now and satisfied to stay home and read the newspapers.” Still, there was much to keep the Moaneys occupied. John continued his work as Dwight’s valet and also tackled more of the farm work as well as maintaining the vegetable garden. Delores’s duties increased following the resignation in 1962 of Mamie’s long-serving personal maid, Rose Woods. Now, in addition to cooking for the Eisenhowers and providing general housework, Delores cared for Mamie’s clothing and set the former First Lady’s hair every night. The Moaneys also continued to travel with the Eisenhowers. In 1962, when Dwight and Mamie undertook an extensive, thirty-day trip to Europe; John and Delores traveled with them.<br /> <br /> John and Delores grew very close with Dwight and Mamie’s four grandchildren during the retirement years at the farm, with John and grandson David forming an especially strong bond. In a memoir about his time with Ike and Mamie at their Gettysburg farm entitled <em>Going Home To Glory</em>, David Eisenhower wrote fondly about John Moaney. “Moaney seemed jovial, with a roly-poly walk and a ready laugh that was really a giggle,” wrote David Eisenhower, who also remembered that “Moaney was always humming a song of his own, familiar-sounding but uncategorizable. He carried a tune that resembled a Stephen Foster melody or spiritual, but the words were improvised. ‘Good Lord, I’m Going Away,’ he sang, morning and night, waiting on the table, or setting up trays, vacuuming the rugs or polishing the silver.” David recalled that he and John Moaney would oftentimes go fishing and that Moaney would often set up targets for David’s shooting practice. Moaney would also set up the film projector for the family to watch movies and would continue to spend time in the garden. David Eisenhower remembered that he and Moaney used to joke about Ike’s temper when he got into a foul mood. [18]<br /> <br /> Years later, John and Delores Moaney were guests at David’s December 22, 1968, wedding, which was a big event since he was marrying President Nixon’s daughter, Julie. There, they were asked to deliver a slice of the cake to Dwight Eisenhower, who, sadly, was at that time hospitalized at Walter Reed Medical Center, forced watched the ceremony on a closed circuit television.</p>   <h3>Eisenhower's \"Irreplaceable Man\"</h3> <br />  <br /> <img alt=\"Dwight Eisenhower, wearing a grey suit, and John Moaney, wearing a white shirt and black bow tie, smile\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/eise/learn/historyculture/images/webpage-ENHS2521J.jpg?maxwidth=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"Dwight Eisenhower and John Moaney\" /> <em>Dwight Eisenhower called John Moaney his \"irreplaceable man.\" Eisenhower National Historic Site. </em> <p> </p> <p>During all their years together, Dwight Eisenhower never called John Moaney, “John;” instead, he was either “Sergeant” or just “Moaney.” [19] But he always spoke fondly of him. In his 1963 book, <em>Mandate for Change</em> Ike wrote that Moaney had always been “immensely valuable,” indeed, “almost indispensable, to me,” while in his popular 1967 publication <em>At Ease: Stories I Tell My Friends</em>, an aged Eisenhower wrote: \"Of Sergeant John Moaney, I have only this to say: He and I have been inseparable for almost a quarter of a century; in my daily life, he is just about the irreplaceable man.\" [20]<br /> <br /> And after nearly 27 years of continual service, through all the trials and the triumphs, John Moaney, Ike’s “irreplaceable man,” was with the Eisenhower family at Walter Reed when, on March 28, 1969, Dwight David Eisenhower passed away. Delores Moaney was there, too, and both, remembered grandson David, shed many tears. [21]<br /> <br /> Before he died, Eisenhower saw to it that John Moaney be promoted to the rank of Master Sergeant, and in his will bequeathed to his faithful valet and good friend his Yellow Gold Rolex watch along with other personal items along with a cash sum in the amount of $5,000. A higher and greater honor came when Master Sergeant John Moaney was named as one of Eisenhower’s ten Honorary Pall Bearers during his State Funeral. Later in 1969 and in recognition of his many years of service to Eisenhower, John Moaney also received the Legion of Merit medal, one of the army’s highest awards.

Every time I’d go over Monday morning and see him, he’d say, ‘You going back to the farm now?’ . . .So I spent most of the time up here [at Gettysburg].\" [23]<br /> <br /> For John Moaney, the Eisenhowers’ Gettysburg farm was the most pleasant place he had ever lived. Delores enjoyed life on the farm as well, especially when compared to the White House. “I couldn’t wait to get away from the White House,” said Delores. “It just wasn’t a place to, you know, attract my attention.\" [24]</p>   <figure> </figure> <img alt=\"Delores and John Moaney, both wearing white, stand and smile for a photograph.

But instead of heading out now on their own, he and Delores remained with Mamie, fulfilling a promise that they would continue to care for her following Ike’s death. Splitting time between their home in Washington, D.C. and at Gettysburg, they would often spend time with the now widowed former First Lady at the farm, having dinner with her, watching television, and celebrating birthdays and Holidays. This helped alleviate some of the loneliness Mamie felt with the loss of her husband. They would also help decorate for the Holidays, including Christmas, which was Mamie’s favorite time of the year. And, of course, they would continue to tend to Mamie’s needs. John continued to perform various chores around the house, while Delores prepared fresh cooked meals and took personal care of Mamie. The Moaneys also continued to travel with Mamie. In the Fall of 1969, the three of them—along with Secret Service agents—undertook an automobile trip to Boone, Iowa, to visit one of Mamie’s uncles. Along the way, they stopped in at the Truman Memorial Library and paid a visit to Ike’s grave in Abilene. [25]<br /> <br /> Finally, in April 1977 and after so many years of service, John and Delores Moaney retired. After bidding an emotional goodbye to Mamie, the Moaneys returned to their home in Washington, D.C.<br /> <br /> Sadly, however, John Moaney would not live to enjoy a long retirement.</p> <h3>The Deaths of John Moaney and Mamie Eisenhower</h3> <p><br /> On February 20, 1978, Master Sergeant John Alton Moaney, the man who had quite literally traveled the world with Dwight Eisenhower as his valet, orderly, friend, and near constant companion from the trying days of World War II to the White House and to the Eisenhower’s humble home in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, passed away at Walter Reed Medical Center, succumbing to cancer just a few months shy of his 64th birthday. He was survived by his widow, Delores, his two stepdaughters, Sarah and Anne, four grandchildren, as well as five brothers and three sisters.<br /> <br /> Funeral services for John Moaney were held on Friday, February 24, at the Asbury United Methodist Church in Easton, Maryland. 81-year-old Mamie Eisenhower, who at that point in her life rarely left her home, made the long journey from Gettysburg to Easton with her son, John, and his wife, Barbara, to attend the funeral. Following the service, the remains of Sergeant Moaney were buried with full military honors at the nearby Deshields Church Cemetery in Copperville. News of John Moaney’s death was printed in newspapers across the country.<br /> <br /> Delores Moaney suffered another great personal loss just twenty months after she lost her husband, when her friend, Former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower died on November 1, 1979. Along with Mamie’s son John, his wife Barbara, and several other family members, a tearful Delores Moaney accompanied the remains of Mamie Eisenhower on the plane ride from Washington, D.C, to Abilene, Kansas, where they were interred alongside those of Dwight and the Eisenhowers’ first-born child, Doud, who died at age in 1921. In her will, Mamie bequeathed to Delores Moaney $5,000.<br /> <br /> Following the death of Mamie Eisenhower, Delores Moaney returned to her home in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1980s, she returned to work for a time for another Eisenhower: Dwight and Mamie’s granddaughter, Susan Eisenhower. Delores sometimes cradled Susan as an infant in the White House; now, more than three decades later, she helped care for Susan’s children.

Eisenhower National Historic Site. </em> <h3>Delores Moaney and the Eisenhower National Historic Site</h3> <p><br /> Throughout the rest of her life, Delores Moaney frequently returned to Gettysburg to visit the Eisenhower home, which had now become the Eisenhower National Historic Site. She was present as an invited guest when the Site first opened in June 1980. The <em>Gettysburg Times</em> reported that “National Park Service guides were a rapt audience for Delores Moaney, who reminisced as she walked through the house. They asked questions and jotted down notes as she described details of the home and of the Eisenhowers’ life there. . . .” [27] During that and subsequent visits, she remembered how she and John helped to decorate the home for Christmas.<br /> <br /> The Eisenhower house was “just as” Delores Moaney remembered, except at that time, the room in which she and John resided was not part of the formal public house tour, and it would not be for another twenty-one years.<br /> <br /> Finally, in 2001, after years of using it as an office space, the National Park Service renovated the Moaney’s room, refurbishing it to its 1967 appearance by using some of the same furniture that was there when the Moaneys occupied the room. Assisting with the renovation and refurbishment was Delores Moaney who provided descriptions of the room to NPS staff and who provided copies of photographs of her and John from her personal collection. “Before the Moaneys’ room was added to the [House] tour,” said NPS Supervisory Historian Carol Hegeman, “few visitors learned that an African American couple lived and worked in the house. Now visitors will learn how essential the Moaneys were to the running of the household and about the special relationship between General Eisenhower and Sergeant Moaney.\" [28]<br /> <br /> Delores Moaney toured the renovated room in January 2005 when, at age 88, she visited the Eisenhower National Historic Site and reminisced about the place where she had spent so many years and made so many memories. And they were mostly good memories. During an earlier visit, Delores Moaney remembered that her years with the Eisenhowers were “fantastic,” and there were too many special memories to recall just one. [29]<br /> <br /> Delores Moaney passed away on the night of September 14, 2014, in Washington, D.C., at age 98. She was laid to rest in Deshields Church Cemetery near Easton, Maryland, alongside the remains of her husband, John Moaney, who had passed away 36 years earlier. Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of Ike and Mamie, paid tribute to Delores, writing that she “remained an integral part of our family until the end of her life, forging all the while a continuing friendship between her grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and ours.” [30] Upon learning of her death, the staff at the Eisenhower National Historic Site in Gettysburg also paid tribute to Delores: “Mrs. Moaney was a favorite among those of us on the ENHS staff. Whenever she came to visit the site or phoned us during the holidays, she was a delight to talk to—pleasant and vibrant with a great sense of humor. . . .As historians, we were fortunate to spend time over the years with such a wonderfully vital, tangible link to the past. But history aside, we were simply lucky to get to know such a cool lady.\" [31]</p>   <figure><img alt=\"A granite headstone marks the grave site of John and Delores Moaney.

They had five children. <br /> <br /> He was a fur trader and joined William H. Ashley’s group of traders on their first and second trips out west. Those expeditions were made to trap and trade furs for the prominent Rocky Mountain Fur Company. In the summer of 1832, Antoine St. Charles and William H. Ashley’s group were at the famous rendezvous point Pierre’s Hole in the Grand Teton range of eastern Idaho and western Wyoming. This location was one of the larger meeting points where fur traders assembled to trade furs and conduct business. In 1833, Antoine St. Charles briefly returned to St. Charles, Missouri before joining another Rocky Mountain Fur Company brigade and heading west again. This time, he went to the mouth of the Yellowstone River (50 miles up the Missouri River) at “Frenchman’s Point\" where he was robbed and nearly murdered by members of the locally notorious Deschamps family.  <br /> <br /> Antoine St. Charles returned home to collect his 12-year-old son, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joseph-antoine-janis.htm\">Joseph Antoine Janis</a> (also referred to as Antoine) and took him west to Colorado in 1836. The younger Antoine claimed later in life that he and his father named the Cache la Poudre River in Colorado, although that story is somewhat disputed. Either way, Antoine St. Charles staked a claim to land there and is said to be the first Euro-American settler in Larimer County, Colorado. However, Antoine St. Charles was not just of Euro-American heritage, but rather of mixed heritage. His father was French, and his mother was a woman of color. <br /> <br /> In <em>Mountain Men</em>, by LeRoy R. Hafen, Antoine St. Charles is said to have lived along the Big Thompson Creek where the Oregon Trail (or Stage Road) crossed from Fort Collins to Denver, three miles west of the present-day town of Loveland, Colorado. From 1837 to 1839, he had an account with and sold to the American Fur Company after the demise of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Antoine St. Charles Janis was killed by members of the Blackfeet Tribe on the riverbank in the Yellowstone River region around 1840.</p> <h4 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{496a8c3b-006d-4dba-9b4b-fdfe3da58123}{190}\" paraid=\"1051566481\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Further Reading</h4> LeRoy R.

Eight years later, in July of 1844, Joseph Antoine married a First Elk Woman of the Oglala Sioux tribe named Mary. He met Mary in 1844 when he journeyed west without his father, working with his brother Nicolas (referred to as “Nick” in many historic records) out of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fola/index.htm\">Fort Laramie</a> as a scout and interpreter to the tribe. Joseph Antoine is said to be the first permanent Euro-American settler in northern Colorado when he founded the town of Colona (later to become LaPorte) in 1858.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f7b41eab-1777-4a47-b3a1-58e02ba38af9}{18}\" paraid=\"1178455044\">Joseph Antoine had been in Mexico before 1844 and upon his return passed through the Poudre Valley in present-day Colorado. He called the spot at the foothills of the Poudre River “the loveliest spot on Earth”, but at the time it was not open to homesteading. The area was used by the Arapaho and Cheyenne as hunting territory. Joseph Antoine did stake out a squatter’s claim on the river bottom just west of present-day LaPorte in June 1844 and expected to return to homestead there once it was legal to file the claim.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{496a8c3b-006d-4dba-9b4b-fdfe3da58123}{206}\" paraid=\"1250547406\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Joseph Antoine returned there in 1858 with his claim filed because of the opening of the western Nebraska Territory. A flood of prospectors came to his area the next year with the 1859 Colorado Gold Rush. He constructed a small log cabin on the south side of the Poudre River where he is said to have kept a grocery and saloon. A general order from the federal government forced Mary to move to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 1878. Joseph Antoine sold his cabin and went to live with his wife on the reservation when she was forced to move. Joseph Antoine passed away there in 1889-1890.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f7b41eab-1777-4a47-b3a1-58e02ba38af9}{28}\" paraid=\"1402424646\">Joseph Antoine’s cabin is now on exhibit in downtown Fort Collins, Colorado, on the corner of Matthews and Olive St in the Heritage Courtyard. A historical marker for Joseph Antoine is at 3597 Galway Dr in LaPorte, Colorado, near where his homestead cabin originally stood. There is also a statue of Joseph Antoine at Horsetooth Rd. and Shields St. in Fort Collins.  </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>John Burroughs was born on May 26, 1759 in or near Skenesborough, Washington County in the British Colony of New York. It is unknown who his parents were or if he had siblings. However, he was taught to read and write. At age 15, the beginings of the American Revolution were stirring, in 1775, the \"Shot Heard Round the World\" took place, and in January of 1776, 18 year old John enlisted in the Continental Army. <br /> <br /> Initially joining Colonel Seth Warner's Regiment, that fall Burroughs and his fellow soldiers marched up the Champlain Valley, over frozen Lake Champlain, and joined up with forces under General Benedict Arnold. The army marched on, first St. John's and Montreal, forcing the citie's surrenders. The goal was to make British Canada the fourteenth colony in the rebellion. From their they marched to Quebec and on New Year's Eve 1775 they attacked, attempting to take the city. They failed spectacularly with General Richard Montgomery, commander of the larger forces, dying from injuries suffered that night. <br /> <br /> Under Arnold's command (Arnold was also wounded), the soldiers spent that winter living in the outskirts of the city off of whatever provisions were stolen by or given to them. It was freezing and miserable and when spring came, they fled back to New York. Finding himself back in Skenesborough and discharged, Burroughs immediately reelisted into a Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Samuel Elmore. His company spent the fall and winter garrisoned at Fort Dayton in the Mohawk Valley. <br /> <br /> In the new year, Burroughs found his enlistment at an end yet again and reenlisted on January 6, 1777 into Colonel Lamb's Artillery. As a private, he served first under Lieutenant James Furnival, and then Captain Joseph Savage at Fort Schuyler (formerly known as Stanwix), at the edge of the new nation. As August of 1777 began, the fort and its forces found itself under siege by British forces and their Native Allies. <br /> <br /> Just three days into the conflict, on August 6, Burroughs participated in a sortie against the enemy forces as part of the artillery crew. Lt. William Colbrath (also of the garrisioned forces) described the event as follows:<br /> <em>“…the colonel detached 200 men and one field piece under command of Lieutant Colonel Willett with orders to proceed down the road to meet the generl's party; having marched a mile, they came upon an encampment of the enemy which they totally routed and plundered them of as much baggage as the soldiers could carry. Their loss is supposed to be between fifteen and twenty killed. The number of wounded who got off is unknown. They took four prisoners, three of whom were wounded, and Mr Singleton of Montreal, who says he is a lieutenant, without the loss of one man killed or wounded. Our party returned immediately and brought in a number of blankets, brass kettles, powder and ball, a variety of cloths and Indian Trinkets and hard cash, together with four scalps the Indians had lately taken, being entirely fresh and left in their camp. Two of the scalps taken are supposed to be those of the girls, being neatly dressed and the hair plaited. A bundle of letters was found in the enemy's camp, which had been sent by a Luke Cassidy for this garrison, who is supposed is either killed or taken; the letters were not broke open. Four colors were also taken, and immediately hoisted on our flag staff under the Contenental Flag, as trophies of victory.”</em><br /> <br /> Burroughs remained stationed at Fort Schuyler until October of 1778. At that point, at the request of Major Robert Cochran, he transferred as a corporal into Captain James Gregg's Company of the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY (who had been stationed concurrently at the American outpost) in exchange for another soldier, who then took his place in the artillery. From there, his new regiment marched to Albany and spent the winter encamped there. <br /> <br /> The following summer, they marched south along the Susquehannah River and joined the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign against the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Burroughs and his fellow soldiers destroyed multiple Native villiages, destroyed crops, and fought in the brutal Battle of New Town in August 1779. The goal was to force the Natives away from British support. It left their homelands devastated. Burroughs and other veterans would later return to these rich lands to \"resettle\" the area on behalf of the United States of America. <br /> <br /> From western New York, the Americans marched south to Pennsylvania, continuing their destruction, and then marched east to New Jersey, eventually settling into the encampment in Morristown. Burrough's enlistment expired on December 11, 1779, but this time instead of immediately rejoining, he choose to take his discharge. When interviewed later in life, Burroughs said he thought that his papers were signed by Lt. Col. Marinus Willett himself, the very man who lead Burroughs and the others on August 6, 1777 while they were still stationed at Fort Schuyler. But he couldn't say for certain as it was never returned from Albany after he sent it in to collect his discharge pay. <br /> <br /> Burroughs was back in Skenesborough by January of 1780; home after serving almost exactly 4 years in the Continental Army. Shortly after his return he married Mary Granger, the daughter of Zaccheus. The couple had a daughter, Deborah, and over the course of the next decade had at least three others; including John G., Phoebe, and Alvin. </p> <p>On July 3, 1790, Revolutionary War veterans drew for lots in the \"Military Tract.\" this was a vast area of land in Central New York that was divided into 28 townships, each comprised of 100 lots, with 600 acres in each lot. The Military Tract was taken from the territory of the original inhabitants of New York state, the Haudenosaunee; specifically, the Onondaga and Cayuga Nations. <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Below:</strong> A map of the land divisions in the \"Military Tract.\" Skaneateles, where Burroughs and his family settled, was located in the Marcellus area. This map was engraved by Cornelius Tiebout.</em><img alt=\"An old line drawing map of western New York. There are dozens of areas divided into even smaller ones. Lines and boxes inside of even more lines and boxes. \" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7401769|0|\" src=\"/people/images/1790Map.jpg\" style=\"float:right;\" title=\"1790Map.image_access_800a\" /> </p> <p><br /> <br /> <br /> This area of one 1.75 million acres in the middle of New York State was set aside by state legislators as a bounty for men from New York who had served in the American Revolution. Privates and noncommissioned officers got 500 acres; and up to 2,000 acres for higher ranking officers. Soldiers could claim their lands by pulling lot numbers from a ballot box. Records indicate that of 2,090 New Yorkers entitled to land, though many many sold their land or let it lie vacant. <br /> <br /> Burroughs however, entitled to and winning 600 acres, turned his land into a farm on which his wife, children, and in-laws would live and work. The farm was located along the north side of the Seneca Turnpike road and prospered for several decades and the couple saw the birth of many grandchildren. In 1812, his father-in-law Zaccheus passed and was buried on the family farm. In October of 1830, his beloved wife Mary died at age 68.  <br /> <br /> Just two years later, a widower well into his senior years, the now 75 year old Burroughs found himself applying for a soldiers pension in September of 1832. He was deposed on the terms of his service and recounted his story in great detail; especially in regards to names, geographic locations, and dates. The completed formal paperwork was submitted in January of 1833. Sadly, John died only a few months later on May 22, 1833, just four days short of his 76<sup>th</sup> birthday.

            "bodyText": "Cathay Williams was born to an enslaved mother and a free father in Independence, Missouri in 1844.  During her adolescence, she worked as a house slave on the Johnson plantation on the outskirts of Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1861, Union forces occupied Jefferson City during the early stages of the Civil War. At this time, captured slaves were officially designated as contraband and some served in military support roles such as cooks, laundresses, or nurses. Before her voluntary enlistment, at just 17 years old, Williams served as an Army cook and a washerwoman. In this role she accompanied the infantry all over the country. Williams served under the service of General Philip Sheridan and witnessed the Red River Campaign and the Battle of Pea Ridge.<br /> <br /> Despite the prohibition against women serving in the military, Williams enlisted in the U.S. Regular Army under the false name of \"William Cathay\" on November 15, 1866. She enlisted for a three-year engagement, passing herself off as a man. Williams was assigned to the 38th U.S. Infantry Regiment after she passed the cursory medical examination. Though this exam should have outed her as a woman, the Army did not require full medical exams at this time.<br /> <br /> Shortly after her enlistment, she contracted smallpox and was hospitalized. Williams rejoined her unit in New Mexico. There, possibly due to the effects of smallpox, the heat, or the years of marching, her body began to show signs of strain. Due to her frequent hospialization, the post surgeon finally discovered she was a woman and informed the post commander. She was honorably discharged by her commanding officer, Captain Charles E. Clarke on October 14, 1868. Though her disability discharge meant the end of her tenure with the Army, her advenure continued. She signed up with an emerging all-black regiment that would eventually become part of the legendary Buffalo Soldiers.<br /> <br /> Following her discharge, Williams went on to work as a cook at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/foun/index.htm\">Fort Union</a>, New Mexico (now Fort Union National Monument) and later moved to Pueblo, Colorado. Though she married, it ended badly after her husband stole her money and a team of horses. Williams had him arrested and then moved to Trinidad, Colorado, where she worked as a seamtress. It was during this time that her story first became public. A reporter from St. Louis heard rumors of a female African-American who had served in the army and came to interview her. Her life and military service narrative was published in the <em>St. Louis Daily Times</em> on January 2, 1876.<br /> <br /> Around 1889 or 1890, Williams entered a local hospital and applied for a disability pension based on her military service. Though there was a precedent for granting pension to female soldiers, (Deborah Sampson,  Anna Maria Lane and Molly Williams disguised themselves as men in the Revolutionary War), Williams request was denied. In September 1893, a doctor examined Williams. She suffered from neuralgia and diabetes, and had all her toes amputated and walked with a crutch. The doctor decided that she did not qualify for disability payments.The exact date of her death is unknown, but it is believed she died shortly after she was denied.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>What Makes Cathay Williams An American Hero:  </strong>Though over 400 women served in the Civil War posing as male soldiers, Williams was the first African American woman to enlist and the only documented woman to serve in the United States Army, while disguised as a man, during the Indian Wars. Williams is also the only known female Buffalo Soldier. Williams' determination to serve her country demonstrates the extraordinary feats women have accomplished simply trying to live their lives.",

Known as the preeminent “Plant Detective” in the region, for over three decades this field biologist has lent her prowess in plant identification, given engaging nature walks and workshops, and has been an invaluable helping hand to park staff. </h3> <p> </p> <h4>Quote by her:</h4> <p>“There’s so much development, it means a great deal if there’s some natural land left.”</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“Barbara is one of that rare breed of plant enthusiasts who make notable discoveries and contributions to the scientific literature by virtue of their enthusiasm, field-learned expertise, and sheer doggedness.”</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Barbara Eleanor Wykes was born December 1st, 1928 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. For the first seven years of her life, she grew up on 166 acres of woods outside of Grand Rapids “that still had six virgin white pines on the property.” It had “a little bit of this and a little bit of that.” Although the surrounding area enchanted her, Barbara’s mother disallowed her to explore the woods on her own. “She went once a year for mushrooms, and once a year down to the swamp to pick raspberries. “And once we all went out to the beech woods and ate wintergreen berries,” Barbara remembered. She said she still wonders what secrets that property held. She then moved to a farm that her grandfather gave her parents where she once caught a glimpse of the famed landscape architect and founder of the Prairie Club of Chicago, “It wasn’t romantic, but it did have half an island, and one day, I guess I was in the rowboat, I saw Jens Jensen going there, so that was of interest.” She fondly recalls playing with horsetails, pulling them apart and putting them together.<br /> <br /> By the time she was about 14, Barbara’s asthma had been so bad the family decided to move to New Mexico, seeking mountain air through a doctor's suggestion. She earned her bachelors and master's degrees from the University of New Mexico. Barbara came back to the Midwest sometime in the early-mid 1950’s and got her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. After receiving her doctorate, she returned to the University of New Mexico to teach English for three years. On April 26, 1960, The Albuquerque Tribune wrote of her forthcoming move to Chicago; “Barbara Wykes, instructor in English, to accept a position at the University of Chicago.” The position was assistant professor of humanities.<br /> <br /> On December 8th, 1961, the New Albuquerque Journal reported her engagement to Geoffrey C. M. Plampin of Chicago; they were married December 21, 1961. Their lives at the University of Chicago, like generations past, would bring them to the Indiana Dunes.<br /> <br /> Geoffrey worked for the University of Chicago and had achieved the roles of Editor of Official Publications as well as Vice Marshal before his retirement. “In those days, those days being, let's see, 1961 or so…Dune Acres was a popular place… for the University of Chicago faculty. And I remember somebody in Dune Acres saying, ‘We have enough people from the University of Chicago in Dune Acres, but you’re nice so we’ll let you come.’ So we did” [laughs].<br /> <br /> Barbara's relationship with plants began to grow shortly after her and Geoffrey moved to Dune Acres. “When I came here, I was interested in plants, and somebody said…‘Lois Howes knows all about plants.’” Barbara took their suggestion to speak to Lois and they met. Despite Barbara admitting being a bit patronizing in their first meeting when she suggested Lois be as scientific as possible, their friendship quickly grew and blossomed. “She did all kinds of things for me,” Barbara recalled. When botanizing together, Lois would move the car so they would not have to walk as far; sometimes without Barbara’s knowledge- who thought she had been left behind! “And she gave me my first copy of Swink and Wilhelm, which is the plant bible, or was in those days.”<br /> <br /> “Well she certainly was a mentor,” Barbara said fondly of Lois.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Kindly, she was one of the world’s worst cooks. After she died I used to visit her husband, often on a wednesday afternoon- I’d take the dog, which was like the dog he had had, and he would talk about Lois, who he said came from a very rich family, and when they got married he was a poor boy, and his story was very interesting, so he tried to save up money so she would have all the comforts, and a maid and everything, but he was relieved to find that she did not require these things. She had a deaf dog, Gretchen, a German shepherd. Gretchen operated by hand signals, every now and then Grechen would wander off, come to my house, ‘cause when she saw me she said ‘I’ll walk,’ and I did not know the hand signals, so I would have to call Lois and say ‘your dog is at my house.’”</p> <p><br /> Barbara also remember’s Lois’s devotion: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Well she was dedicated; she was the one who discovered Howes Prairie– she discovered in it an extremely rare plant, which she sent a specimen of to Floyd, and that’s when Floyd got interested in Howes Prairie... it’s a peculiar plant that will bloom in dry years after wet years.”</p> <p><br /> She continued, “So some years you see it, and some years you will not see it, and there’s always great anxiety about, ‘did you see [it] this year, did you see it?’”<br /> <br /> Barbara’s involvement with plants and the Indiana Dunes accelerated after she met Emma “Bickie” Pitcher, whose charismatic nature grew her loyal “groupies,” of which Barbara self-identified. When Bickie retired to Kalamazoo, Michigan, she carefully selected individuals to carry on a field of study pertinent to their skills and interests. “She assigned me to be a botanist, and it took. Well it was already taking anyway.”<br /> <br /> Barbara wrote of the direction she received from Ms. Pitcher after her passing in 2010, “Bickie taught me to use a dichotomous key and a meter square, and she familiarized me with local botanical literature, passing on several important plant lists, items later helpful to the present Lakeshore botanist.”<br /> <br /> Barbara became well acquainted with the botany and ecology of the Dunes. “Well plants are conditioned, see, something finds a way to develop and grow and to take advantage of any possible niche that isn't already occupied, some seed is going to develop, find the place to grow, no matter how unfavorable… almost.”<br /> <br /> In 1984, the park service hired the keen eyes of Barbara and Bickie for a special project to help find rare plants that were referenced in old botanical literature. “These were pre-GPS days,” Barbara recalled. They were tasked with finding Talinum rugospermum, “Fame flower,” a peculiar succulent-like plant whose vibrant fuschia blooms open only from around 3-6pm. After having no success in the location they believed to find it, Barbara and Bickie forgot about the curious Fame flower. The following August, the pair became overjoyed when they stumbled across its slender leaves on the opposite side of railroad tracks from where they had looked before. Barbara Plampin and Emma Pitcher are distinguished as the official “finders” of this rare species.<br /> <br /> Barbara has been involved with Shirley Heinze Land Trust since its infancy. In August of 1991 with about 40 acres in their possession, Barbara spoke of Shirley Heinze’s vital role in protecting the ecology region, “not only are we preserving land, we’re trying to prevent sand mining.” Today Shirley Heinze protects a variety of quality habitats across four counties and comprising over 2,600 acres. Barbara spoke on her involvement in assessing potential sites, “Well I used to go and help inspect the land that we were proposing to buy or land that we had bought, make plant lists or add to plant lists.”<br /> <br /> An article in the Vidette-Messenger of Porter County helps illustrate her work; “What I hope to find are refugia,” Barbara told the reporter, referring to pockets of quality plants that have maintained a presence in an otherwise degraded natural area. “These are inconspicuous plants that people don’t normally notice, but send botanists into ecstasies.” Human trash was a common find, “We’ve removed some tires… We’ve said that our logo should contain bed springs because most property we get we have to remove bed springs from.” Barbara reiterated the land trust’s importance, “There’s so much development, it means a great deal if there’s some natural land left.” In honor of her work, the Shirley Heinze Land Trust has dedicated a rich floodplain habitat along the Little Calumet River as the “Wykes-Plampin Nature Preserve.”<br /> <br /> On March 25, 1994, Barbara as well as Charlotte Read, Kay Franklin, and Irene Herlocker-Meyer celebrated “Women of Dunes” for a program at the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center on the achievements of Dorothy Buell, Bess Sheehan, Emma Pitcher, and other strong women of the region. Barbara has given presentations and led hikes around the dunes since her and Geoffrey moved to them permanently in 1988. “I had a great time.” She described a shift in the focus of her programs, “I used to talk about what Indians and pioneers used the plants for… and then I got interested in how the plants work. Why they are in the particular places they are, how they affect their pollinators, and how they spread their seeds and so on. So then I got to talking about that kind of thing.” Barbara is very pleased with the program she gave in the summer of 2019, “I gave it when I was 89, my last one, I’m proud of that.”<br /> <br /> Her husband Geoffrey, passed away in 2004. Ten years later she received the Paul Douglas Award from the Save the Dunes Council, who had this to say on her accomplishments:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Ms. Plampin is a tireless advocate for natural land preservation throughout northwest Indiana. She is also cherished as a gifted educator eager to share her knowledge with others. Barbara is one of that rare breed of plant enthusiasts who make notable discoveries and contributions to the scientific literature by virtue of their enthusiasm, field-learned expertise, and sheer doggedness. If the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources wants to find a rare plant species, they will probably ask Barbara Plampin for her help. And she usually finds what she’s looking for.”</p> <p><br /> Some of Barbara’s favorite native plants include trout lily, wood lily, meadow beauty; the non-carex sedge, <em>Cyperus squarrosus,</em> bearded flatsedge, whose seeds look like the basket for a hot air balloon when viewed under a microscope.. Her greatest pleasure comes from stumbling upon unusual species, “I like rare plants quite frankly. I like to find something off-beat.” Barbara mentions upcoming “trouble” for the Calumet Bike Trail with the expansion of the South Shore Railroad through their double-track project, land of which she extensively surveyed for and found rare plants.<br /> <br /> Barbara admires the native conifers, and spoke of the special white cedars of Cowles Bog that grow close to her home- the last existing stand of its kind in Indiana. She recalled a story related to her that she attributes to their decline in the region, “The depression caused people to cut white cedars for heat. And then I am told that once near Clark and Pine were cut for Christmas trees. And there was a story about people buying two seats on the train to Chicago, one seat was for the passenger and one was for the christmas tree.” Barbara looks positively to the future, having noticed members of her own community become more understanding of the purpose and goals of restoration.<br /> <br /> In a Dune Acres Historical Commision interview from 1995, Barbara commented on places in the region she’d still want to see:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“There are records from early visitors that describe places that I haven’t been able to see. There were a group of botanists, a regular crew almost, that got off one South Shore stop or another, and of course they couldn’t get much farther than they could walk, but they left the most tantalizing records of one kind or another. They mention more bogs, or so-called bogs, and I know where two of them were. It just makes me sick that they were drained… But most of all, I’d like to have seen the Dunes before any European settlers arrived or before timbering and draining started. At that time, Northern Indiana has been described as a ‘land of slow moving streams.’ I’d like to have seen it then.” </p> <p><br /> Today Barbara still lives in the Indiana Dunes region, surrounded with the flora, fauna, and community she loves so much. </p> <h3>Bibliography</h3> <p> July 16, 1995; The Vidette-Messenger of Porter County, Valparaiso, IN<br /> • By Nora Rinehammer ; “A place to call home” ; Page 29<br /> <br />  December 8th, 1961; the New Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, NM<br /> • “Miss Wykes, Geoffrey Plampin Reveal December Nuptial Plans” Page 18<br /> <br />  April 26, 1960; The Albuquerque Tribune; Albuquerque, NM<br /> • “U Government Head Named” Page 9 <br /> <br />  August 20, 1991; Vidette Messenger of Porter County, Valparaiso, IN<br /> • “By Nora Rinehammer ; “Go take a hike!” Page 9<br /> <br />  March 24, 1994; The South Bend tribune, South Bend, IN<br /> • “Program on ‘Women of Dunes’” Page 13<br /> <br /> <em>The content for this article was written by Joseph Gruzalski, a researcher with Indiana Dunes National Park.

            "bodyText": "<p>John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower was born on August 3, 1922, in Denver Colorado. The second son and only surviving child of Dwight David Eisenhower and his wife Mamie, John’s life was shaped by the career of his famous father.<br /> <br /> When John was born, Dwight and Mamie were still mourning their first child, a young boy named Doud. Nicknamed \"Icky\", Doud died of Scarlet Fever on January 2, 1921, at the age of three. While he was not their only son, he was the one who lived a full life, one that much like his father was dedicated to the service of his country.<br /> <br /> John grew up in the lifestyle typical of military families, which meant frequent moves and long periods separated from his father. At the time of John’s birth, his Dwight Eisenhower was stationed in Panama. The hot and humid tropical conditions in Panama with limited medical care greatly concerned the Eisenhowers. Mamie decided that it was better to stay with her parents in Denver and deliver the baby with access to better health care.  <br /> <br /> Over the course of John’s childhood, the family moved across the United States and the world. In 1928 the family was stationed in France so Ike could work on a guidebook dedicated to the battlefields of the First World War. There, John not only attended school but traveled with his family around Europe. In the 1930s, the Eisenhowers settled in Washington D.C., though afterwards Ike—then Major Eisenhower—was sent to the Philippines. Mamie and John remained in the United States for a year to allow John to finish the 8th grade. Once the family was reunited, John enrolled at the Bishop Brent School in Baguio, where he graduated high school.<br /> <br /> Graduating from high school is a pivotal moment for any young person, and as John Eisenhower stood at a crossroad in his own life, so too did the rest of the world. On the eve of World War II, as the world descended into another global conflict, John Eisenhower made the fateful decision to follow in his father’s footsteps and attend West Point. He entered as a cadet in 1941, just months before the U.S. entered the Second World War.<br /> <br /> John and his fellow classmates had a much different experience then Ike’s generation. These cadets trained and studied knowing their country was at war. They became the class of 1944, graduating a year early as the need for officers in the field grew more urgent. Their graduation date was set for June 6.  Little could John and his fellow cadets have guessed they would share their graduation date with one of the most vital dates in the war, the Allied invasion of Normandy, known today as D-Day.<br /> <br /> After John’s graduation, his entry into the army came with its own set of difficulties. Lieutenant John Eisenhower was given leave to spend time with his father in France, but he hoped thereafter to serve as an infantry platoon commander. This hope was soon dashed as concerns arose over what would happen to Ike if John should be captured or killed during the conflict. John spent the remainder of the war away from the frontlines, working in intelligence and administrative duties in England and Germany.<br /> <br /> After the war in 1947, John Eisenhower married Barbara Thompson, daughter of Col. Percy Walter Thompson. The couple went on to have four children, David (b.1948), Anne (b.1949), Susan (b.1951) and Mary Jean (b.1955.)  John earned a master’s degree in English and comparative literature from Columbia University before teaching English at West Point, though global events called him back into active service.<br /> <br /> John returned to active duty during the Korean War, seeing combat for the first time. It was during the Korean War that his father’s life would take a second dramatic turn and once again change the trajectory of his own.<br /> <br /> While John was fighting in Korea, Ike was campaigning for the presidency. Having already survived one war as the son of prominent general, now John was faced with the very real possibility of serving while being the son of the president of the United States. This led to a very frank conversation between father and son where the two came to an understanding that John could never be captured alive. John accepted the fact that he would have to take his own life rather than become an instrument of blackmail in the event of his capture. Later in life John expressed a strong opinion that children of active presidents should not serve in combat zones.<br /> <br /> After Korea, John worked in his father's presidential administration. He served as Assistant Staff Secretary in the White House, on the Army's General Staff, and in the White House as an assistant to General Andrew Goodpaster. In 1958, John Eisenhower purchased a small property close to his parents’ farm outside of Gettysburg so his children could be close to their grandparents when they left the White House.<br /> <br /> During his father’s retirement, John acted as an aid to his father while General Eisenhower wrote his two presidential memoirs. He retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 1963, though he eventually achieved the rank of a brigadier general in the Reserves. John eventually sold his home in Gettysburg and became a part of the Nixon administration, serving as ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971. President Nixon later appointed John Chairman of the Interagency Classification Review Committee. In 1975, he served President Gerald Ford as chairman of the President's Advisory Committee on Refugees.<br /> <br /> In addition to his career in the military and the government, John also had a passion for history. He was a prolific writer, publishing ten military history books. His first book The Bitter Woods, a study of the Battle of the Bulge, came out in 1969. He continued to write about the Second World War, the Mexican American War, as well as memoirs of his life and relationship with his famous father.<br /> <br /> For many years, John held the title of the oldest living presidential child and used that status to occasionally remark on the political climate of the time. John Eisenhower passed away at his home in Trappe Maryland in December of 2013 at the age of 91. He is buried in the West Point Cemetery. </p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Larry Itliong (pronunciation: LEH-ree EET-lee-AW-ng) was a Filipino American labor organizer and civil rights activist who played a central role in the founding of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union. Itliong is best known for his role in the 1965-1966 strike and boycott against California grape growers and the subsequent founding of the UFW union. However, Itliong’s activism was a lifelong endeavor that began much earlier. For more than four decades, he organized and advocated on behalf of farm and cannery workers, immigrants, and Asian Americans.</p> <h2>Early Life</h2> <p>Modesto “Larry” Dulay Itliong was born October 25, 1913, in the Pangasinan province of the Philippines, then a U.S. territory. He was one of six children of Artemio and Francesca Itliong. He had only a sixth-grade education when left his home in the San Nicolas municipality for the United States in 1929 at the age of fifteen. Itliong hoped to continue his education in the United States. However, he arrived during the dire economic conditions of the Great Depression and pervasive racial violence and rhetoric against Filipinos and other immigrants. These conditions prevented him from realizing his academic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Although Filipinos were technically American nationals, they faced legal and social discrimination. Anti-miscegenation laws prevented Filipinos (who were overwhelmingly young men) from marrying white women. Police raided Filipino dancehalls and violent mobs targeted Filipino communities. The only work available to most Filipinos was low-paid agricultural, cannery, and domestic work. Itliong’s experience of racism and economic injustice gave rise to a lifetime of activism.</p> <h2>Itliong’s Early Organizing at the Alaska Canneries</h2> <p>Like many other Filipinos in America at the time, Itliong “followed the seasons.” He migrated up and down the West Coast to fill short-term labor needs, such as planting, tending, and harvesting different crops. Mostly young single men, Filipinos crowded into jalopies or hitched rides on boxcars to find the next job. Many Filipinos, including Itliong, made their way to Seattle each year. Here, they signed contracts to spend the summer working in Alaska’s salmon canneries, a critical site for Filipino labor organizing in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Itliong’s first experience with organizing came in 1930, shortly after he first arrived in the United States. He was among 1,500 farmworkers to walk out of the lettuce fields near Monroe, Washington, on strike. By 1933, he organized farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley. This was one of many strikes that were part of a growing movement in Filipino farmworker organizing during the 1930s. Itliong also helped found the Alaska Cannery Workers Union, which later became Local 7 of the United Cannery, Agricultural and Packinghouse Workers of America (UCAPAWA). His efforts with the union fought for a contract that offered workers an eight-hour workday with overtime. Itliong emerged as a leader in the Filipino American community of “Manongs” – respected elder workers who were crucial in shaping the labor movement. </p> <h2>Itliong, Stockton, and the Farmworkers Movement </h2> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwarii/index.htm\">World War II</a>, Itliong served as a steward on a US Army transport ship. After the war, he settled in Stockton, California, where he started a family and resumed his activism. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Itliong continued to organize farmworkers as a member of UCAPAWA and later the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). Itliong also became involved in Filipino community and civic organizations like the Legionarios del Trabajo (League of Workers) and the Filipino Voters League. <br /> <br /> In 1948, Itliong, along with Philip Vera Cruz and other labor leaders, participated in the 1948 asparagus strike in Stockton. The asparagus strike was the first major U.S. agricultural strike after World War II. In 1956, Itliong continued his organizing work with the Filipino Farm Labor Union (FFLU) in Stockton. Itliong was asked to organize for the Agricultural Worker’s Organizing Committee (AWOC), a newly chartered union in the AFL-CIO in 1959. Though the union was largely Filipino, it included Mexican, Arab, Black, and white workers within its ranks.</p> <h2>United Farm Workers and the Delano Farmworkers Grape Strike</h2> <p>In 1965, Itliong and the AWOC led 1,500 Filipino farmworkers on a strike against the grape growers in and around Delano, California. But grape growers could easily replace the striking workers. A successful strike required the support of Mexican farmworkers, many of whom were represented by the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) organized by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cech/index.htm\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cech/index.htm\">ésar Chávez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dolores-huerta.htm\">Dolores Huerta</a>. Chavez was hesitant to join the strike as he believed that the Mexican farmworkers needed more time to be organized. However, Itliong convinced him  to bring the NFWA to join forces with the AWOC. Together, they commenced the massive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/labor/the-road-to-sacramento-marching-for-justice-in-the-fields.htm\">1965–1966 grape strike and boycott</a>.<br /> <br /> In 1967, the two unions officially merged to become the United Farm Workers, AFL-CIO (UFW). Chavez was the director and Itliong was the assistant director. In the years that followed, the UFW drew national attention to the plight of farmworkers through highly publicized boycotts and marches. Through their efforts, the UFW won labor contracts that guaranteed farmworkers higher wages and safer working conditions.<br /> <br /> However, tensions and internal conflict emerged within UFW. Chavez and Itliong’s leadership styles and viewpoints were in conflict. Chavez saw the union as more of a social movement, while Itliong approached it as a more traditional trade union. In 1971, Itliong resigned from the union.</p> <h2>Itliong’s Later Organizing Years</h2> <p>Itliong continued to organize for workers’ rights. Itliong traveled to defend and organize farm workers in Brazil and Chile in solidarity with other labor movements across the world. In addition, he was an elected delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.  He helped to establish the Paulo Agbayani Retirement Village, a retirement community for aging Filipino farmworkers. Agbayani opened its doors in 1974. Itliong remained politically active as a member of the Filipino American Political Association. His community activism continued until his death in 1977 at the age of 63. He was laid to rest in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gravesites-of-larry-itliong-and-richard-ch-vez.htm\">North Kern Cemetery</a> in Delano, California. </p> <h2>Legacy</h2> <p>Larry Itliong is remembered as one of the “fathers of the West Coast labor movement” and a key figure within the Asian American movement. In 1995, the first mural honoring Filipino American farmworkers was completed in Los Angeles’ Historic Filipinotown, which features Itliong. In 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill designating October 25 as Larry Itliong Day in California. Itliong’s story of labor and union organizing among migrant farm workers sheds light on the history of Filipino American activism within the civil rights era.</p> <hr /> <p><em>This article was written by Roneva Keel, PhD, an ACLS Fellow with the National Capital Region, and edited by Marjorie Justine Antonio, NCPE Intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em></p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Learn More</span><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/labor/index.htm\">Labor History Subject Site</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/labor/the-road-to-sacramento-marching-for-justice-in-the-fields.htm\">Series: The Road to Sacramento: Marching for Justice in the Fields</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gravesites-of-larry-itliong-and-richard-ch-vez.htm\">Gravesites of Larry Itliong and Richard Chavez</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/filipino-hall.htm\">Filipino Community Hall: Cultural Center of Delano</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/series.htm?id=2ADF5D62-CE7E-2C9C-10EE4A5897D2A28A\">Series: Curiosity Kit: César Chávez</a></p> <h2>Sources</h2> <p>Aroy, Marissa, dir. <i>Delano Manongs: Forgotten Heroes of the United Farm Workers</i>.

After receiving her PhD, Meitner moved to Berlin, Germany to work with physicist Max Planck and chemist Otto Hahn. Meitner and Hahn would work together for over 30 years; in 1918 they co-discovered the element protactinium. <br /> <br /> In 1922, Meitner became the first female full professor of physics at the University of Berlin. In 1926, Meitner began her research on nuclear fission. In 1938, with Nazi Germany seizing power, Meitner fled Berlin, first to the Netherlands and then Stockholm, Sweden. That same year, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann developed evidence of nuclear fission, but it was Meitner and her nephew, physicist Otto Frisch, who theorized that the process resulted from the uranium nucleus splitting in two. Meitner and Frisch were the first to call the process “fission”, and in 1939 they published a scientific paper explaining the process. <br /> <br /> In 1942, Meitner was invited to work on the Manhattan Project but adamantly refused, stating “I will have nothing to do with a bomb!” After the war, Meitner continued to avoid any connection to her research and the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> In 1944, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Otto Hahn for his work on nuclear fission; Meitner and Frisch’s contributions were not recognized. After the war, Meitner continued living and working in Sweden, traveling throughout the United States to give lectures. Recognition for her scientific contributions included the Max Planck Medal in 1949 and the Enrico Fermi Award alongside Hahn and Strassmann in 1966. Lise Meitner died in England in 1968. </p>",

Shortly thereafter they emigrated to the United States. Initially studying writing at Hunter College in New York, Russell was inspired to switch her studies to chemistry in 1943 after working as a research assistant at Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. Russell graduated with an A.B. in Chemistry in 1945 from Hunter College and a PhD in Zoology from the University of Chicago in 1949.  <br /> <br /> In 1947, she and her husband William Russell moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee where she began work at ORNL and Y-12 studying teratogenesis, damage to developing embryos. Russell’s findings led to regulations regarding x-rays on pregnant women. Her research was primarily conducted on mice; the Y-12 facility where she worked became known as the “Mouse House”.  <br /> <br /> Later in life, Russell and her husband became staunch environmental conservationists. In 1966, she formed the Tennessee Citizens for Wilderness Planning conservation organization. In 1968, the organization helped pass the Tennessee State Scenic Rivers Act, which helped to protect the nearby Cumberland River.  <br /> <br /> Dr. Russell received numerous awards and accolades for her groundbreaking research, including the Enrico Fermi Award in 1994, the Department of Energy’s highest research honor. Dr. Liane B.

            "bodyText": "<p>Elijah Abel (also spelled Able or Ables) was born in Maryland in 1810, possibly into slavery. An early convert to Mormonism (officially, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or LDS Church) and one of the faith’s first Black members, Abel gathered with other Latter-day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, soon after his 1832 baptism. Four years later, in 1836, Ambrose Palmer—a presiding Elder in Ohio—ordained Abel. Later that year, in December, Abel was ordained a <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/quorum-of-the-seventy?lang=eng\">Seventy</a> (a member of an important council of Church leaders) by Zebedee Coltrin; this distinction gave him limited authority to organize and proselytize on behalf of the Latter-day Saints, with the primary duty of administering and spreading the LDS faith. Also in 1836, at the direction of LDS Church founder Joseph Smith, Jr., Abel received his ritual washings and anointings in the Kirtland Temple. He also received a blessing from Joseph Smith, Sr., the patriarch of the church. Abel’s patriarchal blessing was different from those received by his fellow white Saints. Smith pronounced him an “orphan,” promising that “thou shalt be made equal to thy brethren, and thy soul be white in eternity and thy robes glittering.” Abel’s blessing showed that, while Black people could claim some space in early Mormonism, they were also subject to a racial “othering” that differentiated them other church members.”<br /> <br /> In the earliest years of his missionary service, Abel labored in New York and Canada, where his activities generated enough controversy among non-Mormons and his fellow missionaries that church leaders took notice.<sup> </sup>Non-Mormon residents of St. Lawrence County accused Abel of murdering a woman and five children, but he successfully fought the charge. After that, his fellow missionaries in Canada complained about the content of his teachings and claimed that Abel had threatened to assault a fellow missionary. (He admitted to the latter, but with the rejoinder that “knocking around with Brothers” was commonplace.)<sup> </sup>Church leaders chose not to take any disciplinary action against him.<br /> <br /> In 1839 Abel left Canada for Nauvoo, Illinois, where Joseph Smith, Jr. and about ten thousand of his followers had relocated after their expulsion from the state of Missouri. Abel spent three years there living on property <a href=\"https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/bond-to-elijah-able-8-december-1839/1\">he purchased from Smith</a>.  During that time he employed his carpentry skills, even serving as an undertaker in what had become one of the state’s most populous cities. In 1842, for reasons that remain unclear, Abel moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he helped serve the local LDS community as a church leader. While in Cincinnati, Abel met and married Mary Ann Adams, a Black woman who had been born in Tennessee in 1829—making her approximately twenty years younger than her new husband.<br /> <br /> Abel had grown close to the Smith family while in Nauvoo, and his activities in New York and Canada added to his notoriety. His visibility as a Black ordained elder, however, created some consternation among other church leaders. In 1843, during a regional conference in Cincinnati, apostles John E. Page, Orson Pratt, and Heber Kimball presided over a discussion of Abel’s standing in the church. Page argued that, while he respected Abel, “wisdom forbid that we should introduce [him] before the public.” In other words, given the nation’s deep divisions over issues of race and slavery, Page thought it unwise for the Latter-day Saints to appear racially progressive. Pratt and Kimball echoed Page’s concerns and the trio drafted a resolution to restrict Abel’s duties, confining him to local work and instructing him to work only with Cincinnati’s Black population. The conference marked the first documented placement of racially-based restrictions upon a priesthood officeholder. <br /> <br /> Following the death of Joseph Smith at Carthage, Illinois, in 1844, Latter-day Saints moved to the Great Basin—where Abel found further changes for him as a Black member of the church. The exact reasons for these changes are not entirely known. One factor, however, appears to be the tensions that arose from the confluence of U.S. territorial expansion and the nation’s mounting sectional crisis that led to the Compromise of 1850 and legalization of slavery in the newly-formed Territory of Utah. <a>In 1852 Brigham Young, Joseph Smith’s successor and Utah Territory’s first governor, addressed Utah’s newfound status as a slave territory by </a><a href=\"http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/sermons_talks_interviews/brigham1852feb5_priesthoodandblacks.htm\">telling the territorial legislature</a> that men of Black descent were not eligible for the priesthood. Consequently, neither Black men nor women would be allowed to participate in the temple endowment or sealing ordinances.<br /> <br /> The following year Elijah and Mary Ann migrated to Salt Lake City along with their children Moroni, Enoch, and Anna. That same year, Abel petitioned Young to receive the temple endowment and be sealed to his wife and children. While Young officially kept Abel’s priesthood status intact, he denied the petition—marking perhaps the first documented instance of a person of color being denied this particular privilege. More broadly, this refusal was one of the first times that a person of color was denied participation in practices central to the Mormon faith.  <br /> <br /> After Young’s death in 1877, Abel again petitioned to be allowed to participate in the temple endowment and sealing ordinances. Once again, however, the church refused him. Despite being denied full access to the rights and privileges of the priesthood, Abel remained devout and soldiered on with his missionary activities. He served three more missions, making his last trip to the eastern states in 1883, the year before his death. Abel died on 25 December 1884, due to “exposure while laboring in the ministry in Ohio.”<br /> <br /> When Young made his declaration in 1852 regarding Blacks and the priesthood, he also declared that at some future date Black church members would “have the privilege of all we have the privilege of and more.” In 1978, almost a century after Elijah’s death, the LDS Church re-opened the priesthood to men of African descent. More than twenty years later, in September 2002, the church sent apostle M. Russell Ballard to dedicate <a href=\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/939027/New-monument-erected-to-honor-Elijah-Abel-family.html\">a monument that had been erected in Salt Lake City</a> to honor Elijah and Mary Ann Abel’s “[contributions] to the early growth of the state and to their chosen faith.”<br /> <br /> <i>(Special thanks to UNM PhD candidate Angela Reiniche for compiling this information; thanks also to Chad M.

In 1933, during the rise of Nazi Germany, Szilard moved to England to study nuclear chain reactions. In 1940, he became a US citizen and began work at New York’s Columbia University. One year prior, Szilard, with the assistance of colleagues Albert Einstein, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner, wrote the famous “Einstein Letter” warning President Franklin Roosevelt of Germany’s potential plans to create an atomic weapon and urging the United States to do the same.</p> <br /> <br /> In 1942, Szilard began work on the Chicago Pile (CP-1) during his tenure as chief physicist at the Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory (Met Lab) under the direction of Arthur Compton. While Szilard was a key player in the development of the atomic bomb, he was very suspicious of having the Manhattan Project be under military control, preferring civilian control and urging the limited use of atomic weapons, in July of 1945 going so far as to request the bomb not be dropped on Hiroshima. His request never made it to President Truman’s desk.<br /> <br /> In 1946, Szilard resigned from the Met Lab and continued research and teaching at the University of Chicago through the 1950s, all while advocating for limited nuclear weapons development and urging the peaceful use of nuclear power. Szilard died of a heart attack in California in 1964.",

A theoretical physicist, he received his PhD from Germany’s University of Gottingen in 1927 and joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley and Caltech the same year. In 1942, General Leslie Groves, leader of the Manhattan Project, appointed Oppenheimer to lead Site Y, the secret weapons research and development facility at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Oppenheimer served as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory until 1945. During this time, Oppenheimer led the effort to design and construct the world’s first atomic bombs, culminating with the successful Trinity test on July 16, 1945.</p> After the war, Oppenheimer served as an advisor to the Atomic Energy Commission, worked at Caltech, and became director for the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In the 1950s, at the height of the communist “Red Scare”, Oppenheimer’s past perceived communist leanings and his speaking out against the development of the hydrogen bomb led the Atomic Energy Commission to revoke his security clearance, effectively ending his political influence. Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in 1967.",

In 1927, he became Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Rome. It was here in 1934 that Fermi and his colleagues split uranium without fully realizing it, researched nuclear transformation, and discovered slow neutrons, which aided in the discovery of nuclear fission. For these efforts, Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938. That same year, to escape fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, Fermi and his family left for the United States.</p> <br /> <br /> In 1942, Fermi developed the Chicago Pile (CP-1) at the University of Chicago. An experimental nuclear reactor, CP-1 went critical on December 2, 1942. After this breakthrough, Fermi was recruited by J. Robert Oppenheimer to be associate director at Los Alamos. Fermi was the first person to insert a uranium slug into the B Reactor at Hanford. He was present when the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical at Oak Ridge and witnessed the Trinity test in the New Mexico desert.<br /> <br /> After the war, Fermi became a professor at the University of Chicago, dying of stomach cancer in 1954.",

Son of a college professor, Chanute received private school education in New York and quickly began work in the engineering field as a surveyor in 1848 for the Hudson River Railroad. Over his career, Chanute built a reputation as one of the most successful engineers in America. Chanute served as President of several civil engineering organizations including the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Western Society of Engineers, among others. He was responsible for designing the first bridge over the Missouri River at Kansas City, and supervised the construction of railroads opening the West. Virtually every cow driven north from Texas passed through the stockyards in either Chicago or Kansas City, both designed by Chanute. His services as a civil engineer and urban planner were critical to the development of towns across the West.<br /> <br /> <br /> By 1888, Octave Chanute, now one of the most successful civil engineers in the nation, had established both a consulting practice and a wood preservation firm in Chicago. At last he would have some spare time to pursue his hobby – flying machines. Chanute had been fascinated by the problem of flight for almost three decades. He had corresponded with virtually every major aeronautical experimenter in the world, and sponsored discussion of flight at important engineering conferences. The first fruit of his effort was the publication of Progress in Flying Machines in 1894. The most important book published on aviation up to that time, the volume provided a remarkably complete record of what had been accomplished in the past and pointed a way to the future.<br />  </p> <p>By 1894, inspired by the work of the German glider experimenter Otto Lilienthal, Chanute began to develop his own glider designs capable of carrying human beings into the air. Anxious to provide employment for young flying machine enthusiasts, as well to advance his own work, he began contracting for the construction of his most promising glider designs.<br />  </p> <p>Chanute selected the sand dunes along the southern shore of Lake Michigan as the perfect place to test his design ideas. The area was close to Chicago and sparsely populated, offering a number of important advantages including steady winds, dunes from which a glider could be launched in any direction, and an abundance of sand for soft landings.<br />  </p> <p>On June 22, 1896, Chanute and his four assitants rode the Lake Shore railroad to Millers, Indiana; within the present city limits of Gary. The men caused a stir of excitement among the locals as they unloaded their odd-looking luggage and headed towards the lake. Upon reaching the dunes, they pitched their tents and assembled the first glider to be tested. Augustus Herring, the most experienced member of the group, had brought a glider based on the Lilienthal design. William Avery, a Chicago carpenter, had constructed, a multi-wing design to Chanute’s specifications, while William Butusov would attempt to launch his own glider, the Albatross, down a wooden ramp. Dr. James Ricketts, a Chicago physician with “a slack practice and a taste for aeronautics,” was on hand to provide emergency medical services.<br /> <img alt=\"historic image of a man about standing on a hill about to take off in a glider from the standing position.

The group returned to Chicago on July 4th. They would spend the next month repairing their various craft, and building a new glider featuring three wings set one on top of the other and braced together with an innovative design, the Pratt truss configuration that Chanute had employed in constructing railroad bridges.<br /> <img alt=\"Black and white photograph of seven men, seated and standing near a large white tent in front of a sand dune.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7400195|0|\" src=\"/people/images/dune-park-camp-1896-sept.jpg\" title=\"Octave Chanute's Dune Park camp\" /></p> <p><em>Caption: The Chanute camp in Dune Park, Indiana in September 1896.

After some early disappointments, the team removed the bottom wing of the glider, repositioned the tail, resulting in the perfect biplane design. With that modification complete, Herring and Avery were soon making repeated flights of over 200 feet in length, traveling up to 358 feet through the air. When the group broke camp on September 26th, 1896 they had completed several hundred flights with the biplane. At that time, the little biplane was the most successful heavier-than-air flying machine in the world.<br /> <img alt=\"Black and white photograph of Octave Chanute standing on a sand dune holding his bi-wing glider.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7400200|0|\" src=\"/people/images/octave-and-glider.jpg\" title=\"Octave Chanute and bi-wing glider\" /><br /> <em>Caption: Octave Chanute holds his biwing glider design on top of a dune. At sixty-four years of age, Octave left the experimental \"glides\" to his younger companions. Photograph from Calumet Regional Archives, IU Northwest. </em><br />  </p> <p>The 1896 Chanute-Herring biplane tested on the Indiana Dunes proved to be a key step on the road to the invention of the airplane. Herring continued to experiment with the design of his own over the next five years. Chanute’s publication of the plans and specifications for the glider sparked a renewed interest in flight both in America and Europe. Chanute work was able to encourage and attract many young engineering talents into aviation. Two such enthusiasts were the brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright.<br /> <br /> <br /> “For some years now, I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man.” These now famous words begin the first letter written by Wilbur to Chanute on May 13, 1900. “In appearance,” Wilbur noted, “it is is similar to the ‘double-deck’ machine with which the experiments of yourself and Mr. Herring were conducted in 1896-1897.” This letter sparked enthusiasm and a friendship which spanned more than 430 letters over the next 10 years helping Wilbur and Orville connect to a small group of private aviation enthusiasts.<br /> <br /> <br /> Cordial correspondences continued in 1900 in which Wilbur wished to remain transparent about his findings and progress which included detailed notes regarding materials, pilot position and advanced calculations of wind resistances. August 4, 1901 Chanute made a trip to Kitty Hawk NC from Chicago in order to see the Wright’s project firsthand (pictured below, Chanute on the far left with associate C. Huffaker). Chanute took notes, aided with measurements and most importantly took many photographs of the experimental glides. Chanute stayed as guest with the brothers for a weeks’ time. Chanute also visited the brother’s camp in 1902 and 1903.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Men sitting and standing in a building\" data-render=\"1|0|0|1|638|400|0|0|0\" height=\"400\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6594896|0|\" src=\"/people/images/chanute_kitty_hawk.jpg\" title=\"chanute_kitty_hawk\" width=\"638\" /></p> <p><em>Chanute visits the Wrights at Kitty Hawk in 1901. Image Courtesy of the Library of Congress. Alt Text: Historic photo of four men standing in the shade of a wooden building.</em><br />  </p> <p>Chanute’s final visit to Kitty Hawk was in November of 1903, roughly one month prior to the historic first powered flight achieved on December 17, 1903. The years following the 1903 flight presented a new set of challenges for the friendship. The brothers believed their flyer unique and needed to protect their invention which contrasted with Chanute’s open approach and clouded the nature of the relationship. Chanute offered consistent encouragement and publicity for their work and despite the later disagreements, Chanute was the Wright’s most important correspondent in the aeronautic community.<br /> <br /> <br /> While disagreements drove the three men apart after 1905, the Wrights never forgot how important the friendship and inspiration of Octave Chanute had been during those early years. When Chanute died in 1910 Wilbur attended the memorial service and wrote the eulogy read at the Aero Club of Illinois in 1911. “His labors had vast influence in bringing about the era of human flight,” Wilbur Wright observed after Chanute’s death. “No one was too humble to receive a share of his time. In patience and goodness of heart he has rarely been surpassed. Few men were more universally respected and loved.”<br /> <br /> <strong>Sources:</strong></p> <ul> <li>loc.gov, Articles and Essays, Wilbur and Orville Wright Papers at the Library of Congress, <i>The belief</i> <i>that flight is possible to man</i>.</li> <li><i>Progress in Flying Machines</i>, Preface, Ocatve Chanute, New York: Dover, 1897/1984 (internet readable</li> <li>Magazine Hearst, Popular Mechanics, <i>The Death of Octave Chanute</i>, January 1911</li> <li>Chicagology.com, Journal of the Western Society of Engineers May 1911, Part I-<i>Ocatve Chanute: The Father of Aviation, </i>and<i> In Memoriam Ocatve Chanute</i></li> <li>lib.niu.edu, Ocatve Chanute, <i>The Chicago Connection, and the Birth of Aviation by Roger Launius.</i></li> <li><em>On Wind's Wings, Octave Chanute and the Indiana Dunes; </em>Nick D'Alto<em>, Traces, </em>Vol. 15 No. 2<em>, </em>Indiana Historical Society, 2003.</li> </ul>",

As Diana of the Dunes, she spent nearly a decade among the sands in makeshift lakeshore shacks before her untimely death near today’s West Beach; she seeked solitude, advocated for dunes conservation and left an eternal imprint in the sands.</h3> <h4>Quote from her:</h4> <p>“I feel sure, someway, that I shall always be a braver and stronger woman than I was before...”<br /> -Alice</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“To study Alice Gray is to learn about digging our toes in the sand and standing firm, despite the inevitable shifting that takes place beneath our feet.”<br /> -Janet Zenke Edwards</p> <h3>Alice Mabel Gray Biography</h3> <p>Alice Mabel Gray was the fifth of six children of Sallie and Ambrose Gray. Her parents moved to Chicago from Brown County, Indiana in 1873, just a couple years after the Great Chicago Fire. They brought with them their two little girls, Nannie and Lenora and their son Hugh. The fourth child, Harry, was born a few years after their move. Alice was born in Chicago on March 25th, 1881.<br /> <br /> Alice began at South Division High School in 1893, known for its emphasis in classical studies. As a sophomore she was awarded one of the school’s two Victor F. Lawson medals for academic excellence. Alice later wrote:<br /> <br /> It was a poem of Byron's called `Solitude' that gave me my first longings to get away from the conventional world, and I never gave up the idea, although a long time passed before I could fulfill it.<br /> <br /> High school may have been where Alice was introduced to Lord Byron’s work.  The poem reads:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,<br /> To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,<br /> Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,<br /> And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;<br /> To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,<br /> With the wild flock that never needs a fold;<br /> Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean;<br /> This is not solitude, 'tis but to hold<br /> Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">But midst the crowd, the hurry, the shock of men,<br /> To hear, to see, to feel and to possess,<br /> And roam alone, the world's tired denizen,<br /> With none who bless us, none whom we can bless;<br /> Minions of splendour shrinking from distress!<br /> None that, with kindred consciousness endued,<br /> If we were not, would seem to smile the less<br /> Of all the flattered, followed, sought and sued;<br /> This is to be alone; this, this is solitude!</p> <p><br /> By 1895, Alice was the oldest sibling still living at the Gray home in Chicago. Her father suffered incapacitating burns from his employment that year. Ambrose was a city lamplighter, and an accident with leaking gasoline ignited his clothing. Alice, who was just 14 years old, had to absorb major responsibilities as her father was bedridden for the rest of his life. This included looking out for her younger brother, Chester. Her mother Sallie managed household affairs, and kept the family together by hard work, raising poultry, and vegetables.<br /> <br /> In high school, Alice and two classmates were collectively known as the “College Class.” Fittingly, Alice continued her education by enrolling at the University of Chicago in fall of 1897. During her undergraduate years she studied two languages, French and German. She excelled in mathematics, and she also focused on astronomy and theology. She studied these classics at a time when much of academia considered those subjects primarily for men. Alice’s mother died of tuberculosis in February of 1902, during her fourth year at the university. Although her grades dropped temporarily, she brought them back up the next semester. Years later she wrote in her diary, “Just think, dear. I have never had a friend, except my mother, who died thirteen years ago.” Despite this hardship, Alice graduated in 1903 with the University’s mathematics department’s highest distinction, an “Honorable Mention for Excellence in Senior College Work.”<br /> <br /> That fall, Alice left Chicago for Washington D.C. at age 22. She worked at the U.S. Naval Observatory as a “computer,” performing tedious calculations at a time when women were just given the opportunity for this type of work. Although other computers left photographic trails of luncheons and get-togethers, traces of Alice have not been found. Her employee file reads “Miss Gray… had cut her hair short. She also worked in pants!” After about three years of this work, she moved across the globe to Germany to study higher mathematics at the University of Gottingen, an international mathematics center of the time. From the winter of 1906 through the summer of 1908, Miss Gray was admitted as a “guest-listener.”<br /> <br /> She left Europe as a second-class passenger on the ship Kensington, which brought her back to North America by way of Montreal. Within a month of arriving home to the Windy City, she enrolled in graduate studies at the University of Chicago. She took theoretical mathematics courses for a year before pivoting her focus to philosophy for three more years; before discontinuing her formal education altogether. Years later she wrote of some regret:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If I had had faith and gone on energetically with either mathematics, or logic, or ethics, or literature, or politics, or any combination of two or more of the five, or anything else under the sun, doubtless it would have been well with me.</p> <p><br /> Alice was drawn to leave the city again. She had longings to get away from the conventional world. She wrote, \"I wanted to live my own life— a free life. The life of a salary earner in the cities is slavery, a constant fight for the means of living. Here it is so different.” Seeking solitude, the thirty-four year old boarded the South Shore train with little more than a blanket, and two pistols on Halloween of 1915. She rode the rails to the Indiana Dunes. Alice would say a year later: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I was working in Chicago, making little in the way of money, doing little of importance in the world, it seemed. I had measured myself with the world—and the results were not encouraging. I came here to measure myself with nature.</p> <p><br /> The first four nights in the dunes Alice spent under the stars that she marveled. Requiring more shelter than a blanket, she quickly found a new home. She was permitted to use Flora and William Richardson’s nearby “Sassafras Lodge” in today’s Dune Acres, so long as the couple was not using it. Their “lodge” was a tee-pee nestled into the back of a high dune, providing relief from the harsh winds and winter storms near the shore. After just over a week in the Dunes, she wrote of their beauty in her diary:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Now, on this cloudy afternoon, as I sit and look over the milky green on the lake between the trees defined at the horizon with something darker that I should not know whether to call greenish or bluish or reddish. I feel sometimes as if I could faint with the rapture of it.</p> <p><br /> At the end of November she wrote of her conflicting emotions towards leaving the city:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Generally, especially when I write, or walk, or sing, or read, or recite my favorite poems—-I am very, very happy and contented with my lot and my course. Then once in a while I wonder if I am childish, futile, foolish, a ‘skulker’ as some one called Thoreau—-a nonentity, a shirker and a deserter and a coward and egoist. Yesterday was one of the days of such doubt of myself.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The highest bravery in the world is loyalty to one’s trust. It may simply withstanding the world, refusing to stoop to court, to compromise, letting the world and its glory pass by without a regret or a thought, willing to be thought nothing, but in reality, in one’s self possessing one’s own desire.</p> <p><br /> In December she wrote of some of the joys of her experience:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">How glorious this outdoor life is—how good life feels and tastes and smells down close to the elemental things; this blazing fire, with the white brilliance in the west, just one star high up in the southeast, the dull white snow patches in the hollow and on the southern slopes, and the snow-flecks brown of the western slope, and the light gone for writing and the time come for supper.</p> <p><br /> She continued a few days later, reflecting on the wisdom in her decision:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If I had not been so desperate I should not have thought of coming up here; and how wonderful, how unspeakably healing and sanctifying it has been living in all this beauty and this keenly vital air and in the blessed solitude.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">And now forever a sadder and wiser woman—let me forget that acridly chemical atmosphere—even corrosive atmosphere that I knew—now that I am living in the world that belongs to me and to which I belong.</p> <p><br /> Wilderness enshrouded her and necessitated a walking trip for any outside needs. Alice crossed miles of sand to local communities for supplies. Alice had a habit of visiting many families in nearby Baillytown, whom she would visit for fresh eggs, milk, and baked goods. She spent time speaking with Agnes Larson over coffee or Swedish limpa (rye) bread in her 1910 Sears Catalog House near today’s Dunes Learning Center. Agnes’ daughter Margaret recalled:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">One day when I returned home from school my mother happily said, ‘I had company today! You know people have been talking about a woman who seems to be in the dunes just like George Blagg.’ <br /> <br /> Well, this woman came to the door and had been told that mother had known all about the Bailly family…<br /> <br /> My mother invited her to come in, although she said she was perturbed since her visitor was dressed in men’s clothing and had a ‘deep voice.’ As it turned out they visited several hours when Alice got ready to leave mother loaned her our copy of Frances Howe’s French Homestead in the Old Northwest. Alice noticed the rows of books in the bookcase and said, ‘I’ll be back, please.’</p> <p><br /> After living among the sand hills for a few months, she wrote on February 14, 1916:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Friday I walked to Oak Hill and while waiting for Mrs. Larson to come home with my groceries I had the first good look I have had at myself in some time. To tell the truth, I was rather shocked. My eyes seemed to have a rather wild, strained look as if the life I was leading were very wearing on me. I said to myself that I would be afraid if I met myself alone at the crossroad in the moonlight. However, I was not so bad with my hat and coat on.<br /> <br />  …I feel sure, someway, that I shall always be a braver and stronger woman than I was before…</p> <p><br /> Alice’s agreement with the Richardson’s was apparently broken by Alice’s lack of cleanliness; Flora said, “We finally had to ask her to leave because the camp was so filthy and she herself so unkempt.” In the spring, Alice found an abandoned shack on the beach, and quickly made it her own. She named it Driftwood, and wrote in her diary, “Everything I have here, this chair, this cap I wear, these tins, are driftwood, drifting in from the lake—I too, am driftwood.” Alice began to bathe nude in Lake Michigan that spring, which drew the attention of local fishermen. When gossip spread to newspapers, reporters were dispatched to investigate the curious woman living on her own. Early papers often romanticized her— focusing more on selling papers than the truth. The Lake County Times reported in 1916:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Cleaving the water like a milk white dolphin came a mermaid. She made the shallows, rose up out of the water, then like a fabled nymph, flitted off into the shadows.</p> <p><br /> Alice wrote of her dips in Lake Michigan: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Just don’t imagine that I spend my days and nights up here going in bathing (I did go in yesterday, but I’d like to see myself going in just now with the frost still in the air), climbing hills to gaze at views and wiggling my toes before the fire. Far from it.. </p> <p><br /> Published in July of 1916, a number of articles give a deep glimpse into Alice’s first summer in the Dunes. First she was interviewed by a reporter at her shack “Driftwood.”  Alice said had been living in Flora’s “Sassafras Lodge” for nearly four months in “the pines,” and then a fisherman told her of a shack on the beach. She had a bed of pine boughs covered with an oil cloth and her blankets. Of her past, Alice called herself “a Chicago product.” She was a secretary and stenographer and the “literary nurse” for some of her instructors. Her last job was an editor at Rand, McNally Co., a rather large publishing company. She was said to speak both French and German. The article quoted Alice:  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Out on the lake, where all observers are at least three-quarters of a mile distant, I can’t see why a woman, if she chooses, may not take a daily plunge without a bathing suit. I glance up and down the shore and know how far away the intruders are and also know that their vision of me is blurred. I shall not discontinue my habits because a coroner or a sheriff has seen me bathing from miles afar.</p> <p><br /> Two days after the first article was released, a second was written of her visiting the city she left behind. She is referred to as the “nymph of the dunes,” clad in a tan suit, white oxfords and a floppy hat with pink ribbons. The article stated, “The city’s clothes and ways were heavy and wearisome and she longed for the solitude of the sands almost the moment after her arrival.” In the paper, Alice wrote of the city’s development on the lakefront, “...your millions for this, and not a quarter million to save the dunes… Is this forward looking Chicago?” She wrote of exploring today’s Navy Pier and seeing her first motion picture, although everything seemed to remind her of the lake and dunes. She wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…I love the great silent darkness up there; the silence that lives in the noise of the winds and water, the darkness that finds itself in the fleeting, eternal waves of those reaches of waste sand; the only reality of life for me is there… I must go back to them at once.</p> <p><br /> In November 1916, her image from nymph shifted to “Diana.” A newspaper commented on her duck-shooting prowess, likened her to Diana, the Roman goddess associated with wild animals and the hunt, and her moniker “Diana of the Dunes” was born. Now she reportedly wore heavy lumberman socks, a man’s cap and an overhanging gray wool skirt extending nearly to her knees.<br /> <br /> Alice found companionship with the dunes around her. She saw the region swiftly changing as development began to grab hold. She used her notoriety as a wonder from local newspapers to amplify her voice for protecting the region. On behalf of the Prairie Club, a group of early conservationists who organized the first effort to save Indiana’s dunes, Alice gave a speech at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1917. The meeting was to arouse interest in the Save the Dunes movement and to arrange preliminary details for the Dunes Pageant. Alice’s voice had been described as beautiful and lilting. She spoke to the crowd:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Besides its nearness to Chicago and its beauty, its spiritual power, there is between the Dune Country and the city a more than sentimental bond—a family tie. To see the Dunes destroyed would be for Chicago the sacrilegious sin which is not forgiven.</p> <p><br /> The papers indulged in her appearance. Although she was 35 at the time, one paper wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The girl, who is in her early twenties, shows in her face of beaming good health and happiness the reasons why she loves the dunes and will do anything to save them. She has a voice like a bird for its lilting quality, and walks with the spring of a native woodsman. Side by side in her cabin are the roughest implements for life in the open, and volumes that indicate her taste for abstruse reading and study.</p> <p><br /> While some articles romanticized Alice, press shifted negatively when her companion Paul Wilson began living with her. Sometime towards the end of 1918, Alice took in Paul, a Michigan City man who dropped his family’s last name “Eisenblatter” for unknown reasons. One paper wrote, “If romance has finally come into the life of ‘Diana of the Dunes,’... it took a ‘cave man’ to bring it to her.” Paul was noted as a “powerful man,” standing 6’2” and weighing 225 lbs. Paul had just begun to live with Alice when butter, eggs, guns, and blankets began to disappear from distant neighboring cottages. Tracks in the sand leading to Alice’s cabin led to Paul’s capture by a Chesterton marshal. The Chicago Eagle reported:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Diana came [to the jail] and gazed through the bars at the being to whom she had given shelter. He hung his head and turned away. Diana came sorrowfully forth and wept. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">‘The man asked for shelter and I had no idea he was paying for it by robbing my neighbors,’ she said. ‘I took him in because he was cold and wet and hungry.’</p> <p><br /> The two were separated as Paul was sentenced to 6 months work on a penal farm.<br /> <br /> Early 1919 was an especially harsh winter; for six weeks Alice took refuge in the home of Charles and Hulda Johnson, Swedish immigrants living in Baillytown off of today’s Route 12. She used their address for her mail, and that winter she received letters from Paul on the penal farm. The Johnson’s daughter, Irene, 10 years old that winter, recalled her time with Alice when she was 94. She remembered Alice making “the best hot cocoa,” and that they referred to her as Ms. Gray, and Paul as “jailbird.” Alice returned often, she bought bread, eggs, and blueberries from the Johnsons.<br /> <br /> After Paul was released from his work at the penal farm, he claimed they made a quick trip to Knoxville, Tennessee where they wed. Although no records have been found of a wedding, Paul devoted himself to Alice, and her company was said to subdue his temper. Around the summer of 1919, Alice and Paul moved westward down the beach to today’s West Beach in Indiana Dunes National Park. A shack built of odd planks and mismatched boards became their home, and Alice named it “Wren’s Nest.” Samuel Reck, a founder of Ogden Dunes, later described Wren’s Nest:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…just back of the first dune in a sheltered place near Polliwog Pond.  The shack was built of drift lumber and roofed with tar paper.  It consisted of one large room with a fire place in it and a smaller room, or rather closet, off the southwest corner of the shack.  The fire place was quite large, capable of taking a six foot log and equipped with a crane from which cooking pots could be suspended.  The chimney consisted of a heavy steel stack off of a tugboat.</p> <p><br /> Inside Wren’s Nest, simple furniture inevitably sank into the sand floor. Books and papers were commonplace. She wrote manuscripts and diary entries. Outside, fragrant sand cherries surrounded their rowboat and fishing gear. A newspaper described Paul doing the “man-sized duties” for Alice, including fishing, gathering wood, foraging, and repair jobs. Paul relied on Alice to visit nearby towns for food and supplies.<br /> <br /> Reck described Alice and Paul: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Diana was very pleasant to meet, quiet, cultivated voice, animated countenance when speaking, and able to converse well on a great many subjects.  She had great command over her big husband, who adored her in his uncouth way.  He was apt to fall into violent rages, though perhaps, this was an attitude assumed to keep away the curious.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Their principal occupation was fishing.  Paul had several boats, and gill net equipment.  Diana would hike to Miller with a gunny sack full of perch, sell them and with the proceeds buy such things as they needed.  She often went to the Public Library in Miller, where she was well known as a discriminating reader of good books and scientific works.  She would take an arm full of books with her and she had full library privileges.</p> <p><br /> But antagonizing and fabricated stories accelerated after the pair moved to Wren’s Nest. Paul’s burglarious past fueled skepticism in his honest living with Alice. Eugene Frank, deputy sheriff and hired watchman for nearby cottages, kept “an eagle eye” on Paul and on speaking terms they were “anything but friendly.” In 1922, a gruesome murder was discovered nearby; Paul and his unconventional partner Alice became easy scapegoats. Without evidence, newspapers unleashed unyielding allegations that haunted Alice. She responded in a newspaper herself:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I have long been considered the romantic property of the press, and I have been given a lot of undesirable notoriety. I have refused to profit by it, but I see no reason for mentioning my name, or that of my husband, in this investigation.</p> <p><br /> During these intensified tensions, Paul and Alice were confronted by a pair of fisherman brothers who dwelt near them on the beach. They told Paul that Deputy Frank said that he had seen Paul and Alice rob their fishing nets, and then warned him to stay away from their cottage.<br /> <br /> Upon hearing this, Paul and Alice decided to go to Eugene to, “ask him what he meant by saying such things.” As Paul later recalled, the deputy was noticeably drunk and shouted vile names at them. He pushed Paul off his porch, grabbed his gun from inside the fish house, and shot Paul in the foot before ramming the butt of his gun into Alice’s head.<br /> <br /> The dent in her head, Paul recollected, was half the size of his hand. Deputy Frank rounded up two of his sons with a horse and a rifle, and together they marched Alice and Paul two miles down the beach. Paul said, “When I tried to go to my wife’s assistance, Frank threatened to shoot her.” They were met by police patrol at Drusilla Carr’s dancing pavilion. Alice had a three inch skull fracture and she was taken to Mercy Hospital in Gary. Frank and Paul were taken to Miller’s police station. Paul was taken into custody and Frank was booked and charged with assault and battery with intent.<br /> <br /> A 1922 article relaying this story also stated that Alice and Paul had recently been linked with the mysterious charred remains found miles down the beach, but they had a diary that freed them of any connection. Alice recalled how she “hovered between life and death for a period of 5 days.” Alice would remain hospitalized for weeks. While Paul was in custody and Alice was in the hospital, Wren’s Nest was ransacked. Looters stole clothing, furniture, books, and most egregiously to Alice, her manuscripts. That summer’s physical and emotional trauma took an immense toll on Alice. Eugene Frank died in an accident before Alice could make her case to the grand jury. On July 19, 1924 it was reported that Eugene was thrown off his horse at his beach home, with the horse then falling over onto him and the saddle catching the pit of his stomach.<br /> <br /> Considering the development of the area with the construction of Dunes Highway and Ogden Dunes, and amid tensions, it’s understandable that Alice and Paul decided to move away. On November 21, 1923, a headline read, “Picturesque Characters Have Left Duneland - Diana of the Dunes and Her Cave Man Pack Belongings in Boat and Start for Mississippi River”. The article echoed recent animosities, “Few of the beach residents liked Paul, and of late years had little or no love for Diana.” Samuel Reck later described the scenario:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When Alice and Paul approached us about their status in the late spring of 1923, I assured them that they would not be evicted. I even had Paul build porch furniture out of dogwood and hired him to take visitors out in his boat. But in the autumn of 1923, as the first roads were being cut through the dunes and a few cottages and homes were being constructed, Alice and Paul began to make plans to abandon their cabin and to sail to Texas in a reconditioned twenty-four foot boat. I provided them with assistance and encouragement. Much to my dismay the couple returned the following spring. Unfortunately I had not torn down the cabin. For the next eleven months, they remained our neighbors.</p> <p><br /> Considering Paul’s connections to local robberies, Samuel Reck wrote, “I was convinced that most of the depredations were committed by others.”<br /> <br /> That summer, Alice stayed close to her shack. She was busy with writing and bringing a libel suit against some newspapers. On June 9, 1924, Alice and Paul filed a suit against two newspapers in Hammond’s U.S. District Court. They claimed the articles contained false and malicious defamatory statements that incorrectly and unjustly reflected on their character. Like in the outcome of the incident with Deputy Frank, justice eluded Alice again.  <br /> <br /> Janet Zeneke Edwards sets the scene in her book, Diana of the Dunes, the True Story of Alice Mabel Gray:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Throughout the day on Sunday, February 8, 1925, the weather was unsettled outside Wren’s Nest. Shifting winds prevailed, and the already cold temperature was expected to drop. Rain or light snow was forecast for the hours after dark. Icy foam marked the shoreline of Lake Michigan, while ice floes dotted the wild waves. In the midst of yet another difficult winter, Alice Gray lay seriously ill on her pallet, as she had for nearly a week, refusing medical treatment.</p> <p><br /> As Alice’s condition worsened, Paul ran to Samuel Reck’s home to get help. Mr. Reck recalled:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">After we had gone to bed, there was a tapping on the bedroom window and I got up to let in Paul Wilson, he told me, ‘Diana is awful sick, Mr. Reck, I wish you would get a doctor.’</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I dressed and drove to Gary for Dr. De Long. [The DeLongs also had a cottage in Ogden Dunes.]  As the sand was frozen, I drove down the beach to be near their shack. The doctor soon diagnosed the case. Uremic poisoning. Diana was then in a coma. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> …I took the doctor back to town and came back with some medicine. About 5 a.m. she quietly passed away in the arms of Paul.</p> <p><br /> On February 9, 1925 it was reported that Diana of the Dunes was dead. Following Alice’s death, Paul was inconsolable. Paul was described as having “sobbingly protested he had no money to bury her or to carry out her last request that her body be cremated and the ashes scattered to the winds of the dunes they both loved so well.” Alice had allegedly told him that she wished to be cremated on Mount Tom with her ashes scattered by the North Wind, and he began to make plans to carry out her wishes. Samuel Reck is said to have convinced Alice’s family to bury her, threatening to contact the newspapers after they had washed their hands of the ordeal. Alice’s family decided on a funeral and refused to allow cremation.<br /> <br /> When Paul reached her casket he became grief-stricken, drawing and waving his gun in the air. Set on carrying out her request, before being taken away by authorities, he yelled, “Anyone who takes her body will be sorry!” Paul was not released until after Alice’s burial in Gary’s Oak Hill Cemetery. He spent the next decade in and out of courts, penal farms and prisons. At some point he moved to California where he would die in October of 1941. A paper reported, “An unidentified white man, believed to have been approximately 55 yeard old, was found dead on the floor of a lonely desert cabin about a mile north of Freeman Junction.”<br /> <br /> Over 100 years ago, a highly educated woman decided to live freely at the Indiana Dunes. Longing to find peace and simplicity among the sands, she left the bustling city for the rhythmic shore. Her story made ripples in the region, and to commend her conservationism and wild spirit, Indiana Dunes National Park has dedicated a dune at West Beach in her honor.

            "bodyText": "<h2>“Lady of the Dunes”</h2> <h3>Bess Sheehan, an early staunch advocate of the first “Save the Dunes” movement of the 1910s, was a prominent, proactive clubwoman who felt a moral duty and responsibility to transform society. She pivoted conservation pressure to the state, rallied women’s clubs, and led the critically urgent campaign to the successful protection of Indiana’s Duneland as a state park; decades later she aided the second preservation push that established Indiana Dunes National (Lakeshore) Park. </h3> <h4>Quote by her:</h4> <p>“Now is the time to act. Later will be too late.”</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“Mrs. Sheehan stressed the fact that private liberty must end where public injury begins. Honesty, obedience, cleanliness, loyalty and co-operation was urged by the speaker, for we must gain within ourselves before we give to others.”</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Bess Vrooman was born in Jackson, Michigan on April 16, 1882. Vrooman means honest and valiant in Dutch. After high school, Bess attended college at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, just 35 miles away from home. She studied American history and graduated in 1904 with a Bachelor's degree. Bess received a scholarship through the Colonial Dames to continue her education and graduated in 1905 with a Masters degree. The young educator taught history in Grand Rapids, Michigan for two years before she decided to move to Gary; the brand-new “Magic City,” in 1908. Just three years prior, the land was a mosaic of wetlands, woodlands, beach ridges and dunes. Bess became a history instructor at Gary High School. She recalled the early years in Gary: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Before there were sidewalks or city water, and most of the children were in portable schools. I saw the first class of three students graduate from High School in the spring of 1909. Those days were largely concerned with sand fleas and keeping sand out of our shoes and food.</p> <p><br /> The wide-spread disturbance and destruction of the topsoil from Gary’s construction exposed enormous amounts of loose sand to the erosional power of the wind. A newspaper from around this time recorded a “simoon,” or dry, dust-laden wind storm in Gary:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Traveling in the streets was almost impossible and it was done with almost eyes closed… Closing windows afforded but little relief. The fine sand dust blew in through the cracks. In offices, desks were dusty in a few minutes and typewriters were almost put out of commission. The sand storm was the despair of store keepers and housewives. In restaurants, food and things to drink were coated with sand dust. Nothing of light weight stood stationary in the streets.</p> <p><br /> Between the grains Bess became acquainted with Frank Sheehan, a “pioneer” lawyer in Gary with his own firm. Frank was also a graduate from the University of Michigan. The pair married on January 9, 1912. According to an article at the time, “Their marriage came as a surprise to their friends who did not know of its occurrence until after the ceremony was over.” The newlyweds spent their honeymoon in Michigan. During this time, women were barred from being able to work if they were married, so when Bess chose to marry Frank, she reluctantly was forced to quit teaching in a school setting.<br /> <br /> To help remedy social injustices and have their voice heard, women across the country were being empowered through a new woman’s club movement. Bess decided to focus her energy and newfound time into being an active club woman. She became involved in the Pioneer Society of Gary, Woman’s Club, YMCA, the Prairie Club, Daughters of the American Revolution (D.A.R.), and College Club. In 1914, Mrs. Sheehan helped incorporate Gary’s Historical Society. In 1915 she was elected Historian of the local D.A.R. group. <br /> <br /> As Bess’ club-presence grew, so did a movement to preserve the Indiana Dunes as a national park. Around the turn of the century, University of Chicago’s Henry Cowles affixed his keen eyes on the Dunes region, and his research unveiled the land to curious scientists and adventure-seekers alike. Landscape architect Jens Jensen began a number of conservationally-minded clubs in Chicago to connect individuals with similar aspirations to explore natural areas around Chicago; and eventually–to protect them.<br /> <br /> Bess began to show an interest in subjects relating to nature and conservation. In 1916, after four years in the State Federation of Women’s Club, she was elected to chair the “Committee on Forestry and Waterways.” On this committee, Bess met Richard Lieber–founder of Indiana’s state park system. That November she attended the State Federation of Woman’s Club’s session in Indianapolis. In 1916, a National Dunes Park Association formed with the goal of establishing a national park on Indiana’s coast. The group grew from Jensen’s Prairie Club efforts in building momentum to authorize a national park, and included many from the same circles. Bess was voted onto a committee in September of 1916, and continued to work with the group for the next five years. The group was not officially chartered until later that fall.<br /> <br /> These early efforts were successful to find Congressional backing. In 1916, the U.S. Senator Thomas Taggart of Indiana introduced a bill to direct funds for the government to purchase the Dunes, but Congress would not vote on it unless a comprehensive report was made on the proposition. Taggart then successfully sponsored a resolution to authorize the study, which passed on September 7th and assigned Stephen Mather to conduct it. Mr. Mather was a businessman in Chicago for over two decades, a member of Jens Jensen’s Prairie Club, and the catalyst and future first Director of the newly established National Park Service, signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.<br /> <br /> On October 30th, 1916 on behalf of the National Park Service, Stephen Mather held a hearing on a proposed “Sand Dunes National Park” in Chicago’s impressive Federal Building. While Bess’ attendance was not confirmed, hundreds were present, including members of Indiana’s Federation of Clubs. Etchings and drawings by Prairie Club member Earl H. Reed were displayed around the courtroom, and a parade of over two dozen speakers testified on behalf of the park movement. Considering the rapidly expanding development, Jens Jensen poignantly remarked, “If this wonderful dune country should be taken away from us and built on it cities like Gary, Indiana Harbor and others… it would show us to be in fact a people who only have dollars for eyes.”<br /> <br /> While Mather cautioned the hopeful proponents that the hearing was only a prelude to congressional deliberations, he also promised to raise the Dunes park topic at a national park conference in Washington the coming January. He suggested that advocates begin a fund-raising campaign to better the chances of congressional condonement for a Sand Dunes National Park. A newspaper wrote of the overwhelmingly positive testimony: “not a voice was raised against the plan to make a great national playground along the southern shore of Lake Michigan.” At the hearing’s adjournment, Dunes advocates felt they had successfully presented their case and established an impressive record they would have to show of the land’s worth.<br /> <br /> Although the stage was set for a Sand Dunes National Park, park proponents lost the crucial element to pass legislation. Senator Taggart was voted out of office in November of 1916, leaving the movement without support in Congress.<br /> <br /> At the national park’s conference in January, Mather’s mental health began to decline. He began to disappear for blocks of time without explanation. On the third day of the conference he was nowhere to be found. He appeared the next morning before disappearing again that afternoon. Horace Albright explained his demeanor when he appeared again in the morning for the last day of the conference, “Now he wore a somber visage, unsmiling and seldom mixing with conferees.” A few days after the conference’s close, his mental health plummeted. An inconsolable Mather felt inadequate, unaccomplished, and that he should leave government service at once. His “nervous condition” would afflict him for months, and continue periodically for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Another obstacle that further impeded a Sand Dunes National Park was that the federal government had no precedent to purchase land for a park, and almost all of the Dunes were in private hands. On April 4th, 1917, the United States officially entered the first World War by declaring war on Germany. Congress’ attention was too occupied for such legislation, especially without any federal proponent. The proposed Sand Dunes National Park never got a congressional hearing. As Mather’s health improved and development around Duneland accelerated, he became satisfied with the proposition that it seemed politically feasible to only have a state park in Indiana. Authors Norma Schaeffer and Kay Franklin wrote of Mather’s influence on the selection of national parks:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mather’s… philosophy and policies imprintned the National Park Service he founded…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">His preference for large, pristine tracts, removed from population centers, became the standard measurement of a park’s worth, even as such scienically spectacular areas became difficult to obtain in an increasingly urban America…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">This traditional point of view remained dominant in the service until John F. Kennedy’s administration initiated a new national park policy.</p> <p><br /> With Senator Taggart out of office, undetermined park advocates realized that amassing public support would be the only route forward to pursue their goal. On April 28, 1917, The Times of Munster reported that Bess was elected Secretary of the National Dunes Park Association. That same month she successfully led promotional efforts for the park movement through the publication of the Gary Dunes Park Post. The paper published the positive testimony from the Mather hearing, as well as the Indiana Governor’s recommendation for a park in the Dunes.<br /> <br /> In order to garner support, park proponents began to plan an outdoor, theatrical “pageant.” In 1917, Bess became involved in the “Dunes Pageant Association” as “productions trustee” and on the “productions committee.” Bess worked alongside fellow Dunes-lover and conservationist Flora Richardson, who was also in the group. The association, whose slogan was “Save the Dunes,” was in charge of putting together the flowery pageant to represent their version of the history of the Dunes through performance, song, dance, and poetry. The production was entitled, “Dunes under Four Flags.” An article that April reported on the upcoming Memorial Day event:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">... the indications are that at least 50,000 persons will attend the pageant and provision is being made for that number…. Sheehan says the enthusiasm for the dunes movement in Indiana is very great and that the Calumet district will attend ‘almost in a body.’</p> <p><br /> That May, Bess spoke “convincingly” on the “Conservation of the Sand Dunes” to members of the Chamber of Commerce in Hammond. As president of Gary’s College Club and chairman of the Committee on Forestry and Waterways of Indiana Federate Clubs, she promoted the upcoming pageant on the sand and circulated a “Save the Dunes” petition that everyone signed.<br /> <br /> According to Norma Schaeffer and Kay Franklin’s book that chronicles the efforts to save the Indiana Dunes, around 40,000 people descended on Waverly Beach near today’s Porter Beach of Indiana Dunes National Park to attend the event on Memorial Day of 1917. The women included an historic account of the day:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The earliest arrivals finished their lunches and obediently refrained from picking the wild flowers and trampling the delicate, unfamiliar vegetation. Some participated in guided walks to Mount Tom and the Tamarack Grove, while others succumbed to the heat of the early afternoon and napped. All marveled at the color and variety of this little known country. Enjoying the uninterrupted expanse of lake, beach, and surrounding forest, they waited eagerly for the festivities to begin…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As the first notes of music sounded, the crowds… watched in silent appreciation. Soon a new and louder sound interrupted the music. From the lake came the roar of wind and waves, and from the rapidly darkening sky the first rumbles of thunder threatened to disrupt the meticulous preparations. The actors gamely continued against a backdrop of wind-whipped trees and blowing sand. The crowd remained intent, unafraid of the noise and rain, until the torrents and thunder together blotted out all sight and sound.</p> <p><br /> Due to the rain, the event was postponed and the collection of nearly 1000 people involved in the production returned a few days later to put on the dramatic performance for the thousands of onlookers who came again in support of a national park.<br /> <br /> Bess also focused some of her time on the war efforts. She became president of the Gary Soldiers’ Comfort league, a group that had sent out over 1,500 letters in November of 1917 to soldiers in camp to inquire as to what assistance could be sent to them from the homefront. A year later on November 11th, 1918, Bess and three other clubwomen organized the local “United War Work” campaign, a national effort that raised over $200 million for soldier-aid programs in a week.<br /> <br /> Amidst the war and national park efforts, Bess became involved in establishing a lakefront park for the City of Gary. On April 9th, 1918, the Times of Munster reported a revised list of officers and directors of the Gary-Miller joint park board, formed to help plan Gary’s future lakefront park. “Mrs. Bessie Sheehan” was listed as treasurer alongside directors such as Jens Jensen and Henry Cowles. Established in 1919, Gary’s Lakefront Park (today’s Marquette Park) was one of the region’s first parks that preserved much of the site’s dunes, wetlands, and natural character. <br /> <br /> Bess continued to express her love for and to promote the Dunes. In June of 1918, Bess spent the day leading the history department of Hammond’s Woman’s Club around the hills of sand. The Times of Munster reported on the day and her prowess:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mrs. Sheehan of Gary acted as a most charming and efficient guide and this department felt that much of the pleasure of the day was due to her. From Tremont they followed a beautiful trail through the woods to the lake… After dinner the women made the ascent of Mt. Tom and felt well repaid for the effort by the beauty of the view from the top.</p> <p><br /> On April 8th, 1919, Bess gave a “splendid” talk on the Dunes to members and friends of an area Woman’s Study Club. Her presentation dwelled “on the beauties of this natural park.” A few days later, the Indianapolis News reported that through Bess’ efforts, the upcoming November was selected as “Save-The-Dunes Month” in an effort to continue the push for dunes preservation by the Indiana Federation of Women’s Clubs. At the end of April, Bess spoke again at the National Dunes Park Association meeting in Gary. <br /> <br /> In November of 1919, Bess was chairman of Indiana’s State Park Commission and Secretary of the Dunes National Park Association. “In her pleasing manner,” she gave an instructive talk on protecting the Sand Dunes to the Merrillville Woman’s Club. That same month she gave an illustrated lecture entitled “Lure of the Dunes,” at a meeting of the Women’s Study club. A newspaper reported on her conviction: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It really seems deplorable that so many of our people living near the dunes know so little about them. After having heard Mrs. Sheehan not one could help but feel convinced that we have one of the most wonderful and interesting spots in the world, within only a short distance of our own doors…</p> <p><br /> In January of 1920 Bess gave another lecture with pictures of the Dunes to members of a reading club. That April she spoke again to a meeting of Indiana Harbor’s Woman’s Club. In May, Bess presented for the Valparaiso Woman’s Club; a Valparaiso newspaper wrote: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She spoke most eloquently of the beauties of this wonder region, which is attracting the attention of world scientists and about which poets sing and artists delight to portray. </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Especially she mentioned the rare plants of the north which grow here, also the semi-tropical vegetation and many beautiful photographs were also shown to illustrate the subject.</p> <p><br /> In June of 1920 she participated in an event sponsored by the Prairie Club in conjunction with the National Dunes Park Association to further build support and attention for the park movement. In a presentation for Nature Study Club members, Bess highlighted the story of the 1913 International Phytogeographic Excursion in America. She spoke of how Dr. Henry Cowles had hosted a collection of international botanists who wished to visit impressive botanical and ecological areas. The excursion chose to see the Dunes as one of their four stops in the country. In September, Bess led the Mishawaka Women’s club around the dunes. That year she was published in the magazine Topics, which shared her piece entitled “Indiana’s Unrivaled Sand Dunes.” She wrote of the recreational value in saving the area for a park:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">To convince you of the recreational facilities of the dune country, I need only call attention to its location on beautiful Lake Michigan, one of the most wonderful inland lakes in the world, which offers boating, fishing, and, for bathers and swimmers, one of the finest fresh water bathing beaches found anywhere.</p> <p><br /> Bess also stressed the region’s accessibility to millions of nearby people who could benefit from the establishment of a Dunes park. In January of 1921, Bess, Henry Cowles, Richard Lieber, and other representatives and officials met at the governor’s office in Indianapolis to plan costs and needs for a Dunes state park. By 1922, the Gary chapter of the National Dunes Park Association voted to abandon efforts for a national park and instead apply pressure to obtain a smaller, state park. Except for the continued devotion of some of the advocates, the organization effectively died.<br /> <br /> To help promote the Dunes’ wealth of uses to the state, Bess chaired the committee in 1922 to plan a two week summer camp for students to help boost state conservation efforts through the Indiana Federation of Clubs. She and other organizers planned that students would visit iconic sites in Duneland like the Pageant Blowout, Cowles Bog, the Bailly Homestead, and Mt. Tom. They were to be guided by prominent scientists, and lectured by local historians and artists. Notable names included in the plans were Jens Jensen, Stephen Mather, Governor Warren McCray, Dr. Cowles, and Frank Dudley. However, that June it was reported that plans for a camp had been abandoned and instead four days of programming to arouse interest in conserving the Dunes for a public park was instead planned–with much of the same notable cast.<br /> <br /> In November of 1922, Bess gave a presentation entitled “Interesting Things I saw at the Dunes,” to a joint meeting of some local woman’s clubs. Her innumerable Dunes discussions across the state earned her the nickname,”Dunes Lady” or “Lady of the Dunes.” On January 19, 1923, Bess spoke at a meeting of the council of the Indiana Federation of Women’s Clubs on behalf of saving the dunes with a stereopticon slide program. She “asked the women to send individual letters, make personal calls and telegraph members of the legislature asking them to support the bill.” Bess pleaded: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We must save the dunes now…</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We must establish the park at once. It is now or never. Three of four real estate deals in the dune land have been made recently and others are hanging fire. Now only six miles of shoreland is left of the twenty miles of two years ago… we need the million-dollar appropriation now!</p> <p><br /> That year, Indiana senator Will Brown of Lake and Porter counties agreed to sponsor a bill for an Indiana Dunes State Park. Although the National Dunes Park Association had been fighting for nine miles of lakeshore to be preserved, Brown’s bill allotted for three miles at a yet undecided location. The reduced footprint would allow room for proposed harbors in multiple locations along Lake Michigan that the opposition demanded. Norma Schaeffer and Kay Franklin wrote in Duel for the Dunes: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">After the legislature convened, Sheehan went to Indianapolis to join other clubwomen in working for the passage of the Dunes bill. Much to their consternation, they learned that the Democratic caucus had decided to punish any member who favored legislation providing for a tax increase, since Hoosier farmers faced an agricultural depression. No wonder the House bill languished in the Ways and Means Committee! </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Thirty years later Sheehan described what confronted the Dunes proponents in the legislature: ‘This General Assembly of 1923 was, like most others, a complex body. Politically, it was almost evenly divided—52 Republicans and 48 Democrats—so that it would be necessary to secure bipartisan support. Many of the members were farmers, who could see nothing good in a hill of sand. Many of them came from southern and central Indiana and there was always present some feeling of jealousy and suspicion of all measures being actively supported by the new and prosperous Calumet Region.’</p> <p><br /> Fearing that the bill would die in committee, Bess gave another stereopticon lecture, this time to the wives and legislators of the Indiana General Assembly, where she stated:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Dunes are not dumb-bells. They are intensely human. They organize, mobilize, get together, decide to move, and overnight are gone. Those changing, shifting, restless, age-old, ever-new, exotic possessions of Hoosierland that lie away up along the southern shores of Lake Michigan, in Porter, Lake, and Laporte counties, soon pass away before the rising tide of industrialism unless the state of Indiana gets busy immediately and creates a state dunes park…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We had to give up the national park idea because of the necessity of immediate action so we turned to the state… Now is the time to act. Later will be too late.</p> <p><br /> The reporter explained, “...and although it was fully two hours later when the last colored dune picture was thrown on the screen, not a single legislator left the room.”<br /> <br /> For days, the bill remained stagnant in committee. Meanwhile, Bess tried to subdue a potentially damaging whispering campaign that tried to convince land-owners in the dunes that they would not receive fair compensation for their property. Then, with only 9 days left of the session, the committee voted for indefinite postponement of the bill.<br /> <br /> Through a fellow club woman, Bess decided to contact Senator Taggart, the park supporter and federal Democrat from 1916. Although he was no longer in office, Bess knew that getting his help was vital to secure bipartisan support. Through Bess’ friend, Taggart was contacted and he responded by coming to Indianapolis on February 24, 1923 to ask Bess, “Just what do you want me to do?” She pleaded for his help to convince the six Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee to vote in favor of the bill. Although Taggert had tried, to the Dune-supporters’ dismay, the committee voted a second time for indefinite postponement.<br /> <br /> When the bill came for final passage in the House from the Ways and Means Committee without recommendation, Bess telegraphed Taggart for help again. Bess was delighted and relieved when he returned to Indianapolis.  On the final day of the session, with the galleries packed by Dunes supporters, the crucial vote passed the House with just one vote more than required. The Senate safely passed the bill just minutes later. Franklin and Schaefer argued that Bess had used “woman power” to persuade important politicians and their wives to influence people behind the scenes. Bess had saved a piece of the Dunes that she had been fighting to protect for over 7 years. She recounted:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The people here all gave up the struggle; seemed I was the only one who stuck. Had I known how discouraged the others were I guess I would have given up too. I only began to sense it about the time I began to dare to hope for success and that was the eleventh hour… So we were very lucky. Providence surely saw us through an almost impossible situation.</p> <p><br /> On March 6, 1923, Governor McCray signed the Indiana Dunes park bill with a golden pen which he later presented to Bess in honor of her work. The bill’s passage created a commission and a tax levy to acquire 2,000 acres of dune country, but no immediate funds to purchase the lands. One paper called Bess the “biggest little woman in Northern Indiana.” In April of 1923, the Prairie Club recognized Bess’ efforts in their monthly bulletin: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">...the greatest credit for the final success of the measure should go to Mrs. Frank J. Sheehan of Gary, who was in complete charge of the bill during the recent session. First she secured unite support of Lake and Porter counties; then she gained the cooperation of women’s clubs throughout the State, the State Automobile Association, working hand in hand with the Nature Study Club of Indianapolis and kindred organizations, so that the cause of the park bill might be presented to members of the legislature by their constituents as well as by those visiting the State capital in is behalf. Mrs. Sheehan never knew discouragement. Even when the House Ways and Means committee had voted to lay aside the bill for the session, she would not quit, but through influential friends secured cooperation of Thomas Taggart, prominent Democrat, whose party representatives in the general assembly had been opposing all measures to add to taxes. This removed the only real obstacle.</p> <p><br /> That October, Bess received an elaborately engraved silver “basket” from Indiana Federation of Women’s Clubs. The inscription read: “Presented to Bess Vrooman Sheehan by the Club Women of Indiana in appreciation of her efforts in saving the Dunes 1923.” For the next two years, Bess and Richard Lieber led a fundraising campaign that focused on wealthy Calumet citizens and industrialists, as well as schoolchildren and their pennies to raise money to acquire the park; but results were disappointing. <br /> <br /> Bess gave a presentation entitled, “Woman, the Architect of Humanity” in April of 1924 in South Bend, Indiana. The next April, she encouraged clubwoman on Arbor Day to establish more parkland:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The men of tomorrow will come to their generation with minds largely nourished in the great cities of brick and mortar, and we are face to face with the problem of providing that intimate contact with nature which is indispensable to the maintenance of the vigor, moral strength and clean simplicity of mind of the American people…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Let us study our national, state and local park projects so that areas may be preserved forever, not only for our pleasure, but for that of our children, and for our children’s children.</p> <p><br /> Later that month, Bess was principal speaker at an event where she gave a talk entitled “Women, the World Builder of Man.” She said to the women, “Today we measure a person’s value to society by contributions of deeds.” The article continued: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mrs. Sheehan stressed the fact that private liberty must end where public injury begins. Honesty, obedience, cleanliness, loyalty and co-operation was urged by the speaker, for we must gain within ourselves before we give to others.</p> <p><br /> In May of 1925, Governor Jackson appointed Bess membership to the new state library and historical board. On May 20, Bess was reported as being a distinguished guest of honor when Governor Jackson and his wife toured the industry and dunes of Northwest Indiana along with Richard Lieber. On this trip, with Bess as their guide, Jackson was convinced to make the initial land purchase. On May 28, a newspaper reported that Gov. Jackson announced $200,000 being available at once to begin purchasing land for the 3000 acre proposed Dune park. Another paper reported: “Gary Woman’s Efforts Are To Be Rewarded; Indiana Takes Action For Dunes Park.” Schaeffer and Franklin described the state park’s unlikely success: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In retrospect, given the strength of the opposition, preservationists achieved a surprising success in gaining a Dunes state park. Victory resulted from continuing bipartisan political pressure that overcame Porter County’s jealousy of its industrialized neighbor to the west and its refusal to relinquish land that had industrial potential. The effort also surmounted the Indiana legislature’s antipathy to giving benefits to the northwestern part of the state…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Exhausted after years of struggle, the preservationists seemed satisfied with the small size of the state park and for …years made no further attempt to save any other portion of the Dunes.</p> <p><br /> That same month, Bess spoke to the press at French Lick’s West Baden Springs Hotel on land conservation and reforesting the Hoosier State: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If we must prepare for the future we must begin now… I appeal to you newspapermen to use the power of the press on behalf of these movements and to help us curb the waste of wood. We women, in our campaign against forestry waste, oppose the unsightly bill boards that mar our landscape and we oppose the use of paper for magazines that are not fit to be placed on our shelves. These are matters of conservation that require your earnest attention.</p> <p><br /> With her success in conservation, Bess decided to expand her devotion to clubwork. That year, Mrs. Sheehan was a candidate for President of the Indiana Federation of Women’s Clubs. Speaking as to why Bess had endorsements from many women's clubs in the state, fellow clubwomen of Lake County wrote of her “well-known ability as a public speaker, her devotion to duty, her power of organization and her high ideals.” Bess was to be rewarded for her renowned efforts to save the Dunes. On October 16, 1925, the Times of Munster reported:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mrs. J Frank Sheehan, of Gary, member of the intelligencia [sic], lover of the Dunes, lecturer and author, was elected president of the Indiana Federation of Clubs yesterday. For two years Mrs. Sheehan will hold the reins over 30,000 Indiana Club women, composing 600 clubs in 200 towns and cities…When the result of the election was announced 500 women delegates seated and standing in the banquet room broke into prolonged cheers.</p> <p><br /> In January of 1926, Bess addressed club women in Wayne County on education and improving society: “Life means growth, but not only growth within ourselves but the use we make of it in service to others.” The same year, the Indiana Dunes State Park opened to visitors. The Indianapolis News reported that the Prairie Club had voted that February to refuse to accept an offer from the State of Indiana to purchase their 48 acres of lakefront property for the park. Bess attended the meeting and reportedly made a “vigorous protest against the refusal.” The next month it was reported that the Prairie Club sold their tract. Bess continued to travel the state to speak to women’s clubs and inspire progress. She held her position as president through 1927, and became one of the most well-known women in Indiana. By 1927, Indiana owned 2,000 acres that comprised the state park. The next year, Bess was elected the Indiana Director of the national General Federation of Women’s Clubs. That November, Bess wrote into the Indianapolis Star to recruit women impassioned for a cause:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Membership in a local club gives us the opportunity to work for community betterment…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">With invisible voice the womanhood of the world is calling upon us for service. Have you answered that call? If you have not, then come join the woman’s army.</p> <p><br /> Local clubwomen dedicated a poem by M. M. Mudge in Bess’ honor a few years later: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Climbing the dune, on the summit she stands,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Scanning the acres of shimmering sands–</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Glistening, glimmering, glamorous sands, </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Eerie, mysterious valley of sands.</p> <p><br /> Bess remained actively involved in clubs throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Over the years she published a number of writings, including a forty year history of the Indiana Federation of Woman’s Clubs; “The Northern Boundary of Indiana;” and a two-volume manuscript of the history of “Gary in the World War.”<br /> <br /> But Bess’ role in saving the Dunes was not over. Increased development in the region spurred conservationists to again band together in an effort to save remaining areas of the Dunes. In 1952, Dorothy Buell seeked Bess’ guidance when she decided to lead women in a second push for establishing a national park along Indiana’s shore. On June 20, 1952 Dorothy assembled a group of 25 women in her living room–the women were the founding members of the Save the Dunes Council. Bess Sheehan, “Lady of the Dunes,” attended the first meeting and shared her experiences from helping save the Indiana Dunes State Park thirty years before.<br /> <br /> The group met again, this time at Bess’ home in Gary, in 1953. The group was determined to buy a critical area of the Dunes that had recently become for sale–Dr. Henry Cowles’ bog. Bess, who had been treasurer for the National Dunes Park Association, agreed to liquidate the account and transfer the money to Save the Dunes so they could purchase the rare wetland area. The funds that Bess had held for over 30 years provided about half of the necessary funds for the group to purchase the wetland that Dr. Henry Cowles had shown to the world. The secured land served as inspiration for the group and as the core conservation area for the national park movement.<br /> <br /> Although she shared her previous experience, Bess feared the national park project would be unsuccessful again. At age 74 in 1956 Frank and Bess moved to Winter Park, Florida. Although Frank died on March 6, 1964, Bess lived to see the establishment of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore when Congress passed legislation in November of 1966. Bess died in Winter Park about a year and a half later on April 24, 1968. Bess was buried with her family and Frank in Dowagiac, Michigan.</p> <h3>Bibliography</h3> January 30th, 1923, the Indianapolis News <ul> <li>“Leads In Fight to Preserve the Dunes for a State Park” Page 16</li> </ul> April 24, 1925; Lafayette Journal and Courier <ul> <li>“Clubs” Page 5</li> </ul> September 23, 1904; Detroit Free Press, Detroit, MI <ul> <li>“Freer Spoke Too Late” Page 2</li> </ul> September 27th, 1925 ; The Indianapolis Star <ul> <li>“Federated Clubs of Gary Indorse Mrs. F.

            "bodyText": "<h2>“Crusader of the Dunes”</h2> <h3>Both gracious and positive, as well as incisive and fierce, Charlotte Read was a reverent guardian of public trust, who wholeheartedly committed herself to saving the Indiana Dunes from trickling to cascading threats. Always equipped with the facts and intensely credible, she joined her husband in establishing a national park in the Dunes in 1966 and continued a courageously dedicated life in environmental activism and education for over six decades.</h3> <h4>Quote by her:</h4> <p>“Nothing that we did could have been done without all kinds of people who don’t get awards, whose names, maybe I didn’t even remember; but it's so important to have people who care.”</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“Her involvement with numerous committees illustrates her well-rounded interests in Indiana’s environmental heritage and her commitment to preserve the quality of the air, water and wildlife for all the citizens of Northwest Indiana and the nation.” -U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Charlotte Johnson was the only child born to two Swedish immigrants in Chicago on March 27, 1929. Her father worked as a building contractor and painter in her youth. “I grew up near Jackson Park, and the lake was our playground. I can’t imagine growing up without that.” She attended the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, graduating in 1950 with a bachelors in economics.<br /> <br /> One night in September of 1951, Charlotte met Herbert Read at a social function for singles. After having ice cream together and a second date to the stock car races, Herb took Charlotte to the dunes. Although they had never met, they grew up nearby one another and were alumni of the same university. Two years later on September 6th, 1952, she married Herb. “I was married into the Indiana Dunes,” Charlotte recalled.<br /> <br /> Herb’s father was acquainted with Dorothy Buell and became familiar with her efforts; he got Herb and Charlotte to join the cause to save the Dunes. They wrote their first non-rent check as newlyweds for the Save the Dunes Council’s first fall dinner in 1952. Later they would agree they had no idea the amount of energy and time that would be required, but once they began, they could not stop.<br /> <br /> In 1958, Charlotte and Herb started the Izaak Walton League’s Porter County chapter. The next year, In 1959 the couple moved to Indiana to live near the Dunes and raise their family. She recalled, “We had two sons, and a third on the way, and Herb decided it was time to move out of the city to raise our kids.” Charlotte spoke of the early years of the Save the Dunes Council:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I think that probably a lot of the council members thought that by getting out the message that [the dunes] were beautiful—there are all these birds and all these flowers—it would make its own case. You didn’t have to get [partisan] or political. They were just so beautiful that once you made the facts known, the numbers would flock… in ‘59 I think the petition drive was that type of thing. You want to impress legislators, and they tried to impress Congress, but it’s not the kind of lobbying or political involvement we thought we could do.</p> <p><br /> The group was beginning to transform. In their book, The Land Speaks, Debbie Lee and Kathryn Newfont wrote of the change in the activists: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As a result the previously nonpolitical group made a very politically charged move: it shifted its focus from raising funds to buy land for donation to the state park, to more direct efforts that challenged the creation of a port and proposed the establishment of a national lakeshore.</p> <p><br /> While Charlotte worked on the homefront, Herb was instrumental in stalling the funding of the port by finding errors in the report outlining its cost-benefit ratios. Their son recalled in an interview:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My mom and dad obviously have been well known our entire lives and for all these efforts, they have a celebrated public persona… But there are things people don’t know, like what a wonderful mother she was to all of us.</p> <p><br /> The article continued: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">A mother who made a Jell-O mold in the shape of a five-pointed star, so each of her children got a piece; who often had one of the children, long before they were old enough to do so legally, grab the wheel and steer one of her vintage cars; who made Swedish pancakes and other treats; and who read classic literature to her children at bedtime.</p> <p><br /> Following a fourteen-year effort led by Dorothy Buell of the Save the Dunes Council, on October 14, 1966, Congress finally authorized an Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Charlotte remembered the unbelievable victory, “When the bill passed we had a euphoric moment.” Many in the Council believed this meant their work was over. “Everyone thought we could go home,” Charlotte said. Mrs. Read would later reflect on the success of the bill’s passing; “talk about babes in the woods.”<br /> <br /> Although the park was authorized, it would not exist unless funds were also authorized for acquisition. Charlotte and several other Save the Dunes members traveled to Washington D.C. to demand funding for the newly designated national park. “Charlotte possessed a natural gift for diplomacy, and a capacity to sense another person’s character and values and to understand where it was possible to find common ground.” Senator Douglas had lost his bid for reelection, and the park had lost its major federal proponent. But in April of 1968, Congressional committees succumbed to the massive, coordinated lobbying efforts and allotted 2 million in emergency funds for acquisition.<br /> <br /> According to the park’s administrative history, Funding for West Beach development became a reality in 1971 after Congressman Roush came to the Dunes and met with Superintendent Whitehouse, Sylvia Troy, Charlotte Read, and Herb. After the meeting, Whitehouse’s original $1.2 million request grew to $2.1 million.<br /> <br /> Charlotte was a conservationist who contended that communication between the government and local groups left room for improvement in the early years of relations concerning Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. In 1971, the National Park Service unveiled their plans for the development of West Beach. The Council, led by Sylvia Troy, had to travel to Indianapolis to find what the park’s development plans were. “An hour before daybreak, Save the Dunes Council President met future Executive Director Charlotte Read and Porter County Chapter Izaak Walton League President Herbert Read to begin the trip.” Up until then the plans had remained closely guarded with no public input.<br /> <br /> They were left in shock as the plan was unveiled: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“...two Olympic size swimming pools… two steel bathhouses…a three-story parking garage…a pavilion, sports fields, winter coasting slopes, a manmade dune, a bandshell and amphitheater, an ice-skating rink, basketball courts, a viewing terrace overlooking the swimming pools, a general field game area, a boating and fishing lagoon, five day-use shelters, storage and maintenance facilities, an administration building, and sixteen residential units for NPS employees.”</p> <p><br /> After the meeting quickly ended, the conservationists went up to view the plans closer-up. After saying the plans were not public, the officials collected the documents and left. “They act like they’re handling C.I.A. documents,” Charlotte Read quipped, shaking her head. “No, they act like we’re the enemy,” Troy remarked.<br /> <br /> Charlotte commented after their gloomy lunch together, “This is too dangerous to believe. We’ll change those plans…”<br /> <br /> “They protested to the newspapers, to their congressional supporters, and to the Secretary of the Interior… A planning advisory group incorporating local and regional planning agencies as well as area citizens’ groups was created; and a new, more acceptable General Management Plan for park development eventually emerged.” “Park service attitudes have subsequently changed. Local public hearings on General Management Plans are now required throughout the National Park system…”<br /> <br /> In 1972, Charlotte became president of Porter County’s Izaak Walton League chapter. She would continue to lead the chapter until 1976. In 1974, Charlotte became a seasonal interpretive ranger for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. “I realized that my heart lay in being a citizen watchdog, and not a part of the bureaucracy,” she said. That same year, Charlotte became the first paid employee of Save the Dunes. She served as Executive Director from 1974-1992.<br /> <br /> Charlotte helped lead efforts to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore’s first successful expansion bill in 1976, adding 3,700 acres to the park. Following years of attempts and failures, Charlotte read spoke to a reporter just weeks before it passed:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Acre for acre, there has been more struggle over the Indiana dunes than anywhere else.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…With every year this doesn’t get passed, more land is destroyed or developed. If it doesn’t pass this year the pressure for development will build.</p> <p><br /> Although the park expanded, the Council was unsuccessful in adding the “greenbelt” property, a corridor of man-made ponds and buffer land that exists between Cowles Bog and its industrial neighbors. The Council’s senses were heightened to the importance of buffer zones after it was discovered that an Indiana Toll Road Commission's salt pile was “bleeding” into the national lakeshore’s Pinhook Bog wetland. The area posed a serious risk of coal ash-pond seepage contamination, something that Charlotte and the Council alerted the National Park Service and other officials to after they witnessed accelerated dumping in the area in 1973.<br /> <br /> With the success of their first Lakeshore expansion, Save the Dunes Council began the fight to include additional parcels within the authorized boundaries. The Council was trying to absorb areas that had been part of Paul Douglas’ earlier bills for a national park unit. Charlotte and the Council again promoted the acquisition of the “green-belt” area in a new expansion bill in 1979. Charlotte felt that control of the property was essential to ensure the ecological integrity of the area.<br /> <br /> The Council was dismayed when the controversial greenbelt tract was eventually dropped from the successful Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore’s expansion bill in 1980. Although the greenbelt was never officially acquired by the national park, the most recent expansion bill from 1992 stipulated that the property owner is required to maintain the natural state of the greenbelt, and must notify Congress three years prior to changing the character of the property.<br /> <br /> In 1981, the Shirley Heinze Environmental Fund, today’s Shirley Heinze Land Trust, was established by an endowment from Mr. and Mrs. Robert Seidner on behalf of their friend who had recently passed away. Dr. Shirley Heinz was devoted to nature study in her free time and participated in the fight to save the Indiana Dunes. Charlotte became the group’s first executive director. Their mission is to “preserve and restore natural lands and waters in northwestern Indiana, and to engage people in nature and conservation.”<br /> <br /> Charlotte recalled, “I started out just wanting to preserve the beautiful dunes, but I realized that I couldn’t ignore the air and water pollution and other factors that affect the dunes.” In August of 1970, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO,) had filed an application for a permit to construct a nuclear power plant adjacent to its fossil-fuel Bailly generating facility at Burns Harbor. The most active group that opposed the facility, known as “Bailly I,” was the Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League led by Herb and Charlotte. They, along with Sylvia Troy and Edward Osann of Save the Dunes were instrumental in halting a nuclear power plant in the Dunes’ backyard. “There was little the Service could do except monitor the activity and express its opinion.” Charlotte said of the project, “The company knew when they picked that site, it was like waving a red flag in front of the environmentalists.” Countless court battles ensued, but the Council did not become involved in any until 1980. Charlotte commented on the lack of an evacuation plan for visitors to the park, “It’s ludicrous to say we’ll worry about evacuation when the plant is built. The time to stop Bailly is now.”<br /> <br /> In 1981, eleven years after NIPSCO revealed their project, they pulled the plug on the Bailly I project after spending $191 million. “The anti-nuclear groups dragged Nuclear Regulatory Commission proceedings to a point where it was no longer feasible to build the plant,” reported the Times of Munster. “Ultimately the project became a victim of one lengthy delay after another,” said NIPSCO chairman of the time, Edmund Schroer. Charlotte reflected on the victory, “When you put 10 years of your life into trying to fight something like this, you find it hard to believe they’ve finally done the right thing. I congratulate them for having the wisdom to make a hard and important choice.”<br /> <br /> She recalled the reason for opposition the next year; “It wasn’t because we were anti-nuclear… But a reactor located 800 feet from the boundary of the park would and has been damaging to park resources,” referring to the lowered water levels caused by initial construction that was started on the reactor. She also told the reporter:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The idea of preserving the dunes precedes World War I. A proposal to designate it a national park was made in 1916. But it failed, largely because much of what is now the lakeshore was private land, and in those days public funds were not used to buy private land to create a national park…</p> <p><br /> It was an uphill fight all the way. It probably always will be.<br /> <br /> Charlotte would later wisley remind readers that NIPSCO pulled the permit “without prejudice, meaning they could resurrect it if they wanted to.”<br /> <br /> The Paul H. Douglas Center for Environmental Education was authorized in the park’s 1980 expansion bill. By 1983, proposed plans were released, but Charlotte was concerned that conventional construction would destroy the land’s beautiful rolling beach ridges and dunes. She urged the federal subcommittee overseeing the project to approve additional funding so the center could be built as “a series of pods that will be placed on top of the dunes, grouped for different activities.” Charlotte said at the time, “Since the plans are not yet final, the council will keep a watchful eye on the plans so that the facilities serve their intended purpose and are compatible with the area.”<br /> <br /> U.S. House Representative Katie Hall submitted her first bill that year that successfully increased the funding for the education center. Rep. Hall was Indiana’s first Black woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Later that year she successfully led legislation that established Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. Charlotte’s ideas were incorporated and can be experienced at the center today.<br /> <br /> Charlotte was a founding member of the Hoosier Environmental Council in 1983. She explained the watchdog group organized because, “we really wanted to have a presence in Indianapolis to see that the good federal laws we have to protect the environment are actually carried out on the state level.” She continued:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I think that the work I do is just an example of democracy at work. Citizens have a responsibility to see that what they expect from their government actually turns out…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The impetus for these laws doesn’t come from the top down, unfortunately, but from the bottom up. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the increasing complexity of society so keeping the government on track is an important and very challenging job.</p> <p><br /> Mary Kay Rothert, who was on the Hoosier Environmental Council’s board with Charlotte, recalled Charlotte’s role as moderator:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She would sit there and always be practical. People would say, ‘Oh, yes, we’ll do X, Y, and Z.’ Charlotte was the one who would say, ‘Look, let’s keep it realistic.’ She would ask questions that would make you realize that you were sort of over the cliff in terms of what you were imagining.</p> <p><br /> In 1984, Charlotte summed up her years spent fighting to protect the region; “They call us bunny lovers, tree huggers and little old ladies in tennis shoes. But I take that as a back-handed compliment because I know we are respected for what we’ve done.” After Charlotte and Save the Dunes Council helped the passage of another park expansion bill in 1986, she wrote an open letter to the Times of Munster, Indiana:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Welcome to Northwest Indiana, an environmental stronghold.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Don’t laugh. Just because you still see a smoke-filled horizon doesn’t mean things are getting worse. In fact, I think things are starting to get better. As a long-time practicing environmental activist… I see a growing awareness of our area’s environmental problems, and more people wanting to correct them. I also see a widespread appreciation of the good things Northwest Indiana has to offer.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…Times are changing. Citizens are refusing to allow Northwest Indiana’s environment to deteriorate.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… It’s a big job, but not an impossible one. If you care, and want to help, it will make the job easier. The environment we are protecting is the only one we have.</p> <p><br /> In 1988, the fight to save a 35 acre tract known as Crescent Dune was evolving; proposals for a marina at the site began to circulate. Charlotte Read said that environmentalists would rise up as one to fight against a proposed marina for the site. Although the land owned by NIPSCO was within the authorized boundaries of the national lakeshore from the 1976 expansion bill, there was a stipulation that had failed to be met that the land had to be acquired within two years.  In November of 1989, NIPSCO revealed a condominium development proposal. The following January, fellow Save the Dunes member and environmental activist Irene Herlocker-Meyer said, “I would think that every national park in the country would be up in arms because it affects all national parks.”<br /> <br /> The then Council president, Thomas Serynek explained, “If Crescent Dune is permitted to slip out of the park, it will set a precedent that will further encourage private interests to chip away at other authorized lands in park boundaries.” Prospects to stop the condominium efforts seemed dismal after local U.S. House Representative Pete Visclocky supported a plan to allow for the construction of the housing structure with public access to the beach. In addition to defacing the lakefront, Charlotte feared that development on the tract would be threatened by erosion; “This beach eroded 170 feet in the last about 17 or 18 years… the most eroding part of the Indiana shoreline.”<br /> <br /> On March 27th, 1990, Rep. Visclocky announced a reversal in his position to endorse the condominium plan due to an outpouring by his constituents. He instead arranged Crescent Dune to be purchased through eminent domain. Charlotte found the news to be a fitting birthday present, “We, of course, think this is the right decision and we appreciate the congressman re-evaluating his position. It must be a hard thing for anyone to do.” Six years later, park officials completed negotiations and Congress appropriated $3.7 million for the purchase of Crescent Dune.<br /> <br /> In 1988, as Executive Director of Save the Dunes Council, Charlotte went to Washington D.C. to testify on the topic of “acid rain oversight” to a subcommittee on “energy and power.” She spoke of the conditions around the Dunes: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As watchdogs for a very small and very fragile natural resource… we have become early leaders in the fight for clean air in Northwest Indiana, and find we must continue that role today.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Northwest Indiana’s three counties along the lake, Lake, Porter, and LaPorte, are nonattainment, or unclassified, as we speak, for sulfur dioxide. Lake and Porter Counties are also nonattainment or unclassified for most of the rest of the criteria pollutants. This, 18 years after the enactment of the Clean Air Act. </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The Council believes there is no other area in the State of Indiana where the promises of the Clean Air Act have failed so completely as they have there.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In 1985, the Indiana Dunes had the unfortunate distinction of experiencing one of the top ten most acid rainfall single events, with a pH of 3.38.</p> <p><br /> Between 1980 and 1987, the pH of the rainfall in the Indiana Dunes ranged from 3.88-4.38. Charlotte spoke on some of its effects in the park:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Studies that the National Park Service has done of air pollution damage to vegetation within the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore… have found visible damage to sensitive species, in particular, the absence of many forms of lichen… vital indicators of pollution.</p> <p><br /> Charlotte continued with examples of acid rain affecting boats with damaged hulls, decks and rails that moored just downwind of Michigan City’s coal-burning power plant. While Charlotte believed boat-owners were being paid by the power company to repair their watercraft, she alluded that there was no assistance to the Old Lighthouse Museum, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The structure that housed the fearless lighthouse keeper, Harriet Colfax, had been showered with pollutants for the past seven years. Charlotte believed in finding a solution:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The Council believes that the time has come to enact meaningful acid rain control legislation now. If not now, when? If not us, who? … we also believe that utilities should be encouraged or if need be, mandated, to manage their loads based on the least polluting, not necessarily just the least cost, units.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…I think we need a dialogue involving all of us. And I think the time has come that we now take steps to control a problem that is not going to go away.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As a lover of my particular national park, and all national parks, I think we cannot afford to wait any longer until all our trees are dead, all our sensitive lakes are acidified and all our fish have rolled over and are no longer edible or swimmable or fishable. I think we have to bite the bullet. And I personally and my organization are willing to take our fair share of the cost of acid rain control. Thank you.</p> <p><br /> In September of 1988, Charlotte told the Vidette-Messenger of Porter County of what she believed to be the only solution to the acid rain problem afflicting the county; “Legislation is needed to show a federal commitment to solving the problem.” Two years later, the Clean Air Act would be amended to include a system known as the “Acid Rain Program,” to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to half of 1980’s value.<br /> <br /> Charlotte was deeply connected to the Dunes region and committed to bettering it. A later article revealed some of Charlotte’s character: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Tom Serynek, who was hired by Read to work at Save the Dunes in 1989… recalled when a region mayor called Read “Queen of the Nitpickers” because of her attention to detail, her tenacity and her knowledge of facts and law.</p> <p><br /> In 1989, Charlotte and Save the Dunes opposed a new subdivision in Dune Acres and the subsequent issues septic tanks and erosion would have to Cowles Bog. “Our immediate goal is to protect the park.” In 1990 she and Save the Dunes supported designating part of U.S. 12 a scenic highway; a plan that was since shelved. In 1991, Charlotte and Save the Dunes supported IDEM’s enforcement of state air quality laws when a company was renewing an incinerator permit. In 1992, Charlotte and Save the Dunes were involved in the negotiations leading to successfully reducing toxic air pollutants from coke plants. Charlotte told a reporter; “The standards are not as low as we would like to have them, but they’re much higher than industry wants them.”<br /> <br /> On March 25, 1994, Charlotte along with Barbara Plampin, Kay Franklin, and Irene Herlocker-Meyer gave a program honoring “Women of Dunes” at the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center on Emma Pitcher, Dorothy Buell, Bess Sheehan, and others. In an interview a month later, she said:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We’re prickly advocates for the dunes. We’re not everybody’s favorite environmental group because we take a stand. We still have to re-save the dunes periodically… </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The plant species diversity blows your mind. It’s not only beautiful but the floral biodiversity is incredible, especially for the park’s size and the neighborhood it’s in.</p> <p><br /> Charlotte understood and appreciated the inherent value in the entire “Dunes” landscape. In 2001 she said, “The dunes are more than just the lake. The way the glaciers retreated you have a botanical melting pot. There are arctic plants sitting right next to desert plants. It’s a fascinating place from a lot of angles.” Charlotte told a reporter in 2003, “There are places in the Dunes where you can go and think you’re the only person in this wonderful wilderness. Considering how industrialized Northwest Indiana is becoming, that’s important.” They wrote that Charlotte’s “gentle demeanor contrasts with the spirited battles she has waged on behalf of Northern Indiana’s premier natural reserve.” Stephen Higgs’s book Eternal Vigilance quotes Charlotte’s description of her own life as a preservationist: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You get hooked on the little victories, and the little defeats, and then pretty soon you find, at least in our case, that it becomes the central part of your life. There’s no finite point when you say, ‘It’s over, I can rest.’ Eternal vigilance is the price of preserving your good idea.</p> <p><br /> In June 2004, as Assistant Director of Save the Dunes, Charlotte spoke out about federal budget cuts for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. “The lack of money threatens to do permanent damage to the park’s flora and fauna and to Americans’ ability to experience the park fully and safely.”<br /> <br /> Charlotte continued to stress the importance of communication and clarity between the National Park Service. Due to financial constraints, the national lakeshore discontinued their “living farm” programming at Chellberg Farm around 2008. The exceedingly popular programming had become a part of the community, and the public was shocked and upset at the sudden discontinuance. At a public meeting in 2009 with the then park superintendent, a frustrated Charlotte spoke: “Talk to us first and then you won't have to apologize later” To the pleasure of Charlotte and the whole community, in 2017 live animals returned to Chellberg Farm through a partnership with the Dunes Learning Center.<br /> <br /> In the summer of 2015, Charlotte spoke of going to the dunes the first time with Herb. “I loved it and still do, and I hope we can keep it from being spoiled any more than it is already,” she said. That fall she stressed to a reporter, “I want people to know how much importance the public played. Without public support, it wouldn't have happened.” On February 15, 2019, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was officially renamed Indiana Dunes National Park, an achievement that delighted the Reads. Charlotte died May 2, 2019 at age 90. Herb died 7 months later on December 22 at age 93.<br /> <br /> Former Save the Dunes president Tom Serynek said of Charlotte after her death:<br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">...she left her mark on clean air and clean water and clean land in Indiana…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She was always upbeat and positive. She’d say we’d figure it out and take care of it. But, she made sure you’d done extensive homework and that you could back up your facts.</p> <p><br /> Serynek continued in another interview; “She held a torch for environmentalism in Northwest Indiana long and high. It’s going to be hard to find someone to take up all her years of dedication and hard work.”<br /> <br /> The vice president of the Porter County chapter of the Izaak Walton League, Jim Sweeney, spoke of Charlotte after her passing:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She did her homework. She was not willing to go out on a limb unless she knew something was right. Then she was fierce…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I have always wanted to have both Herb’s scrappiness and Charlotte’s intellect and grace…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She was so committed. There was no schedule when it came to the issues. It was more than a job to her…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As we saw Shifting Sands, she loved to acknowledge and brag on the impact women had on the efforts to protect the Dunes. Talking about what they could do with more money and members, Charlotte looked right at me and said, ‘You need to get more women.’</p> <p><br /> Jeanette Neagu said, “Both she and Herb and Dorothy Buell and all the dunes people made an impression on me. They taught me that even if it seemed pie in the sky, if you work hard and organize, you can achieve.” Jeanette went on to be a distinguished activist in her own right. <br /> <br /> A former Save the Dunes executive director, Susan MiHalo said:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Charlotte’s work inspired us and reminds us we are all part of nature…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She believed we needed to be informed and participate in public commentary. That was very important to Charlotte. We have to honor her by making sure we show up, make sure our voices are heard. We have to honor her by realizing the dunes are never completely really saved.</p> <p><br /> MiHalo continued in another interview:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She’s one of the most principled people I ever met, and one of the things she taught me is when you’re taking a position on something, take an informed position…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As a result, she gained a lot of credibility…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">How things were held in public trust was very important to her. She never wanted to see that compromised.</p> <p><br /> Gary Brown, the president of the Porter County chapter of the Izaak Walton League said of Charlotte; “She never held back from truth or duty. Honest virtue was her vision. Intelligence and courage were her weapons. Perseverance and faithfulness were her victory.”<br /> <br /> Herb and Charlotte Read’s home stands within today’s Indiana Dunes National Park and has been added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture and its role in housing countless meetings to save the Indiana Dunes. At the time of designation, Herb and Charlotte hoped in the future that the house would be used for environmental education as a museum or interpretive center “to tell the story of the citizen movement to preserve the dunes.” The home is occasionally toured during the spring architectural tour, “Logs to Lustrons.”  In Shirley Heinze’s 1984 publication, “The Indiana Dunes Story,” Charlotte wrote, “It is impossible to predict what the major threats will be in the future. It is possible, however, to predict that the park will survive only if it has public support.”</p> <h3>Bibliography</h3> <p>March 18, 2001; Munster Times, Munster IN<br /> “Charlotte Read: Crusader for the Dunes continues to battle to preserve lakeshore treasure” by Ed Collier; Page 62<br /> <br /> April 17, 1994; Chicago Tribune, Chicago IL <br />  “Earth mothers” by Marya Smith ; Page 231<br /> <br /> September 14, 1952; Chicago Tribune, Chicago, IL<br />  “Weds in Church” Page 2<br /> <br /> July 19, 1986; Vidette-Messenger of Porter County, Valparaiso, IN<br />  “Dunes play a large part in her life” by Alicia McClean ; Page 2<br />  <br /> October 20, 1982; Vidette-Messenger of Porter County, Valparaiso, IN<br />  “Save the Dunes Council marks 30 years” by Sandi Holt; Page 33<br /> <br /> October 4, 1972; Vidette-Messenger of Porter County; Valparaiso, IN<br />  “Citizen Groups” Page 22<br /> <br /> January 13, 1976; Vidette-Messenger of Porter County; Valparaiso, IN<br />  “Today’s Scene” Page 2<br /> <br /> September 2, 1976; Chicago Tribune, Chicago IL<br />  “Those who love the Indiana Dunes fight to add more land to the park” by Casey Bukro, Page 5<br /> <br /> September 3, 1972; The Times, Munster, IN<br />  “Dunes Lake Park Gets Land Gift” by Gary Wilson, Page 12<br /> <br /> August 23, 1973, Vidette Messenger of Porter County, Valparaiso<br />  “Deny Save-Dunes Charge of Destroying Bog” Page 1<br /> <br /> September 28, 1978; Vidette-Messenger of Porter County, Valparaiso, IN<br />  “Dunes photo insight varies” by Kevin Leininger; Page 22<br />  <br /> October 9, 1992; South Bend Tribune, South Bend, IN<br />  “Dunes bill took 2 terms to pass in the Congress” by Matthew S.

She resolutely oversaw the family and homestead on the Little Calumet River for more than 30 years after the death of her husband, raising their children and grandchildren in an ever-foreign world. </h3> <h4>Biography:</h4> <p>Records of Marie’s life are scant. In fact, because of her ancestry, she was omitted from federal censuses. Much of her life’s story is anecdotal, gleaned from her granddaughter, Frances Howe, in her book, The Story of a French Homestead in the Old Northwest. Frances lived with her grandmother and mother Rose for over a decade at the Bailly Homestead.  Frances wrote her book in 1907, over four decades after her grandmother Marie’s death. The book’s historical accuracy is scrutinized because of Frances’ obvious embellishments; however, for their traces of truth and to better illustrate Marie’s life, select stories from Frances are included. To better understand Marie’s world, regional events that would have affected her life are also included.<br /> <br /> Marie Lefevre was born around 1783 at a small fur-trading settlement known to outsiders as Frenchtown along the River Raisin just east of Detroit, Michigan. Today it is known as Monroe, Michigan. He was a prominent early settler to Frenchtown. Many French-Canadians had moved to Detroit in decades past, and now they were beginning to disperse. They brought with them many of their French traditions, including devout Catholicism. Marie’s father was a skilled trapper and trader by the name of Lefevre of Gascon. In accordance with common practice of the time, Lefevre, who was a French-Canadian fur trader, married a Native American woman— Marie’s mother. Marie’s mother had Odawa family living in an area known as Waganakisi, or L’ Arbre Croche, “Land of Crooked Trees.” The village stood at Lake Michigan’s Little Traverse Bay near today’s Cross Village, Michigan. Today's Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians are descendents of these peoples. As she grew to a young girl on this growing outpost on the bank of River Raisin near Lake Erie, Marie was already living between two cultural worlds, that of the Native Americans and that of the French. <br /> <br /> Around 1790 when Marie was about 7, her father suddenly died. Marie’s mother was shocked when her husband’s European relatives arrived at the Lefevre home in Frenchtown, claimed all possessions and the home—kicking Marie, her mother, and sister out onto the street. Frances wrote of the event:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Never to her dying day did my Grandmother forget the awful desolation of that day and hour, when jeering, mocking strangers took possession of their home, and they stood by the roadside, taking nothing with them but the clothes they happened to be wearing.</p> <p><br />  As a result of Jay’s Treaty in 1795, British troops withdrew from Detroit and Americans began to settle around the area. Marie’s mother brought them to her family’s village on Lake Michigan, Waganakisi. At the village along Lake Michigan she was raised in Odawa culture, albeit with influences, especially in religion, of over a century of French contact. She became traditionally skilled and excelled in story-telling. John Couchis Wright, Marie’s great-grandson, was born near Waganakisi (L’ Arbre Croche) in 1874. He wrote of of the Odawa’s semi-nomadic lifestyle from the century past:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">They spent the warm summer months at or near the village of L’Arbre Croche ; the men being occupied by hunting, fishing, in the making of weapons and pipes, or lounging about ; the women weaving beautifully ornamented mats in colors, made from rushes and bark of slippery elm ; fashioning baskets, bags, pails, etc., and attending the gardens. But when the cold blasts of winter began to arrive, gradually they migrated toward the south, stopping along the coast as the occasion might require, and going as far as the hunting and trapping grounds of Northern Indiana and Illinois.</p> <p><br /> L’Arbre Croche contained remains of a Jesuit mission from decades before; including a large wooden cross, a missionary house, and a church. Although the presence of priests and acceptance of Catholicism fluctuated throughout the years, many Odawa continued to practice aspects of Christianity. Marie married an Odawa or Métis man by the name of Kougowma (or Kiogima) de La Vigne. They moved to Mackinac Island, where Marie gave birth to their daughter Agatha de la Vigne around 1797, when Marie was about 14. <br /> <br /> In 1799, a Catholic missionary, Father Richard, came to L’Arbre Croche and spread smallpox to the Odawa, killing about half of the population where Marie spent the later part of her childhood. Father Richard came to Mackinac Island around 1802 and found the island’s inhabitants relatively unreceptive to Catholicism. Memories of previous disease outbreaks from missionaries may have made the Odawa more receptive to the growing pan-American Indian movement. Around 1805, a Shawnee Native American named Tenskwatawa and often referred to as “The Prophet” from Southern Illinois was gaining popularity. He began accumulating a following of Indigenous resistance to American expansion through his unity preachings. <br /> <br /> Echoing the Prophet’s sentiment, Le Maigouis, The Trout, gave a speech in 1807 outside the American’s fort’s walls at Mackinac Island to promote the necessity of Indigenous unity for survival. The Trout was Odawa and his message would have sent ripples in the community that Marie and her daughters were connected to. Marie was around 24 at the time. The substance of The Trout’s message, which he claimed came from the Great Spirit, was distributed by newspapers in August of 1807:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><br /> My children—you are to have very little intercourse with the whites. They are not your father, as you call them ; but your brethren. I am your father. When you call me so, you do well, I am the father of the English, of the French, of the Spaniards, and the Indians ; I created the first man, who was the common father of all these people as well as yourselves, and it is through him, that I now address you. But the Americans I did not make. They are not my children, but the children of the devil. They grew from the scum of the great water, when it was troubled by the evil sprity, and the froth was driven into the woods by a strong east wing, they are numerous, but I hate them. They are unjust ; they have taken away your lands, which were not made for them.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My Children—The whites I placed on the other side of the Great Lake, that they might be a seperate people. To them I gave different manners, customs, animals, vegetables, &c. For their use. To them I have given cattle, sheep swine, and poultry for themselves only. You are not to keep any of these animals, nor to eat of their meat. To you I have given the deer, the bear, and all wild animals, and the fish that swim in the rivers, and the corn that grows in the fields, for your own use ; and you are not to give your meat or corn to the whites to eat. </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My Children—You may salute the whites when you meet them, but must not shake hands. You must not get drunk ; it is a great sin… you must not drink one DROP OF WHISKEY. It is the drink of the evil sprit. It was not made by me, but by the Americans. It is poison. It makes you sick. It burns your insides…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My Children—You must plant corn for yourselves, for your wives, and for your children, and when you do it, you are to help each other, but plant no more than is necessary for your own use. You must not sell it to the whites. It was not made for them. I made all the trees of the forest for your use ; but the maple I love best, because it yields sugar for your little ones. You must make it only for them, but sell none to the whites… by making too much you spoil the trees, and give them pain by cutting and barking them, for they have a feeling like yourselves… If a white man is starving, you may sell him a very little corn, and a very little sugar, but it must be by measure and by weight. </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My Children—You are indebted to the white traders, but you must pay them no more than half their credits, because they have cheated you. You must pay them in skins, gums, canoes, &c. But not in meat, corn, or sugar. You must not dress like the whites, nor wear hats like them, but pluck out your hair, as in ancient times, and wear the feather of the eagle on your heads; and when the weather is not severe, you must go naked, excepting the breach cloth ; and when you are clothed, it must be in skins, or in leather of your own dressing.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My Children—You complain that the animals of the forest are few and scattered. How should it be otherwise ; you destroy them yourselves, for their skins only, and leave their bodies to rot, or give the best pieces to the whites. I am displeased when I see this, and take them back to the earth, that they may not come to you again. You must kill no more animals than are necessary, to feed and clothe you…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">My Children—Your women must not live with the traders, or other white men, unless they are lawfully married. But I do not like even this ; because my white & red children were thus marked, with different colors that they might be separate people.</p> <p><br /> In his conclusion, The Trout warned the villages that do not listen to his talk, “will be cut off from the face of the earth.” In 1808, Marie gave birth to her second daughter, Theresa; shortly after, Marie’s husband Kougowma de la Vigne died. During the winter of 1808-1809, the Trout and many other L’ Arbre Croche Odawa traveled to Tenskwatawa’s Prophetstown at the confluence of the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers in Indiana to join other tribes in the Prophet's resistance. That winter, disease singled out the Odawa and approximately 160 died of tuberculosis. The Odawa returned to L’ Arbre Croche and declared Tenskwatawa a false prophet. Looking for renewal of spiritual power, many Odawa turned again to Catholicism.<br /> <br /> A few years after the death of her husband, Marie found companionship with Joseph Bailly around 1810. Bailly was a French-Canadian fur-trader on the island who had been involved with the trade since around 1793. He traded on the Grand River in Michigan in the late 1790s and taught his apprentice Jean Baptiste Beaubien there. Bailly also worked on the St. Joseph River in Michigan, where he mentored Alexander Robinson, a young, Metis, British-Odawa boy who was born on Mackinac Island. Decades later, Robinson would become a Potawatomi chief.<br /> <br /> Because both Marie and Joseph had previous marriages, their union was likely a social ceremony rather than a religious one. In 1810, Marie was about 27 and Joseph was 36. On Mackinac Island, Marie gave birth to their daughters Esther, Rose, and Eleanor; born in 1811, 1813, and 1815, respectively. <br /> <br /> In July of 1812 while Marie was pregnant and with three small girls, Britain laid siege to and captured the American’s Fort Mackinac— igniting the War of 1812. The fort was not reclaimed by the Americans until three years later at war’s end. <br /> <br /> Warfare and unrest was fueled by the Battle of Fort Dearborn in August of 1812. Potawatomi who were angered by Americans’ false promises attacked Nathan Heald, his men, and the fort’s inhabitants on their retreat to Fort Wayne in Indiana. At the time of the attack, Joseph had sent Alexander Robinson by canoe from their post on the St. Joseph River to Fort Dearborn to buy corn. He stealthily entered the area and took refuge in the house of Archange Ouilmette, where he heard the “shocks of the combatants” and “shrieks of the victims.” Three days later when other hostile Native Americans arrived at the fort. Robinson along with Black Patridge and Shabonna stood on the front porch of the Ouilmette house, protecting the Kinzie family within. John Kinzie was an early trader of the region who occasionally worked with Joseph Bailly. His ties to the fur trade would garner him protection from even pro-British Native Americans like Shabonna and Billy Caldwell. After negotiations, the hostile group left. Black Partridge put the Kinzie family in a boat. They were guided to St. Joseph and then to Detroit. Alexander Robinson took the American prisoners, Nathan Heald and his wife, to British-occupied Mackinac Island. <br /> <br /> In January of 1813, Marie’s birthplace was host to warfare at the Battle of Frenchtown when British and Indigenous forces attacked the American’s fort. That winter, Joseph Bailly conducted trade on the Grand River. While it is unclear where Marie and Joseph spent all of this tumultuous period, Frances maintained that Joseph’s fur trade business had brought them to the St. Joseph River in present day Southwestern Michigan.<br /> <br /> In December of 1813, Marie’s husband Joseph was seized as a prisoner of war for being a part of the pro-Britain Canadian militia unit. Americans wanted to cut off Native American’s supply lines so they could not aid Britain in the war. Joseph spent three months imprisoned in Detroit. It is unclear how much time Marie spent with Joseph, if any, during the months he spent away from Mackinac, trading. Considering their number of small children, Marie and Joseph’s separation may have been a common occurrence, although this time it was under more stressful and dangerous circumstances. Local historian Olga Schiemann, who knew Frances Howe well, wrote of Bailly’s quick release:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">His understanding of the causes of the War and his wide aquaintance with men on both the American and the British sides, together with his friendliness and lack of animosity plainly showed he was a man of affairs…</p> <p><br /> Following his release in March of 1814, Bailly carried a letter from H. Butler, a Canadian official that addressed all officers of the United States and directed them to allow Bailly to pass through to his trading post on the St. Joseph River. In the summer of 1814, American’s initiated a weeklong battle in an attempt to regain the fort on Mackinac Island. Though the invasion ultimately failed, Joseph was deported with other Canadian Loyalists eastward to Drummond Island, which was under control of the British. Americans regained the fort on Mackinac in July of 1815. In October, Joseph was involved in a legal case on Drummond Island regarding his time as prisoner of war. Around 1816, Marie gave birth to their only son, Robert, on Drummond Island. While legislation passed that required a trader to be American to receive a license in what is today Michigan, Joseph could continue trading on the British-controlled island. Likely in response to the same legislation, Joseph became an American citizen in the fall 1818 and the family returned to Mackinac Island so that Joseph could again enter the trade scene.<br /> <br /> In 1819, Marie’s first daughter Agatha was married at her and Joseph’s home on Mackinac to Edward Biddle. Elizabeth Baird, part of a prominent Great Lakes fur trade family and niece of North America’s first female millionaire, Madame LaFramboise, attended. She described Marie as a powerful storyteller, “one could have listened to her all day and never tired. They were told in the Odawa language.” She also described Agatha’s marriage scene, detailing the clothing that Agatha, Marie, and her aunt Madame LaFramboise wore: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“...a double skirt made of fine narrow broadcloth, with but one pleat on each side; no fullness in front nor in back. The skirt reached about half-way between the ankle and the knee, and was elaborately embroidered with ribbon and beads on both the lower and upper edges. On the lower, the width of the trimming was six inches, and on the upper, five inches. The same trimming extended up the overlapping edge of the skirt. Above this horizontal trimming were rows of ribbon, four or five inches wide, placed so near together that only a narrow strip of the cloth showed, like a narrow cord. Accompanying this was worn a pair of legging made of broadcloth. When the skirt is black, the leggins are of scarlet broadcloth, the embroidery about three inches from the side edge. Around the bottom the trimming is between four and five inches in width. The moccasins, also, were embroidered with ribbon and beads. Then we come to the blanket, as it is called, which is of fine broadcloth, either black or red, with most elaborate work of ribbon; no beads, however, are used on it….</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The waist, or sacque, is a sort of loose-fitting garment made of silk for extra occasions, but usually of calico. It is made plain, without either embroidery of ribbon or beads. The sleeves snugly fit the arm and the wrist, and the neck has only a binding to finish it. Beads enough are worn around the neck to fill in and come down in front. Silver brooches are worn according to taste. The hair is worn plain, parted in the middle, braided down the back, and tied up again, making a double queue. At this wedding, four such dresses appeared – those of the bride, her mother, Madame Laframboise, and Madame Schindler.”</p> <p><br /> Land cession treaties that stripped Indigenous peoples of their traditional lands began to appear across the region. Dr. Kelli Mosteller, Citizen Potawatomi Nation’s Cultural Heritage Center’s Director, said of this time:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> The federal government started to talk about the ‘Indian problem’ during this period, and the ‘Indian problem’ is essentially, ‘What do we do with Native Americans who have been living on lands that we want to occupy?’</p> <p><br /> In August of 1821, another treaty was under negotiations. The negotiations took over two weeks at Fort Dearborn and included much debate because of the size of the tract. Potawatomi Chief Matea is noted for having stated:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Our country was given to us by the Great Spirit, who gave it to us to hunt upon, to make our cornfields upon, to live upon, and to make down our beds upon when we die. And he would never forgive us, should we bargain it away. When you first spoke to us for lands at St. Mary’s, we said we had a little, and agreed to sell you a piece of it; but we told you we could spare no more. Now you ask us again. You are never satisfied! We have sold you a great tract of land already; but it is not enough! We sold it to you for the benefit of your children, to farm and to live upon. We have now but little left. We shall want it all for ourselves. We know not how long we may live, and we wish to have some lands for our children to hunt upon. You are gradually taking away our hunting-grounds. Your children are driving us before them. We are growing uneasy. What lands you have, you may retain forever; but we shall sell no more.</p> <p><br /> Lewis Cass, Governor of the Michigan Territory, successfully swayed opinions with threats and withholding whiskey. The Treaty of Chicago passed and ceded the majority of the Odawa’s winter hunting grounds in southern Michigan, to the Americans—nearly 4 million acres. Joseph and his family remained on Mackinac Island where he continued to trade.<br /> <br /> In the summer of 1822, Joseph and Marie settled along the bank of the Little Calumet River in today’s Indiana Dunes National Park. Joseph was already familiar with the region and the local Potawatomi from his years in the trade. The site was strategically located near two Native American trails, including the northern branch of the Sauk Trail which connected Detroit to Fort Dearborn and beyond. Around this same time, Marie gave birth to her sixth and last daughter, Hortense. Granddaughter Frances Howe relayed a story in her book about how the cabin was first constructed in a lower area. One evening, a stupendous storm flooded the cabin, and it had to be moved up the hill the following morning. She wrote, “Grandmother used to say, jestingly, that the home floated up to the summit of the hill.” It is important to note that although Frances quotes Marie in English, Marie never spoke the language and only limitedly understood French. <br /> <br /> For about years, their home was the only non-Indigenous settlement in the Calumet Area. Because of this, it was a point of interest as one of the few stopping places on the trail from Detroit to Fort Dearborn. Odawa and Potawatomi were frequent visitors to the Homestead. Like the Odawa, local Potawatomi seasonally shifted southward in the winter. When the Potawatomi left for their annual migration to the Kankakee River, Joseph and Marie safely stored their possessions at the homestead.<br /> <br /> Joseph was intent on educating their children to the best of his ability. Marie and Joseph sent their children to the Carey Mission on the St. Joseph River in present day Niles, Michigan. Their daughters were known to speak Odawa, French, and English fluently. This Baptist school began in 1822 specifically for Native American and Métis children to provide Western education and cultural assimilation. McCoy supported the Indian Removal Act and continued constructing missions west of the Mississippi following the bill’s passage in 1830. In 1827, Typhoid fever hit the school and killed Joseph and Marie’s youngest and only son, Robert. Joseph constructed an enormous oak cross and the family buried their son and brother at a nearby site that would become known as the Bailly Cemetery. The cross would have undoubtedly reminded Marie of her childhood home along Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> In September of that year, further north along the St. Joseph River from the school, the Treaty of St. Joseph was signed between Governor Cass and Potawatomi chiefs which ceded additional Indigenous land between Detroit and Chicago in Michigan for the purpose of a “territorial road.” When developed, the road’s route would follow the Native American trail that passed the Bailly Homestead. The trail would have undoubtedly been special to Marie; it not only connected her to her birthplace, but through its travelers— to her Indigenous culture.<br /> <br /> The seizure of Indigenous lands intensified after President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. States who had negotiated treaties in years past now had support for removal with federal backing. A flow of easterners heading west began to come past the Homestead as land cession treaties took land from tribes and opened it to predominantly Euro-American settlers. Marie, about 47 years old, was experiencing a change of worlds again. She witnessed her people being removed from their homeland, and the shifting attitudes of Indigenous peoples by Americans. The infringement of Native American land by Euro-American settlement led to a final Indigenous resistance in the area, the Blackhawk War of 1832 in Northern Illinois. The majority of Americans at the time considered Native Americans as uncivilized and an impediment in gaining control of the continent. In an account he wrote from a visit in 1831, Ronald Tinkham praises the Bailly daughters while slighting Marie for her ancestry:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… and just at sunset arrived at Bailey’s or Bayee’s, trading post. I never was weary nor hungry or had my feet sore before. We had walked 27 miles. The old trader was not home, but his daughters were. Fine girls, indeed, for this or any other country, tho’ their father is an ugly, illiterate man, and their mother a full blooded Odawa, yet he is rich and has given three of his daughters a good English education. They speak English, French and Indian with correctness and fluency; dress in the English fashion, and are quite accomplished and genteel in their manner.</p> <p><br /> The string of Euro-American migration westward accelerated after the Blackhawk War. Chief Shabonna, a prominent Odawa-born figure involved in both the Battle of Fort Dearborn and the Blackhawk War, was said to be a frequent visitor to the Homestead. By 1833, the major Native American trail connecting Detroit to Chicago that passed the Homestead was converted to the stagecoach road known as the Old Chicago Road. A number of accounts comment on the hospitality of Marie, the impressiveness of their girls, and the dirtiness of Joseph. Their home was furnished with mahogany furniture, books, sterling silver, china dishes, and musical instruments, including a piano. In 1833, writer Charles Fenno Hoffman and his party were ejected from their coach as they traveled past the Homestead on the Old Chicago Road. He wrote of Marie coming to assistance:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">A very respectable-looking Indian female, the wife, probably, of the French gentleman who owned the post, came out, and civilly furnished us with basins and towels to clean our hands and faces, which were sorely bespattered with mud…</p> <p><br /> He continued with a description of the Homestead:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The trading establishment consisted of six or eight log-cabins, of a most primitive construction, all of them grey with age, and so grouped on the bank of the river as to present an appearance quite picturesque.</p> <p><br /> An account from another visit of that year written by Dr. Valentine A. Boyer’s describes the Homestead and the family’s generosity, but also reveals some problematic insects:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… Departing from Laport the only place of note before we reached the Lake shore was a French Trader`s location on the Grand [Little] Calumet, consisting of six or more log shanties, for storage purposes, together with the house in which his family resided, and a stable for his cattle and horses. When we arrived there Old Mr. Baillie, for that was his name, received us very kindly and offered us one of his storage shanties…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Taking possession of the one pointed out, we found therein, several bunks in which was spread a bear skin or two and several deer skins. Being provided with a skillet, pans and a coffee pot, Mother and Sister soon prepared one of the most palatable meals we had had for some time.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…Feeling somewhat recuperated after the hearty meal we enjoyed, we began to look for our comfort, for our sleep, we found sleeping accommodations slim, Mr. Dean and myself betook us to the bunk with the bear skins without divesting ourselves of any of our clothing but our coats…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">But alas, our anticipated enjoyment was soon blasted – and to our serious disappointment, the famished fleas and bugs who had been the only occupants of the place for some time set about feasting on us so voraciously that fatigued as I was, having fallen asleep nearly as soon as I touched the bear-skin, I was after a few hours sleep aroused from my slumber, springing out of the bunk I hurried out of doors with all dispatch possible where I found Mr. Dean, who had preceded me, fast asleep on the wagon tongue of his wagon with the end board of the wagon for a pillow apparently thankful that he had escaped alive from the tormenting pests.</p> <p><br /> In 1833, another Treaty of Chicago was signed which gave Native Americans in the area (mostly Potawatomi,) two years to leave their ancestral homeland. They would have to walk to a newly promised home about 500 miles away in Kansas. The same treaty awarded Joseph Bailly money, allegedly for his assistance to convince the Potawatomi to sign. Bailly used this money to begin construction of an early version of the “big house” seen at the Homestead today. Weatherboard covered the original, hand-hewn, white oak logs, but Joseph would not live to see it completed. The treaty also awarded land in Will County, Illinois to Marie and Joseph’s daughters. When a railroad was constructed through that area in the early 1850’s, they named the nearby stop “Monee” after Marie. Frances wrote that Marie never had a Native American name, but that her maternal relatives called her Maunee because there is no “r” sound in Algonquin languages and it is supplemented by an “n.” While reasoning for the spelling is debated, Marie Bailly is the accepted namesake of Monee, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Frances recounted a story from when Odawa stopped to camp at the family homestead in the early years. A couple of Odawa girls were sent to purchase potatoes from the Morgans, the only other nearby farm. The girls came running back after they were victims of “improper advances” by two of Jesse Morgan’s sons. Frances maintains that Marie mediated the situation to peace by speaking to the Odawa. Frances wrote of another occasion when her grandmother baffled a dry goods merchant by helping coordinate purchases with her daughters and him.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">[He] was greatly surprised and frightened when he saw Grandmother take a key from a special hiding place to use it to unlock her husband’s strong box, an ironbound, oaken chest. Putting aside his papers and account books she drew forth a well-filled urse and sat down to superintend her daughters’ purchases…</p> <p><br /> On January 28, 1834, Marie and Joseph’s oldest, Esther, married John Whistler at Joseph’s former employee’s home, Mr. Beaubien, outside of Chicago. John was the son of American Captain Whistler who came to build Fort Dearborn in 1803. John and Esther have the first marriage license in Cook County, and began living together in Chicago. Also in 1834, Joseph platted the “Town of Bailly” along the little Calumet River with the hope of stabilizing finances since the fur trade had come to an end. He used “Lefevre” and many of his and Marie’s children’s names for street names. Although the town was never built, a community known as “Baillytown” would spring up around the Homestead in the decades to come.<br /> <br /> According to Frances, her Grandfather began to wind up business affairs and make arrangements for the event of his death. On December 21, 1835, Joseph Bailly died. A local man, Jacob Beck, orchestrated the burial. In accordance to women’s property rights at the time, his death inevitably left Marie and their daughters’ lives in turmoil: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Indiana’s earliest property laws were based upon the English common law tradition that considered women almost as perpetual juveniles. Women forfeited all personal interest in property upon marriage. They could not make wills or convey property. They had extremely limited rights of inheritance and no right to an independent income.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">A legal agreement regarding property before marriage could offer a married woman some protection. Most married women, however, were dependent upon their husbands for everything. Married women and widows generally had little control over their own destinies.</p> <p><br /> Frances wrote of the period after Joseph’s death and the court’s requirement of an “administrator:”</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The peculiar circumstances of Grandfather’s death and burial, led to some misunderstandings, it was falsely supposed that he had died suddenly, and that his business and his affairs generally, must be in great confusion, and that therefore a man must be needed to wind them up. In vain the family protested this theory, the judge was obstinate, and in defiance of all laws governing the actions of probate court, forced Grandmother and herdaugthers, who he treated as unreasonable women, to be coerced into subjection, to accept as an administrator to one whom they had the most reason to dread, a man against who Grandfather had specially warned them. It was a disastrous performance. Of course Grandfather’s prudence in winding up all his business and settling all his affairs absolutely prevented this person from doing all the harm he wished to do, but he did embezzle a considerable amount, his conduct being so boldly dishonest that he was brought before the grand jury in a very short time, charged with fraudulent conduct (a true bill was found against him, he did not wait to stand trial, but fled into the far west, in those days, the safe refuge for all such characters.) </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Never again in Indiana was such a piece of cruel injustice perpetuated against a bereaved family, the lesson thereof was taken deeply to heart by the Indiana lawmakers, the laws declaring the right of a widow to administrate her husband’s estate were yet more clearly denied, and any attempt to weaken them was for many and many a year met by reference to the maladministration of the estate of Joseph Bailly…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">After Porter county probate court had recognized its error, by discharging the dishonest administrator, life at the Homestead began to regulate itself in accordance with Grandfathers wishes.</p> <p><br /> Following her father’s death, Esther moved back to Indiana with John Whistler to live at and manage the Homestead. Frances wrote of Ester’s husband’s influence to Bailly land and home, “Uncle Whistler… never defrauded the estate or did anything to diminish its value.” Joseph’s son Alexis, from a previous wife, came to help settle the estate and became administrator with Marie. For two years he lived at the Homestead, sorting out his father’s real estate and attempting to settle the Bailly estate without success. Marie lived with her daughter Theresa in a one-story, three-roomed cottage that had been used as quarters for the men needed in the services of the fur trade.<br /> <br /> In 1836, a dream harbor city was platted on Lake Michigan along Dunes Creek. A saw mill was constructed, and white pine trees from the dune bluffs provided lumber for construction. In 1837, T. H. Ball moved with his family to the city, City West, when he was about 9 years old. Later in life, Ball became an early regional historian who compiled a history of Northwest Indiana in 1900. In his account, he wrote of some of his memories of the early city on Dunes Creek. He recalled that when they arrived, there were around sixteen families living in newly constructed houses, and there was even a hotel. City West was mostly located within today’s Indiana Dunes State Park and centralized around the main parking lot and pavilion area. Ball wrote (in third-person) fondly of his seven months living in City West, and noted Native Americans in the area: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… seeing the travelling parties almost every week on their ponies, going to and from the neighboring Baillytown [Homestead], and visiting at their wigwams the hunting parties that came from Green Bay in their large, birch-bark canoes, and camped for weeks near the growing village... here he first saw an Indian burial place and saw Indians mourning over their buried dead…</p> <p><br /> Immediately north and west of this area was a noted Potawatomi burial mound. Ball wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">On a sandy knoll, between the village and the lake, on the bank of the creek, there was an Indian burial ground of some size, the marks or inscriptions on the head-boards seeming to have been painted with Indian puccoon root. Here the villagers did not bury ; this sacred spot they did not disturb. Near this, in the summer and fall, some Indian encampments were held ; the Indians being quiet, peaceable hunting parties, one party at least having come down Lake Michigan from Green Bay…</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Frequently the Indian parties came on good ponies from Bailly-town [Homestead], men, women, and children passing along the west street of the village, then going by their burial place to the lake shore, sometimes going eastward to the city, sometimes westward. In a few days they would return.</p> <p><br /> Ball also noted that the Native American women and papooses on the ponies were always subjects of much interest to the White women and children. By the end of that year, a financial crash swept the country and caused the residents of City West to scatter. In 1899, Ball interviewed a Mrs. Sarah Beck Stonex, daughter of Jacob Beck, the man who prepared Joseph Bailly for burial. Ball and Stonex connected on the fact that they had both happened to attend a “frontier burial service” in City West in 1837.<br /> <br /> In 1835 a delegation of Odawa leaders from Little Traverse Bay traveled to Washington D.C. in an attempt to negotiate for keeping land in Michigan. An Odawa “head man” and interpreter, Kanapima, wrote Lewis Cass, now Secretary of War under President Andrew Jackson that December:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It is a heart-rending thought to our simple feelings to think of leaving our native country forever, and which has been bought with the price of, their native blood, and which has been thus safely transmitted to us. It is, we say, a heart-rending thought to us to think so; there are many local endearments which make the soul shrink with horror at the idea of rejecting our country forever—the mortal remains of our deceased parents, relations and friends, cry out to us as it were, for our compassion, our sympathy and our love.</p> <p><br /> In 1836, the Treaty of Washington ceded the near entirety of the Odawa’s traditional lands in the northern half of Michigan’s lower peninsula, as well as much of the upper peninsula—totaling nearly 16 million acres. In exchange for title of the land, the treaty provided Odawa permission to stay within established reservations and continue to hunt and fish on surrounding lands. Despite this, negotiations eroded over time and the American government continued to push for the Odawa’s removal. But Kanapima was well educated, having been schooled in Cincinnati and later, Rome. He understood his people’s rights and wrote letters and petitions to avoid removal of Odawa at L’Arbre Croche. Thanks to his efforts, an Odawa reservation exists in the area today. The fate of Potawatomi in Indiana did not follow this exception. After local additional treaties were signed that ceded Potawatomi land in Northwest Indiana, Chief Menominee and his people refused to leave. He wrote a federal agent in 1838:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The President does not know the truth. He, like me, has been imposed upon. He does not know that you made my young chiefs drunk and got their consent and pretended to get mine. He would not drive me from my home and the graves of my tribe, and my children, who have gone to the Great Spirit, nor allow you to tell me that your braves will take me, tied like a dog.</p> <p><br /> Despite the resistance, over 800 Potawatomi were rounded up by mounted militia that September and forced to leave. The two month trek exposed the vulnerable Potawatomi to sicknesses, killing many in an event known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death.<br /> <br /> Although Joseph Bailly and his son were buried in the family’s cemetery near the Homestead, a man named Jacob Stair had purchased the land from the federal government. In 1838, Marie’s daughter Theresa paid delinquent taxes on the property and Mr. Stair deeded the land to her. Two years later in 1840, Theresa, her husband and children followed the Potawatomi’s forced migration to Kansas. <br /> <br /> In 1841, Marie’s daughter Rose married Francis Howe at the Homestead. The family spent the day strolling through the autumn woods, and Rose and Francis planted an oak and an elm and entwined them in memory of the day. Since Joseph had been alive, traveling priests made visits to the Homestead. One priest who was to be known as Father Maurice de St. Palais visited the Bailly homestead in the early 1840s. Likely influenced by his visits, 26 year old Eleanor decided to enter the Sisters of Providence of St. Mary’s of the Woods in November of 1841. Shortly after arriving, Mother Theodore of St. Mary’s complimented Eleanor while slighting her Indigenous heritage:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">A new postulant arrived last week who appears desirable. She alone could serve as proof that the Lord has His elect everywhere and that He watches over them. She seems only half civilized, but she has received direction of the Holy Spirit. She has been brilliantly educated and knows vocal and instrumental music, which pleases Monseigneur greatly. I do not know whether she will remain, as I wish only those whom God would choose, and in spite of all her fine qualities, we would not receive her if as to virtue she were not suitable.</p> <p><br /> Father Guegen, friend of Father Maurice, recalled to Frances a visit he made to the Homestead while Ester and John lived there. His description from the 19th century is similar to its appearance today:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The house stands on a hill, a sort of clay cliff, there is a very pretty river, winding gracefully around the foot of the hill, and enough of the natural groves are left to give the impression of a dense forest, while all the buildings are in keeping with the scenery and stand just in the position best suited to the landscape.</p> <p><br /> Father Guegen noted that Marie and Theresa were on Mackinac Island at the time, visiting Agatha. He had a fine supper at the Homestead and spent the night. Frances wrote that the next morning, Esther translated confessions for some Native Americans in the area, and then Father Guegen gave mass. <br /> <br /> At age 30 in 1842, Esther Whistler died in childbirth while delivering her fifth healthy baby. After Esther’s death, Mr. Whistler and their Métis children also followed the Potawatomi’s forced migration and moved to Kansas, where he worked as a trader with his half sister-in-law, Therese (also likely known as Mary Nadeau.) Marie continued to live at the Homestead with her youngest, Hortense. During the late 1840s, Francis and Rose Howe lived in Chicago but Mr. Howe ran a sawmill near the cemetery and logged the Bailly land for lumber. Many European-American settlers continued to come to the area that was being cleared.<br /> <br /> Following Hortense’s marriage to Joel Wicker in July of 1849, Marie moved back to Mackinac Island to live with Agatha, a respected member of an unusual band of Indigenous and Métis peoples from multiple regional tribes. While Marie was away, a cholera epidemic in Chicago killed Rose’s husband Francis and four of their children in 1850. Rose gave birth to Marie’s last grandchild, Frances Howe, a few months later in 1851. Frances’ oldest sister, also named Rose, was the only of her 5 siblings to survive the cholera outbreak. Following Francis’ death, Hortense’s husband, Joel Wicker, oversaw operation of the sawmill near the Homestead.<br /> <br /> Shortly before the family’s tragedy, James Oliver Van De Veld, was consecrated as the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. According to Frances, De Veld, a “reformer,\" brought grief to Rose after her husband Francis’ death. Granddaughter Frances wrote that De Veld objected to the acceptance of a Catholic lady’s legal liberty accorded to her by laws of the United States. She maintained that Rose had administered and closed her husband’s estate, managed her own paternal inheritance, and was acknowledged the natural guardian of her children. Frances wrote that in Belgium, Rose would have been subject to a guardian after the death of her husband. De Veld’s views had apparently aligned with Belgium, and concurrently, with Illinois. In Illinois, women did not have the rights to property or their earnings until the Married Women’s Property Act was passed in 1861. Rose was in a legal bind concerning her property in Chicago. According to Olga Scheiman, Rose disposed of the Chicago home and in the counsel of one of her husband’s good friends, purchased property at State and Jackson as an investment. The Vidette-Messenger of Porter County provided another claim; that Rose left Chicago after gossip spread that shared how her parents, Joseph and Marie, had never had a church-sanctioned marriage. It also claims that the gossip was the reason for France’s 1907 book, which vehemently rejects notions of their marriage being illegitimate.<br /> <br /> Frances wrote that Rose explained her housing situation to family friend, Father Maurice, Bishop St. Palais—who came to her assistance. Father Maurice traveled to Mackinac Island and successfully petitioned Marie to help her daughter Rose by moving back to live at the old Homestead. Marie showed remorse to leave because she was well-known, respected, and comfortable living with Agatha and her tribe on Mackinac Island.<br /> <br /> According to Frances, following Marie’s return to the Homestead, she could invite Rose into her home to allow her the “virtuous freedom of an American Lady” with respect to the property. Although married women would not be granted personal property rights in Indiana until 1879, widows gained inheritance rights in May of 1852. <br /> <br /> Sometime around 1853, Marie returned to live at the Homestead with her daughter Rose, and granddaughters Rose and Frances. During this time, Hortense’s husband,Mr. Wicker, had the most influence over the estate. Frances approached the topic in her book:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… he was a man wholly ignorant of the family history, having no sympathy with the traditions of the past, and possessed with an idea that his wife had been wronged in her inheritance, so he managed matter wholly with reference to this idea. The matter which he misunderstood was in relation to the embezzling administrator ; he judged the affair wholly by the county records, which certainly made no note of the cruel coercion used on Grandmother and her daughters, compelling them to accept as administrator, one whom they had every reason to dread and dislike.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As he read the barren statement of legal proceedings, he judged the family had asked the court to appoint this man to take charge of the estate, and that therefore Aunt Hortense should have been compensated for the damage done by him to the estate, during her minorry, overlooking the fact that Grandmother ceded one-third interest to cover up all such claims. He also disliked the unavoidable intrusion of the foster sister [Agatha] into the family inheritance, so altogether his management of this lumber enterprise tended chiefly to give him an opportunity of making his wife’s inheritance furnish funds for his own investments.</p> <p><br /> Not long after Marie, Rose, and her daughters returned, Marie’s youngest daughter Hortense Wicker died in 1855. Marie had to bury a third child in the family plot. <br /> <br /> According to Frances, Marie wished for the Homestead to remain undivided to preserve its memories after her death. She said that Marie had tried to buy back Esther’s son’s shares of the estate, but they refused. Frances wrote that Joel Wicker acquired property from Esther’s sons. Mr. Wicker continued to operate the sawmill and clear Bailly land of timber. He sold the stumpland, known as “Slab City,” to an increasing stream of Swedish immigrants. The name derived from the rough shelters of the workers at the saw mill, built of the waste product from squaring the logs. By the end of the 19th century, the surge of Swedish immigration had given Porter County about 20% of the state’s Swedish population, with many living in or around what became known as “Baillytown.” Mr. Wicker acquired more of the Bailly property in 1856 when he gained ownership of the cemetery, just a quarter mile south east of where he operated a sawmill. By this time, around 20 Swedish families were already living in the area.<br /> <br /> Marie chose to live in the old kitchen, a separate structure detached from the main house. She dwelt there except for the three coldest months of winter. The Bishop who helped convince Marie to return to the Homestead from Mackinac had told her that he would send a priest once a year to perform mass, a promise, Frances said, he kept. Marie continued the family custom of visiting the cemetery every Sunday, where her husband, son, daughters, and many grandchildren were buried. Frances wrote of her grandmother:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…her health remained good for one of her advanced age, and for one who had undergone so much hardship and so much sorrow ; she was always very cheerful, very kind and very thoughtful of others, prayer was her recreation, and during the last two years of her life, her constant occupation, yet she never hesitated to lay aside her devotions to perform an act of kindness or charity, or to receive a friend affectionately. She never seemed to be lonely, though she had no society except what our presence gave her. Sometimes a family of Potawattamies came up from Central Illinois to make maple sugar, in a fine forest of hard maple nearby ; they would come and visit her and she would return their visits, otherwise she maintained a sort of cloister rule of never leaving the premises.</p> <p><br /> Frances also described her grandmother’s dress:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Grandmother’s wrap was either a handsome shawl, or else a sober mantle of broadcloth, sometimes thrown Madonna style over her head as well as her shoulders… Grandmother’s soft, silky, iron-gray hair was neatly braided into a small tress and tied with the black ribbon of widowhood.</p> <p><br /> Marie’s daughter Eleanor, who had gone to Sister’s Providence of St. Mary’s of the Woods, became Mother Cecilia in 1856. Marie’s granddaughter, Rose, attended school Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, and was the first formal graduate in 1860. Rose’s mother, Rose, sent a letter to her at school in 1857, illuminating a period that Marie spent alone with her granddaughter Frances:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">… I too started on a journey, which you must remember I had to take, Frankie preferred not to go with me of which I was very glad, though I intended to have taken her. As you had just left, I thought it might be too much for her to bear, but to my very agreeable astonishment, she preferred to remain with her Grandmother for fear, as she said, she would be lonely.</p> <p><br /> After Rose’s days long journey, she returned to the Homestead late one moonlit night:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">…both Grandma and grandchild were fast asleep. I was much relieved when I saw them sound and safe. It appears they had both been crying that evening, each told of the other. Three nights they spent alone and this was to be the fourth, two helpless beings, one for age and one from childhood, and not enjoying the comfort of speaking the same language, that is, to have much conversation together, it was pitiful!</p> <p><br /> Rose finished her letter with her worry about gathering wood being relieved because a neighbor had agreed to help them out. She notes that Marie, who was about 74 at the time, had been carrying from the woods every stick they used. In March of 1864, Rose acquired title to the cemetery property. In 1865, Marie’s daughter Rose and granddaughters Rose and Frances attended President Lincoln’s Inaugural Ball. Although reasons for the invitation are unknown, Frances was just 14 at the time; her dress and invitation are preserved by the Westchester Township History Museum. <br /> <br /> France recalled that over the years, her grandmother had gradually grown “more and more feeble.”  She wrote of her grandmother’s final months:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Early in the March of 1866… she slipped in crossing the lawn, not noticing a thin sheet of ice lying in the path, she fell in such a manner as to jar her spine ; being too old for the forces of nature to rally, this was her death blow.</p> <p><br /> In July, with her mother on her deathbed, Rose constructed a wooden fence around the family’s cemetery and instructed neighbors to abstain from burying their dead there; she even asked them to remove their already buried, but few complied. On September 15, 1866, Marie died in her quarters, the old kitchen, the same walls where her husband passed 31 years before. France wrote, “The funeral was devoid of pomp, as her husband’s had been, for such was her wish…”.<br /> <br /> Following Marie's death, Porter County courts chose to divide the Homestead’s remaining 160 acre estate in half. The 80 acres that contained the homestead went to Rose and the remaining 80 acres to her brother-in-law Joel Wicker, who quickly made sale of his half. Rose had sold most of her inheritance property between the deaths of her parents, and in order to comply with her affidavit of continued residence, she had to remain at the homestead for a number of years. In 1869, Rose ordered the old kitchen where her mother dwelled and both her parents died to be converted to a chapel. Then she left with her two daughters, Rose and Frances, for a five year sojourn to visit Catholic churches and shrines around Europe and the Holy Land. Among others, they traveled to Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Nazareth, Bethlehem, Jerusalem.<br /> <br /> Rose, Frances, and Rose visited Belgium in the spring and summer of 1874 where they witnessed a stigmatic—Louise Lateau. During her period of over 10 years, Louise would allegedly enter “ecstasies” where she would bleed from her hands as if from nail punctures every Friday promptly at 3:00 P.M.. Frances wrote about the experience with Louise Lateau in a religious journal and later published a book on the subject. In an compilation of religious literature published in 1897, Frances and her writings were described: “Her writings are characterized by a strong tendency toward theological questions, which prove that a woman may think and write deeply as well as piously.” Shortly after Rose returned to the Homestead from Europe with her daughters in 1874, she had the red brick house adjacent to the main house built for her daughter, Rose, who died 5 years later.<br /> <br /> Marie’s daughter, Rose, died on May 15, 1891 at age 78. Following her mother’s death, Frances acquired ownership of the family cemetery. As Frances approached her own death, she became increasingly worried about preserving her family’s history. To curb threats of curiosity seekers, she had a concrete wall built around the cemetery’s 1867 wall. The interior was then enclosed by filling it with sand, giving it the appearance it maintains today. Frances died while visiting her adopted daughter in California on January 20, 1917. Her burial was the final internment at the Bailly Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Marie lived as a relict negotiator in two worlds, that of the French and the Indigenous. She was born into tumultuous times where the French, British, and English all had interests in the area. She experienced a myriad of conflicts, warfare and land cession; and their effects, throughout her lifetime. Susan Sleeper-Smith wrote of Marie in Indian Women and French Men, Rethinking Cultural Encounters in the Western Great Lakes:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">She learned her mediation skills in a world where identity was kin-based and where ethnicity had limited meeting. She experienced raising children and leaving children in a “society [that] determined identity through ethnicity, and increasingly, by race… [and a] world where racial prejudice mitigated against their acceptance.</p> <p><b>MLA Format</b><br /> BOOK: Last Name, First Name. <i>Title of Book</i>.

As an avid naturalist and talented self-taught botanist, she convinced the Save the Dunes Council to make the pivotal purchase of Cowles Bog in 1953. She brought innumerable scientists and nature-lovers on insightful forays near her home; she discovered a rare remnant prairie and later alerted the park to ecological threats as well as made irreplaceable contributions to the park herbarium and rare plant monitoring.</h3> <h4>Quote by her:</h4> <p>\"A silent tongue and a true heart are the most admirable things on earth.”</p> <h4>Quote about her:</h4> <p>“Lois Howes… was an exceptionally knowledgeable student of the flora.”</p> <h3>Biography:</h3> <p>Lois Fletcher was born in Middlesex County, MA on March 15, 1914. She was the daughter of a salesman, and had two older siblings. In 1932 she graduated from Newton High School and selected a German proverb as a quote by her image; \"A silent tongue and a true heart are the most admirable things on earth.” She attended Russell Sage College in New York and graduated with a degree in physical education. Ms. Fletcher married Edward Howe in Chicago in 1938. In the 1940 census, the young couple are noted as living together in Chicago where Edward was employed as a marine engineer.<br /> <br /> Lois was in poor health and with a doctor’s recommendation to do a lot of walking, they moved to Dune Acres in 1941. Lois felt that just walking was boring, so she began to study the variety of plants that grew along the trails. Prior to the formation of the Save the Dunes Council, in November of 1951, Mrs. Howes spoke on conservation at a meeting of the Duneland Historical society that also had a slide program on wildflowers of the Dunes. The following May, Lois led a girl scout hike to identify wildflowers in the Dunes. That summer, she also assisted in girl scout day camps in the first week of June. By October of 1952, Lois was a member of the newly formed Council and she presented a land survey that showed suitable land for enlarging Indiana Dunes State Park at a Save the Dunes Council meeting. She was also active in the League of Women Voters that fall as well, when she conducted economic study groups. On June 1, 1953, the Save the Dunes Council held a meeting, Dorothy Buell presiding, at the Dune Acres clubhouse for the Regional Director of the National Park Service and his assistant, where Lois led a wildflower walk afterwards that highlighted rare plants. The same year, Lois found out that Cowles Bog, the floristically rare and historically significant wetland was being sold cheaply to pay back taxes. Lois convinced Dorothy Buell and the council to purchase the property, providing an important core for a future national park as well as inspiration to continue fighting for one.<br /> <br /> In 1954 she brought another group of girl scouts on a spring wildflower hike in the Indiana Dunes State Park. The same year, Lois was President of the local League of Women Voters, a group she had been involved in since at least 1951. She was noted describing the organization's goals as “to educate women to become better informed voters, to work toward legislation for the protection of women and children, on topics such as slum clearance, public housing, and international cooperation, and to awaken the electorate to its responsibilities.” She remained President the following year, before she stepped down and was voted chairwoman of the conservation committee in 1956.<br /> <br /> Lois continued branching out and advocated for preserving the Indiana Dunes. In June of 1956, she spoke on behalf of Save the Dunes at the Edison Garden Club of Hammond where she pointed out the vital need for a recreation area in the region. In April of 1958 she presented a talk,“Conservation and Save the Dunes” for the “Indian Trails Garden Club.”<br /> <br /> In an oral interview with Norma Schaeffer and Kay Franklin, Lois recollected her growth in Save the Dunes as the group’s early naturalist; “It was a type of job I was interested in and I didn’t want to become, I’m not the type of person, even though I do it, to go out and talk to people and try and convince them to give money, or to give their efforts. It’s hard for me to do that. I’ve overcome a lot of that shyness through the years.”<br /> <br /> The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was finally established in 1966. Lois continued to stay active in the region. That summer she taught the history of the dunes to 6th grade girl scouts. In spring of 1968, Lois led a hike in the state park for the North Porter County Garden Club. In January of 1971, she headed the Environmental Quality Committee and led discussions to reach consensus on air quality and thermal pollution. Later that year she helped lead a bus tour for the League of Women Voters on the history of Porter County where she focused on the changes of the Kankakee River.<br /> <br /> As Mrs. Howe continued committing the surrounding plant communities to memory, she began to realize the rare species that grow around her part of the Dunes. Over the years she made numerous rare plant discoveries and relayed valuable information to the park’s scientists.<br /> <br /> Barbara Plampin became one of Lois’ neighbors, and Lois’ reputation on plants soon led to a mentor-mentee relationship. Together, they traversed the dunes and meadows around Dune Acres. Barbara spoke of Lois’ wholehearted commitment, “When she got arthritic in her early 60s… she would take what she called ‘four wheel drive’ up the dune, which meant she just got down on her hands and knees, and crawled up the dunes.” Barbara also spoke of Lois’ discovery of a remnant prairie that contained unusually rare species that were previously unknown to the Dunes:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Well she was dedicated, she was the one who discovered Howes Prairie, she discovered in it an extremely rare plant, which she sent a specimen of to Floyd, and that’s when Floyd got interested in Howes Prairie... it’s a peculiar plant that will bloom in dry years after wet years.”</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“So some years you see it, and some years you will not see it, and there’s always great anxiety about, did you see [it] this year, did you see it?”</p> <p><br /> In a later publication, the National Park Service described Lois’ namesake prairie:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Howes Prairie is an area of high species and community diversity in the Indiana Dunes. The vegetation in the burn area is a complex mosaic of wet prairie, mesic prairie, oak savanna, and oak forest communities on sand dunes at the southern end of Lake Michigan. The wet prairie is often flooded in the spring and dominated by bluejoint grass (<em>Calamagrostis canadensis</em>), meadowsweet (<em>Spiraea alba</em>), and willow (<em>Salix gracilis</em>) with scattered aspen (<em>Populus tremuloides</em>). The highly diverse mesic prairie contains abundant little bluestem (<em>Andropogon scoparius</em>), big bluestem (<em>A. gerardii</em>) , Indian grass (<em>Sorghastrum nutans</em>), marsh blazing star (<em>Liatris spicata</em>), rattlesnake master (<em>Eryngium yuccifolium</em>), and tall coreopsis (<em>Coreopsis tripteris</em>). The oak woods range from savanna-like dry oak woods dominated by black oak (<em>Quercus velutina</em>) and sassafras (<em>Sassafras albidum</em>), to mesic woods with abundant white oak (<em>Quercus alba</em>), red maple (<em>Acer rubrum</em>,) and black cherry (<em>Prunus serotina</em>) (Cole and Pavlovic unpubl. data). The understory vegetation in the oak woods and mesic woods is predominantly Pennsylvania sedge (<em>Carex pennsylvanica</em>) and late low blueberry (<em>Vaccinium vacillans</em>).”</p> <p><br /> In January of 1975, the Vidette-Messenger of Porter County reported that Lois, along with local author Norma Schaeffer and local artist Hazel Hannell, participated in the 4th Annual Christmas Bird Count in 1974, a birding tradition that continues today. From 1970-1975, the number of invasive cattails in the sedge meadow of the Cowles Bog Wetland Complex had more than tripled. Lois Howes was the first to alert the National Park Service of this growing issue.<br /> <br /> In 1980, Gerould Wilhelm published a report on the special vegetation of the Indiana Dunes. At this time, he described the condition of the Great Marsh’s sedge meadow as </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“little more than a pathetic desert of Cattail populated in some areas by uniform, solid stands of Cattail alone!” Wilhelm attributed this to fluctuating water levels and fire suppression. “The Great Marsh… still contains, here and there, small, remote populations of a number of species, most of which could proliferate and coalesce into relatively rich associations if water levels were stabilized and fires again became regular fall occurrences.”</p> <p><br /> Today, the National Park Service has made great progress in battling the invasive cattails and restoring the prior plant biodiversity to the site. Although Gerould Wilhelm’s report was published after her death, he mentioned Lois’ assistance in finding rare species on numerous occasions. In his report, Gerould shared that Lois was one of the first to recognize that the area was distinctive and unique, and that she brought it to the attention of Floyd Swink. Gerould mentions the prairie having a handful of names, but that he felt “Lois Howes Prairie” was most appropriate. The name stuck.<br /> <br /> One of the highest quality sand prairie habitats in Indiana, Howes Prairie comprises 80 acres of rich mesic prairie and wet prairie. Rose gentian, <em>Sabatia angularis</em>, was one of the plants she found there. It is more commonly found today in panne wetlands like those along the Dunes Succession Trail at West Beach. Just like those wetlands, the wind scoured the sand down to the water table at today’s Howes Prairie when the area was nearer the shore. A ten inch deep core sample of peat in the wet prairie that Kenneth Cole took provided some paleoecological insight into the site. The wind-swept area became a white and jack pine-dominated forest before oaks became more adapted to the site. Periodic fires kept the oaks at bay.<br /> <br /> In an ethnobotany study of the Indiana Dunes, elders of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation shared that Howes Prairie’s high places and diversity of certain plants meant it would have been shared and used for medicine collecting. This role was often traditionally performed by multigeneration groups of girls and women. Noel Pavlovic observed in core samples an increase in fire frequencies in the post-European-settlement era, he hypothesized an increase in steam locomotives may have contributed to starting fires in newly drained wetlands areas. Lois believed that a chronic lack of fire was leading to the disappearance of many species around her beloved prairie.<br /> <br /> In addition to the previously mentioned groups, Lois was involved in the Audubon Society, Dueland Historical Society, Friends of Westchester Library and was a volunteer for the National Park Service. She died on April 8, 1985 in Dune Acres. Her children, who grew up in the prairie, scattered some of Lois’ ashes there.<br /> <br /> In 1986, Lois was acknowledged again for sharing her expertise in the publication “Endangered Plant Monitoring Strategies at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore” published by the Morton Arboretum, University of Illinois and the park service. When a 1990 edition of special vegetation report  was released, Wilhelm reaffirmed her critical help: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“Lois Howes, a long-time resident of Dune Acres prior to her death, was an exceptionally knowledgeable student of the flora. She gave up a day of her time to take Floyd Swink, Ken Dritz, and me to wonderfil out-of-the way places in the Dune Acres Unit; she showed us many rare plants, and provided numerous historical and floristic insights. To the extent that the contemporary flora of the Dune Acres Unit is adequately portrayed in Survey Unit V, Lois is largely responsible. She left many notes on the plants of Dune Acres; both Barbara Plampin and Emma Pitcher have provided me with these notes and keys to their importance.”</p> <p><br /> Following Lois’ death, a memorial lecture series began in her honor that often included a hike to her namesake prairie. The lecture series continued until at least 1993. On April 18, 1986, the first prescribed burn within Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was conducted at Howe’s Prairie. Since then and throughout the 1990’s the prairie received seven more “research burns.” Since the early 2000s, there have been 5 prescribed burns and one wildfire; the prairie’s last prescribed burn was in 2019. The fire regime’s return has led to a fire return of about 34%, providing the necessary conditions to help Howes Prairie flourish. The National Park Service occasionally offers hikes to the rare prairie, check with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/idnlvc.htm\">Indiana Dunes Visitor Center</a> to learn of upcoming visits.</p> <hr /> <p><em>The content for this article was written by Joseph Gruzalski, a researcher with Indiana Dunes National Park.

An immigrant to the United States from China, she did important work for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mapr/index.htm\">Manhattan Project</a> and in experimental physics. Her crucial contribution to particle physics was, however, ignored by the Nobel Prize committee when it awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.<br /> <br /> Chien-Shiung was born on May 31, 1912 and raised in a small fishing town just north of Shanghai, China. She had two brothers and was the middle child. Although relatively uncommon for girls to attend school, Chien-Shiung went to Mingde Women’s Vocational Continuing School. It was founded by her father, who believed that girls should receive an education.<br /> <br /> In 1934, Chien-Shiung graduated at the top of her class with a degree in physics from the National Central University in Nanking, China (now known as Nanjing University). After graduation, she worked in a physics lab in China. Her mentor, Dr. Jing-Wei Gu, another woman working in the field of physics, encouraged Chien-Shiung to continue her education in the United States.<br /> <br /> With financial support from her uncle, Chien-Shiung took a ship to San Francisco. She was likely processed for immigration to the United States at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/u-s-immigration-station-angel-island.htm\">Angel Island Immigration Station</a> located in San Francisco Bay.[1] She enrolled at the University of California Berkeley in 1936.[2] Her academic advisor was Ernest Lawrence. In 1939, while Chien-Shiung was still his student, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the cyclotron particle accelerator. In 1940, Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu graduated with her PhD in physics.<br /> <br /> In 1942, she married Luke Chia-Liu Yuan, who she had met during her studies at Berkeley. Neither of their families were able to attend the wedding because of World War II fighting in the Pacific. They moved to the east coast where Dr. Wu taught physics at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts and at Princeton University in New Jersey.[3] She was the first woman hired as faculty in the Physics Department at Princeton. Shortly afterwards, in 1944, Dr. Wu took a job at Columbia University in New York City, and joined the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mapr/index.htm\">Manhattan Project</a>. The Manhattan Project researchers were working towards the creation of the atomic bomb. Chein-Shiung’s research included improving Geiger counters for the detection of radiation and the enrichment of uranium in large quantities.<br /> <br /> Once communications with China were restored after World War II, Wu received a letter from her family. She was making plans to visit them when the Chinese Civil War started, and her travel was put on hold. Later, her father told her not to return to Communist China. She was not able to return to China until 1973. By then, her parents had died and their tombs destroyed. Both her uncle and brother were also gone, killed in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Luke and Chien-Shiung had a son in 1947. Following in his parents’ footsteps, he also became a nuclear scientist. In 1954, Chien-Shiung became a US Citizen.<br /> <br /> After World War II, Dr. Wu continued on at Columbia University, becoming a full professor in 1958 and the Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973. In 1975, her pay as a professor was raised to be equal to that of her male colleagues. Among her important contributions to physics was the first confirmation of Enrico Fermi’s 1933 theory of beta decay (how radioactive atoms become more stable and less radioactive). She also played a crucial role in an important advancement in atomic science. In 1956, physicists Tsung-Dao Lee (at Columbia University) and Chen Ning Yang (Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton) asked Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu to create an experiment. The purpose was to test their theory that the conservation of parity did not apply during beta decay. The conservation of parity is the scientific principle that identical nuclear particles act alike. Dr. Wu agreed to design the experiment. She carried it out at laboratories at the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Washington, DC.[4]<br /> <br /> To test the theory, she put cobalt-60 (a radioactive variety of cobalt) into a strong electromagnetic field at temperatures near absolute zero. The cold helped eliminate the effect of temperature on the atoms. If the conservation of parity held true, particles expelled by the cobalt-60 as it decayed from radioactive to stable should fly off in all directions. What she observed was that more particles flew off in one direction (the direction opposite to the spin of the nucleus). Therefore, conservation of parity did not happen during beta decay. The experiment, known as the Wu Experiment, is named for her. Yet, in 1957, Lee and Yang were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. Like the contributions of many women in science at the time, Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu’s work was not acknowledged. In 1964, at a symposium at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she asked her audience “whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment.”<br /> <br /> Chien-Shiung Wu continued to be a leader in the field of physics, and her work even crossed over to biology and medicine. Some of her research included looking at the molecular changes in red blood cells that cause sickle-cell disease. Although denied recognition with the Nobel Prize, Dr. Wu received many honors during her career. These include being only the seventh woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences (1958); the Comstock Prize in Physics given by the National Academy of Sciences; the first woman to be president of the American Physical Society (1975); the first person to receive the Wolf Prize in Physics (1978); and the first honorary doctorate awarded by Princeton University to a woman. In 1990, she had an asteroid named after her (2752 Wu Chien-Shiung).<br /> <br /> Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu retired from Columbia in 1981 and died of a stroke in New York City on February 16, 1997. Her ashes were buried in the courtyard of the Mingde School in China that she had attended as a girl.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Notes</span><br /> [1] Angel Island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1971 and designated a National Landmark Historic District on December 9, 1997.<br /> <br /> [2] Sather Tower, also known as The Campanile, is a highly visible and noted feature of the University of California Berkeley campus.

            "bodyText": "<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>John Bradstreet (baptized Jean-Baptiste) was born on 21 December 1714 in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Some believe he may have been born in England with the family relocating shortly after his birth. He was the second son of Edward Bradstreet and Agathe de Saint-Étienne de La Tour. Edmond became ill and died in 1718. Agatha Bradstreet re-married and her family remained in Annapolis Royal, where the boys grew up. <br /> <br /> John Bradstreet and his brother Simon served in Nova Scotia as volunteers in Richard Philipps’ regiment (40th Foot) until 1735, when their mother, working through the regimental agent King Gould, secured commissions for them. John received an ensign’s rank and thus began a military career which would be capped when he became a major-general in 1772.<br /> <br /> Confusion surrounds the early years and family of John Bradstreet as the result of the presence in Nova Scotia of a cousin of the same name. After the latter’s death John compounded the confusion by marrying his widow, Mary Aldridge, and two of the four children believed to be his were actually his cousin’s. In later years Bradstreet was reticent to discuss his family background and the Nova Scotian phase of his career. No doubt uneasiness about the effect his Acadian ancestry would have on his career in the British army, as well as his involvement in questionable trading activities, explain his silence. The result has been a historical picture of Bradstreet as an enigmatic figure who first emerged during the campaign against Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) in 1745. As a young officer stationed at Canso in the 1730s, however, Bradstreet had been very active. In addition to carrying out his military duties, he had developed a lucrative trade in provisions and lumber with the French fortress. Despite advice from Gould to “Knock off” such activities lest they damage his military career, Bradstreet continued his mercantile connections with Louisbourg well into 1743. Not surprisingly, when Canso and its garrison were captured by the French in May 1744 Bradstreet was given preferred treatment.<br /> <br /> During the next few months he became the message bearer between the commandant of Louisbourg, Jean-Baptiste-Louis Le Prévost Duquesnel, and Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts as prisoner exchanges were discussed. Bradstreet also worked at turning his knowledge of Louisbourg to good advantage in New England and improving his chances of promotion in Britain. The very day in September 1744 that the released Canso garrison reached Boston, Bradstreet and George Ryall, a fellow officer in the garrison, submitted a report on Louisbourg to Shirley which stressed the fortress’s importance to the French empire and hinted at its vulnerability. Three months later, Bradstreet presented Shirley with a plan for an assault on the French stronghold. Whether it was used as the basis for the 1745 attack is uncertain since no copy is now available. William Vaughan claimed to have been the author of the definitive plan; however, Bradstreet was described by William Pepperrell as “the first projector of the expedition,” and Shirley claimed that it was because of Bradstreet’s “Intelligence and advice...that I set the Expedition on foot.”<br /> <br /> Although disappointed that he was not given command of the expedition, Bradstreet accepted a provincial commission as lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Massachusetts Regiment and contributed to the victory at Louisbourg. Pepperrell, Commodore Peter Warren, and Shirley all applauded his performance. The day after the surrender Bradstreet was commissioned “Town Major of ye City and Fortress,” but the more substantial rewards he clearly expected were not forthcoming. Moreover, after Charles Knowles became governor of Cape Breton in June 1746, even his position as town major was lost. Personal animosity developed between the two men, and rewarding sidelines for Bradstreet, such as providing rum and fuel to the garrison, were curtailed by Knowles, who claimed that he no longer permitted Bradstreet “to Plunder the Government.” Although Bradstreet had been appointed captain in Pepperrell’s newly established regular regiment garrisoning the fortress and on 16 Sept. 1746 was appointed lieutenant governor of St John’s, Newfoundland, he remained bitter. Further attempts to improve his situation failing and continued frustration at Louisbourg being unacceptable, he journeyed to St. John’s in August 1747 to begin active service as lieutenant governor.     <br /> <br /> Newfoundland turned out to be only a temporary resting place, however, since in the fall of 1751 he went to England. Armed with his journal of the siege, reciting his contributions, and bemoaning his treatment, he soon regained the support of King Gould and Gould’s son Charles which he had lost because of his trading activities, and he aroused the interest of powerful persons such as Sir Richard Lyttleton, an intimate of William Pitt, Charles Townshend, later chancellor of the exchequer under Pitt, and Lord Baltimore. Although both Townshend and Baltimore were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to obtain preferment for him, Lyttleton and Charles Gould were to prove more useful. Having gained badly needed “Easie Access” to patrons in England, Bradstreet returned to America in 1755 with Major-General Edward Braddock’s expedition.     <br /> <br /> Now a captain in Pepperrell’s newly raised 51st Foot, he was initially assigned to Shirley’s campaign against Fort Niagara (near Youngstown, N.Y.) the same year. Lacking experienced personnel, the Massachusetts governor relied heavily on his old Louisbourg adviser. In the spring of 1755 he ordered Bradstreet to Oswego (Chouaguen) to improve its defences and prepare it as a base for the assault on Niagara. Bradstreet carried out his orders energetically and in August he was promoted brevet-major and adjutant-general. During the summer, however, Shirley had encountered difficulty in organizing and transporting his army to Oswego, and as the opportunity for a Niagara strike slipped away Bradstreet sought permission for an immediate attack on the French fort. Shirley had rejected this plan, and in September he abandoned the campaign altogether. He decided that an attack on Fort Frontenac (Kingston, Ont.), which he described as “the Key” to Lake Ontario, must be the first campaign of 1756, and he assigned the task to Bradstreet.     <br /> <br /> One of Bradstreet’s first duties in the spring was to lead a convoy of bateaux to reinforce the garrison at Oswego. Once there he was to select the necessary men and supplies and attack Fort Frontenac. He had difficulty in reaching Oswego, however, and its weakened garrison and incomplete fortifications made it obvious that an offensive against Frontenac was impossible. Since French pressure on Oswego was now growing, Bradstreet directed his efforts to keeping the supply line between Oswego and Albany open. He returned to Oswego once more on 1 July 1756 and then waited impatiently in Albany to set out again. In mid-August, however, Montcalm captured Oswego.     <br /> <br /> By then Lord Loudoun had replaced Shirley as commander of the British forces in America. Shirley’s enemies, such as Sir Charles Hardy and Sir William Johnson, identified Bradstreet as one of his cohorts, but Bradstreet was quick to dissociate himself from his former commander. Forewarned in March 1756 by Charles Gould that Shirley “is no longer in great esteem here,” Bradstreet became somewhat uncooperative when Shirley attempted to collect information for his own vindication. He moved instead to endear himself to Loudoun and his staff, and his strategy worked perfectly. Of all the measures that Shirley had authorized, only Bradstreet’s performance “won the unqualified praise of Shirley’s successors.” With Loudoun’s approval the bills for his bateau service were honored, he received a captaincy in the Royal Americans (60th Foot) when the 51st was disbanded early in 1757, and he became virtual quartermaster and aide-de-camp to Loudoun. During the spring of 1757, he assembled supplies and transports at Boston for Loudoun’s expedition against Louisbourg, and at Halifax in August he was among those who felt that the attack should not be postponed.     <br /> <br /> Although disappointed by the cancellation of the expedition, Bradstreet was encouraged to learn that William Pitt had become the British prime minister, and he wrote to Lyttleton seeking “a favourable mention.” He was quite willing to specify appointments to which he considered himself entitled, such as the governorship of New Jersey, the colonelcy of a regiment of rangers, or the post of quartermaster general. Moreover, once again offering schemes to his superiors, early in September 1757, he sent Lyttleton his thoughts on how Canada could be conquered. For complete victory in North America a three-pronged assault should be launched against the French possessions. One army should reduce Louisbourg and then proceed against Quebec while another should move from Albany to capture forts Carillon (Ticonderoga, N.Y.) and Saint-Frédéric (near Crown Point, N.Y.) and then link up with the third army, which was to attack across Lake Ontario from Oswego. The combined forces should then proceed “in a short time [with] the reduction of the Town of Montreal.” Bradstreet thus offered a strategy which bears a striking resemblance to the basic plan that Pitt used to achieve the conquest of Canada in the campaigns of 1758 to 1760.     <br /> <br /> “Charmed with the Spirit and Enterprising Genius” of Bradstreet, Lyttleton passed his ideas along to Pitt and Lord Ligonier, commander-in-chief of the British army. The latter was definitely influenced by them in drawing up his plans for the 1758 campaign. Quick action followed Bradstreet’s request for promotion; on 1 Jan. 1758 Lyttleton reported to Charles Gould with obvious satisfaction that “I have Obtained for our Friend Bradstreet the rank of <i>Lt</i>. <i>Col</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>Kings</i> <i>Service</i>, as Deputy Quarter Master General for America.”     <br /> <br /> While he was winning promotion in England, Bradstreet was being assigned increasingly important tasks in America. Loudoun ordered him to oversee the construction of bateaux in the Albany region for service on Lake Ontario and the Hudson and St Lawrence rivers in the coming campaign, and he also approved Bradstreet’s proposal for an attack on Fort Frontenac in the early spring. These plans were abruptly altered early in March, however, when Loudoun was replaced by James Abercromby. In Pitt’s orders to Abercromby, Bradstreet was assigned to quartermaster’s duties in the southern colonies. Abercromby was aware of Bradstreet’s talents, however, and in “an inspired piece of disobedience” decided to use him in his campaign against Fort Carillon.<br /> <br /> Accordingly, Bradstreet supervised the construction of bateaux and the movement of men and provisions up the Hudson River in preparation for the attack. When Viscount Howe (George Augustus Howe), Abercromby’s second in command, was killed, Bradstreet “took up the slack” since Thomas Gage, now second in command, failed to emerge as a key adviser to Abercromby. With Abercromby’s permission he took a force of several thousand regulars and provincials on a more direct route to Carillon than the army had been following. Once before the fort with this advance guard, Bradstreet requested permission to launch an immediate attack. Abercromby did not take “the least Notice” of this request but instead came up with the rest of the army and ordered the attack for the next day. The delay proved costly: on 8 July the strengthened French forces and entrenchments hurled back successive waves of British attackers. Following Abercromby’s decision to withdraw, Bradstreet took command at the landing place and converted a near disastrous rush for the boats into an orderly embarkation.     <br /> <br /> While others licked their wounds in the aftermath of the British defeat, Bradstreet resurrected his proposal for an attack on Fort Frontenac and secured Abercromby’s approval. His largely colonial force of approximately 3,000 reached Lake Ontario on 21 August and four days later was within sight of the French fort. Frontenac was in no condition to resist a siege and the fort’s commander, Pierre-Jacques Payen de Noyan et de Chavoy, surrendered on the 27th. After plundering, burning, and demolishing the fort, Bradstreet’s force retreated to British territory. With this one brilliant stroke the lifeline of the French Great Lakes empire had been severed. More directly, the capture of French provisions at the post, the destruction of the French naval flotilla on Lake Ontario, and the resultant blow to French prestige among the Indians all contributed to the final defeat of New France.     <br /> <br /> Bradstreet’s triumph was applauded in Great Britain, and he was promptly promoted colonel in America, the promotion being backdated to 20 August. But ironically, although his military career had risen to its apex during Britain’s years of defeat, his feelings of frustration and neglect intensified as the victorious years of the British war effort began. Under his new commander, Jeffery Amherst, Bradstreet served as deputy quartermaster general at Albany, winning Amherst’s consistent respect for the conscientious performance of his duties. During the preparations for the 1760 campaign Bradstreet’s ceaseless diligence caused his health to collapse and brought him to death’s door. As Amherst’s army embarked upon the final reduction of Canada, Bradstreet remained behind at Oswego, confined to his bed. Although his quartermaster’s duties were financially rewarding and indeed increased his political and economic importance in the Albany region, as the war drew to a close he became increasingly concerned at what he considered the British government’s failure to reward adequately his contributions to the victory. His cause was not helped by Lyttleton’s departure from England in 1760 nor by Pitt’s fall from power in 1761, but the faithful Charles Gould continued to solicit on his behalf and in October 1763 secured his appointment as lieutenant governor of either Montreal or Trois-Rivières once Ralph Burton’s choice was known. By this time Pontiac’s uprising had broken out, and Amherst offered Bradstreet command of an expedition to the Great Lakes against the Indians. Reasoning that the successful completion of this task would carry more weight with the British government than his service in Canada, he accepted.     <br /> <br /> The operations planned for 1764 were directed primarily against the Delawares and the Shawnees; Bradstreet was to command a northern force moving from Niagara to Detroit, while Henry Bouquet was to command a southern force moving from Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh, Pa) towards the Muskingum River (Ohio). Unable for various reasons to leave Niagara until early August, and bitterly disappointed at the limited size of his force, Bradstreet convinced himself that his mission was also one of peacemaking. Thus he offered tentative peace terms to an Indian delegation which met him near Fort Presque Isle (Erie, Pa) on 12 August and conducted further negotiations after his arrival at Detroit on 27 August.     <br /> <br /> By mid-September Bradstreet had reached Sandusky (Ohio) on his return journey. Gage, who had succeeded Amherst as commander-in-chief, had by now been informed of Bradstreet’s peacemaking activities and disavowed them, ordering Bradstreet to launch an overland attack against the Delawares and Shawnees. Bradstreet felt his weakened force was incapable of such a mission and remained at Sandusky until mid October, offering only a potential threat to the Indians and an indirect aid to Bouquet. The journey from Sandusky disintegrated into a nightmarish rout because of storms and lack of supplies, and it was not until 4 November that the remnants of the expedition began to arrive at Niagara. To his credit, Bradstreet had relieved Detroit, helped reopen the various posts on the Upper Lakes, and proved at least an indirect help to Bouquet’s more successful campaign. But to Gage and Sir William Johnson, Bradstreet had mismanaged the campaign and exceeded his instructions, and he emerged from the Detroit campaign with his military record and reputation badly tarnished. After the Detroit disappointment Bradstreet continued to serve as acting deputy quartermaster general at Albany, a virtual sinecure since his departmental expenditures and responsibilities were cut to the bone by Gage. The unsympathetic Gage remained as commander-in-chief for the remainder of Bradstreet’s life, often thwarting his efforts at advancement. Bradstreet prospered financially through land speculation and other dealings, but his military career stagnated. Pet projects such as the establishment of a full-fledged colony at Detroit with himself as governor were still offered to the home authorities, but although the projects were at times carried to the brink of achievement they were ultimately unsuccessful. Equally futile were his requests for the governorships of Massachusetts, New York, or even Canada when he heard that Guy Carleton contemplated “never returning” in 1770.<br /> <br /> During the 1760s, he began to acquire acreage in the colony of New York. He secured a leasehold from the Van Rensselaers on a prime strip of land located along Albany's southern border. Calling that parcel \"Whitehall\", he began to engage tenants to farm the bottomland that included \"Patroon's Island.\" In 1768, he also took title to a large tract located between the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers - more than a hundred miles west of Albany. By the 1770s, he was looking to develop that land as well. His family never joined him in New York. After living in Boston, by 1765 Mary Bradstreet and her daughters had removed to England.<br /> <br /> Except for the Schuylers, Bradstreet had a more contentious time with other Albany leaders in that he was clearly identified with the British, complained about Albany to his superiors, and brought actions against Albany people in the local courts. At the same time, his aggressive manner caused friction with Sir William Johnson - the most powerful British adherent in the entire regions.<br /> <br /> In 1773, the possibility of his succeeding Gage was still being pursued, and his proposal for a Detroit colony was resubmitted the following year, only to be precluded by the Quebec Act. The old warrior was spared the news of this final rejection, as well as the spectacle of the open revolution he had long expected, since he died at New York City on 25 Sept. 1774. The next day, accompanied by an elaborate funeral <i>cortège</i>, Bradstreet’s body was borne to its final resting place in Trinity Church. His will left his South Albany farm to his namesake, John Bradstreet Schuyler.</p> <p>Despite considerable achievement, Bradstreet's ambition for high station was undermined by an aggressive and abrasive personality that kept him at arms length from royal officials who characterized his brashness as \"all too peculiar to those born in America.\" Not until 1771 when he was sick with dropsy and broken by cirrhosis of the liver, was he promoted to the rank of Major General.<br /> <br /> For an Anglo-American-Acadian a successful career in the mid-18th-century British army was not an easy undertaking. Nevertheless, Bradstreet was able to combine a prominent role in military triumphs with proper timing, well-placed patrons, the support of his commanding officer, and a widespread recognition of his special talents, and he thus did remarkably well. The obscurity surrounding his background and the questionable side of many of his schemes and actions kept him beyond the pale, however. Although valued in a wartime emergency, he remained a somewhat irregular regular.</p> <h4>Notes:</h4> <ul> <li>Material concerning John Bradstreet is fairly extensive but widely scattered. The Tredegar Park coll. at the National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth) contains the immensely rewarding Bradstreet-Gould correspondence. At the PAC numerous collections (in microfilm and transcript) touch upon Bradstreet’s activities. Among the more important are the Amherst family papers (MG 18, L4), AN, Col., C<sup>11B</sup> (MG 1), Nova Scotia A (MG 11, [CO 217]), PRO, Adm.1 (MG 12), CO 5, CO 194, CO 217 (MG 11), PRO 30/8 (MG 23, A2), and WO 1 (MG 13). At the PANS, RG 1, 5–26, 29–30, 34–35, and 38 were helpful. The Clements Library houses the extensive Thomas Gage papers; the American series contains substantial correspondence between Gage and Bradstreet. The American Antiquarian Soc. (Worcester, Mass.) has the John Bradstreet papers, 1755–77, and the New York Public Library, Manuscripts and Archives Division, has the somewhat disappointing Philip Schuyler papers. Both the New York Hist. Soc. (New York) and the New York State Library (Albany) have miscellaneous items dealing with Bradstreet. The Huntington Library has the Abercromby and Loudoun papers, which are worthwhile, particularly the latter, and the Mass. Hist. Soc. has the equally useful Belknap papers.     </li> <li>Among the more important printed primary sources are [John Bradstreet], <i>An</i> <i>impartial</i> <i>account</i> <i>of</i> <i>Lieut</i>. <i>Col</i>. <i>Bradstreet</i>’<i>s</i> <i>expedition</i> <i>to</i> <i>Fort</i> <i>Frontenac</i> . . .

Gansevoort’s paternal relatives first arrived in New York in 1657, and settled in Albany twenty years later. His earliest military training came at the age of 13 as part of the British force that besieged Havana, Cuba in 1762.<br /> <br /> When Continental troops were raised for the invasion of Canada at the start of the Revolutionary War, Gansevoort traded his militia commission for that of a major in the 2<sup>nd</sup> New York Regiment. That fall, Gansevoort was promoted to the rank of colonel and given command of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-3rd-new-york-regiment-of-the-continental-line-1777-1781.htm\">3<sup>rd</sup> New York Regiment</a>. In the spring of 1777, the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY was ordered to Fort Schuyler (Stanwix).<br /> <br /> Col. Gansevoort commanded the fort during a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-1777-siege-of-fort-schuyler.htm\">21 day British siege in August of 1777</a>. He refused to surrender the post, and in response to a British summons for surrender said: \"...It is my determined resolution...to defend this fort and garrison to the last extremity...\" Gansevoort's determination won out in the end, and the British were forced to retreat back to Canada. John Adams commented on the siege that “Gansevoort has proven that it is possible to defend a fort.”<i> </i>From the fall of 1777 through 1778, he divided his time between command of the fort and time in Albany with his new bride, Catherine (Van Schaick).<br /> <br /> The 3<sup>rd</sup> NY spent the winter of 1778-79 posted at various points between Saratoga and Schenectady. In 1779, Gansevoort and his regiment took a role in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-clinton-sullivan-campaign-of-1779.htm\">Sullivan-Clinton expedition</a> against the British allied Six Nations. A bout of illness kept him in Albany during the winter of 1779-80, and he did not rejoin his regiment until the spring of 1780. In July of 1780, Gansevoort's regiment made up part of the garrison at West Point. Later that year he was placed in temporary command of the New York Brigade. In the fall of 1780, the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY was stationed at various points throughout the upper Hudson Valley, with Gansevoort's headquarters at Fort Saratoga. With the consolidation of 1781, Gansevoort's regiment was absorbed into the 1<sup>st</sup> NY Regiment and colonel's commission was abolished. Gansevoort then accepted the rank of brigadier general, commanding the Albany County Militia. He held this post until 1809.<br /> <br /> After the war, Gansevoort concentrated on rebuilding the family fortune. In 1788, Gansevoort became an Indian Commissioner; and in 1790, became Sheriff of Albany County. In 1800, he was appointed a U.S. Military Agent, and in 1809, a Brigadier General in the U.S. Army. During the winter of 1811, Gansevoort contracted various illnesses that shattered his health. Brigadier General Peter Gansevoort died on July 2, 1812 at the age of 68. His summer home in Gansevoort, New York still stands.<b> </b><br /> <br /> Several of his grandchildren contributed to American history during the 1800s. His granddaughter donated most of his military items to the Smithsonian in the 1800s. One grandson, Guert Gansevoort became an American Naval officer, serving 45 years, through the Mexican-American and American Civil Wars. Another grandson, Herman Melville, became famous in his own right after penning the novel <u>Moby Dick</u>.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Image below:</strong> Peter Gansevoort's regimental jacket from his time in the 3<sup>rd</sup> NY Regiment. He wore this coat during his command of Fort Schuyler in 1777.

            "bodyText": "<p>His vigorous efforts to build public and political support for the parks helped persuade Congress to create the National Park Service in 1916. Appointed the first NPS director in May 1917, he continued to promote park access, development, and use and contributed generously to the parks from his personal fortune. During his tenure the service's domain expanded eastward with the addition of Shenandoah, Great Smoky Mountains, and Mammoth Cave national parks. Periodically disabled by manic-depression, Mather left office in January 1929 after suffering a stroke and died a year later.<br /> <br /> Stephen Tyng Mather led a full active life of 63 years, from 1867 to 1930. The years spanning the turn of the century saw vast changes in the country's demographics, as well as the development of modern forms of transportation and communication, and increased leisure time. Mather was able to capitalize on these trends in his marketing efforts at the Thorkildsen-Mather Borax Company, which made him a millionaire, and in his public life as the first director of the National Park Service. During his life, Mather was an active member of numerous organizations, including his college fraternity Sigma Chi, the Sun Alumni Association, the Chicago City Club and Municipal Voter's League, and the Sierra Club. He was always a strong supporter of the University of California at Berkeley. Mather was physically active, pursuing hiking and mountaineering, often squeezed into a frenzied travel schedule related to his business and the parks. His work, travel, and tremendous physical energy exacted a heavy toll and contributed to his untimely death.</p> <p>Mather recognized magnificent scenery as the primary criterion for establishment of national parks. He was very careful to evaluate choices for parks, wishing the parks to stand as a collection of unique monuments. He felt those areas which were duplicates might best be managed by others. Within the framework of \"scenery,\" his preservation ethic covered such issues as the locations of park developments, provision of vistas along roadways, and the perpetuation of the natural scene. Mather always wished to have the parks supported by avid users, who would then communicate their support to their elected representatives. His grasp of a grassroots support system encouraged the rise of \"nature study\" and modern interpretation, as well as other park services, and was followed by increases in NPS appropriations. Mather was the first park professional to clearly articulate the policy which allowed the establishment of park concessioners to provide basic visitor comforts and services in the then undeveloped parks. His provision of creature comforts connected with park developments encouraged a curious and supportive public to visit the national parks.</p> <p>His life is well summarized — on a series of bronze markers which were posthumously cast in his honor and distributed through many parks:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved, unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good he has done . . .\"</p> </blockquote> <h3><b><u>Proposed \"Sand Dunes National Park\"</u></b></h3> <p>Stephen Tyng Mather left Chicago in 1915 to serve as an assistant to his friend, Franklin K. Lane, President Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of the Interior. Mather, a wealthy Chicago borax manufacturer imbued with a deep appreciation of the environment, went to Washington to manage the neglected national parks. On August 25, 1916, President Wilson signed the National Park Service Act, and Lane later appointed Mather the first director of the new bureau. As a member of two organizations promoting a Sand Dunes National Park, Mather found himself in an ideal position to promote just such an entity to benefit his native Chicago and the Midwest. Within two weeks of the National Park Service Act, Mather met with Senator Taggart to draft a resolution authorizing an investigation of the \"advisability of the securing, by purchase or otherwise, all that portion of the counties of Lake, Laporte, and Porter, in the State of Indiana, bordering upon Lake Michigan, and commonly known as the 'Sand dunes,' with a view that such lands be created a national park.\" While Congress made no appropriation for the study, local preservation groups assumed Mather's expenses, including a one-week trip to the dunes, Chicago, and Michigan City.</p> <p>Mather held hearings on October 30 to gauge local sentiment on the proposed national park. Meeting in a courtroom in the Chicago Federal Building, 400 people attended and forty-two spoke in favor of the park to \"save the dunes.\" There were no opponents. Individuals testifying were Henry C. Cowles, University of Chicago botanist; Earl H. Reed, artist and writer; Otis Caldwell, Chicago Historical Society president; Lorado Taft, sculptor (and future father-in-law of U.S. Senator Paul H. Douglas); T. C. Chamberlain, University of Chicago geologist; and Julius Rosenwald, founder of Sears, Roebuck, and Company. Some other organizations represented were the Prairie Club, Indiana Academy of Science, Chicago Association of Commerce, and the Illinois Audubon Society.</p> <p>The most convincing testimony was that of Henry Cowles. The botanist had dedicated twenty years of his life to the Indiana Dunes and still took his students there for intensive academic study. The dunes were known throughout the world for their ecological importance. Cowles related the story of a group of European scientists with only two months in the United States who compiled a list of places to spend their time: the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, and the dunelands of southern Lake Michigan.</p> <p>Mather's assistant, Horace M. Albright, accompanied him to the dunes and compiled the National Park Service's report to Congress, which was submitted to Secretary Lane on December 20. The document represented a potential turning point for Federal land acquisition policy for the Park Service director proposed the government purchase the land for a national park from private interests, a practice hitherto verboten by Congress. He cited the example of the $50,000 appropriation to buy a tract in Sequoia National Park which was insufficient to meet the $70,000 price tag, the deficit amount coming from the National Geographic Society. Mather identified a strip of lakeshore twenty-five miles long and one mile wide for acquisition. This represented 9,000 to 13,000 acres at a price of $1.8 to $2.6 million. The park should be \"contiguous and dignified,\" with no isolated tracts outstanding, Mather believed.<br /> <img alt=\"Members of the Prairie Club of Chicago join Stephen Mather's tour of the proposed Sand Dunes National Park.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7410473|0|\" src=\"/indu/images/mather-2_1.jpg\" title=\"Members of the Prairie Club of Chicago join Stephen Mather's tour of the proposed Sand Dunes National Park.\" /></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Image caption:</strong> Members of the Prairie Club of Chicago engage in a popular weekend activity in the nearly dunelands of Indiana. This particular \"dunes walk\" took place in 1913 in the vicinity of Mount Baldy. (Photographer A.E. Ormes, July 4, 1913, Photographic Archives, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore)</em></p> <p>Federal developments in the Sand Dunes National Park would be scant. Four or five roads connecting the lakeshore with the state highway would take motorists to the lake. A road along the shore itself was also a possibility, but development was not pressing because of the convenient rail lines traversing the dunes. As for Park Service administration, a superintendent and two permanent rangers were all the personnel needed for visitor protection and interpretation with additional seasonal help during the summer. Estimated cost for the manpower would not exceed $15,000 a year.</p> <p>Mather declared that the Indiana Dunes were unmatched anywhere in the United States, if not the world. The area was convenient to five million people in the Chicago metropolitan area as well as millions of other Americans in the center of the nation. The principal segment of the proposed national park stretched from Miller to Michigan City, the northeast corner of Lake County to Porter County. Mather wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>The beauty of the trees and other plant life in their autumn garb, as I saw them recently, was beyond description.</p> <p>Here is a stretch of unoccupied beach 25 miles in length, a broad, clean, safe beach, which in the summer months would furnish splendid bathing facilities for thousands of people at the same instant. Fishing in Lake Michigan directly north of the dunes is said to be exceptionally good. There are hundreds of good camp sites on the beach and back in the dunes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mather discounted the value of land near Gary for the park either because the dunes were less spectacular or the land was too near industrial areas. Mather discussed the unique values for which Yellowstone, Yosemite, Crater Lake, Sequoia, Mount Rainier, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde, and Grand Canyon (at the time pending) merited national park status. The Sand Dunes of Indiana, Mather believed, deserved the same designation:</p> <blockquote> <p>The sand dunes are admittedly wonderful, and they are inherently distinctive because they best illustrate the action of the wind on the sand accumulated from a great body of water. No national park or other Federal reservation offers this phenomenon for the pleasure and edification of the people, and no national park is as accessible. Furthermore, the dunes offer to the visitor extraordinary scenery, a large variety of plant life, magnificent bathing beaches, and splendid opportunities to camp and live in the wild country close to nature.</p> <p>If the dunes of this region were mediocre and of little scenic or scientific interest, they would have no national character and could not be regarded as more than a State or municipal park possibility. My judgment is clear, however, that their characteristics entitle the major portion of their area to consideration as a national park project.</p> </blockquote> <p><img alt=\"Stephen Mather leads a group of interested conservationists down a sand dune along Indiana's coast.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7410366|0|\" src=\"/indu/images/mather-at-the-dunes.jpg\" title=\"Stephen Mather leads a group of interested conservationists down a sand dune along Indiana's coast.\" /></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Image caption:</strong> National Park Service Director Stephen T. Mather (far left foreground) is accompanied by Col.

In the center of the group in the background are Associate Director Horace Albright and his wife, Grace. (Photographer Unknown, October 31, 1916, Photographic Archives, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore)</em></p> <p><br /> Because opponents were not present at the Mather hearing does not mean there was no serious opposition to the park proposal. The center of this opposition was in Porter County, Indiana. Led by the press, business and political leaders, and the Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce, the critics attacked the immense area under consideration and charged it would undermine the tax base of the region and permanently close the lakeshore to industry. Many believed U.S. Steel Corporation was the power behind the park movement because it wished to keep its competitors out.</p> <h3><b><u>\"First Save the Country, Then Save the Dunes,\" 1917-1919</u></b></h3> <p>On December 20, 1916, Mather submitted his report to Secretary Lane who approved the report and forwarded it to Congress in early 1917. To help promote the park cause, Stephen Mather used his own money to publish and distribute the report. Thereafter, the outlook appeared bleak. Senator Taggart, the champion of the dunes in Congress, left office following his electoral defeat. Another vocal champion, Stephen T. Mather, was silenced when he suffered a nervous breakdown in the spring of 1917 and could not lobby for the park. The crippling blow came on April 6 when national priorities inexorably changed as the United States entered World War I. With revenues targeted for the national defense, any Congressional expenditure for the establishment of a Sand Dunes National Park appeared doomed. The popular slogan \"Save the Dunes!\" became \"First Save the Country, Then Save the Dunes!\"</p> <p>Undaunted, the National Dunes Park Association (NDPA) and other preservation groups were determined to continue the save the dunes campaign. Supporters took the Prairie Club's annual outdoor festival concept and expanded it into a historical pageant called \"<a href=\"https://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10974.html\">The Dunes Under Four Flags</a>.\" The dunes pageant would tie the area to American history while portraying the beauty of the duneland through dance, music, and poetry. The Dunes Pageant Association, incorporated in Chicago in February 1917, commissioned Thomas Wood Stevens, president of the American Pageant Association, to compose a pageant similar to his other successful shows in Newark and St. Louis. Memorial Day 1917 was the first performance at the Waverly Beach blowout—a natural amphitheatre amidst the sand dunes—in the present-day state park. It was rained out, but the following weekend, 25,000 people jammed into the area for an unforgettable pageant with 600 actors. It was capped by a stirring grand finale, singing the national anthem.<br /> <img alt=\"Historic photograph of Dunes Under Four Flags, pageant\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7410481|0|\" src=\"/indu/images/dunes-pageant.jpg\" title=\"Historic photograph of Dunes Under Four Flags, pageant\" /></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Image caption</strong>: Dancers of the pageant in white gowns are seated in the sand behind the crowd; spring, 1917. (Westchester Township History Museum)</em></p> <p>The pageant enjoyed widespread publicity thanks to area women's clubs. Newsreels spread the event throughout the country. Petitions proliferated. Each member of Congress received a copy of the pageant brochure. One author contends the pageant spawned a civil religion and a formidable political constituency for saving the dunes by creating a \"community united by mutual sympathy.\"</p> <p>As United States involvement in the war deepened, NDPA members acknowledged their inability to halt the despoiling of the dunes during the conflict. They vowed to renew the fight \"the minute the war is over.\" They kept the issue before the public, however, as witnessed by what one Chicago columnist wrote in 1918:</p> <blockquote> <p>Unless the State of Indiana or the United States takes the matter in hand, commercial plants will crowd the entire lake frontage. The matter resolves itself into a decision of humanity. Shall the million[s] of mill workers be condemned to the slavery of labor without recreation in the big plants on the lake shore, or shall they be given the privilege of open-air spaces and pure air in which to renew strength and courage in their brief hours away from the mills?</p> </blockquote> <p>While the war ended in late 1918, the Sand Dunes National Park initiative floundered badly in 1919, faced by the post-war prosperity and the mounting opposition of politicians and business interests. Evidence of this fatal NDPA pessimism can be seen in the May 15, 1919, meeting of the Chicago committee. The group conceded that a prolonged educational campaign was needed to convince Congress to \"purchase\" the national park. After that arduous process, there would be no dunes left to save. The group admitted the NDPA should drop the national park struggle and pursue administration of the Indiana Dunes by the State of Indiana itself.</p> <h3><strong><u>An Indiana Dunes State Park</u></strong></h3> <p>Origins of Indiana's interest in establishing its own State Park System began in 1916, when an Indianapolis business leader and municipal reformer recommended the State establish its own park system. A member of the Indiana Historical Commission (IHC—overseer of the State centennial), Richard Lieber found himself chairman of the IHC's State Park Memorial Committee. By the end of the year, Lieber succeeded in raising private funds to purchase McCormick's Creek Canyon and Turkey Run which became Indiana's first state parks. Lieber also called for the acquisition of a portion of the Indiana Dunes for a state park. In 1919, the Indiana Legislature approved the formation of the Department of Conservation and Republican Governor James P. Goodrich appointed Lieber its first director.</p> <p>By late 1920 or early 1921, National Park Service Director Stephen Mather and Assistant Director Horace Albright were convinced the fight for establishment of the Sand Dunes National Park was fruitless. Combined with scant political support in Indiana, the new Federal administration of Warren G. Harding ushered in a new era of Republican conservatism which nixed the plan. No dunes park bill was introduced before Congress. More importantly, Mather and Albright no longer believed in the cause. With industry's relentless push on each end of the lakeshore, Indiana Dunes was \"unacceptable for National Park status.\" Albright recalled, \"Mr. Mather was just too busy to get back to the Dunes project and he gradually came to the conclusion that the only hope for them lay in the state park movement.\"</p> <p>Mather abdicated saving the dunes to his friend Richard Lieber. Both men organized the first national meeting of state park employees in 1921. Two years later, they reassembled at Turkey Run State Park where the National Conference on State Parks formed with Mather the first president and Gary's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/bess-sheehan.htm\">Bess Sheehan</a> (NDPA officer) its secretary. Indiana's park system was the model in the United States and its leader redoubled his efforts to add the Indiana Dunes to its fold.<br /> <img alt=\"Stephen Mather stands atop a dune with Henry Cowles, Richard Leiber, Bess Sheehan, and others.\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7410411|0|\" src=\"/indu/images/mather-3.jpg\" title=\"Stephen Mather stands atop a dune with Henry Cowles, Richard Leiber, Bess Sheehan, and others.\" /></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Image caption:</strong> The National Park Service inspection tour of the proposed Sand Dunes National Park included the following (beginning with the first full figure at the right): unknown, Dr. Henry Chandler Cowles; Mrs. Bess Sheehan; unknown; National Park Service Director Stephen T.

            "bodyText": "<p>Han Yerry was born circa 1724, somewhere in the Mohawk Valley. It was believed that his mother was Mohawk and his father German (probably Palatine). Despite his Mohawk background, Han Yerry chose to live with the Oneida and was accepted as such, becoming a member and lead warrior of the Wolf Clan. He was called Han Yerry Tewahangarahken (“He Who Takes Up the Snowshoe”) by Oneida, and Han Yerry Doxtader by whites.<br /> <br /> Sometime in the 1750s Han Yerry married Tyonajanegen (“Two Kettles Together”). They settled in the Oneida village of Oriska (near present day Oriskany, NY), and had three sons and a daughter; Jacob, Cornelius Dolly, and Peter. Prior to the American Revolution, Han Yerry was one of the wealthiest Oneidas and counted amongst his holding a frame house, a barn, a wagon and sleigh, and numerous horses, chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, and turkeys.<br /> <br /> Due to British encroachment on Oneida land and their attempts to stifle Oneida self-sufficiency, Han Yerry became drawn to the Patriot side of the coming American Revolution. When a British/Loyalist/Native army invaded Oneida land and laid siege to American Fort Schuyler (Stanwix) in August of 1777, Han Yerry and his family took up arms against them.Han Yerry, Two Kettles, and son Cornelius fought with Herkimer’s Patriot militia at the Battle of Oriskany on August 6, 1777. Though wounded in the wrist, Han Yerry fought on with Two Kettles reloading his gun for him.<br /> <br /> After the militia retreated, Two Kettles rode through the Mohawk Valley to spread word of the fight. Later that year, the couple left to the Saratoga area to fight with General Horatio Gates against another invading British force.<br /> <br /> Han Yerry and other Oneida warriors served with the Continental Army at Valley Forge for a short time in 1778. While there, he was a dinner guest of General Washington. Han Yerry also served with the Continental Army operating against the British allied Cayuga and Seneca Native Nations in Western New York in 1779 during the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition.<br /> <br /> In 1779, Han Yerry received a captain’s commission from the Continental Congress. After the war, Han Yerry continued his leadership role in Oneida affairs dealing with land sales and treaties, representing his Oneida village in a boundary dispute with Congress. Han Yerry died in 1794. He was remembered by one observer decades later as an “ordinary sized” fellow and “quite a gentleman in his demeanor.” An Oneida friend, Hendrick Smith, honored him when he said, “Hon Yerry was too old for the Service, yet used to go fearlessly into the fights.”<br /> <br /> Two Kettles grew blind in old age and survived her husband by nearly three decades.</p> <h4>Source:</h4> <p>Forgotten Allies: The Oneidas and the American Revolution.

            "bodyText": "<p>Adam Frederick Helmer (also known as John Adam Frederick Helmer and Hans Adam Friedrich Helmer), born circa 1754, was an American Revolutionary War hero among those of the Mohawk Valley and surrounding regions of New York State. According to the memories of his sons-in-law: in his prime Helmer, was about 5’ 8”, weighed around 150 lbs, had blue eyes and light-colored hair.<br /> <br /> He was made nationally famous by Walter D. Edmonds' popular 1936 novel \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" with its depiction of \"Adam Helmer's Run\" of September 16, 1778, to warn the people of German Flatts of the approach of Joseph Brant and his company of Natives and British Loyalists.<br /> <br /> Adam Helmer was born in German Flatts, New York, to Maria Barbara Kast, and George Frederick Helmer (who had been born in 1706, in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse a city in the Rhineland-Palatinate region in southwestern Germany). His father emigrated to America sometime before 1710 and eventually settled in one of the numerous Palatine farming communities on the south side of the Mohawk River in central New York.<br /> <br /> In the summer of 1776 he was assigned as a scout in Captain John Breadbake's Company in the Tryon County Militia. He also married Anna Piet Bellinger that year. Together they had ten children: Frederick (1777), Margaret (1778), Anna (1781), Adam (1783), Peter (1786), Elizabeth (1788), Catharine (1790), David (179?), Maria Barbara (1795), and Eve (1800).<br /> <br /> On August 2, 1777, the tensions of the war in the Mohawk Valley came to a head when the American Fort Schuyler (Stanwix) was attacked and surrounded by British forces, including many of Helmer's former neighbors who had left the area the year prior. On the evening of August 5, 1777, Helmer was chosen by General Nicholas Herkimer to be one of three messengers to deliver word to the besieged fort that the Tryon County Militia was on its way to help them. When he reached the fort, a cannon was fired as a signal to the militia down the river that the message was recieved. <br /> <br /> It appears that Helmer also took part in the August 6th afternoon sortie (raid) against the Indian and Loyalist camps carried out by troops from the fort to try to draw British attention away from Herkimer’s advance. While this raid did not end up assisting Herkimer, it did destroy the main Indian/Loyalist camps, captured a great deal of badly needed supplies, and dealt a severe moral blow to the Indians supporting the British siege. Herkimer and his men ended ambushed in what became known as the Battle of Oriskany. During the bloody fight, Herkimer himself was mortally wounded and Helmer’s brother Capt. John Frederick Helmer was killed and another, Lt. George Frederick Helmer II, was seriously wounded.<br /> <br /> In September 1778, Lt. Helmer and eight scouts under his command were sent to the Unadilla River Valley to spy on Joseph Brant's company of Indians and Tories who were encamped at Unadilla near the confluence of the Unadilla and Susquehanna Rivers. It was feared that Brant would send a raiding party north to the Mohawk Valley during the harvest season to forcefully obtain stores for the winter ahead. When Helmer's scouts reached Edmeston Manor, the farm of Percifer Carr, just north of what is now South Edmeston, they were attacked by a large group of Brant's men, apparently part of the feared raiding party on its way north. Several of the scouts were killed, but Helmer managed to escape.<br /> <br /> Helmer took off running to the north-east, through the hills, toward Schuyler Lake and then north to Andrustown (near present-day Jordanville, New York) where he warned his sister's family of the impending raid and obtained fresh footwear. He also warned settlers at Columbia and Petrie's Corners, most of whom then fled to safety at Fort Dayton. When Helmer arrived at the fort, severely torn up from his run, he told Colonel Peter Bellinger, the commander of the fort, that he had counted at least 200 of the attackers en route to the valley. The straight-line distance from Carr's farm to Fort Dayton is about thirty miles, and Helmer's winding and hilly route was far from straight. Catherine Myers, then a 10-year-old girl living near German Flatts, remembered that “Helmer’s clothing was torn to tatters, his eyes were bloodshot, his hands and face and limbs were bleeding and lacerated from the effects of the brambles and bushes through which he had forced his headlong flight….”<br /> <br /> It was said that Helmer then slept for 36 hours straight. It was initially feared that he had so exhausted himself that he would not survive. During his sleep, on September 17, 1778, the farms of the area were destroyed by Brant's raid. The total loss of property in the raid was reported as: 63 houses, 59 barns, full of grain, 3 grist mills, 235 horses, 229 horned cattle, 279 sheep, and 93 oxen. Only two men were reported killed in the attack, one by refusing to leave his home when warned. Three days later Helmer led another group of militia back to the Carr Farm on the Unadilla, discovered the bodies of three of his scouts, and buried them at that site. The fate of the other five scouts is not known.<br /> <br /> Later in the war, Helmer served in the New York State Levies under Colonel Lewis DuBois. In 1803, Helmer bought land for in the modern-day town of Brutus, in Cayuga County where he died. Adam Helmer died on April 9, 1830 at the approximate age of 76, in the town of Brutus in Cayuga County, New York.

            "bodyText": "Nothing is known about the early life of the Oneida Indian woman Tyonajanegan, who was known to the Europeans as “Two Kettles Together.\" Sometime in the 1750’s she married Han Yerry Tewahangarahken, or \"He Who Takes Up the Snow Shoe,\" a chief warrior of the Wolf Clan Oneidas. The couple resided at the Oneida village of Oriska (modern Oriskany area). Over the years, she gave birth to three sons and a daughter. It would be the American Revolution that would change her life forever and make her a heroine of the Oneida Indian Nation.<br /> <br /> Early in the conflict, Han Yerry and Two Kettles had determined to side with the Americans, as did the majority of the Oneida Nation. The Siege of Fort Schuyler (Stanwix) in 1777 would finally force the Six Nations to openly choose sides, which resulted in a split within the centuries old confederacy. As with many women during the revolution, Two Kettles was determined to take an active role. There was a small group of Oneida men and women at Fort Schuyler when the British began arriving on August 2nd, and Two Kettles is believed to be one of several Oneidas who made their way through the encircling British troops to warn the settlements in the Mohawk Valley that the British had arrived.<br /> <br /> General Herkimer’s militia encamped near Oriska on the evening of August 5th. Two Kettles prepared two pistols and made ready to join her husband and other Oneidas accompanying Herkimer on his march to Ft. Schuyler in the morning. During the resulting Battle of Oriskany on August 6th, Two Kettles fought alongside her husband, firing her pistols until Han Yerry was wounded through the wrist. She then took up the task of reloading his weapon for him each time he fired. Two Kettles had gained a reputation as an excellent rider, and after the battle ended, she was eventually able to procure a horse and ride into the valley to report the outcome of the battle, and prepare people for the flood of wounded men that would be returning. In the fall of 1777, when Han Yerry and a group of Oneidas joined the American army fighting at Saratoga, Two Kettles again accompanied her husband, both to tend to his still healing wound, and to act as a messenger. To show his appreciation for her service, General Horatio Gates instructed Colonel Gansevoort at Ft. Schuyler to “deliver to her Three Gallons of Rum, for a Winter’s supply for her Family.”<br /> <br /> Two Kettles’ last documented service occurred on August 14, 1781 at the fortified homestead of Fort Timmerman (near modern St. Johnsville). The “fort” acted as a base for a small force of militia and Oneida warriors protecting the gristmills on the nearby creek. While the men were away pursuing one group of raiders another force of 150 Loyalists and British allied Indians attacked the homestead. Two Kettles and the small group of Oneida and White women with her defended the home and drove the attackers off.<br /> <br /> After this, Two Kettles largely disappears from written history. The last mention of her is that she lost her eyesight late in life and that she is believed to have died around 1824, surviving her husband by around three decades. Two Kettles Together is another one of the many unsung women of the American Revolution who were willing to sacrifice everything for a cause they believed in.",

She was among the first cohort of women to attend Gallaudet College and she was active in multiple organizations in the city of Chicago. For that reason, Elliott should stand alone as a Deaf historical figure. </span><br /> <br /> Elliott was born in Ohio on May 5, 1867, as the third of five children. Her family moved to rural Illinois when she was young, and the town was later renamed Elliott for her family. The town grew when Elliott's father donated land to build a public school and railroad. At the age of five, Elliott and her family contracted spinal meningitis as part of an epidemic across the central United States. One of her older brothers didn't survive. Elliott's illness resulted in her becoming deaf. Her parents continued to send her to a hearing public school for several years. They later transferred her to the <a href=\"#reference\">Illinois School for the Deaf</a>, located in Jacksonville, Illinois. It was finally here that she was able to have full access to education and social opportunities with her peers. She attended this residential school from 1876 to 1887, graduating as valedictorian in the spring of 1887.<br /> <br /> During the second half of the 1800s, the American Deaf community went through a cultural shift. The first half of the nineteenth century was known as the 'golden age' for the deaf community. Deaf institutions thrived. The art of sign language (formerly known as manualism) blossomed. But after the Civil War, attitudes towards manualism changed as the eugenics movement and social Darwinism gained ground. The <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">eugenics movement</a> supported the goal of improving society by controlling people's reproduction. Social Darwinism aimed to only select the most \"desirable\" groups to continue having children. Those who supported eugenics believed that people with disabilities, people of color, low-income communities, and some immigrants were \"undesirable.\" Because of these widespread attitudes, many hearing people believed that Deaf people should integrate into hearing society. To do so, they had to be able to speak. Sign language and Deaf culture came under attack in the late nineteenth century. The Deaf community entered an era where they had to fight to preserve their culture, sign language, and way of life.<br /> <br /> Despite being established in 1864, <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Gallaudet College's</a> doors remained closed to Deaf female students until the 1880s. While Gallaudet accepted a few female students to preparatory school programs on a case-by-case basis, these earlier students did not complete their degrees. It's likely they left due to the unwelcoming environment they found at Gallaudet, or job opportunities that awaited elsewhere.  Elliott, aged 19, didn't accept this exclusion. Prior to her senior year of high school in 1886, Elliott wrote a letter to the Convention of American Instructors of the Deaf. This national organization met at various locations every other year, and Gallaudet College president Edward Miner Gallaudet frequently attended. Her letter explained why Gallaudet College should admit young Deaf women. Elliott relied on the language of domesticity to argue for the advancement of Deaf women. The language of domesticity was the belief that, as wives and mothers, women could influence politics and society from home. The more educated a woman became, so the thinking went, the better she could support the country and its institutions, from within the domestic sphere. Elliott also argued that girls excelled in school as much as the boys did. Elliot's letter received unanimous support at the convention.<br /> <br /> Western Association of Collegiate Alumnae (WACA) then got involved in the coeducation issue a few months after Elliott wrote her letter. WACA was a hearing association with the mission of pushing for co-education. The organization believed that Deaf women had a right to a collegiate education. They sent a letter to President Gallaudet, pointing out that Gallaudet College received federal funds. They inquired as to how the federal funds were being managed since Deaf women were being excluded. President Gallaudet then invited exceptional female students who were recommended by their deaf residential schools. The catch was that they could only stay for an experimental trial of two years. Six young Deaf women, Elliott among them, joined Gallaudet's male cohort in the fall of 1887. <br /> <br /> Participating in this coeducation experiment was not easy for Elliott and her female peers. They faced ridicule from their male counterparts. They could not attend extracurricular activities unchaperoned. They had to work twice as hard to earn basic respect from the male students and faculty.<br /> <br /> One highlight of Elliott's Gallaudet years was her visit at <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Susan B. Anthony’s</a> house in January of 1888. The Washington Critic mentioned Elliott's visit with three other female students. The visit must have been a success. In February, The Deaf-Mutes' Journal announced that Anthony invited 20-year-old Elliot to speak at the Woman's Suffrage conference. The conference would take place in Washington DC on March 17. Unfortunately, no records have been found that confirm or deny that she accepted the invitation.<br /> <br /> The experimental program was a success. In 1889, Gallaudet College officially opened its doors to Deaf women. Instead of graduating, however, Elliot chose to become a teacher at Missouri School for the Deaf. While she was working there, she began her courtship with Philip Hasenstab. Philip worked as a teacher at the Illinois School for the Deaf. They had met when she was a high school senior there. Their courtship was a long one, lasting five years.  During that time, they both worked as teachers at their respective schools. She played a pivotal role in encouraging Philip to follow his calling to become a clergyman. In 1890, he became the first Deaf ordained minister in the history of the Methodist church. Three years later, he left teaching to become a full-time Deaf minister in Chicago.<br /> <br /> The Elliott family did not approve of Philip for two primary reasons. His family was Catholic at a time when anti-Catholic prejudice ran high in the United States. Philip had converted to Methodism as an adult. But the Elliott family remained suspicious. Additionally, a minister's income was modest. They were afraid that Philip would not be able to provide Elliott with financial security. Despite her family's disapproval, Elliott married Phillip on June 20, 1894. Upon her marriage, Elliott stepped down from teaching. She relocated to Chicago to help her husband with his Deaf ministry, at the Chicago Temple Building in the heart of downtown Chicago.<br /> <br /> During their 47-year marriage, Elliott and Philip welcomed four daughters. Elliott was busy as a wife and mother. Yet she remained involved in the Deaf ministry and social reform organizations. This was because her mother Anna Elliott lived with the family for 14 years from 1895 to 1909. Anna supported the upbringing of the four Hasenstab girls. This allowed Elliott to continue her work in the Chicago deaf community.<br /> <br /> In her role as a clergyman's wife, Elliott became known as the \"First Lady\" of Deaf Methodism.  According to letters to Philip, Elliott took pride in her church work. When her husband traveled to preach at other locations, Elliott sometimes took his place in the Chicago pulpit. She wrote her own sermons and then shared them on Sundays. This was a bold step for women, as they could not yet become ordained ministers or hold official positions in the Methodist church. Elliott's actions reflected a change in the church and showed how women were striving for positions of authority in church communities. In one of her letters to Philip describing the church service in his absence, she wrote:</span></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>You may be now wanting to know about the meeting. I shall tell you here first of all, I feel that God was there and blessed the meeting abundantly: His spirit moved it I feel. I think I never preached so enthusiastically as I did yesterday in my life. </em></p> <p>Following a sermon she delivered, she wrote to Philip:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>I think it really did go all right. Everyone seemed interested and paid good attention. Mr. C – you know, yourself, that he is hard to reach, did not turn his attention away and said afterward that he had enjoyed it all. I was relieved it went all right. </em></p> <p>While she worked in the ministry, she also focused on volunteer charitable work outside the church. Elliott worked with the Chicago Ladies' Aid Society. This organization focused on improving the quality of life for poor people in the city.  Elliot also helped out with the Epworth League. The league's goal was to nurture the spiritual life and community mindedness of young adults. This kind of work was common for middle-class women in the early 1900s. During the Progressive Era, private citizens often managed relief work in absence of governmental support. This work was especially important as U.S. cities experienced waves of immigration. Elliott was one of many who felt motivated to \"improve\" society. She likely knew of and was influenced by <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Jane Addams</a>, famed for her social reform work at <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Hull House</a> in Chicago. <br /> <br /> Elliott worked in the Chicago Deaf ministry and on social reform efforts until her death. She died on July 26th, 1941, at the age of 74, surrounded by family. Her husband Philip continued their work until he died six months later in late December 1941. Community members, including Elliott's daughter Constance, took over the Chicago Deaf ministry. But, to this day, the work of Elliott's life remains unnoticed by the majority of historians. In the words of Proverbs 31 etched in her tombstone, <em>let her own works praise her</em>. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><a id=\"note\" name=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong></a> When studying Deaf History, there is a significant difference between capitalization of the letter \"D\" in \"Deaf\" versus \"deaf.\" \"Deaf\" identifies a culturally Deaf person or the Deaf culture. Deaf culture describes a set of common values, traditions, and achievements of a group of Deaf people. This can take form in the nationwide usage of American Sign Language, establishments of Deaf institutions, organizations and clubs and the celebration of Deafness. But deaf describes a medical condition, a hearing loss or a disability. In this article, Deaf is used to describe Elliott.  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">It is important to note that Deaf versus deaf was not a concept known or used during Elliott's lifetime. The concept did not exist until the late 1980s. This article uses the 21st-century language of \"Deaf\" to describe Elliot because she subscribed to the cultural norms, values, and practices of Deaf culture.</p> <p><br /> <em>This article was written by Lexi Hill, National Council for Preservation Education Intern with the National Park Service Park History Program. 2022. </em></p> <hr /> <p><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong> William Ennis, Jeffrey Joeckel, Lu Ann Jones, Jannelle Legg, Turkiya Lowe, Perri Meldon, Ella Wagner, Kirk VanGilder, Brian Greenwald, Roberta Wendel.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>Sources:</strong></span><br /> Baynton, Douglas C.  \"Disability and the Justification of Inequality in American History,\" In The Disability Studies Reader, edited by Lennard Davis, Florence: Taylor & Francis Group, 2013.

Shortly after he began working at the Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab) at the University of California and then at Massachusetts Institute of Technology until 1943. <br /> <br /> In 1943, Alvarez joined the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago’s Met Lab, working on equipment designed to detect possible German nuclear reactors and assisting in the operation of CP-2. In 1944, with the encouragement of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Alvarez moved to Los Alamos and began to work on implosion methods. It was here in New Mexico that he witnessed the Trinity test on July 16, 1945. Less than one month later, Alvarez was part of an observation team on the Great Artiste, a B-29 Superfortress alongside the Enola Gay that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. <br /> <br /> After the war, Alvarez received numerous awards for his research, including the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on elementary particle physics in 1968.

            "bodyText": "<blockquote> <p>\"When I was young, I hoped to save the world. In my middle years, I would have been content to save my country. Now I just want to save the dunes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In gratitude for his courage, his vision, and his leadership in the effort to preserve this unique landscape, Indiana Dunes National Park is dedicated to the memory of Senator Paul Howard Douglas. <br /> <br /> Through careers in teaching and government that spanned half a century, he spoke for the poor and the old, workers and the unemployed, and for citizens denied the full rights of citizenship. <br /> <br /> Paul Douglas believed in open space as a source of spiritual renewal, especially for those who spent their working lives, as he did, in cities. He felt that all citizens, rich or poor, should have access to that same source of strength and worked for the last 20 years of his life saving the Dunes so that here it might be so.</p> <h2><u>Saving the Indiana Dunes</u></h2>   <p><em><b>Excerpts from </b><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/indu/adhi.htm\">A Signature of Time and Eternity: The Administrative History of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore</a></em></p> <h3><u>\"Indiana's Third Senator\" Takes the Dunes Battle to Congress</u></h3> <p>Approaching Paul H. Douglas to herald the dunes preservation movement in Congress proved to be an excellent move. Although from Illinois, Douglas was no stranger to the Indiana Dunes. Following his 1931 marriage to Emily Taft, daughter of sculptor Lorado Taft, the couple built a summer cottage in the dunes. Summertime and weekends in the dunes with his family left an indelible mark on Douglas' soul. He regarded those times as \"one of the happiest periods of our lives\":</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Like Anateus, I retouched the earth and became stronger thereby. We had rare privacy, with mornings of quiet study and work, afternoons of swimming and walks along the magnificent beach and in the fascinating back country.... What remained was idyllic and an ever-present source of physical and spiritual renewal. I seemed to live again in the simplicities of my boyhood.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dorothy-buell.htm\">Dorothy Buell</a> first approached Douglas to sponsor a bill to authorize an \"Indiana Dunes National Park\" in the spring of 1957. Douglas, familiar with the negative stance of the Indiana Congressional Delegation, targeted Senator Homer Capehart. Douglas suggested that Capehart could become a hero by leading the dunes effort and thereby have the Federal park bear his name. Intrigued, Capehart told Douglas he first had to consult with the \"boys in Indianapolis.\" The inevitable answer came: the boys \"have other plans.\" Douglas decided he would introduce the legislation himself. Fittingly, he unveiled the bill to establish \"Indiana Dunes National Monument\" in Dorothy Buell's home on Easter Sunday 1958. He cited the popularity of the Save the Dunes Council as an indication of widespread public support enabling him to go against the wishes of Indiana's political and business community.</p> <p>Few could have predicted the magnitude of the vehemence unleashed on Senator Douglas. Media, industry, and political organizations combined accusing Douglas with interfering in Indiana's affairs, serving as a Chicago carpetbagger plotting against Indiana's economic development, and working to establish a park to placate the minorities of Chicago. Douglas' opponents derisively referred to him as the \"Third Senator from Indiana.\" Indignant Hoosiers pointed to an underground coalition of Illinois politicians and industrialists who were hiding behind Senator Douglas' \"Save the Dunes\" movement in order to stop the Port of Indiana. Douglas' nefarious coalition was also believed to be joined by dunes area industry which hoped to keep competitors out. Nevertheless, Paul Douglas introduced his bill, S. 3898, on May 26, 1958.<br /> <br /> Later that June, Senator Douglas received a letter of support from renowned American writer, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/carl/learn/historyculture/carl-sandburg.htm\">Carl Sandburg</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Dear Senator Douglas:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You should know that I am one of the many who appreciate your toils and efforts in behalf of an Indiana Dunes National Monument. I have known those dunes for more than forty years and I give my blessing and speak earnest prayers for all who are striving for this project. Those dunes are to the midwest what the Grand Canyon is to Arizona and the Yosemite to California. They constitute a signature of time and eternity: once lost the loss would be irrevocable. Good going to you!</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 280px;\">Faithfully yours,</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 320px;\">Carl Sandburg</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to an inquiry from Senator Paul Douglas, the Park Service dispatched a team in September 1958 to evaluate an area of undeveloped duneland west and south of Ogden Dunes. The team identified an additional 850 acres which Douglas incorporated into a new 1959 bill, S. 1001. Park Service comments to the Department on S. 1001 were favorable, but there were a few amendments suggested. Park Service officials believed the designation of \"National Seashore\" was more appropriate than \"National Monument.\" The Service also questioned the excluded areas around Dune Acres, Ogden Dunes, and Johnson Beach, preferring to consider all available land in order to have an area of sufficient size to accommodate heavy use. While the towns themselves should be excluded, the Service wanted unspoiled Johnson Beach to fall within the acquisition area.<br /> <img alt=\"Black and white photograph of Senator Paul Douglas standing outside at a podium with an American flag\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7411457|0|\" src=\"/indu/images/douglas_3.png\" title=\"Black and white photograph of Senator Paul Douglas standing outside at a podium with an American flag\" /></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Image caption: </strong>Senator Paul Douglas standing in front of a podium<br /> <strong>Source: </strong>University of Illinois at Chicago. Library. Special Collections Department</em></p> <p>On June 13, 1959, Douglas delivered a powerful statement before the U.S. Senate committee considering the legislation:</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">I am appearing before you in support of S. 1001 to preserve 5000 acres of the Indiana Dunes and prevent them from being destroyed by the erection of one or more steel mills. I cannot exaggerate the importance of this measure. In the great industrial complex which stretches from Gary, Indiana to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, there already live over six million people. And in 20 years, it is estimated that this number will rise to at least 10 million. This great industrial complex which overlaps into three states, and which has Chicago as its core, is one of two or three great productive centers of the world, with an almost unrivalled variety of industries concentrated primarily in the field of heavy goods. But excellently equipped as this area is from the industrial and commercial standpoints, it is short on recreational facilities. Whereas London, Berlin, and Paris have each approximately 200,000 acres of parks and public wooded areas, this region probably does not have more than 65,000.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The great natural wonderland of this region was the Indiana Dunes which 40 years ago stretched for over 20 miles from Gary to Michigan City. Here were mile after mile of unrivalled beaches and high dunes, some wooded and some shifting. A marvellous inland area of woods is interspersed with a lake or two. Here virtually ever variety of tree and flower could and still can be found. It is a paradise for botanists and naturalists as well as the natural recreation area for pent-up people of this area.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the last 40 years, however, tremendous inroads have been made in this natural paradise. Industry has come into the area. Four real estate subdivisions have greatly restricted the area open to the public. All that is left is a small state park created in the 1920’s largely through the voluntary contributions of Chicago citizens and which is greatly overcrowded, being visited by nearly half a million people in 1958, and about 5000 acres of land is owned by National Steel, headed by Mr. George M. Humphrey with whom we are all acquainted, and Bethlehem Steel. Both of these companies have announced their intention of building steel mills on this site while the State of Indiana has appropriated two million as a nest egg for the development of an industrial port at Burns Ditch for which a federal appropriation of from $35 million to $45 million will later be requested.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The issue is, therefore, squarely joined as to whether we should allow industry to gobble up all these places of natural beauty. In the movie we will show, the unique beauty of the Dunes will be displayed far more eloquently than my words can describe. I can only emphasize that if these mills are built there, with the industrial city which will grow up around them, not only will the Dunes be destroyed but the little state park will itself be made virtually unusable because of the pollution of air and water.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The population is growing rapidly. We are becoming more and more industrialized. Our population is moving citywards. Our cities are spreading over the countryside. We are running out of space and if we do not act quickly, all the places of beauty will be taken over and destroyed. We will have steel mills, cement factories, slag piles and more asphalt jungles and these, I suppose, will be hailed as signs of progress. But we will also have more psychiatric hospitals. When will we realize that all men should have the chance to enjoy the simple things of life which industry seems bent on destroying, namely, the water, the sky, growing and living things and beauty? Must man be compelled to live surrounded by people without having any chance at solitude? Mr. George M. Humphrey can find his solitude by going to his plantation in Georgia where he can invite guests if he so wishes. But the people herded together in our great industrial centers have no such chance and Mr. Humphrey and his associates should not be allowed to destroy the places of recreation for the people.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">This brings me to another point. I have been in charge with trying to prevent the coming of the steel mills to Indiana and to obtain them instead for Illinois. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I think it would be fine for Indiana to have these mills, but they do not have to destroy the Dunes and waste $40 million of public money building another port to enable them to do so. There is already a 30-foot deep water harbor at Indiana Harbor where new steel mills could be located; there is a private U.S. Steel harbor at Gary which might be converted into a public harbor; there is an 18-foot harbor at Michigan City which could be deepened for the ore boats and the mills could possibly be located there. The Indiana branch of the Calumet River could be deepened and the mills built near the head of that river in Indiana. There are plenty of sites for steel mills on or near the Indiana shoreline. But there is only one Dunes. Do not destroy them.</p> </blockquote> <p>The stirring speech delivered on the Senate floor was a forerunner of the conservation movement which blossomed in the late 1960s. It provided for an Indiana Dunes National Monument composed of 3,800 acres in the Central Dunes. On the same day, Representative John Saylor of Pennsylvania—the home state of Bethlehem Steel—submitted a companion bill in the House, H.R. 12689.</p> <p>With the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, the dunes controversy intensified. Hoosier politicians and businessmen were eager to exploit the economic prosperity promised by the linking of the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. The Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments reaffirmed that the Indiana Dunes should be incorporated into the National Park System. Senate hearings in May 1959, saw Douglas and a large group of supporters pleading in vain for swift action on the dunes park bill. An equal number of opponents, from Indiana's Governor to the President of Midwest Steel Corporation, testified against the proposed park. Even as Douglas spoke, an increasing number of power-shovels were decimating the Central Dunes. The same spring, Midwest Steel dusted off its thirty-year-old construction documents and began building a finishing plant on 750 acres at Burns Ditch. Simultaneously, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) began clearing a 350-acre parcel to build a coal-fired generating plant west of Dune Acres. Douglas accused the industrialists of denuding as much duneland as possible in an effort to make the preservation argument moot.</p> <h3><u>Port v. Park, 1960-1962</u></h3> <p>A key element in the port versus park battle involved a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report commissioned in 1960 to study Indiana's proposed deep—water port at Burns Ditch. The artificial channel, built by a contractor named Burns who was commissioned in 1926, drained the marshlands of the upper valley of the Little Calumet River for development as well as reduced the threat of flooding. For three decades, although not supporting the appropriation of public funds, a series of Corps studies evaluated the Burns Ditch site.</p> <p>To no one's surprise, the October 1960 Corps report concluded that the mouth of Burns Ditch was the ideal location for the Indiana port and recommended that Congress appropriate the funds. The report called for dredging the lake approach channel to a depth of thirty feet and the outer harbor to twenty—seven feet. With breakwaters and shoreline facilities, the total cost came to $34,500,000. The Corps set the benefit—cost ratio at 5.66 to 1.</p> <p>When the report arrived for approval at the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors in Washington, D.C., Senator Douglas was ready. He asked why no other alternate sites were evaluated and why the public interest in parkland was not addressed. Until these questions were addressed, Douglas successfully urged the Board to return the report to the Chicago office.</p> <p>Douglas' move deeply angered Indiana politicians who had boasted that the report's approval would be routine. An aide to Governor—Elect Matthew E. Welsh urged Welsh to \"get to the bottom of it.\" He warned:</p> <blockquote> <p>It appears to me that the entire project is in jeopardy and the situation is serious. Normally, the Corps of Engineers is considered immune to political pressures but in this instance it would appear from the known facts that Senator Douglas was able to exert considerable influence in securing this latest action by the Corps.</p> </blockquote> <p>An important ally of Douglas was Save the Dunes Council member Herbert Read, son of artist and Council publicity director Philo B. Read. Read, a dunes advocate who worked for a Chicago architectural firm, became chairman of the Council's Engineering Committee after educating himself on harbors through reading a borrowed technical manual. The self—taught \"harbor expert\" was able to decipher the Corps of Engineers' formula for calculating benefit—cost ratios. The Engineering Committee demonstrated the Council's resolve to take the offensive. Ogden Dunes resident George Anderson, a railroad research engineer, assisted Read in identifying various harbor alternatives and technical report errors. Channeling the information to Senator Paul Douglas, the result saw the Corps agree to a series of restudies. Herb's wife, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charlotte-read.htm\">Charlotte Read</a>, was also a Save the Dunes member- and future director of the organization. </p> <p>Interestingly enough, pre—1949 Corps of Engineers' evaluations recommended against a Federally—funded Indiana harbor. As early as 1930, the Corps reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>The harbor, if constructed, will be entirely surrounded by the plant of the Midwest Steel Corporation, which would make its use by the general public impracticable. The District Engineer recommends that no work be done by the United States at that harbor until it can be shown conclusively that it is of direct benefit to the general public.</p> </blockquote> <p>Political agitation from Indiana forced another report in 1935 which garnered the same result. The district engineer found the commerce projections \"highly speculative\" and that the \"existing facilities are adequate to supply demand for some years to come.\" Yet another restudy in 1937 resulted in a report issued in 1943 with an identical conclusion. The Corps recommended that \"selection of the site for such an improvement should be based on a comprehensive review of the whole available frontage rather than the consideration of the site of Burns Ditch alone.\" The report concluded, however, that an evaluation of Indiana's shoreline was unmerited because there was no proof that a deepwater port was needed.</p> <p>In 1960, for the third consecutive year, the Secretary's Advisory Board recommended Indiana Dunes as a new unit of the National Park System. Life magazine sympathetically displayed a photographic essay in the context of nature against industry. Revealing the destruction of Midwest Steel and NIPSCO bulldozers, one caption warned, \"Over the dunes hangs the smoky specter of steel.\"</p> <p>Nineteen sixty—one, the first year of President John F. Kennedy's administration and the Eighty—seventh Congress, was the first year in which more than one Indiana Dunes bill was introduced. In the first sign of compromise, Indiana Senator Vance Hartke introduced S. 2317 which provided for both port and park. Paul Douglas submitted S. 1797 which provided for an \"Indiana Dunes National Scientific Landmark\" of 5,000 acres which he subsequently amended to 9,000 acres. In the House, H.R. 6544 provided for an Indiana Dunes National Monument. Park Service comments, however, favored adopting the language of S. 1797 because the Secretary could lease the lands to the State of Indiana to preserve and manage. The National Scientific Landmark could be administered in conjunction with the Dunes State Park. The bill was designed to allay Indiana's concerns about Federal appropriation of the land. Protection of the leased land could be assured by careful monitoring of State management and protection.<br /> <img alt=\"Black and white, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, U. S.

On July 23, 1961, Douglas, Bible, and Udall arrived before the Bethlehem Steel property accompanied by an impressive entourage: Director Conrad Wirth; Chicago Mayor Richard Daley; the mayors of Gary, East Chicago, Hammond, and Whiting; and Dorothy Buell. After enjoying a day of hiking and interpretive talks sponsored by the Save the Dunes Council, the participants were converted to the park cause.</p> <p>In a widely publicized interview, Secretary Udall affirmed his desire to preserve the dunes as a national park and urged prompt Congressional action: \"It is my hope that we might preserve as large an area of national significance, not only to serve Chicago or Indiana, but to serve the whole country and future generations as well.\" To Paul Douglas, Udall asserted,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We ought to make a last ditch fight to save the dunes as a national park. Our great National Park System has no major unit in the midwestern heartland; your people need something above all. I hope that we can take a walk through the dunes again soon, and that it then will be a great national park.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><img alt=\"Black and white photograph of a vehicle on the beach. U.

In effect, the IPC declared, the Federal park would encompass and strangle the state's own popular park. The IPC further accused Douglas and his park proponents of spreading malicious propaganda, a \"vicious campaign\" of heralding a \"tourist Mecca\" to prevent the public port under the \"guise of conservation.\" Down—playing the tourist potential of the Federal park, IPC cited Secretary Udall's own words: \"There will be very little public recreational development. It will, rather, be a preservation of the natural state of the dunes land area. The National Park System is not in the bathing beach business.\"<br /> <img alt=\"Black and white photograph of Paul Douglas and Secretary Udall surrounded by citizens and press.

Indiana had a Democrat in the governor's mansion pledged to securing a public port, and the minority leader in the House of Representatives, Charles A. Halleck (Republican—Indiana), had most of the lakeshore area in his district and had launched his political career decades previously based on securing a public harbor for Indiana. Like most Hoosier politicians, Halleck was a self—declared enemy of the proposed park. On March 30, the Indiana Port Commission gleefully declared that Bethlehem Steel contracted for the removal of more than two million cubic yards of sand for use in a landfill at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The activity marked the first step in Bethlehem Steel's plans to break into the Chicago steel market by building a new $250 million facility, a move officially unveiled on December 2, 1962. Following the declaration, Douglas issued the following statement:</p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The announcement of Bethlehem Steel that it has sold two and a half million cubic yards of sand from the Dunes to a contractor who in turn has sold it to Northwestern University to fill in the lakefront at that institution, and that it will start to destroy the Dunes on May 1st, is a brutal and anti-social act. It is an attempt to confront the Congress and the President with an accomplished fact, before they can move to save this rarely beautiful area for the people… and for posterity. It is like attacking and mutilating a beautiful woman so that she may not belong to any one else.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The business manager of Northwestern University is reported to have friends of the Dunes that he did not care where the sand came from and that Northwestern was determined to go ahead with the contract, and furthermore, that he would not discuss the matter. I cannot believe that this attitude represents the real opinion of the President, trustees, faculty, alumni and students of this great university, and I appeal to them to reverse this position. If Bethlehem is deprived of a market for the sand it may be deterred from destroying the Dunes. Northwestern by using the sand becomes partner to the crime. Because a university is the repository of the intellectual heritage of the past, and helps to create the culture of the future, I still hope that Northwestern will not lend itself to this wanton destruction. For the Dunes are a priceless gift of nature, a peerless recreation area created over the millennia of time, and a famous laboratory for naturalists. They should be saved as the everlasting heritage of mankind…</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">May I also make one final appeal to the officers, directors, and stockholders of Bethlehem to call of their brutal plan. Does that corporation want to be known to the nation and to posterity as the ravager and destroyer of nature? Bethlehem has only a few days in which to redeem itself…</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Time is of the essence. The friends of beauty and of the outdoors should rally to the defense of this uniquely beautiful area.</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">Fearing that the industrial—political coalition might succeed in decimating the Central Dunes, Senator Douglas vowed to oppose appropriations for Burns Harbor until the park became a reality. At this point, Douglas knew the Kennedy White House wanted the port more than the park. He observed that the President's advisors exhibited typical Eastern arrogance in that they considered nothing in the Midwest worthy of preservation.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Douglas' suspicions proved correct when he learned in early October 1962 that President John F. Kennedy had approved the Bureau of the Budget's inclusion of Burns Harbor in the 1962 Public Works Bill. Paul Douglas immediately went to the White House to speak to President Kennedy. He shared with the President his well—worn photographs of the dunes, comparing the area's beauty and uniqueness to that of Kennedy's own beloved Cape Cod National Seashore. Douglas seized the opportunity to raise doubts about the validity of the fluctuating cost—benefit projections contained in the Corps of Engineers report, which had been revised from 5.66 to 1 in 1960 to 1.47 to 1 in 1962. He argued that the issue transcended politics. The dunes had to be preserved at all costs.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The meeting with Kennedy resulted in the President rescinding his approval of the port project. Additionally, he instructed the Bureau of the Budget to re-evaluate the economic potential of the harbor as well as to seek an avenue of compromise to establish both a port and a park. On October 3, 1962, an emergency meeting took place in Senator Douglas' office with Bureau of the Budget (BOB) and Corps of Engineers officials listening to a recitation of errors contained in the Corps' Burns Harbor report. Such in—depth analysis to dispute the Corps' findings was a shockingly unprecedented act. The result saw BOB reject the port proposal. The elimination of the port from the administration's agenda outraged port proponents who universally denounced Douglas' interference. New battle lines were drawn in early 1963 as the highly charged port versus park struggle entered a new stage.</p> <h3 dir=\"ltr\"><u>The Kennedy Compromise</u></h3> <p dir=\"ltr\">While bulldozers were leveling the middle of the Central Dunes in order to build the new Bethlehem Steel plant, Senator Douglas introduced yet another park bill—S. 650—to save the remainder of the dunes. Boundaries were adjusted to include unsold tracts in Dune Acres as well as land west of Ogden Dunes owned by Inland Steel. For the fourth time the Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments recommended that the area be preserved through the establishment of a national park.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Douglas privately felt the National Park Service was no longer as staunchly committed to the proposed park now that the largest unspoiled area outside the Dunes State Park was gone. While he had the tacit support of the administration, Douglas repeatedly encountered only lukewarm Interior Department approval. He believed this new attitude was dune in large part to tremendous political pressures as well as to the fear of harmful pollutants from the increasing number of area blast furnaces. Douglas later wrote disdainfully of the Service (by referring to it incorrectly) and its Director: \"The Eisenhower—appointed head of the Bureau of Parks, Conrad Wirth,* who had endorsed the Dunes proposal, reversed himself in public before the opposition of Capehart and his merry men. He is regarded as a great conservationist.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In a repeat of the October 3, 1962, emergency meeting in Senator Douglas' Washington office, officials of the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, and Bureau of the Budget met with Douglas and Save the Dunes Council Members Herbert Read and George Anderson on June 28, 1963. The Council members detailed three alternatives for Burns Ditch Harbor designed to save the shoreline dunes of the Bethlehem Steel tract, also known as \"Unit 192.\" This meeting led to a Save the Dunes Council—led tour of the area for Senator Douglas and George B. Hartzog, Jr., Associate Director of the National Park Service.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In August 1963, a Park Service report identified new areas to replace that lost to the steel mill. The report, compiled by an inter-disciplinary team from the Washington Office and Northeast (formerly called Region V from 1955 to 1962) Regional Office, excluded both the Bethlehem Steel and Burns Ditch Harbor areas from consideration, but did target areas to the immediate south for inclusion in the park. The report identified a national lakeshore composed of four distinct units with a combined shoreline total of eight and three—quarters miles.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In yet another high—level meeting in Senator Douglas' office with the same cast of players on September 5, 1963, the Corps of Engineers responded to the three harbor alternatives proposed by the Save the Dunes Council. Ominously, despite Douglas, Read, and Anderson's best arguments, the Bureau of the Budget (BOB) concurred with the overall Corps position. The proposals were \"not acceptable to local interests,\" i.e., the two steel companies. In a last—ditch effort, the Council appealed to Bethlehem Steel officials themselves. Although the corporation agreed that the alternatives for preserving the lakeshore dunes were feasible, it had already made up its corporate mind.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In September 1963, BOB completed its study as requested by President Kennedy. The so—called \"Kennedy Compromise\" ensued. BOB recommended the establishment of an 11,700-acre national lakeshore. Under BOB direction, the Corps of Engineers report included alternate port sites, but for the recommended Burns Ditch Harbor site, the Corps listed reservations in accordance with the Save the Dunes Council view. Before Federal money could be expended, environmental and economic considerations had to be satisfied.* The \"Kennedy Compromise Bill,\" drafted by the National Park Service, provided for an Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in accordance with the August 1963, Park Service report. In a conference call to the Save the Dunes Council, Douglas recommended acceptance of the compromise even though the Central Dunes would be lost. To continue the fight, Douglas believed, would extend the deadlock indefinitely and then no duneland would be left to save. After much agonizing, the Council concurred.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">On October 21, Senator Henry M. Jackson, Chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, introduced S. 2249 on behalf of Paul H. Douglas, Clinton P. Anderson, Vance Hartke, Birch Bayh, and a score of other cosponsors. The support of both Indiana Senators Bayh and Hartke was a heartening testimonial to the spirit of compromise. In the House, Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona introduced a similar bill, H.R. 8927, which was cosponsored by, among others, Rep. J. Edward Roush of Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the hopeful outlook engendered by the compromise, swift Congressional action was not to be. With the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas the following month, the transition to the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the frenzied enactment of many of the New Frontier programs kept the Congress from considering the dunes park bills. Hearings were held in the Senate Public Lands Subcommittee from March 5 to 7, 1964. Approximately fifty witnesses testified. It became apparent on the first day of hearings that not all of Indiana's Congressional Delegation was willing to ride on the bandwagon of compromise.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The stalwart leader of the opposition was Representative Charles A. Halleck. Halleck recounted the effort since 1935 to secure a public port to \"open Indiana as a gateway of the greatest agricultural and industrial area\" in the nation. Halleck objected to surrounding the port and steel mills with parkland because it would destroy the area's economic potential, thereby depriving his constituents of thousands of jobs. He cited the overwhelming local opposition to the Federal Government preserving the dunes when the State of Indiana had already incorporated a prime dunes tract into the State Park System—a unit which Halleck affirmed Indiana would never give away. He criticized the National Park Service for advocating the inclusion of land which did not even feature dunes. As for Park Service plans to establish nature trails near the industrial zones, Halleck scoffed, \"I can't conceive of anyone even walking across the street to explore some of those parcels.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">A spokesman from the Gary Chamber of Commerce expressed his displeasure over the wide expanse of the park. A resolution from the Porter County Board of Commissioners stated unalterable opposition to any Federal park in northern Porter County. Another resolution from the town board of Beverly Shores also expressed opposition as did the Beverly Shores Citizens Commission which questioned the apparent discrimination in excluding \"wealthy and powerful\" Ogden Dunes and Dune Acres from the park. Other Beverly Shores representatives asked the committee to either include all of the town within the national lakeshore or compensate the town for the loss of sixty percent of its tax base.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The testimony of Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall was decidedly favorable. Secretary Udall declared that to his knowledge the twenty—six Senators cosponsoring S. 2249 were the largest number of patrons for the establishment of any unit in the history of the National Park System. Udall recognized the national support base for the preservation of the dunes. He expressed disappointment in the preceding negative testimony in light of the best efforts initiated by John F. Kennedy in early 1963 to secure a compromise. Udall praised the committee for approving Point Reyes National Seashore on the Pacific Coast, Cape Cod National Seashore on the Atlantic Coast, and for considering the pending Fire Island National Seashore in New York. The Secretary pointed out that Mid—America was also a prime area for a national park unit in the form of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The highlight of the hearings was the well—delivered plea of Senator Paul Douglas. Calling the establishment of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore the \"most important conservation issue before the nation,\" Douglas lauded the efforts of the Save the Dunes Council:</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">\"This is undoubtedly one of the most public spirited, courageous, and self—sacrificing volunteer groups in the nation.\"</p> </blockquote> <div dir=\"ltr\">Douglas condemned the proposed Federal harbor as infeasible and an unfair subsidy of the steel companies which were conspiring to block the creation of a national park. He outlined the Kennedy Compromise providing for both port and park. He warned the committee,</div> <blockquote> <div dir=\"ltr\">\"[Do] not lose sight of the fact that this compromise plan gave up to the bulldozers the most beautiful section of the Indiana Dunes. The loss is tragic. No words and no amount of profit to anyone can possibly justify the inability or failure of our society and Government to preserve the irreplaceable 'Unit 2' section of the park.\"</div> </blockquote> In August 1964, the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee reported S. 2249 favorably and it passed the Senate on September 29, 1964. With the 88th Congress facing its closing months, the conservationists remained hopeful as Representative J. Edward Roush presented a companion bill, H.R. 12096, in July 1964. They were realistic, however, faced by the powerful coalition of park opponents led by the uncompromising Charles A. Halleck and Inland Steel. <h3><u>Authorization of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore</u></h3> <p>By the end of 1964, the Roush bill effectively died, bottled up in the House Interior committee. With the convening of the 89th Congress, Roush reintroduced the bill in early 1965 and it received the designation H.R. 51. Senator Paul Douglas and Representative Charles Halleck continued their port versus park political machinations. For his part, Douglas worked for the Senate to approve the Public Works Omnibus Bill of 1965 which included a stipulation providing that no funds be appropriated for Burns Ditch Harbor until Congress designated the Indiana Dunes a national lakeshore. When the bill reached the House, Halleck not only saw that the measure was deleted, but he inserted a clause forbidding any linkage between port and park. In conference committee, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana worked for a compromise. In the final bill, Douglas prevailed when Congress approved the Burns Waterway Harbor (Port of Indiana), but appropriations could only come with the authorization of an Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore by the adjournment of the 89th Congress in late 1966.</p> <p>From his years of experience in Congress, President Lyndon B. Johnson knew the history of the port versus park battle well. He adopted his predecessor's stand on the dunes, the so—called \"Kennedy Compromise,\" without pause. In his February 8, 1965, State of the Union speech, President Johnson declared that the number of parks, seashores, and recreational areas did not satisfy the needs of an expanding population. Johnson proposed that maximum appropriations from the newly implemented Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) be utilized to make the 1960s a \"Parks—for—America\" decade. He listed twelve proposed national park areas he intended to target LWCF monies to acquire. Two Great Lakes units were on the list: Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan, and Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.</p> <p>In early 1966, the Department of the Interior produced an updated feasibility proposal to Congress on Indiana Dunes. Ten thousand copies were printed for the Department, made possible through the use of private funds. The Izaak Walton League ordered 7,000 copies direct from the printer for its own distribution. Needless to say, Indiana, Washington, D.C., and other areas were saturated with the positive report.</p> <p>When House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee hearings resumed in April 1966, the National Park Service was confident that <u>finally</u> the dunes bill would be reported out of committee. Of notable importance, the State of Indiana's position had mellowed. It sought to capitalize on the proposed park out of its own self—interest. While Indiana welcomed the Federal Government acquiring lands immediately bordering on the Dunes State Park, the State remained diametrically opposed to donating its parkland. Rather, it wished to lease the new Federal areas and thereby forego National Park Service management. The State frowned upon acquisition of noncontiguous areas, such as the Inland Steel property, as an attempt to \"strangle\" the harbor and other industrial development.</p> <p>The slow trend in acceptance for the park also gained momentum in 1966 because of the approaching Congressional elections. While the port versus park issue had always split along partisan lines, this dichotomy was especially acute in 1966. The proposed Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was perceived as a \"Democratic\" program. Senator Douglas himself was facing a tough re—election campaign against Republican challenger Charles Percy. United in favor of the park by the top Democrat in the White House, Indiana's five Democratic representatives used their influence to promote the park bill as did Democratic Governor Roger Branigan, and Democratic Senators Vance Hartke and Birch Bayh. With the opening of the second session of the 89th Congress, Senator Paul Douglas personally called on members of the House Interior committee to enlist their support. These collective efforts bore fruit. The favorable committee report came in July 1966.</p> <p>Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey called committee members and Speaker of the House John McCormack to urge progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson, aware that polls indicated Douglas was trailing Percy, also called Speaker McCormack and reiterated his firm support for the park bill. Save the Dunes Council members joined with professional lobbyists representing labor, civil rights, and other liberal causes to promote the national lakeshore to each member of Congress.</p> <p>On October 11, 1966, the park bill went before the Committee of the Whole. Throughout the afternoon and again the following morning, Charles Halleck, Joe Skubitz (Republican—Kansas), and Rogers C. B. Morton (Republican—Maryland) led a concentrated attack against H.R. 51. In its defense, Interior Committee Chairman Wayne Aspinall declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>Exhaustive hearings were held by the National Parks and Recreation Subcommittee both in the field and in Washington. Every conceivable argument for and against the proposal was heard. I can honestly say no other park proposal has been given more intense consideration in this session of Congress than has been given H.R. 51.</p> </blockquote> <p>Speaker John McCormack, polling for votes on the floor, discovered that the measure would fail if it came to a vote. Entire delegations were absent, back in their districts campaigning. In a cunning political move, McCormack proposed to House Minority Leader Charles Halleck that the park bill be rescheduled for later in the week in order that more important business be discussed. Believing that even more Democrats would be absent, thereby ensuring a humiliating defeat for the bill, Halleck readily agreed. The Indiana Dunes vote was postponed until Friday, October 14.</p> <p>The brilliance of McCormack's move soon became apparent. One of the Great Society's pivotal programs was up for a vote on the same day. Ironically, Senator Paul Douglas' other bill, the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act (or Model Cities Act) was scheduled for consideration. The White House had used every avenue to ensure that all Democrats would be in attendance. So, too, had the conservationists who launched a massive telegram drive. According to Save the Dunes Council member and President of the Indiana Division of the Izaak Walton League Thomas E. Dustin,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If there is anything we could have done besides hiring a sky—writer to spell out \"save the dunes\" over the Capitol building, I don't know what it could be.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The proposed Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore reaped the benefits of the shrewd, top—level political maneuvering. On October 14, 1966, a legislative miracle occurred when the House of Representatives passed H.R. 51 with an impressive 204—141 vote. On October 18, the conference committee sent the bill back to the Senate which promptly concurred with the House amendments. Another irony involved the simultaneous approval of H.R. 50, which provided for an appropriation for Burns Harbor. The port versus park struggle, almost nine years in the making, had come to a draw.</p> <p>The park bill, authorizing $28 million for 8,100 acres, went to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for President Johnson's signature. Indiana Dunes was not to become the first National Lakeshore, however, as President Johnson signed the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan, bill on October 15. Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore came into being on November 5, 1966, with the approval of Public Law 89—761. Signed into law at the LBJ Ranch in the Texas hill country, the President heralded the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Act as a great victory for the United States. A statement from the President, released by the Office of the White House Press Secretary from San Antonio, read:<br />  </p> <blockquote> <p>The bill to establish the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore has been 50 years in the making. In 1916, the National Park Service first cited the need to preserve for public use the strip of uninhabited, tree—covered dunes, and white sandy beaches stretching along the south shore of Lake Michigan from East Chicago to Michigan City.</p> <p>Over the years many bills were introduced in the Congress. But it took the foresight and determination of the 89th Congress—and the tireless work of Senator Paul Douglas—to save the last remaining undeveloped portion of this lakeshore area. Thirteen miles of dunes and shoreline will be preserved for public use and enjoyment.</p> <p>Its beaches and woodlands will provide a haven for the bird lover, the beachcomber, the botanist, the hiker, the camper, and the swimmer.</p> <p>Within a 100—mile radius of the Indiana Dunes there are 9—1/2 million people crowded into one of the greatest industrial areas of our country. For these people, as well as for millions of other visitors, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore offer[s] ideal recreational opportunities. Here man can find solace and relief from the pressures of the industrial world.</p> <p>The Members of Congress who have worked with dedication for so many years toward enactment of this bill deserve great credit. In addition to Senator Douglas, I particularly commend the diligence of Senators Hartke, and Bayh, and Representatives Roush, Madden, and Udall.</p> <p>During the Administration more than 980,000 acres in 24 States have been added to the National Park System by the Congress. Twenty major conservation measures were passed by the 89th Congress. None gives me greater satisfaction than this bill to preserve the Indiana Dunes.</p> <p>The great scenic and scientific attractions of the Dunes moved poet Carl Sandburg to say \"the Indiana Dunes are to the Midwest what the Grand Canyon is to Arizona and Yosemite is to California.\"</p> <p>Our entire country is made richer by this Act I have signed today.</p> </blockquote> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Rosalie Jones was known as a maverick, strong-willed and opinionated by her friends and allies. Those who disliked her used much stronger words.  </p> <h2>Early Life and Education</h2> <p>Her parents were wealthy: her mother, Mary Elizabeth Jones, came from a wealthy, upper-class family. As well as her inherited wealth, Mary also earned a fortune in real estate development, rumored to own property “in every state in the Union.” Rosalie's father was Dr. Oliver Livingston Jones, Sr., a physician who also had real estate investments.<br /> <br /> In 1909, their home in Cold Spring Harbor, New York burned to the ground. Rumors in the community swirled that Rosalie’s brother, Oliver, started the fire. He suffered from mental illness and was eventually institutionalized. In 1911, the family began rebuilding. In 1913, tragedy struck again when Rosalie’s father committed suicide. Oliver died in early 1918.<br /> <br /> Her mother died in October 1918 during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/influenza-at-camp-sherman.htm\">Influenza Pandemic of 1918</a>, just nine days before her son Philip died. Rosalie’s surviving brother, Arthur, inherited the family properties. After many years of fighting, Rosalie took possession of one of the family homes and a financial settlement. In return, she agreed to stop accusing her brother of mismanaging the estate.<br /> <br /> Before her death, Rosalie's mother was a member of the New York State Anti-Suffrage Associations. Although raised in an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/anti-suffragism-in-the-united-states.htm\">anti-suffrage</a> household, Rosalie was an active <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">suffragist</a>. She first took part in an outdoor suffrage meeting in New York City in 1911. This new and radical way of organizing was started by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/maud-malone.htm\">Maud Malone</a>, another New York City suffragist. From 1912 to 1913, Rosalie served as Nassau County President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In the spring of 1912, she traveled around Long Island in a “Votes for Women” wagon pulled by a horse.<br /> <br /> Rosalie earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Adelphi College in Brooklyn and then attended Brooklyn Law School. In 1919, she received a law degree from George Washington University in DC. In 1922, she got her Doctor of Civil Law degree from George Washington College of Law, now part of American University in DC. She passed both the New York and Washington, DC bar exams. After law school, she went into business buying and selling real estate. She made a considerable fortune, much of which she lost during the Great Depression.  </p> <h2>Suffrage Pilgrimages</h2> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a>, Rosalie was influenced by Emmeline Pankhurst, a militant suffragette from Britain. To bring attention to the battle for suffrage, Rosalie organized groups of women to march long distances. She called these marches “pilgrimages,” and the women marching were “pilgrims.”<br /> <br /> In December of 1912, over 200 women joined Rosalie for parts of a march of over 140 miles from New York City to Albany, New York.<a href=\"#ftn-1\"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong></a> Only a handful of women, including Rosalie, completed the entire route. The march took thirteen cold, wintry days. During the march, the women stopped to hold open air meetings and give out pamphlets in communities along the way. They carried yellow knapsacks and Votes for Women banners. Rosalie’s anti-suffrage mother said the march was “ridiculous.” It was during this pilgrimage, carrying petitions to the governor of New York, that Rosalie earned the nickname “General” Jones.<br /> <br /> In February 1913, General Jones led a group of 225 women on another march from New York City to Washington, DC. As the pilgrims rested in Wilmington, Delaware, two white Southern businessmen confronted Jones about the group’s stance on African American women’s voting rights. Jones tried to avoid the question. She ultimately stated: “The question is one that has to do largely with certain States. The men and women of those States must solve their own problems.”<a href=\"#ftn-2\"><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></a><br /> <br /> As the hikers neared Laurel, Maryland, Jones received word that a small group of African American women planned to join the pilgrimage from nearby Muirkirk, Maryland. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, “Gen. Jones did not seem to take the report seriously. Her only remark was, ‘Yes they will,’ with the accent upon the first and last words.”<a href=\"#ftn-3\"><strong><sup>[3]</sup></strong></a> Jones’s tone and opinion are difficult for historians to decipher because the language used in the newspaper is itself dismissive of the Black suffragists. Four or five African American women joined the suffrage hike for at least one mile and hoisted a ‘Votes for Negro Women’ banner, albeit at the very back of the procession. After the marchers left Laurel, a cavalry brigade of women met General Jones and escorted the group into DC. On March 3, 1913, General Jones and her “pilgrims” marched in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woman-suffrage-procession1913.htm\">DC suffrage procession</a>.<br /> <br /> Jones’s evasiveness about Black women’s voting rights may have stemmed from her immediate circumstances. The 240-mile suffrage hike was physically grueling. People who opposed women’s suffrage harassed and intimidated the hikers along the way. In addition to verbal insults, onlookers tore banners and jostled the women. In Wilmington, the white Southern businessmen had also indicated that if the hikers supported Black women’s voting rights, the rest of their journey to Washington would be a hostile one, “through the enemy’s country.”<a href=\"#ftn-4\"><strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong></a></p> <h2>Life after Suffrage</h2> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/womens-suffrage-timeline.htm\">ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment</a> in 1920, Rosalie continued working for causes she believed in. For example, she demanded the removal of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/historyculture/robert-moses-biography.htm\">Robert Moses</a> from his position as President of the Long Island Park Commission. He was, she argued, taking land from people without fair warning. She lived alone for many years at her home on Long Island and had a reputation for being “difficult.”<br /> <br /> In March 1927, Rosalie married Clarence Dill at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Cold Spring Harbor. She removed the word “obey” from their vows, and refused to “be given away” by anyone. Dill represented Washington state in the United States Senate. That November, Dill ran for a second term, and was reelected. While in DC, Rosalie continued to her involvement in things that were important to her. From 1933 to 1935, she was President of the Congressional Club. Members rebuffed her insistence that the organization engage with social causes. They insisted instead that the clubhouse remain neutral ground, a place “free from the constant drive and appeals from scores of groups for various forms of service.”<a href=\"#ftn-5\"><strong><sup>[5]</sup></strong></a><br /> <br /> Rosalie and Clarence separated before 1934, while Clarence was still in office. He remained in Washington state while she moved back to New York. In 1936, after months of public speculation, Dill filed for divorce from Rosalie. She fought to prevent it. The case received considerable press – both Rosalie and Clarence were well known and there was name calling and other fodder to entice readers. Among other grievances, Dill claimed that Rosalie called him a “political coward” for not running for a third term. He called her an appalling wife, slovenly, and a terrible housekeeper (even though they had a maid, who testified during the court proceedings). Dill also claimed she spurned his business advice, telling him he should “keep to politics.” Rosalie claimed that she gave him thousands of dollars in the early years of their marriage. In the divorce, he got their home in Washington state and she got the furniture.<br /> <br /> In 1936, Rosalie ran for Congress in Washington state, promoting a balanced budget and the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. Her campaign was unsuccessful and she returned to New York. She lived much of the rest of her life on Long Island, “composting her garbage, raising goats, defying traditions, and fighting with her neighbors and relatives.”<a href=\"#ftn-6\"><sup><strong>[6]</strong></sup></a><br /> <br /> She spent her last years in Brooklyn, where she died on January 12, 1978. Despite the challenges she had with her family over the years, General Rosalie Jones’s ashes were scattered outside of her mother’s tomb at St. John’s Episcopal Church, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.</p> <h2>Notes </h2> <p><strong><a href=\"#text-1\">[1]</a> </strong>The pilgrimage to Albany left New York City from the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/75312120\">Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street subway station</a>.

Most historical accounts state that Thomas Jr. soon became ill and died while still in infancy. Dennis Hanks, a cousin of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, the mother of Thomas Jr., later recalled that little Tommy Lincoln \"did not live three days.\" Whereas Thomas Lincoln did not own the land he farmed at Knob Creek he could not bury Thomas Jr. on the property. Thomas Lincoln Jr. was buried in the Redmon Cemetery on a nearby hill overlooking the Lincoln's Knob Creek Farm. The illness that Thomas Lincoln Jr. died from is not known.",
