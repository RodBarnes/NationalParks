Fortunately for the visitor today, the pilings these piers were built upon did survive and offer an excellent opportunity to see some of the park’s larger marine animals. The shelter created by the pilings, mixed with a deep drop off into the dredged channel, attract large grouper, tarpon, barracudas, and the occasional shark. You can also expect to see a variety of smaller fish and colorful coral living on and around these pilings. <strong>Remember to recreate responsibly, there is no lifeguard on duty and the nearest medical help is 70 miles away. The park is a no touch no take area. All coral, reef fish and cultural artifacts are protected. Maintaining at least an arms distance from the bottom or any corals is a best practice for personal and resource safety. There is no fishing allowed in this area.</strong>",

To the left of the sign is the start of the boardwalk. An approximately 8 foot wide boardwalk extends into the trees in two directions. If visitors follow the trail in a clockwise direction they set off into an open forest floor. Large trees in the old growth forest tower over them. Near the far end of the loop the boardwalk levels out into a gravel trail that is also accessible. At the far end of the loop a spur trail (not accessible) extends up the mountainside to a waterfall. Continuing along the trail the boardwalk reappears and continues next to Happy Creek which flows over fall trees and collects in still pools before continuing downhill. After a few hundred feet the boardwalk veers away from the creek and returns to the parking lot.",

The building is powered by solar energy and receives water from a modern well in Nidever Canyon. The airstrip's west end conveniently abuts the entrance to the ranger station.<br /> <br /> Although the Navy retains legal possession of the island and may in perpetuity, agreements were made in 1976 that allowed the National Park Service to manage the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>NPS and Navy Cooperation</strong><br /> The idea of including San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands National Monument had circulated for decades. Activities in this direction increased in the early 1960s as President Kennedy pressed for parklands and NPS historian Ross Holland produced a history of the island in 1961.<br /> <br /> The Navy, however, continued to deny transfer of San Miguel to the NPS. It needed the island to test guided weapons systems, for fleet squadron practice, and for on-land instrumentation. Creation of a park would have an adverse effect on the required readiness training of fleet aviation units. A park would attract the general public into the nearby hazard area, which had to be kept free to assure maximum range scheduling. In short, the position of the Commander, Pacific Missile Range was that there was no objection to the proposed park provided San Miguel Island was excluded until it was no longer desired for Navy purposes. The Navy also wanted unrestricted access to and use of existing improvements on privately owned Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> In 1948 biologist Lowell Sumner had made an air inspection of the northern Channel Islands after which he recommended nominal transfer of San Miguel Island from Navy to NPS. If that could not be done, he urged that the Navy should stop the destructive sheep grazing.<br /> <br /> In July of 1957 Sumner conferred with regional specialists on seashore survey at the subject island and then wrote the Regional Director that he was still of the same opinion he had in 1939: the scientific features of San Miguel Island were so outstanding that it warranted every effort of preservation. It was approximately 14 times as large as Santa Barbara Island and had a correspondingly greater wealth of unique biological features. He noted that the federal government had, through its continuance of sheep grazing, permitted destruction on San Miguel; thus it should be up to the government to restore the land.<br /> <br /> A few days later the Regional Director wrote to the Director of NPS in Washington asking that San Miguel Island be added to Channel Islands National Monument. He wrote that no NPS representative concerned with biological and other natural resources had been on the island since 1939. The only activity on the island or around it in 1957 was commercial and military.<br /> <br /> The Navy could not give up San Miguel, yet preservation experience lay with the National Park Service. During 1962 the Western Regional Office, NPS, and the Navy drew up a series of interim agreements and put forth plans for the future management of San Miguel Island. NPS pointed out that they had been criticized for the lack of protection they offered on the islands they already controlled, but that lack of funds, transport, and personnel was the reason.<br /> <br /> The Navy was concerned about a need for launching missiles and the need to close down the island temporarily to continue the launches. The Navy discussed using San Miguel and San Nicolas for a naval petroleum reserve, and this was fought by local conservation groups who urged national monument status for San Miguel instead. Letters went to President Kennedy urging his support for conservation.<br /> <br /> Recognizing that San Miguel and Prince Islands contained rich and unique natural and cultural resources, the Department of the Navy and Department of the Interior entered a Memorandum of Agreement on May 7, 1963 for \"protection of natural values and historic and scientific objects\" on the two islands. The agreement authorized the Department of the Interior to take action regarding resources inventory and protection. Interior agreed to evaluate natural and cultural resources, to promote recovery or reintroduction of rare and locally extinct plants and animals, and to cooperate with the Navy in its rules and management of the islands. It was understood that the Navy had paramount use of the islands as a missile test range and that in the future it could even be a Naval Petroleum Reserve. Both parties recognized the priority of military uses. As a result, both departments would share responsibility for preservation and management. San Miguel and Prince Islands would not be open for public recreational purposes, and the Navy owned the island. These facts made it unlawful for the NPS to spend its funds there.<br /> <br /> NPS personnel began to study the island after the agreement was signed. Historian Daniel Bienvenu of the National Park Service prepared a Historic Structures Report for the Lester ranch house in November of 1965. Bienvenu found the old house abandoned for almost 20 years and quite dilapidated. He noted that while many fixtures had been taken away, numerous artifacts had been left, such as a table, beds, and sinks and toilets. Bienvenu recommended that the house, \"a hand-made oddity, with no recognizable architecture,\" be retained on the site \"until destroyed by the elements.\" Two years later, the ranch house burned to the ground along with the outbuildings and shearing shed.<br /> <br /> In cooperation with the Navy, the National Park Service produced a management plan for the island in the late 1960s. The document's authors recommended a wide range of activities on the island, concluding, \"San Miguel and Prince Islands possess both unique and irreplaceable scientific and natural values.\" Included in the recommendations were exotic plant identification and removal, enhancement of native plants, removal of feral burros, and studies of fire ecology, marine mammals population and ecology, faunal species, seabird and landbird ecology, underwater features, and history, prehistory and archeology.<br /> <br /> Two major agreements were negotiated and signed in regard to San Miguel Island after Park Superintendent Bill Ehorn took office in 1974. The first, signed in 1976 was an amendment to the agreement between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Navy that related to protection of natural values on San Miguel. The amendment further recognized that the National Park Service could expend appropriated funds on the island to enforce NPS regulations and to develop a tightly controlled visitor program. Public access was to be confined to daylight hours and importantly tied to spending of funds at the island.<br /> <br /> As a result of this, a tent was set up in Nidever Canyon adjacent to the old windmill to serve as temporary Park headquarters; beginning in 1978 visitors could contact the ranger as they walked up the canyon to the island. Ehorn assigned Mike Hill as ranger at the post. Hill accompanied all visitors to the island who wanted to take the trail that follows the road bulldozed during World War II.<br /> <br /> Ehorn convened an advisory group that included A. Starker Leopold, Carey Stanton, Ralph Philbrick and Bob DeLong. In 1977, a Statement for Management was drawn up for San Miguel and Prince Islands by the National Park Service as well as an agreement between the National Marine Fisheries Service and the National Park Service for management and protection of the pinnipeds on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> A decision by the United States Supreme Court gave the State of California control over tidal lands, not the National Park Service, although designation of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary in 1980 offered federal protection of those waters. On land, meanwhile, Monument staff in 1977 killed the last of the feral burros that had been roaming the island for decades, finally bringing to a close the era of domestic livestock grazing on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> After creation of Channel Islands National Park in 1980 the National Park Service took on additional management of San Miguel and Prince Islands, although the Navy retained ownership until a transfer would be authorized by the Navy. A General Management Plan (GMP) was quickly adopted that spelled out development and protection of the island. The GMP designated the entire island as a historic zone overlapping the natural zone, which extended into the waters surrounding the island.<br /> <br /> Of the natural zone, 2,800 acres would be a protected area in which development and visitor access would be restricted. Only one acre, in two half-acre parcels, would be used for developments: the NMFS research station at Point Bennett and a proposed visitor contact station at the Lester Ranch site. Camping would be prohibited and visitors were restricted to day use only and by permit.<br /> <br /> The NPS adopted amendments to the 1980 GMP in 1984, which included minor changes in plans for San Miguel Island. Noting the dearth of visitors due to extreme conditions, park-imposed restrictions and distances from the mainland, the GMP proposed one or two small primitive campgrounds, one at the Lester Ranch site and another at the dry lake bed (the latter location was dropped within a year). The plan also extended the range of ranger-led walks, although it still limited trail construction. In light of these potential developments, the development zone was increased to 1.5 acres.<br /> <br /> A small amount of development occurred in the 1980s. The tent in the canyon was replaced by a conex box. NPS crews eventually constructed a campground in a former sheep corral near the Lester ranch house ruins. Trail development remained low-key in the interest of habitat restoration, with visitors being restricted to ranger-led walks if venturing beyond the area of Nidever Canyon and the old ranch site. The trail to Point Bennett was used for such walks and by staff and volunteers of the field station. A trail to Lester and Harris points was developed but like the Point Bennett trail, was restricted to supervised hikes.<br /> <br /> Park resources staff focused on archeological and shipwreck survey work as well as island fox monitoring, pinniped research and habitat restoration. In 1997 the NPS constructed a modern building up on the mesa to replace the temporary ranger station in the canyon. Designed to echo the lines of the Lester ranch house, the one-story structure combined a ranger contact station, ranger residence and bunkhouse for visiting researchers. The building is powered by solar energy and receives water from a modern well in Nidever Canyon. The airstrip's west end conveniently abuts the entrance to the ranger station.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "In an open field, next to the airplane landing strip, sits the ranger station. It is an L-shaped wooden building. The building has brown, planked wood siding. If facing the front of the building, four upper, clerestory windows are visible near the peak of the roof. A lower roof overhangs the front of the building, supported by beams and posts, creating a covered walkway. Along that walkway, at ground level, five windows alternate with five doors. Two wooden benches along the exterior wall provide seating. At the bend of the L-shape is a 10-foot by 10-foot structure that sticks up about 10 feet taller than the roof. Sticking up from it are several tall rods and a shallow, concave-shaped satellite dish. An outdoor lamp attached to the side. <br /><br />In front of the station is a picnic table and a flagpole, flying the United States flag. On the left side of the walkway is a low wire frame platform. Mounted on top of this is a large brush, made of stiff blue plastic spikes, used to clean off the bottoms of boots. Further to the left is a small, single-seater wood plank outhouse, with symbols on the door representing both a man and a woman. Several other small storage sheds are nearby.<br /><br />The ranger station information center is through the second door from the right. The room is a large and open space, with high ceilings. It has light wood paneling. Windows line the back wall behind a partially-partitioned area with desks and a table with two chairs. Colorful pictures on the walls display island views. On the left side of the room are two doors leading to equipment and supply closets. To the right is a television, set on the top of a corner cabinet, with a shelf of videos below it.<br />",

            "audioDescription": "Leading to the large upper observation deck holding the tug Aloha is a long wooden ramp that slopes slightly upward, with a bend to the right a few feet before it meets the deck. Both sides of the ramp and all sides of the deck are lined with an approximately 3-foot-tall wooden railing fitted below with a wire mesh grid. In addition to displaying the tug, the observation deck holds 2 wayside panels, 2 pairs of binoculars supported atop metal poles, and 3 wooden benches. The benches are situated about 4 feet in front of, and parallel to, the deck railing immediately to your left as you step off the ramp. Take care to avoid these benches as you approach the waysides and binoculars, which are placed alongside this same railing. This is the side of the observation deck that most closely faces the beach fronting Sleeping Bear Bay. As you move along the railing, the first wayside panel you will encounter is entitled \"Safe passage.\" Featured on the panel's right half is a color nautical chart showing Manitou Passage, the Michigan mainland, and South Manitou and North Manitou Islands. Text appearing under the title on the panel's left half reads: A chart of navigable waters shows the information sailors need to travel safely. How deep is the water? Shallow water is noted with contour lines drawn around the shorelines. Small numbers tell, in feet, the depth of the water. Where is the water the shallowest? the deepest?Where are the dangers? Symbols show the type of navigational aids sailors need to find safe travel through the passage. A left-tilting purple and black exclamation point means a red light on a platform. A red light at night warns sailors to steer clear of danger. Can you find this symbol marking the North Manitou Shoal Light? How many other symbols like this can you find?The black outline of a circle with a red arrow shape jutting off to the right is the symbol for a red flashing buoy. These buoys are paired with green flashing buoys to tell sailors where the safe channel is. Can you find one on the chart? The dotted outline of a football-shaped oval with a row of 3 crosses inside marks shipwrecks. How many shipwrecks do you see on the chart? Six plus one marked \"wreck.\"Scattered on the map are about a half dozen symbols representing the red lights on platforms and red flashing buoys. Standing to the right of the \"Safe passage\" wayside is a second wayside panel entitled \"A perilous highway.\" Filling the top half of the panel is a black-and-white photo of a long wooden steamer ship with a 2-level deckhouse with a pilot house as its 2nd level. The steamer's bow is tipped slightly upward, out of the water, and its stern appears to be buckled. Text below the wayside's title tells us:The Manitou Passage served as a trail for the Anishinaabek who hunted, fished, and traded in this region. It was from the water that they named the forested mound of sand atop the dunes \"The Sleeping Bear\" and used it as a landmark for navigation. This 30-mile-long stretch of water between the Manitou Islands and the mainland served as part of the Great Lakes \"highway\" for travel and commerce. The Passage today is still a shortcut for vessels on this inland sea and boasts several protected harbors. Yet, danger lies in the treacherous shoals and rocks hidden beneath the waves upon which hundreds of boats have wrecked or foundered.Look out across the water. Can you spot two different types of lighthouses? When it is clear, you can see the tall, white tower of the South Manitou Island Lighthouse and the shorter North Manitou Shoal Light known as \"the Crib\". Today, the light on South Manitou is not an official aid to navigation, but the Crib still is. Look for vessels as small as kayaks and as huge as freighters maneuvering the Passage.A caption accompanying the photo of the steamer provides additional information:In October of 1917, the steamer Rising Sun grounded on the rocks off Pyramid Point-the high headland to the east. The passengers and crew survived. Remnants of the wreck can still be seen in shallow waters.Appearing in the panel's lower right corner are 2 smaller images placed one beside the other. The image on the left depicts a color postcard of the lighthouse containing the North Manitou Island Shoal Light. The white structure supporting the 3-story steel tower topped with the light caps consists of a 2-story steel building supported below by a larger square concrete crib. A caption reads: In the middle of the Passage the North Manitou Shoal Light flashes its warning light and sounds its fog signal. Can you hear it today? The small black-and-white photo to the right shows a tapered cylindrical lighthouse with a lantern room and cupola at its top. The lighthouse stands beside a brick building with the date 1858 etched into its facade. A caption reads: A lighthouse has marked South Manitou Island since 1840.Standing approximately 8 feet to the right of the \"A perilous highway\" wayside are the metal poles holding the",

            "audioDescription": "The Aloha is a small fishing tug measuring about 12 feet wide and 40 feet long from stern to bow. The tug, which is slightly longer than the average school bus, is perched atop a wooden platform on the upper observation deck located near the Glen Haven parking area. As displayed, the boat's weather deck is located about 3 feet above the observation deck. The vertical metal sheeting covering the Aloha is painted white. The stern is rounded in shape and fitted with a large rectangular window with a sliding shutter. The tug's flat 2-level roof-lower over the bow and taller over the vessel's higher rear cabin-is lined with a low metal grab railing, about 6 inches high. Standing on the observation deck just in front of the stern is a wayside panel entitled \"The good tug Aloha.\" Pictured on this wayside is a drawing of a long fishing net stretching vertically above the pale brown sand at the bottom of a deep blue lake. A wide band of paler blue sky fills the panel above the lake's surface. The net holds several fish drawn in white. Two dozen small black dots running along the base of the net represent weights. Appearing along the top of the net are 2 dozen small white dashes labeled \"floats.\" Floating on the water's surface above the net's two top corners are two red buoys topped with red flags. Also appearing on the water's surface above the center of the net are 2 small red circles which are not labeled. Text below the wayside's title explains: The Aloha, part of the boat collection housed in the nearby Cannery, was built for fishing on the Great Lakes. She spent her days navigating deep waters of Lake Michigan gillnetting chubs-small, oily native fish especially prized as smoked fish. Gill nets hang like curtains in the water between floating buoys along their top and anchored lines at their bottom. Chubs swim into the small openings in the net and get caught, often by their gills. Larger fish can't enter the openings and simply swim around the net. The Aloha's crew worked in the enclosed cabin. One used a motorized net lifter to pull up the long gangs of nets (hopefully filled with fish!) through the small hatch near the front on the starboard side. Another removed fish from nets pulled along the sorting table. They then reset the nets through the sliding hatch on the portside stern. As the boat returned to harbor, crews often cleaned and packed the fish on ice in boxes. Back at the dock, they would unload the 100-pound fish boxes before their work was done. See other working and recreational boats from the Great Lakes in the Cannery boat museum. Superimposed one above the other in the wayside's upper right quadrant are two small images. The image at the top is a page printed with Aloha's measurements and other specifications. The tug's weight is noted as 26 gross tons, and materials are listed as \"wood hull with galvanized steel sheeting.\" Additional text tells us that the Fish Tug Aloha was built in 1937 by Sturgeon Bay Boat Works in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. The image appearing below is a black-and-white photo depicting the Aloha docked in the lake. A caption accompanying the photo below d tells us: The Aloha was launched in 1937 and had five different owners during her 50 years of service. She worked out of the Lake Michigan ports of Ellison Bay, Washington Island, Algoma, and Milwaukee, and from Port Wing on Lake Superior. The observation deck holding the Aloha is surrounded by a wooden railing fitted below with a wire mesh grid. This barrier has a total height of approximately 3 feet. Standing a few inches from the railing running alongside the beach at Sleeping Bear Bay is an approximately 5-foot-tall metal pole supporting a pair of binoculars aimed out over the water. A separate metal arm protruding from the left side of the pole at about half its height holds a second pair of binoculars positioned just above the deck railing. As you approach the binoculars from the center of the deck, take care to avoid 2 wooden benches placed side by side, but with a 3-foot-wide space between them, about 4 feet in front of, and parallel with, the deck railing.",

Day the first Chairman of the State Parks Commission. Day was an excellent choice for the job of State Park Commissioner due to his promotional activities and his widely acclaimed Day Forest conservation efforts.<br /> <br /> In November 1920, Day donated 32 acres of land on Glen Arbor Bay, Leelanau County, between Glen Haven and Glen Arbor to the state for use as a state park.<br /> <br /> Michigan had previously acquired at least two other properties for management as state parks (Mackinac State Park in 1895 and Interlochen State park in 1917).

            "audioDescription": "Located just north of the D.H. Day Campground is the D. H. Day Log Cabin, a one-story log structure constructed in 1923. This historic cabin stands alongside the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail and can be accessed from both the campground and the parking area at Glen Haven to the west. The cabin features an open porch and a side-facing gable roof covered with dark shingles. Jutting up from the roof's center is a log cupola, also with a dark-shingled gable roof. Rising above the building roof on its right end is a large stone chimney. Visible below the porch is the building's low stone foundation.<br /> There are two 12-paned glass windows on the front of the cabin, one each flanking a central double entrance door. There is also a 6-paned glass window on the cupola's front side, tucked directly below its roofline. A stone walkway leads to the front of the cabin, where there are 2 wide stone steps positioned below the wooden porch, which extends across the full width of the building's facade. You must take one tall step up from the top-most step to reach the porch floor, which is situated about 2 feet above the surrounding grass. The overhanging porch roof is supported by 4 square wooden pillars, 2 each flanking the stone steps and 2 others standing at the porch's left and right ends. There are no railings or other barriers positioned alongside the stone walkway, the steps, or surrounding the porch. Take care as you walk along the stone walkway as although its top surface is flush with the surrounding grass, it is uneven in spots and you may encounter thick tufts of grass growing up between some of the stones. Note that the cabin's porch can also be accessed by an upward sloping wooden ramp located on the left end of the building. This ramp is flanked by wooden railings on both sides. Once on the porch, you may encounter a wooden bench placed below one or both of the 2 windows flanking the entrance. Situated on the porch directly in front of the entrance door is an upward-sloping wooden threshold, about one foot deep. The right-side double door will likely be propped open when the cabin is open for visitors. Features found inside the one-room cabin include a tall stone fireplace surround with a flat stone hearth, a display case holding various artifacts, and any number of wooden benches, tables, cabinets, or metal folding chairs. Lastly, standing near the approach to the cabin is a green sign labeled \"Michigan Registered Historic Site.\" Text in yellow lettering reads: Early State Parks. By the end of World War I, with the rapid growth of the recreation industry in Michigan, a need for a state-wide parks system had arisen. In 1919 the State Park Commission was established. D. H.

The Rangers here recommend exercising caution, staying on trails, wearing bug spray, avoiding tall grass and brush, and, perhaps most importantly, inspecting yourself for ticks when you get home.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f7c16e6b-33a3-495b-aad1-ec2fefd35489}{145}\" paraid=\"1748299891\">Please, choose your own adventure by selecting the path, or paths, that meet your time and interests. The Land Use Trail begins here and continues along the boardwalk to a view of the manor house. From the end of the boardwalk, you may choose to follow the \"Squirrel Lane Trail\" down to the family cemetery, or visit the \"Barnyard Trail\" behind the Old Mastic House. Alternatively, you may want to follow the road at the other end of the parking lot to head straight to the \"Barnyard Trail.\"  </p>",

He became a Town trustee in 1769, a colonel in the colonial militia, and active in church affairs, giving money and support to the Caroline Church in Setauket and the Fire Place Church in Southhaven, NY. In 1774, he was appointed a representative for New York in the 1st Continental Congress. It was in this capacity that on July 6, 1776, he dared to sign the Declaration of Independence. It was act of treason, and an act that set the country on its path to independent and democratic rule. His granddaughter, Julia Floyd Delafield recounted his story of the signing, \"When they were about signing the paper Gen'l Floyd was talking with ---- a man of feeble frame and delicate health. The General was a man of iron nerve and of muscles to match. The man said 'Floyd if we get our necks in a noose for this - you'll kick half an hour after I'm quiet!'\" ",

Their cabin, along the banks of what became known as Lon’s Creek, was an informal gathering spot for the community of Black and Indigenous workers traveling between the Poospatuck Reservation, other cabins for enslaved and later free workers, and the estate. Long after his death in February 1860, Lon’s Creek continues to bear his name.  </p>",

Cornelia Floyd Nichols remembered this approach fondly, “Perched high in the light wagon with pungent horse blankets tucked around us for warmth, we jogged the three miles homeward on a narrow woods road. Past the little Indian reservation of Poospattuck…through the spring mudpuddles of 'Oak Arch', into Squirrel Lane and up the little rise onto the lawn. Carriage wheel marks were so soon lived down by its soft deep clover that it was the custom to drive right across the green to the piazza.”</p>",

Walker</a>. Today the home is a National Historic Landmark and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/index.htm\">Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site</a>.  </p> <p><strong>Architecture</strong></p> The home was built in 1883 by architect George Boyd, a formerly enslaved man from Goochland, VA. His inspiration was the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/italianate-style-architecture.htm\">Italianate style of architecture</a> that lasted in the United States from the mid 1800s to the 1890's, inspired by the style of Italian villas. One of the main features of the Italianate style that can be seen on the Maggie L. Walker home is the low angled roof and highly decorated overhanging eaves. The eaves are also supplemented with decorated brackets called corbels supporting the weight of the eaves. Another one of the features indicating the Italianate influence is the tall narrow windows on the front of the house. The Italianate style heavily accentuated vertical structures and also utilized window sashes, which can also be seen on the Walker house. The porch of the house is also a common piece of Italianate style buildings in the United States and the columns, both locate outside and inside the home, evoke the memory of the Italian Renaissance. The interiors of the Italianate style were less defined than the exteriors, however there were some notable ideas present in the Walker home. One of them is that most of the rooms will have multiple entrances and exits, and this is very evident in the Walker home with most rooms having three doorways, even the bedrooms, which all connect to each other and to the hallway. <h4>Before the Walker Family</h4> While the most famous family that resided in this house would be Mrs. Walker and her family, she was not the originally owner of the home. Originally built in 1883, the home's original owner would be Doctor James Ferguson and his family. When the Ferguson family moves into the home, it would only be a two floor, five room house. This isn't as much information known about the family in the home as there would be for the second family to live in this home, the Jones.<br /> <br /> Doctor Robert E Jones and his family would be the second owners of 110 ½ E. Leigh Street and would own the home until 1904 when Maggie L. Walker buys the home. During their time in the home in the 1890's, they would make several major structural changes to the home, which would then be inherited by the Walker family when they move in.<br /> <br /> One of the largest changes the Jones family makes to the home is adding several upstairs bedrooms to the home. When they first move into the home, there would only be two upstairs rooms, but they grow the house by extending the hallway and adding five more rooms on the second floor.<br /> <br /> They also add a key feature to the house today, the kitchen. Previous to their upgrade, the kitchen was not attached to the house, but they added it onto the first floor at the rear of the house, making cooking easier, especially since the kitchen and dining room were now connected to each other.<br /> <br /> The third major addition added to the home by the Jones was the west wing on the first floor that Dr. Jones used as a waiting room and examination room for his patients. This change would give the home one of its more unique features which are two front doors, which still exists to this day. The Jones family would eventually sell the home to Maggie L. Walker in 1904. <h4><strong>Walker Family Moves In</strong></h4> While Maggie L. Walker buys 110 ½ in 1904, she and her family delay their move for another year as they makes two upgrades to the home. One of the upgrades Maggie L. Walker makes to the home before moving in is the installation of electricity throughout the home. Before the electricity is installed, the lighting in the house was all gas-powered and instead of replacing all the light features, they were retrofit to be electric powered keeping the old gas aesthetic with the functionality of electricity. The other major upgrade Mrs. Walker would add to the house was a central heating system using a furnace in the basement of the home, replacing the need for fireplaces to heat the home. The fireplaces would still be used by the family for relaxing evenings in together.  <br /> <br /> When the upgrades finished the Walker family would move into the house at 110½ E. Leigh Street. There are originally six members of the family that move into the house together. Maggie L. Walker and her husband Armstead, their two sons, Russell E.T. Walker and Melvin DeWitt Walker, their foster daughter, Margaret \"Polly\" Anderson, and Mrs. Walker's mother, Elizabeth Mitchell.<br /> <br /> Throughout the 1900s and 1910s, the Walker family continued to change the house adding furnishings and making more minor changes, such as adding a pressed tin ceiling in the dining room. The family also changed through this time as well, growing in number as both sons would marry, with Russell marrying Harriet \"Hattie\" Naomi Frazier in 1912 and Russell would marry Ethel B. Robinson in 1919. Polly would also marry a man named Maurice Payne and all three of the married couples would continue to reside in the home with Mrs. Walker and her husband Armstead, and her mother Elizabeth. The Walker family would continue to grow as as both Russell and Melvin each have a daughter and son before 1920 and Melvin would have two more daughters in the early 1920s to bring a total of four grandchildren into the home by 1924.<br /> <br /> As the Walker family grew in numbers, so did the house, as Mrs. Walker decided through the 1920s to add rooms onto the house to suit a larger family. One of the main additions added to the home would be when the side porch on the west side is transformed into an interior room. This new interior room would be known by Mrs. Walker's grandchildren as Melvin's Den, as Melvin Walker would use this room to host his friends and guests for games of poker or relaxing music nights using an electric victrola located in the room.  <br /> <br /> The larger of the additions that would take place at the Walker home during the 1920s would be a large addition of many rooms on the back-side of the home on both the second and ground floor. Added to the rear of the house, these rooms on the bottom floor would serve a variety of purposes for the family, such as a room with three sinks and a stove to do laundry, a bathroom, which the first floor lacked before the addition, and also a bedroom use by Polly and Maurice. The second floor of the addition added several rooms used mostly by Melvin's side of the family, including a bedroom for Melvin and Ethel, their two daughters, Mamie Evelyn and Elizabeth, and a sleeping porch used by their son, Armstead.<br /> <br /> One of the last major changes to the structure of the home would be added in 1928 when an elevator is added onto the rear most room of the house. Earlier in her life, Mrs. Walker was diagnosed with diabetes and it will take a toll on her life. By the beginning of 1928, she experiences weakness in her legs that makes walking difficult. She first adopts a set of leg braces, and while they were cumbersome, they helped to stave of the coming paralysis. Mrs. Walker took action as her condition developed and employed Charles T. Russell to design the elevator, as he had also designed her additions and also several of the buildings for the Independent Order of St. Luke. Finally finished between March 17th and March 24th, 1928. <h4>The House After Maggie L. Walker</h4> Maggie L. Walker continued to live in 110½ E. Leigh Street with her family until she passed away December 15th, 1934. Initially, the home would come under the ownership of Melvin Walker, Mrs. Walker's only surviving son. Melvin only owned the house for less than a year as he passes away in 1935. Shortly after this happens, Hattie NF Walker, Russell's widow, would gain ownership of the home and continued to live there with her daughter, Maggie Laura Walker and Polly. Hattie would follow in Mrs. Walker's footsteps by becoming the Right Worthy Grand Secretary for the Independent Order of St. Luke in 1937. When Hattie Walker becomes owner of the home, she makes it her mission to keep the house as Mrs. Walker wanted it, so she keeps many of the furniture and objects Mrs. Walker collected during his time in the home. She thought that the best way to keep Mrs. Walker's memory alive is to keep the house as she intended. For more than 30 years Hattie Walker preserved the home with the dream of turning it into a museum to honor the legacy of her mother-in-law, Maggie L. Walker. While Hattie Walker would pass away in 1974, her dream of turning the home into a museum was realized through her daughter, Maggie Laura Walker, when she sold it to the National Park Service in 1979 where it is still preserved as part of the Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site.",
            "audioDescription": "The Maggie L. Walker Historic Home is a two-story red brick building located on Leigh St. in Jackson Ward. The front porch is raised off street level and is surrounded by Greek style columns with a tiled floor. It is covered by a green and white awning and has two entrances, a main double-door entrance and a smaller side entrance once used as an office entrance. The front of the house on the second floor is an enclosed sunporch overlooking Leigh Street. The home and garage combined take up nearly all of the available space in the lot so very little room lies between the home and the buildings next door. There are 28 rooms inside the home, consisting of several bedrooms, a kitchen, dining room, library, den, laundry room and parlor. The interior of the home is decorated with artifacts from Mrs. Walker's life including art work, books, furniture and pictures of friends and family.",

Attached to the front of the restroom building is the campground registration board, two vertical framed boxes divided into rows of individual square sections. Each square is numbered and corresponds to a campsite. Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with a slot for dropping one of two registration payment receipts into an individual square. Low and to the right of the registration boards is a brown box with a lid holding campground registration envelopes. Standing in front of the board is a 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing the envelope with payment. On the face of the cannister, at the top, is a slot for slipping in the envelope.

A black and white drawing on the left shows a man leading two mules up a trail between forested mountain slopes. The man wears a brimmed hat, white shirt, and black pants. Bundles wrapped in cloth and rope are strapped across the back of each mule. Text reads, The Staircase. This area was first called the staircase in the 1890 diaries of the O’Neil Expedition. A “staircase” was the only possible route up certain slopes. On the way to map and explore the Olympic interior, O’Neil’s party cut zig-zag trails up ridges, felled trees against cliffsides and covered the logs with brush and dirt to create a stair-like path for pack mules. Today the name Staircase describes the rapids one mile upstream. Below the text is a map of the Olympic Peninsula with the blue Strait of Juan de Fuca to the north, and the blue Pacific Ocean to the west. On the peninsula, the text, You Are Here, marks your location along the O’Neil party’s route which is illustrated by a black dashed line that heads north to the Quinault River, bears west along the river, then turns south",

            "audioDescription": "The Beaumont Cabin. 3 minutes A concrete walkway encircles the cabin. The log cabin is a square building of weathered logs with interlocking dovetailed corners and a roof of weathered wood shingles covered in moss. On the front of the cabin, as you face the building, is a screen door offset to the right. To the left of the door is a window with six glass panes, three over three. On the right side of the cabin, a grey stone chimney rises up the wall from the ground level to about a foot above the roof line. The chimney is bottle shaped – wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. To the right of the door is a sign with a sepia toned photographic head-to-waist portrait of Elliott Beaumont. He has a white moustache and long white beard and appears happy as he looks at the camera. He wears a dark brimmed, rounded-crown straw hat, a black coat, vest and shirt. Rolled white papers protrude out from an inside coat pocket. Text to the right of the portrait reads, The Beaumont Cabin This log cabin was built in 1887 about a mile south of here by Mr. And Mrs. Elliott Beaumont as a home while “proving up” on a 160-acre Government homestead. They lived in this cabin for almost 40 years. The cabin was donated by Mr. Don Newman to the Clallam County Historical Society to be used as an exhibit of pioneer life on the Olympic Peninsula. It was moved from the original site on this property in 1962 by members of the society. They have restored the cabin with representative furnishings of the pioneer period 1850-1900. To the left of the cabin in the grass, is a low-to-the ground concrete platform upon which is a large bell and train whistle. The gold-colored metal bell is flared at the bottom and slimmer at the top and is suspended in a somewhat circular yoke. The train whistle sits atop the bell and is a tall, dark green metal cylinder with a cap at the top and two semicircular openings at the bottom. Text on a brass plague affixed to the front of the platform reads, Baldwin Locomotive whistle and bell. Lyon and Hill’s Train Number 4, hauled first load logs, Sol Duc Valley to Port Angeles, 1926. To Clallam County Historical Society from Harry LeGear, 1970.",

Hispano settlers who arrived from New Mexico in the 1860s and ’70s brought social and cultural traditions that had changed very little from the time their ancestors arrived from Spain.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ea9bd3-1bcd-47ae-86cd-04571a602de3}{228}\" paraid=\"671671473\">Between 1902 and 1929, the church building served as the meeting hall, for los hermanos of the Sociedad de Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno, also known as the Penitente Brotherhood. A lay religious society, the Pentitente Brotherhood developed in New Mexico to fill the gap left when Mexico expelled Spanish priests in the early 1800s. Often misunderstood or suppressed early on, chapters consisted primarily of Hispanic males who participated in rituals and observances which included prayer, processions, and penitential devotions, including Holy Week re-enactments of the Passion.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ea9bd3-1bcd-47ae-86cd-04571a602de3}{248}\" paraid=\"1390984093\">Our Lady of Guadalupe Church provided a central social and cultural gathering place for the residents around Medina Plaza. The church was the focus of Hispano community life and the location of many important community events including baptisms, marriages, funerals, celebrations, and feasts. Sermons at the church were typically given in Spanish, but by the late 1940s English was more commonly used.

It functioned as a jail for soldiers who had violated military laws and regulations and as a shelter for the guards who played a vital role in the fort's protection and security. The duties of the guards included patrolling the fort, enforcing the rules and watching prisoners.<br /> <br /> Discipline at any post of the 1800s was strict; punishments were harsh and often cruel. Punishments ranged from reduction in rank, stoppage of pay, and confinement in the guardhouse for minor offenses, to \"bucking and gagging,\" \"spread eagle,\" standing on a barrel, confinement in a choke box or the solitary cells, mounting the wooden horse, and even wearing iron collars or balls and chains.<br /> <br /> One soldier at a different post wrote that the United States Army had \"acquired a very odious notoriety for the diabolically inhuman treatment of the enlisted men by their officers\" Men were kicked, cuffed, cursed, and even mauled without cause, as suited \"the caprice or anger\" of the officers. Although laws existed to protect the soldiers, they were loosely enforced.</p> <h3>Guard Room</h3> <p>Quarters for the guard adjoined the prison section, because one of the duties of the guard detail was to provide prison security. The chief furnishings in the guardroom would have included benches, shelves, and a platform bed for the men resting between assignments. When a soldier was assigned to guard duty, he was assigned for twenty-four hours straight. He would generally patrol for two hours then rest for four hours, patrol for two hours, then rest for four hours and so on throughout the twenty-four hour period. During the four hour rest period, if the guard wished to lay down and rest, he would have had to do so on the platform bed. But he would've had the option of laying down on the bed only during the day. At night, he could neither sleep nor lay down under any circumstances.<br /> <br /> <br /> Weapon racks probably were common also, along with tables and benches. Fireplaces or stoves would have provided heat, and generally the guard claimed extra candles because of their need for nighttime lighting. Since the guard was the first line of attack against fire, leather buckets would have been readily at hand.</p> <h3>Cells</h3> <p>Each guardhouse had an area set aside for light and dark cells, which were reserved for the worst offenders - soldiers who refused to obey orders, had delirium tremens, were riotous, or perhaps were mentally disturbed. The light cells had small openings in or above the doors admitting some light and air. Dark cells had solid doors, and ventilation was provided by openings in the rear wall or by shafts. Cells were unheated and without sanitary facilities. Buckets served the latter purpose. Since many guardhouses were built of stone, like Fort Scott's, the cell areas were cold and damp. Although the surgeons at the garrisons around the country worried about the foul air, it was not until years after the Civil War that conditions improved for those in confinement.</p> <h3>Prison Room</h3> <p>Prisoners with light sentences were placed in the prison room. This usually was a large room with adequate ventilation but unheated. There seems to have been no furnishings in the room. The men brought their blankets and slept on the floor. One soldier, during a stay in different military guardhouse , indicated he preferred the cells to sleeping in the prison room with the other inmates.</p> <h3>Officer's Room</h3> <p>The officer of the guard directed the activities of the guards on his watch. Officers rotated into this role every 24 hours along with guard mounting or the changing of the guard. His duties included frequent roll calls, being present for the relief of sentries every two hours, and oversight of the noncommissioned officers who had direct supervision of the guards. He would be responsible for delivering the countersign or password to the sentries, treatment of prisoners, and responding to the guards when they challenged someone leaving or coming on to the grounds of the fort without authorization. He used a room in the guardhouse as temporary quarters while on duty. In this room, he kept details of prisoners and sentences on his watch, and prepared a record of his tour of duty. Because of the complexity and importance of the job, only experienced officers were assigned this duty.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The reconstructed one-story stone guardhouse has a sloping gable roof with its wide porch overhang supported by 4 wide stone pillars. There are two doors facing the parade ground and 4 shuttered windows-2 each on the sides of the building. These windows, as well as the transoms above each door, are barred both vertically and horizontally on the interior. 4 smaller windows are visible near the top of the building. There is a one-sided wheelchair ramp in front of the leftmost door leading to the guard room.Also of interest are a covered barrel and a wood horse, or sawbuck, standing in the yard to the left of the guardhouse. The barrel is 3 feet high and the sawbuck is 6 feet high and 7 feet long at its widest point. Please take care when approaching the building as you will need to step up from the concrete walkway onto the building's stone porch, which measures 10 feet deep.27B. First wall panel191 wordsA wall panel to your right just inside the 17-by-15-foot guard room features a black-and-white drawing of the guardhouse yard, where a uniformed sentry stands watch over three prisoners enduring punishment. One prisoner stands at attention atop a barrel, the second stands at attention while holding a log on his right shoulder, and the third sits atop a tall sawbuck with his hands behind his back, ostensibly tied. Text on this panel reads:\"Strict Rules, Harsh Punishments. It was a rare soldier who was not, at some time, punished for some infraction of the rules. Punishment for minor offenses included reduction in rank, stoppage of pay, or confinement in the guard house. Punishment for more severe crimes ranged from mounting a wood horse (\"sawbuck\"), carrying a log, standing on a barrel, carrying a ball and chain, flogging, to solitary confinement. \"So that soldiers would not seek time in the guard house as a respite from the daily routine, the cells were made barely habitable. Neither bedding nor sanitary facilities-other than a bucket-were provided. Post Surgeons often commented in their regular reports on the cold and damp of the cells.\"â€ƒ27C. Second wall panel 188 wordsA second panel to the right of the door leading to the cells features three guards sitting at a table under the room's only window while three other men sleep on a wood bed resembling a sloping pallet spanning the length of the opposite wall. A sentry, with his rifle shouldered, stands outside the door to the prisoner cells. Text on this panel reads:\"Guard Duty. Soldiers never welcomed the twenty-four hour stretch of guard duty that came about every fifth day. Half of the duty section was required to be under arms and on sentry post, regardless of the weather. The other half had to remain fully dressed with all of their accouterments and ready to respond to any emergency. \"'Guard mounting,' an impressive ceremony, took place each morning with the inspection of the new guard. Soldiers turned out with clothing, arms and equipment in the best order, for the soldier who presented the best appearance was selected as the commanding officer's orderly. Rivalry was keen for this duty because the winner was excused from guard duty and had the opportunity to sleep in his own bunk.\"27D. Guard Room161 wordsAs measured in the doorway, the guardhouse walls are 19 inches thick. The exterior door is 2 inches thick, and the cell doors are 4 inches thick. All doors have iron bolted locks. All interior walls are white-washed stone. The floors throughout the building are also stone. Spanning the length of the guard room's right wall is a wood bed measuring 15 feet long by nearly 6 Â½ feet deep. This shared sleeping surface, which lacks both mattresses and pillows, measures approximately 3 feet high at the head, sloping down to 2 Â½ feet high at the foot. The only other furniture in the room is a table and bench placed under the window on the room's left wall. Hanging on a peg rack mounted on the wall to the left of the window are two leather fire buckets with handles. A woodstove fills the room's rear left corner. An empty rifle rack stands to the right of the front door. 27E. Prison room and cells237 wordsAs you pass through the thick interior door leading to the cells, you will be standing in an inner room, or vestibule, measuring 16 Â½ feet long by 3 Â½ feet wide. The wood doors to three small cells are directly in front of you; a larger prison room is located at the end of this narrow space on your right and is enclosed behind a barred door with a locked bolt measuring a full foot long and one inch in diameter.The prison room measures approximately 12-by-16-foot and is empty but for one bucket, a small bench, a three-legged stool, one set each of leg irons and wrist irons, plus two balls and chains. There are two barred windows in the room, one measuring approximately 3 feet wide by 6 feet high; the other, located near the ceiling, measuring about 6 inches high by 6 inches wide.Of the three cell doors, only the one on the far right is open.

            "audioDescription": "The Hawksbill Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken from the summit of the trail that shows lush green foliage, the blue haze of the mountains in the distance, and a gray, cloudy sky overhead. The text reads, \"We All Live Downwind...of the things we make and use. What will you see from Hawksbill summit today? Shenandoah sits downwind from major cities and industry, sources of pollution that impair the Park's air quality. Air pollution, especially in summer, can obscure the view from the Park's high points, including the highest peak, Hawskbill - at 4,051 feet. Shenandoah's scientists, as well as all of us, must work together to reduce pollution and preserve Shenandoah's beautiful views.\" The photograph on the lower left is the Shenandoah salamander. This close-up of the head and front half of its body shows the brownish, moist body, large dark eyes, and the distinctive orange/yellow stripe down the length of its back. The picture captures the salamander on a bed of lush green foliage. The text reads, \"Here and Only Here: The Shenandoah salamander - a rare and endangered species found only in this Park - has never existed anywhere else in the world! It can only live in certain environments, such as the relatively cool, moist, high elevation of Hawksbill Mountain. This small creature has been listed as Federally Endangered even though its range lies entirely within a National Park. The salamander faces many threats - acid deposition, climate change, and human use of the Park, which can be very disruptive to the places it lives. Scientists are working to better understand and protect the Shenandoah salamander.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Hawksbill Summit and Observation Platform. The longer loop trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line . The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: A.T. - Hawksbill Loop, 2.9 mile circuit, moderate, 2 hour hiking time, 860-foot elevation gain. At the north end of the parking lot, take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.). At the trail post, turn left onto the A.T. south. Continue on the A.T. south to the trail post indicating Salamander Trail. Go left onto the blue-blazed Salamander Trail and follow to the summit. Descend via the blue-blazed Lower Hawksbill Trail to the starting point.\" The shorter round trip trail is marked in purple on the map. \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #2: Lower Hawksbill - 1.7 mile round trip, easiest, 1.25 hours hiking time, 690-foot elevation gain. Ascend from this point via the Lower Hawksbill Trail to the summit. Retrace your steps to return to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\" A Hiking Difficulty Scale reads: \"Easiest - A hike that is generally suitable for anyone who enjoys walking. Mostly level or with a slight incline. Generally less than 3 miles. Moderate - A moderate hike generally suitable for novice hikers seeking a bit of a challenge. The terrain will involve a moderate incline and may have some steeper sections. Generally 3 to 5 miles. Moderately Strenuous - Generally challenging for an unconditioned person. The terrain will involve a steady and often steep incline. Generally 5 to 8 miles. Strenuous - Will challenge most hikers. The hike will generally be longer and steeper, but may be deemed strenuous because of the elevation gain. Generally 7 to 10 miles. Very Strenuous - Only well-conditioned and well-prepared hikers should attempt. Generally long and steep, and may include rock scrambling, stream crossings, and other challenging terrain. Generally 8 miles and over.\"",

            "audioDescription": "The Hawksbill Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken from the summit of the trail that shows lush green foliage, the blue haze of the mountains in the distance, and a gray, cloudy sky overhead. The text reads, \"We All Live Downwind...of the things we make and use. What will you see from Hawksbill summit today? Shenandoah sits downwind from major cities and industry, sources of pollution that impair the Park's air quality. Air pollution, especially in summer, can obscure the view from the Park's high points, including the highest peak, Hawskbill - at 4,051 feet. Shenandoah's scientists, as well as all of us, must work together to reduce pollution and preserve Shenandoah's beautiful views.\" The photograph on the lower left is the Shenandoah salamander. This close-up of the head and front half of its body shows the brownish, moist body, large dark eyes, and the distinctive orange/yellow stripe down the length of its back. The picture captures the salamander on a bed of lush green foliage. The text reads, \"Here and Only Here: The Shenandoah salamander - a rare and endangered species found only in this Park - has never existed anywhere else in the world! It can only live in certain environments, such as the relatively cool, moist, high elevation of Hawksbill Mountain. This small creature has been listed as Federally Endangered even though its range lies entirely within a National Park. The salamander faces many threats - acid deposition, climate change, and human use of the Park, which can be very disruptive to the places it lives. Scientists are working to better understand and protect the Shenandoah salamander.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Hawksbill Summit and Observation Platform. The longer loop trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line . The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: A.T. - Hawksbill Loop, 2.9 mile circuit, moderate, 2 hour hiking time, 860-foot elevation gain. At the north end of the parking lot, take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.). At the trail post, turn left onto the A.T. south. Continue on the A.T. south to the trail post indicating Salamander Trail. Go left onto the blue-blazed Salamander Trail and follow to the summit. Descend via the blue-blazed Lower Hawksbill Trail to the starting point.\" The shorter round trip trail is marked in purple on the map. \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #2: Lower Hawksbill - 1.7 mile round trip, easiest, 1.25 hours hiking time, 690-foot elevation gain. Ascend from this point via the Lower Hawksbill Trail to the summit. Retrace your steps to return to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\" A Hiking Difficulty Scale reads: \"Easiest - A hike that is generally suitable for anyone who enjoys walking. Mostly level or with a slight incline. Generally less than 3 miles. Moderate - A moderate hike generally suitable for novice hikers seeking a bit of a challenge. The terrain will involve a moderate incline and may have some steeper sections. Generally 3 to 5 miles. Moderately Strenuous - Generally challenging for an unconditioned person. The terrain will involve a steady and often steep incline. Generally 5 to 8 miles. Strenuous - Will challenge most hikers. The hike will generally be longer and steeper, but may be deemed strenuous because of the elevation gain. Generally 7 to 10 miles. Very Strenuous - Only well-conditioned and well-prepared hikers should attempt. Generally long and steep, and may include rock scrambling, stream crossings, and other challenging terrain. Generally 8 miles and over.\"",

            "audioDescription": "21B. Exterior (Building and Cistern)118 wordsThe exterior of this reconstructed 2-story Enlisted Infantry Barracks features white clapboard siding, a gable roof with one brick chimney on each end, and a wide central staircase leading to a second-story veranda with six round columns. A wide stone porch spans the width of the building's facade at ground level where there are also six large square stone columns supporting the veranda above. A double-sided wheelchair ramp flanks the restroom entrance door in the building's center just behind the staircase. Located in the grass toward the left rear corner of the barracks is a circular stone cistern, or water tank, measuring 9 feet in diameter. The approximately 2-foot-high cistern is capped with a slab of dark stone. 21C. Restrooms79 wordsAs you step inside the door marked \"Restrooms\" in the center of the building, two restrooms and two drinking fountains are located on the wall on your the right. The door to the women's room is about 4 feet in from the doorway, followed by a wheelchair-accessible drinking fountain, a regular-height drinking fountain, and then the men's room about 2 Â½ feet beyond the last fountain. Note that motion-activated lights illuminate both this 5-by-24-foot vestibule and the restroom interiors.21D. First wall panel437 wordsPlease note the two panels hung on the long wall across from the restrooms. The first panel features black-and-white drawings of American Indians by artist George Catlin. These drawings are of Clermont, the head-chief of the Osages; Clermont's wife and child; Black Dog, well-known to all Army officers and traders; the distinguished warrior Tal-lee; and three braves. Text on this panel reads:\"The Osage: A Once Powerful People. Before the European settlement of North America, the Osage Indians occupied land in what is now Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. In 1845 the Osage were confined to a reservation southwest of Fort Scott and by 1872 they had been moved to a different reservation in the Oklahoma Territory. Living along the Osage River, the Osage named themselves \"Children of the middle waters.\" They numbered about 6,000 in 1850 and were considered to be very religious, excellent hunters and fierce warriors.\" More text on the panel tells us: \"Painter of the Osage. In 1834, artist George Catlin stopped at Fort Gibson (present day Oklahoma) on one of his trips throughout the west, to paint portraits and scenes of the Osage Indians. The following are excerpts from his journal:\"I have been industriously at work with my brush and pen, recording the looks and deeds of the Osages, who inhabit the country on the north and west. Their chief place of trade is with the sutlers at this post (Fort Gibson); and they are constantly more or less encamped about the garrison. The Osages have been formerly, and until quite recently, a powerful and warlike, tribe; carry their arms fearlessly through all of these realms; and ready to cope with foes of any kind that they were liable to meet. At present, the case is quite different; they have been repeatedly moved and jostled along and reduced by every war and every move. The small-pox has taken its share of them so that their decline has been very rapid, bringing them to the mere handful that now exists.\" More text follows:\"Memories of the Osage. Charles W. Goodlander described the following Osage activities which occurred in Fort Scott between 1858 and 1860: \"When I came to Fort Scott (1858); the Osage Indian tribe was located at Osage Mission, now St. Paul (Kansas), some 38 miles southwest from Fort Scott. The summer of '58, members of that tribe used to come to Fort Scott to sell their ponies and robes and do their trading. Several times during the years 1858 and 1860, the Osages came and gave us their Indian dances on the fort parade (ground), which is now called the Plaza.\"21E. Second wall panel260 wordsThe second panel features a black-and-white drawing of 10 soldiers standing at attention in front of the infantry barracks. They hold their muskets high as a commanding officer inspects their ranks. Text on this panel reads:\"Always the Infantry. Between 1842 and 1853, the U.S. Infantry functioned as Fort Scott's permanent military garrison. While the dragoons were frequently detailed away from the fort on patrols, escort duty or expeditions, a detachment of infantry was always here.\"Additional text includes Barracks, Drill and Discipline, followed by a list of observations by Colonel George Grogan, who conducted an inspection of Fort Scott on July 8, 1844. Excerpts from Colonel Grogan's report include:\"State and condition of quarters: The Infantry are in temporary huts, but they will soon be moved to the quarters preparing for them. \"Appearance under Arms: I have been particularly pleased with the whole manner and bearing of this command. \"Discipline: The discipline of the Post is good, in truth I have visited no garrison which in this respect has impressed me more favorably. \"Instru",

Powder Magazine HS-17-Exterior and lightning rod<br />162 words<br />The exterior walls of the octagonal Powder Magazine are red brick with a nearly 2-foot-high gray stone foundation. Each of the building's eight sides are 8 feet wide and are separated by concrete corner columns measuring 1 Â½ feet wide; the building's domed roof is also made of concrete. <br />The building also features one heavy 3-foot-wide wood door and three side window openings, or ports, protected by wood shutters with metal hinges, bolts, and locks. Each port measures approximately 3-foot square and is topped by a horizontal 6-pane glass transom window, which adds another 1 Â½ feet in height. The transoms also have shutters that open upward; these are located in the building's interior.<br />Located in the grass about 3 feet off the concrete path to the left of the powder magazine as you face its entrance is an approximately 35-foot-high pole, or lightning rod. The wood pole is 10 inches in diameter with a slim metal rod jutting from its top.<br />24B. Interior intro and wall panel<br />266 words<br />Please take care when stepping through the powder magazine doorway, which has a slanted wood sill measuring 5 inches high. You will then encounter an area of wood flooring approximately 3 Â½ feet wide by 2 Â½ feet deep; beyond this area, you will step into the building's circular interior, which is 12 feet in diameter. <br />A wall panel just to your right as you enter the circular area features a black-and-white drawing of four men working inside the magazine. The 2 privates in the foreground each hold one ammunitions barrel, while the two officers behind them inspect a small crate. Below this larger drawing are renderings of a long, thin port-fire, small bullet-sized cartridges, a cylindrical metal canister with a clip on one end and a cylindrical solid shot. The shot is nearly identical to the canister in diameter and length but has a rounded end. Text on this panel reads: <br />\"Power Magazine. Gunpowder and prepared ammunition were stored here in the magazine. Its design and use centered on safety. The walls are several bricks thick. The wood paneling and flooring are fastened with copper nails to prevent sparks. <br />\"Regulations specified that the magazine be opened three days each week to air the building in order to help keep the powder dry.<br />\"The Ordnance Sergeant oversaw the diverse components of weaponry. At Fort Scott he had charge of two structures: the ordnance storehouse gun shed (located within the headquarters building) and the magazine. The gun shed housed weapons, tools, harness supplies and other metallic, non-explosive stores. The magazine contained powder, cartridges, port-fires and explosive projectiles.\"<br />24C. Interior<br />163 words<br />The magazine's walls are covered with vertical wood paneling painted white, the planks ranging from 4 to 8 inches in width. Above the nearly 9-foot-high wood section is a circular brick wall which continues into a domed brick ceiling. The window sills, which are located about 3 feet above the floor, are 2 feet deep, indicating the thickness of the building's walls. Several round wood disks the size of quarters represent the large copper nails that once fastened the wide wood floorboards below your feet.<br />On either side of a 3-foot-wide clearance in the center of the magazine is a pyramid stack of several wood barrels-piled 3 high on the left and 2 high on the right. Each barrel measures 16 inches in diameter; they are labeled either \"cannon, rifle, or musket.\" Beyond the barrels and flanking the window straight ahead of you are several dozen rectangular boxes stacked chest high. These are marked either \"port-fires\" or \"carbine, buck and ball cart.\" <br />",

He conducted all the inventory even down to the last nail. Nothing could be added or removed without his approval. If something went astray, that responsibility fell on to the quartermaster himself.</p> <h3>Issue Room</h3> <p>From the issue room, the army issued rations, uniforms, and tools. Soldiers would check out and return tools daily. Fatigue uniforms were issued once a year; dress uniforms were replace d every 3 years. There was a partition in the wall to separate this room from the commissary room, in order to prevent soldiers from pilfering goods as they came by.</p> <h3>Commissary and Quartermaster Storerooms</h3> <p>The largest rooms in the building were designed for the commissary and quartermaster storerooms. . Normally these rooms were in separate buildings at larger posts, but at Fort Scott, both of these were combined into the same building. Wagons would bring coffee, sugar, salt, molasses, flour, bacon, salted pork/salted beef, whiskey, vinegar, candles, and soap all to be stored in the commissary storeroom. Upon the quartermaster request, whiskey, vinegar, candles and soap were stored in the basement to keep from deteriorating, during summer heat.<br /> <br /> In the quartermaster storeroom, located behind the barrier, the army stored paint, window glass, nails and other supplies used in construction.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "18A. Quartermaster Storehouse (HS-12)-Exterior196 wordsThe exterior of the restored Quartermaster Storehouse features white clapboard siding, a gable roof, and one brick chimney located toward the roof's left end as you face the building from the parade ground. The building has one story with a loft above.There are three doors and 8 windows on both sides-the parade ground side and the building's rear side. All but two doors and most of the windows are covered with wood painted white. There are also several barred windows in the building's stone foundation. There are three raised loading docks, or platforms, on both the front and rear sides of the building. Each platform measures approximately 4 by 8 feet. The 4 platforms on the ends are supported by 3-feet-high stone pillars and hold several wood barrels of various sizes; the platforms in the middle have been left bare and are furnished with white wood handrails. They are accessible by wood stairs starting at ground level. You may enter the building from either side by stepping through the open doorways off these middle platforms. Please take care when climbing the short sets of stairs leading to the platforms as they may be slippery.18B. Interior intro and first wall panel296 wordsThe rooms available for viewing in the Quartermaster Storehouse include the Quartermaster Office, the Quartermaster Storeroom, the Commissary Storeroom, the Issue Room, and the basement. If you enter the building from the parade ground, you will encounter the Quartermaster Office first. The building's rear entrance takes you to the Issue Room, where there are 3 wall panels with information about the quartermaster's activities and responsibilities at the fort. The unfurnished 14-by-14-foot Issue Room can be accessed from either the Commissary Storeroom or by entering through the middle exterior door at the rear of the building. A panel on the left-hand wall just inside the room's exterior door features a black-and-white drawing of several men at work constructing a long stone building. Approximately two-thirds of the building and only one roof section have been completed. Text on the panel reads:\"Captain Thomas Swords. One of the ablest quartermasters on the frontier, Capt. Thomas Swords had attended West Point where he received training in architecture and engineering. Prior to being assigned to Fort Scott, he had also served as Assistant Quartermaster at Fort Leavenworth in the 1830s, where he became experienced in building design and construction. \"In the four years he served at Fort Scott, Captain Swords designed and had constructed four sets of officers' quarters, three barracks, the hospital, the guardhouse, the well canopy, the magazine, the stables, both the ordnance and post headquarters and the quartermaster warehouse. His plans featured porches to provide shelter from the torrid summers of the plains, large windows for light and air, plastered walls and graceful stairways. Despite restrictions on hiring, Swords obtained civilian brick layers, plasterers and a stone cutter to help finish the buildings.\"In 1846 General Kearney promoted Captain Swords to Quartermaster of the Army of the West.\"18C. Second wall panel216 wordsThe next panel features a black-and-white drawing of two men delivering supplies to the Quartermaster, who stands beside several barrels and crates on a rear loading dock. One man lifts a large barrel from a horse-drawn wagon while the Quartermaster makes notes in a ledger. Text on the panel reads: \"Up the Missouri-Down to Fort Scott. Supplies were normally shipped from St. Louis to Fort Leavenworth by steamboat. They were transferred then to wagons drawn by horses, mules or oxen and transported south to Forth Scott by the military road. \"The Quartermaster supervised the blacksmith shop and bought new animals as they were needed. In 1844, prices for sound horses ranged from $65 for a chestnut to $45 for a black, bay or gray. \"The animals required a great deal of feed. Settlers in the area bid for the contracts to supply Fort Scott with the hay, corn and oats needed by the post animals. In 1842, Daniel Waldo delivered 12,000 bushels of corn to the fort at 29 Â¾ cents per bushel. \"Five years later, the Mexican War brought two companies of volunteers to the fort for the winter.

Called the \"backbone of the army,\" the infantry soldiers, marching into combat on foot, formed the core of the army's fighting forces. Many were dismayed to learn upon arrival at Fort Scott that they were to be used as a glorified labor force. Using tools such as the adze and broadax, the infantry hand hewed the beams used to build this and other fort structures. Several complained they had not joined the army to build houses.<br /> <br /> This situation was not unique to Fort Scott however. General Zachary Taylor stated, \"The ax, pick, saw, and trowel have become more the implement of the American soldier than the cannon, musket, or sword\"<br /> <br /> Today, this reconstructed infantry barracks houses a theater and museum exhibits. The 23 minute movie and the interactive exhibits inside provide a good orientation to the site's history. An elevator provides access to the second floor for the mobility impaired.</p> <h3>Site Movie</h3> <p>The 23 minute movie, Dreams and Dilemmas: Fort Scott and the Growth of a Nation, was produced in 2009. It provides an introduction to the site's history and covers events Fort Scott was involved in from 1842-1873, one of the most critical eras of our nation's history. During that era, the nation acquired vast territory, expanded rapidly westward, and was torn apart by Civil War. Soldiers and civilians at Fort Scott witnessed and participated in these events.<br /> <br /> The movie is played in the upstairs auditorium and can be started by pushing the button below the screen. The movie is captioned for the hearing impaired. Devices that provide assistive listening and audio description for the movie are available at the visitor center.</p> <h3>Exhbits</h3> <p>Exhibits about the site's history can be seen on both floors of this building. Displays on the first floor include maps, artifacts, and interpretive panels that tell the story of Fort Scott and its soldiers during the 1840s.<br /> <br /> On the second floor, visitors can view interactive exhibits addressing Bleeding Kansas and the Civil War. As visitors walk through the exhibit, they hear the stories of six different characters who provide diverse perspectives on the turbulent events of the time. Characters share their stories through a series of short video snippets, all of which are captioned for the hearing impaired.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The exterior architecture of the reconstructed 2-story Enlisted Infantry Barracks features white clapboard siding, a wide stone porch spanning the building's width at ground level, and one 13-foot-wide central staircase with railings leading to a second-story veranda with 6 round columns. At ground level, there are also six large square stone pillars supporting the veranda. Two brick chimneys-one on each end-jut out from the building's gable roof.<br />You may enter the building on the ground level by stepping through the door marked \"exhibit\" located to the right of the staircase. There is a two-sided wheelchair ramp-4 feet wide with railings on both sides.<br /><br />The building's first floor contains several exhibits as well as restrooms and 2 drinking fountains. Another exhibit and a large theater space where you can watch the short film about Fort Scott are located on the second floor. The upstairs rooms can be reached by either stairs or an elevator. <br />As you enter the building, the restrooms and drinking fountains are located in an approximately 8-foot-square vestibule located immediately to your right. Once inside the vestibule, the wheelchair-accessible drinking fountain is located approximately 3 feet in on the wall to your right; a regular-height drinking fountain is to its left. The door to the men's room is approximately 3 feet in on the vestibule's left wall, and the women's room door is straight ahead of you. Both restrooms are wheelchair accessible.<br />A small sign located on the freestanding exhibit wall directly in front of the entrance reads: \"To conserve energy, this structure is equipped with motion detectors that will turn the overhead and exhibit lights on for a period of 6 minutes.\"<br /><br />There is one exhibit on the building's second floor, located to your left at the top of the stairs. If you take the elevator, the exhibit entrance will be at an angle across the wide upstairs hall. The title of this exhibit is \"The Fight Over Freedom!\" [Audio description for this exhibit provided by another contractor] <br />There are two entrances to the 20-by-30-foot theater room, both on the same wall as the elevator. As you face the elevator, enter the door to its right, where you can start the film by pressing a green button, 1 Â½-inch-square, on the wall directly on your right. The button, which is located to the right of the movie screen, is located about 9 Â½ feet into the room and about 3 Â½ feet off the floor. There are 5 rows of chairs facing the screen, with ample space at the rear of the theater for wheelchairs. <br />The 23-minute film, entitled \"Fort Scott and the Growth of a Nation,\" is audio-described. Hand-held devices that allow access to the audio description are available at the Visitor Center. A caption box measuring 3 Â½-feet-long and 8 inches high is mounted to the wall under the screen; bright yellow captions appear on the box's solid black background<br />",

            "audioDescription": "The Upper Hawksbill Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken at the summit of the trail that shows the gnarled tree and shrub growth between exposed boulders in these harsh conditions. The text reads, \"Hunkering Down: It's harsher - colder, icier, windier - up high, and to adapt, trees and shrubs on Hawksbill hug the warmer-than-air ground and grow gnarled, at a wedge-like angle. They've had to be tough to adapt to harsher conditions on this summit. But adaptation is stressful, so they are fragile - tread lightly. The balsam firs and red spruce you see on Hawskbill summit are boreal, or northern, trees; they thrive in New England-like climates. These species were more widespread in the Blue Ridge Mountains in the last ice age, but now that the climate is warmer, they have retreated to a few high-elevation spots, like Hawksbill.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a beautiful blue cerulean warbler on a a bare gray tree branch. The text reads, \"The Times They Are A-changin': Change may be the only constant, but in regards to climate, some change is natural and some is not. The retreat of these cold loving plants as the last ice ice segued into warmer times was organic - unrelated to any workings of humans. The same is not true of what we face today. Climate change over the past century owes much to humans and our waste-emitting cars and industry. Climate change begets other changes that affect sensitive animal and plant life. The cerulean warbler, whose numbers have decreased by 70%, depends on the delicately timed, weather driven balance of insect emergence. Reducing carbon emissions can't come too soon.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Hawksbill Summit and Observation Platform. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: Upper Hawksbill; 2.1 mile round trip, easiest, 1.5 hours hiking time, 520-foot elevation gain. Take Upper Hawksbill Trail to Byrds Nest 2 Shelter and continue on road, following signs to the summit. From the summit, retrace your steps to return to the starting point. Camping is not allowed on Hawksbill summit. Byrds Nest 2 Shelter is for day use only.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitor centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\" A Hiking Difficulty Scale reads: \"Easiest - A hike that is generally suitable for anyone who enjoys walking. Mostly level or with a slight incline. Generally less than 3 miles. Moderate - A moderate hike generally suitable for novice hikers seeking a bit of a challenge. The terrain will involve a moderate incline and may have some steeper sections. Generally 3 to 5 miles. Moderately Strenuous - Generally challenging for an unconditioned person. The terrain will involve a steady and often steep incline. Generally 5 to 8 miles. Strenuous - Will challenge most hikers. The hike will generally be longer and steeper, but may be deemed strenuous because of the elevation gain. Generally 7 to 10 miles. Very Strenuous - Only well-conditioned and well-prepared hikers should attempt. Generally long and steep, and may include rock scrambling, stream crossings, and other challenging terrain. Generally 8 miles and over.\"",

From Fort Algernourne, the first militarized structure at Point Comfort, to Fort Monroe National Monument, the museum shares over 400 years of history. The roles and uses of casemates varied over time. Casemates were constructed as gun positions but also used to house soldiers, store weapons and ammunition, and hold prisoners – including <i>Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, </i>also known as Chief Black Hawk, in 1833. Jefferson Davis was also imprisoned at Fort Monroe held in Casemate No. 2 after his May 1865 capture in Georgia. In June 1951, the Casemate Museum opened as a one room museum, but has since expanded. Today you will learn about the American Indian presence on site; the first English colonists who landed upon Virginia soil in 1607; seacoast fortifications dating back to 1609 and Fort Algernourne; the Endicott Battery Era; the American Civil War and Major General Benjamin Butler’s “Contraband Decision”; military and civilian life; and other history distinct to Point Comfort and Fort Monroe.",

Four three-story duplexes were built along officers' row, with two sets of quarters in each building. Typically, an officer and his family occupied half of one of these buildings. If the officer was a bachelor, he might share his quarters with other bachelors. Each of these quarters had two bedrooms, a dining room, and parlor for entertainment, a morning or sitting room and a kitchen.</p> <h3>Morning or Sitting Room</h3> <p>The sitting room was an informal parlor, so to speak, where the officer and his wife would have spent private time. Breakfast and lunch would generally be served here. The officer and his wife would have used this room to pursue leisurely pursuits such as watercolor, sewing and reading. This was for private time only, guests would generally not be brought down here.</p> <h3>Kitchen</h3> <p>The kitchen is where servants prepared meals for the officers. Being from the upper class, officers and their wives had servants to perform the household chores of cooking and cleaning. Particularly in the wintertime, the servant might have slept in the kitchen adjacent to the fireplace which would have provided warmth. In the 1840s, the servants were often African American slaves. At that time, officers from the North and the South owned slaves. The pans are made of cast iron and would have been used in open hearth cooking. The metal box in front of the fireplace was called a bird oven used to roast quails, duck, pheasant or other game birds that the officers would have hunted in the area.</p> <h3>Parlor</h3> <p>The parlor was for formal entertaining and social gatherings. After dinners, the ladies would go to the parlor to socialize while the officers would meet in another room to smoke and to discuss military business and politics. Afterward they would all meet in the parlor for games and entertainment. The room is furnished with a lamp that was state of the art for it's time. It gave off 360 degrees of illumination as opposed to other lamps that just shone light in one direction.</p> <h3>Dining Room</h3> <p>The dining table and elegant \"Millennial\" china reflect the elegant lifestyle enjoyed by the officer and his wife. Officers often entertained guests here, the room was for formal dinner parties attended by other officers and their families and traveling guests, if they were of the appropriate social class, might also attend.</p> <h3>Master Bedroom</h3> <p>The master bedroom was a room of comfort. Beds with high posts and other elegant furnishings reflected an upper class Victorian lifestyle. Often several different types of mattresses (e.g. straw mattresses, hair mattresses, and feather beds) were layered to provide comfort. Yet the beds on the frontier likely would be light weight to facilitate travel, as officers were frequently reassigned to other posts. Located on the third floor, the bedroom window overlooked the parade ground, providing the officer with a commanding view of the fort.</p> <h3>Guest Bedroom</h3> <p>If an officer and his wife had children they would generally sleep in here adjacent to the master bedroom. Education of the children was a must among the officer class, tutoring/schooling of the children likely took place in this room. Sometimes a sergeant or corporal, non commissioned officer, would be hired as the tutor. If there were no children this room could be for friends or guests who came to visit.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Officers' Quarters No. 1 (HS-1)-Exterior111 wordsThe exterior architecture of the restored 3-story Officers' Quarters No. 1 building features white clapboard siding, a wide stone porch spanning the building's width at ground level, and two wide staircases on each end of the facade leading to a second-story veranda with seven round columns. Two brick chimneys-one on the parade ground side, or facade, and the other on the building's rear side-jut out from the center of the building's gable roof. The facade-side chimney is flanked by one dormer window on each side. At ground level, there are also six large square stone pillars supporting the veranda. The staircase on the left is roped off to visitors.10B. Interior intro and first wall panel258 wordsThere are 6 furnished rooms available for viewing inside the officer's quarters, 2 on each of the building's 3 floors. All rooms are blocked to visitor access by 4-foot-high glass partitions. You are invited to enter the building through the first-floor \"exhibit\" door on the facade's right side.A wall panel on the left as you enter the building features a black-and-white drawing of the building's sitting room, where a woman in a long checkered dress sits writing a letter at a small table. Her husband--an officer-leans against the fireplace mantle behind her; he studies a paper in his hand. Text on the panel reads:\"Letters From the Frontier. During the 19th Century, military officers enjoyed writing letters to their families, friends and fellow officers. The following quotations are from the personal letters of Captain Thomas Swords and his wife, Charlotte, which describe life at Fort Scott in the 1840s.\"The first two quotations from the captain and his wife read: \"Fort Scott. November 26, 1842. You of course have heard all about our delightful post here, and we are going to make it the crack post of the frontier, even ahead of [Fort] Leavenworth. Capt. Thomas Swords\"\"Recreation. August 7, 1843. Our time is mostly passed in reading; within a few days there has been a considerable addition to the library. When the books become irksome, we ride, fish, and walk, collect all the pretty flowers we see and try to become botanist; the flowers here far surpass those of Leavenworth in fragrance. Charlotte Swords\"10C. Sitting room154 wordsThe 12-by-18-foot officer's morning, or sitting, room is located to the right of the wall panel. Placed in the center of the white-painted room in front of the fireplace is a square wood table surrounded by 4 wood chairs with rush seats. The table holds playing cards, as well as two china cups and saucers. Other furniture in the room includes two upholstered chairs-a rocking chair and an occasional chair with wood foot stool-as well as several tables. One table, placed against the left-hand wall between the room's two windows, holds a coffee service. A wood bench placed against the right-hand wall holds books, a stack of newspapers and a hat box covered with floral-print paper. A wood-framed mirror is propped above the fireplace mantle. Other items decorating the walls include framed needlework, an Indian spear, and a round pouch made of animal skin. The windows are covered with diaphanous white curtains. 10D. Kitchen175 wordsThe most prominent feature in the 16-by-18-foot kitchen is the large brick fireplace located on the wall directly across from you. Hanging on the wall above the firebox are various iron pans; several iron pots have been placed on the stone hearth, which also holds a cylindrical wood-burning stove. To the right of the fireplace and placed against the wall under one of the room's two windows is a narrow wood rope bed with a trundle. Both beds are covered with hand-pieced quilts. A small table set with cups and plates stands at the foot of the beds under the other window; a highchair joins two additional chairs surrounding the table. Both windows have been left bare. Other furniture in the room includes a wood rocking chair and a low chest holding two large wood bowls. Standing against the room's left-hand wall, both a tall cabinet and six open shelves hold various pottery crocks and porcelain coffee pots, dishes and bowls. A doorway to a small pantry is tucked into the room's back left corner.â€ƒ10E. Second floor intro and sign115 wordsA small sign on the second floor reads: \"Welcome to Captain Swords' Quarters. Officers' Quarters at Fort Scott consisted of six rooms or one-half of a duplex house. This home represents the private residence of Captain and Charlotte Swords who were stationed here from 1842 until 1846. It has been refurnished to illustrate their lifestyle and the social position which officers were expected to maintain.\"The parlor to your left adjoins the dining room. These rooms were not used on a daily basis, but rather for formal entertaining and dinners. Two bedrooms are upstairs with the kitchen and sitting room downstairs. The sitting room was used for informal daily activities, meals, reading, sew",

            "bodyText": "<p>The digging of the well toward the north side of the parade ground received a high priority in the early construction of the fort.. By October 1843 , the quartermaster reported that a 65-foot well had been hand dug \"the whole of it, with the exception of about 5 feet near the surface, having been blasted through successive strata of limestone, slate and coal.\" The well is off centered under the canopy to simplify the drawing of water when soldiers used wagons to haul the water barrels. Neither Swords nor his successors referred to the pillared canopy over the top of the well. They probably avoided mentioning it for fear that the quartermaster general would get \"exercised\" over its elaborate use of materials at a time when supplies were scarce and budgets low. The first reference to the octagonal canopy was a suggestion of its existence in the 1848 plan of the fort, wherein the well was described as being completed. The canopy consists of 8 white columns and a low domed roof that architecturally complemented the magazine on the opposite side of parade. The well canopy is an example of classical Greek architecture. Post Sutler H.T. Wilson purchased the canopy and columns for $28.00 at public auction on April 16, 1855. In 1870 the local paper reported that this well was the deepest in town.</p>",

Well and Canopy (HS-15) <br />151 words<br />The fort's circular stone well measures 8 feet in diameter with an inside opening measuring 5 feet in diameter and approximately 3 feet deep. Its walls are slightly more than 3 feet high and 1 Â½ feet thick. The well stands slightly right of center on an octagonal stone path that measures 8 feet at its widest point to the left of the well and 4 Â½ feet at its narrowest side on the right. Surrounding this stone path is a narrow concrete path, also octagonal in shape.<br />Standing along the outer edges of the stone path are 8 round columns with 2-foot-square wood bases, all painted bright white. The 1 Â½-foot-wide columns support an octagonal domed roof, or canopy. Construction features on the underside of the roof include 6 white-painted timbers-3 radiating out from each side-that meet in the center against one longer timber spanning the canopy's diameter.<br />â€ƒ<br />",

Laundresses lived here and washed the uniforms of the soldiers. Each company was allowed to employ four women as laundresses who were paid a fixed rate by the piece or month. Debts due a laundress were settled on pay day and were given preference over all amounts owed by the soldier except for military indebtedness. Laundresses were subject to Army orders and received quarters, fuel, one daily ration and the medical services of the post surgeon.” The walls of the approximately 14-by-15-foot laundry room are painted white and its wood floor is bare. Two rope clotheslines hung from metal brackets attached to all four walls crisscross at standing height in the center of the room. Other objects include a wood washboard and tub, an ironing board draped with clothing, various baskets and buckets, and a butter churn Placed against the room’s back wall--a small cot covered with a plain white blanket. Also of note are two long cotton dresses hanging on a wood peg rack on the left-hand wall. To the right of the dresses—a small table holding sewing supplies including a spool of thread and some scissors. A wood table holding bowls and a rolling pin stands under the room’s only window, to the right of the fireplace on the right-hand wall.",

In the center of the room is a wood rope bed; its headboard and footboard have short posts adorned with smooth acorn finials. The bed, which is slightly smaller than a modern-day double bed, is covered with an off-white quilt with colorful print fabric blocks. A white cotton bonnet hangs on the right-side footboard post. On the floor to the right of the bed is a small wood baby’s cradle holding a cloth doll. To the left of the bed is an open fireplace. A single wood wheeled toy—a white sheep—sits on the hearth. Other furniture in the room includes a ladder back rocking chair, a dresser, and several small tables, one holding a wash basin and pitcher, another holding a plate, cup, bowl and eating utensils. A couple’s wedding picture hangs on the wall above the bed; gold-striped blue sergeant jackets hang on a wood peg rack on the right-hand wall. There is one window in the room, on the wall to the left of the fireplace. Simple blue-and-white plaid cotton curtains are tied back on one side to let in sunlight.",

Text on a small sign standing on the left approximately 6 feet inside the hall reads: “Mess Hall and Kitchen. Each barracks at Fort Scott had rooms designated as the company mess hall and kitchen. If a separate room was not available for non-commissioned officers mess, a table was reserved for the NCO’s in the company mess. During the 1840s, open hearth cooking was still practiced by army cooks. Provisions were issued to each company by the commissary officer or assistant quartermaster. Mealtime, designated by the Post Commander, was signaled by a bugle call or drumroll.” The walls of the approximately 30-by-22-foot mess hall are painted white and the wood floor is bare. Filling the right side of the room are 4 wood tables, each measuring 10 feet long by 2 ½ feet wide and accompanied by a pair of 5-foot-long benches on each side. More benches are placed against the room’s left-hand wall and under one of two windows on the back wall. Running 15 feet down the length of the left-hand wall, mounted on the wall one above the other, are two wood peg racks. The upper, and much wider, rack is topped at approximately 5 feet off the floor with a foot-deep shelf. The mess hall’s walls are bare of additional decoration with the exception of a half-dozen metal candle sconces placed around the dining area and a small corner cabinet in the room’s back left corner.",

Lack of food would obviously lead to starvation, but also important was the quality of the cooking and the variety of the food. The cast iron kettles and skillets used in open hearth and Dutch oven cooking helped assure that the food was evenly heated and cooked. In theory, the rations of salt beef, salt pork, beans, rice, and vegetables from the garden should have made a palatable soup or stew. However, the quality of the food also depended on the soldier doing the cooking. As this was a rotated duty, the quality varied with the cooking skills of the private on duty that day.",

Placed in the wood bowls or directly on the table are several artificial vegetables including carrots, peppers, potatoes, beets and squash. Standing against the room’s two side walls are open shelves holding tin dishes, handle-less ceramic cups, wood ladles and other cooking tools, as well as several muslin or burlap bags labeled flour, corn meal, beans, coffee beans, sugar, salt, and tea. Other items in the room include several pottery crocks, leather and wood buckets, two large metal wash basins, and—placed on their sides on a small table to the right of the window-- three small barrels with spigots. A black iron tea kettle sits on the fireplace’s wood mantle.",

Placed against the wall on each side of the fireplace is a 2-foot-wide cot used by corporals; a box full of firewood is also placed to the right of fireplace.

They contained the homes of 43 of our downtown residents and more than 100 years of memories. On the evening of May 21, 2021 and into the night, a disastrous fire of yet-unknown causes destroyed this substantial portion of the block. Heroic efforts by community members ensured that residents made it safely out; twelve local units of volunteer firefighters led by Calumet’s own ensured that the fire spread no further.<br /> <br /> The Holman block was built around 1896, replacing a two-story wood frame building housing a watcher, photographer, and grocer. Holman and Williams were grocers. In 1900, they rented the other half of their store to Jewish businessman Izzy Blumenthal, who sold dry goods and clothes. Later, the Holman Block shared space with a gallery for the flourishing medium of photography. ",
            "audioDescription": "The Holman Block is located at the corner of Fifth and Portland streets in downtown Calumet. The building was constructed in 1896 with a wood frame and brick exterior. Originally one building, it was split down the center around 1900 and held many businesses including a photo gallery, salon, hardware and general store, furrier and ladies clothing, and more. This three-story building now has off-white siding but has retained the red and green accents above the windows and top of the flat roof on the Fifth street side. A sign just off center of the roof detail reads “Holman Block Seffie’s 1896.” The first floor was used for shop space while the upper second and third stories were used for dwellings. There are two single door entrances on the first floor off Fifth street and one off Portland Street. A sign on the first floor of the Fifth street side reads “Calumet Laundromat.”",

About one percent would be denied admission for violation of America laws. Watching the clock? Come back and read the legal question sections later if needed. There's only one more stop - it's the Stairs of Separation. When you are ready, walk toward the center stairs on the west side of the Great Hall.</p> <h3>Will You Become A Public Charge?</h3> <p>Any immigrant deemed \"liable to become a public charge\" was denied entry to the United States. To Ellis Island inspectors, this clause (which has been a cornerstone of federal immigration policy since 1882) designated those who appeared unable to support themselves and were therefore likely to become a burden on society. Influenced by American welfare agencies that claimed they were being overwhelmed by requests for aid from impoverished immigrants, the Ellis Island inspectors carefully weighed the prospects of new arrivals, especially those of women and children intending to rejoin husbands and fathers in this country.</p> <h3>Do You Have A Job?</h3> <p>This question posed a dilemma for immigrants. The Alien Contact Labor Law of 1885 excluded all immigrants who came to the United States under contract for work. The law was meant to stop the importation of cheap labor, but was applied even to immigrants who had jobs promised to them through relatives or friends. Immigrants had to convince inspectors that they were able and willing to work and were not \"liable to become public charges, yet they could not admit that they had a job waiting for them.</p> <h3>Are You A Woman Traveling Alone?</h3> <p>Immigration officials detained escorted women and children until their safety was assured once they left Ellis Island. A telegram, letter, or prepaid ticket from waiting relatives was usually required before detained women and children would be sent on their way. Single women could not leave Ellis Island with a man who was not related to them. When a fiance and his intended were reunited at Ellis Island, their marriage was often performed right on the island. Then they were free to leave.</p> <h3>What If You Don't Speak English?</h3> <p>Many immigrants described the Registry Room, which frequently echoed with the sounds of many languages, as a \"Tower of Babel.\" Ellis Island inspections were assisted by interpreters who were fluent in major languages and any number of obscure dialects. The interpreters were rarely stumped, but often they had to try several languages before comprehension would finally light up an immigrant's face.</p>",

On many days, over 5,000 people would file through the space. For most immigrants, this great hall epitomized Ellis Island. It was here that immigrants underwent medical and legal examinations. Here they encountered the complex demands of the immigration laws and an American bureaucracy that could either grant or withhold permission to land in the United States.</p> <h3>Historic Medical Inspection</h3> <p>The medical inspection was the first examination which an immigrant had to pass. The doctors and medical inspectors would look for any signs of illness or contagious diseases. If found, they would mark the immigrant with a chalk mark letter, indicating the suspected illness, and earmarking the immigrant for further examination. The majority of immigrants passed through the medical inspection the same day.</p> <h3>Historic Legal Inspection</h3> <p>Inspectors behind desks asked immigrants their name, home town, occupation, destination, and the amount of money they carried. Those allowed to pass continued downstairs. Those detained for additional legal examination waited for an opportunity to explain further in the Board of Special Inquiry room where their hearing would be held. About one percent would be denied admission for violation of America laws.</p> <h3>Restoration of the Registry Room</h3> <p>The Registry Room has been restored to its appearance in 1918-24, including several original wooden benches. Photographs of the room during other time periods can be seen on the east and west ends of the balcony.<br /> <br /> To learn more, visit the exhibit \"Restoring a Landmark\" on the East side of the third floor.</p>",

Officially known as surgeons, they were in charge of the Ellis Island Hospital and the medical examination of immigrants in a routine procedure called the line inspection. As long lines of immigrants slowly entered Ellis Island's Registry Room, they were examined swiftly and expertly by the doctors for any sign of disease or signs of physical or mental weakness.</p> <h3>The Six Second Exam</h3> <p>U.S. Public Health Service doctors sometimes had only six seconds to scan each immigrant during the line inspection, a rapid, efficient process meant only to detect those who should be held for a more through medical examination. Experienced doctors could recognize the signs of a wide variety of diseases and disabilities. In 1917, the U.S. Public Health Service printed a list of over 60 health conditions - from anemia to varicose veins - that doctors could spot during the brief line inspection.</p>",

The building is a two-story structure with gabled roof and raised foundation. The foundation is made from poor rock while the building is made from red and white Jacobsville sandstone with polished pieces to highlight the corners of the structure and the edges of windows. Arched red brick detail can be seen above the windows and doors. In the early 1990s the building was refurbished into its current use: the Quincy Mine Gift Shop.",

The driveway entrance from Hwy. 41 to the Quincy Mine Hoist Association property leads to the former Quincy Mine Supply Office which is 50 feet from the Highway. The driveway turns to the right and becomes a large parking lot that extends around the supply office foundation and to the south. An accessible ramp leads visitors to a deck on the supply office building that offers views of the tall shaft-rockhouse to the south and the large hoist house to the east. The supply office building is constructed of brown and white sandstone that adds a decorative look to the building. Tall windows with wooden window panes bring light into the building and provide expansive views of the property.",

Lewis named Werner Creek, now called the Clearwater River.</p> <p>We are a small community in the God-given green valley on the southwest side of the Crown of the Continent, the largest intact ecosystem in the continental United States. The local scenery and wildlife along Highway 83 is between the world class Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. Seeley Lake is a never-never land for shutterbugges – they’ll never run out of things to photograph.</p> <p>Relatively few people hold title to the wildlands surrounding Seeley Lake. Although there is enough private land in the valley to accommodate 10,000 (now 2,000) people, the vast majority of the open space is public, dominated by National Forest Land. The forest is dotted with lakes and wetlands throughout the countryside. Grasslands at the southern end of the valley begin the progression of ecotones through mid-elevation mixed tree species up to subalpine higher mountains.</p> <p>Our valley is blessed with an incredibly wide spectrum of biologic diversity. Our ecosystem is influenced by the convergence of maritime from the west, some arctic from the north, Great Plains from the east and high plains from the south.</p> <p>Our wildlife is still wild. The mid to upper portions of the Blackfoot Valley remains one of the few places along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail where one may encounter a grizzly bear. Several noted species of wildlife are in the valley, including several top of the food chain varieties (grizzly bears and gray wolfs). Birders think this is the best area within 100 miles. Avifauna ecosystem niches are spread from elevation ranges of 4000 feet to 8000 feet above sea level — grasslands to subalpine environments. If birds move too fast, enjoy a heaven of wild flowers with colors moving throughout the seasons.</p> <p>Seeley Lake is at the epicenter of wilderness. The Bob Marshall-Great Bear-Scapegoat Wilderness Complex lies just beyond the skyline to the east. The Swan Mountain Wilderness beckons from the northeast. And the Rattlesnake Wilderness touches the southwest corner of the valley. Seeley Lake is only a few hours hike or horseback ride from the wild­erness edge. A primitive road from Jocko Pass links us to the Jocko Valley and Flathead Indian Reservation on the western side.</p> <p><strong>We have plenty of breathtaking experiences.</strong></p> <p>Our scenery is relaxing while many hikes can be breathtaking. Not all who wonder around are lost. They are just looking for rocks. You can find a different outdoor experience every day of the year. If you return to a special summer place when it has four feet of snow, it will be so different you’ll swear you’ve never been there before.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy our relaxing hospitality.</strong></p> <p>Visit like the snow geese enroute to other lands, like the loons that stay as long as they can or our resident ravens.</p> <p>Our people are very accepting and accommodating, respectful of other opinions and preferences. Most are outdoor enthusiasts sharing experiences rather it be motorheads or traveling by shanks mare. Water based recreation opportunities are on lakes and streams, liquid or frozen. People have been snowmobiling here for 40 years and still haven’t run out of new nooks to explore. Newer residents are overwhelmed with choices of places to explore. Lifetime residents accept the fact they can never do it all.</p> <p>Visitors have a choice of accommodations ranging from camping in a primitive environment or with modern conveniences. Select a siwash camp under a tree, developed campground, rent a cabin, stay in a motel, or find a vacation rental. Those who prefer brighter lights can visit for the day from Missoula.</p> <p>Seeley Lake is the regional hub for leisure travel. People here can enjoy the attractions with a one to three hour drive in some of the larger Montana cities — Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls and Kalispell. Those folks are the bulk of our visitors. Those airports can also be starting points for exploring here and beyond Montana.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>In 1804, The Corps of Discovery, a specialized Military Unit, set out under orders from President Thomas Jefferson to explore the Louisiana Purchase. The expedition arrived in present day Montana on April 27, 1805 and on June 13, Captain Meriwether Lewis was witnessing:</p> <blockquote> <p>“…the grandest sight I ever beheld…whin my ears were saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing a little further; I saw the spray arise above the plain like a collumn of smoke . . . which soon began to make a roaring too tremendous to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri…”</p> </blockquote> <p>-Captain Meriwether Lewis</p> <h3>The Great Falls | Ryan Dam</h3> <p>The best view of The Great Falls is done from the highest peak at <a href=\"https://www.visitmt.com/listings/general/recreation-area/ryan-island-park-picnic-area.html\">Ryan Island Park</a>, which is accessed from a suspension bridge across the Missouri River. After traveling a two-lane road that provides views of the expansive high plains and agricultural land, you will arrive at the viewing point of the Great Falls, located at 160 Ryan Dam Road.</p> <p>There are few hints given along the way of the canyon or the river contained at the end of the road. The roar of the falls is best witnessed in the Spring, just like Captain Lewis experienced. The canyon walls show the arduous task of portaging around the Falls that laid ahead of the Expedition. Although Ryan Dam, constructed in 1915, controls the flow of the water over the falls, the enormity of The Great Falls is still impressive. The dam follows the natural break in the landscape that created the falls and was more than 80 feet high when first seen by Captain Lewis. Today, The Great Falls stand 148 feet due to the dam.</p> <h3>Crooked Falls</h3> <p>Upstream 7 miles from the Great Falls, Crooked Falls flows over an irregular shelf, 19 feet high and 300 yards across. Untouched by a dam, and inaccessible by vehicle, Crooked Falls can be witnessed today just as the Expedition saw it in 1805.</p> <h3>Rainbow Falls | Rainbow Dam</h3> <p>Recorded by Captain Lewis as “Beautifull Cascade” in his journal, Rainbow Falls’ “cascade of about fifty feet perpendicular” was untouched when the dam was constructed in 1910. You can see the magnificent Rainbow Falls at 6401 Giant Springs Road.</p> <h3>Colter Falls</h3> <p>A half mile upstream from Rainbow Falls, the smaller, 6 foot Colter Falls could be found. Set behind Rainbow Dam, these falls are now submerged.</p> <h3>Black Eagle Falls | Black Eagle Dam</h3> <p>Nearest to Great Falls’ city limits, Black Eagle Falls are 2.5 miles above Rainbow Falls. At 26 feet high and 600 yards, these falls were the first to be dammed in 1890. From the top of these falls, the confluence of the Missouri River with the Sun River is visible and from the bottom, Black Eagle Memorial Island Park gives you the closest breathtaking vantage possible. These dramatic falls are located at 5401 River Drive North.</p> <h2>The Dams</h2> <h3>Morony Dam</h3> <p>The old town site of Morony still stands and offers a glimpse into where present-day Great Falls almost was. Below Morony Dam is great fishing and a natural spring, Sulphur Springs, accessible by foot or bicycle on River’s Edge Trail.</p> <h3>Cochrane Dam</h3> <p>Cochrane is the newest dam, constructed in 1958, between The Great Falls and Crooked Falls and is only seen along the River’s Edge Trail while walking or biking.</p>",

            "bodyText": "This colonial style cottage home was the former residence of Conrad and Nellie Warren. It was built in 1934 as a wedding gift from Augusta Kohrs to her newlywed grandson and his bride.<br /> <br /> The house was designed, by the New York City architect Lewis W. Welsh as a “country home for city dwellers.” The plans and specifications for the residence featured a beamed ceiling with a craftsman style touch that appealed to Conrad and the modern comforts of electricity, lighting, plumbing, and heating which appealed to Nellie.<br /> <br /> The two were married on May 1, 1934, and quickly departed for a honeymoon on the West Coast. It was noted in the Deer Lodge Silver State Post that “they will return in about a month and will be at home to their friends in their new residence at the Kohrs ranch.” In June, the newlyweds moved in.The Warren residence originally had five rooms – kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, and bath, plus a detached garage. The living room featured a stone fireplace made of rhyolite porphyry (igneous rock like granite) that was collected from the nearby south face of Orofino Mountain. <br /> <br /> The Warren family expanded in 1936 with the birth of their daughter Patricia, and in 1940 with the birth of their son Conrad Kohrs Warren II. With the family’s growth, the residence needed to be enlarged. In 1941, the roof of the house was raised four feet and two bedrooms, and a bath were added to the newly built second floor.<br /> <br /> Conrad worked hard to manage the ranch, while Nellie managed the home. She eventually added a garden, and a chicken coop.  In the 1950’s, Conrad added a workshop/hobby boat house to the west side of residence. The home and other structures were all grouped together and enclosed within a white picket fence. The yard was attractively landscaped and featured a barbeque pit and other conveniences for outdoor living.<br /> <br /> The house was highlighted in the <i>Westerner</i>, magazine in 1947. The author emphasized the Warren residence as a modern ranch home, but also included descriptions of antiques that belonged to Augusta Kohrs who had died in 1945. An appraisal in 1958 described the home as” having a basement, nine rooms, two baths and contains 1,735 square feet of floor space on the lower level alone.”<br /> <br /> The Warren's became advocates for the ranch joining the National Park Service and Nellie is credited with the preservation of much of the Kohrs family papers and furnishings. In 1972 designation for Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site was passed and Conrad gave his wife credit saying, “It was your idea that created the park, a thing of joy for many people, that enriches their lives and will for all time.” Unfortunately, Nellie became ill and died shortly thereafter. Conrad remained living in the home through the 1970s and 1980s and died in the Warren residence in 1993. <br /> <br /> In 2002, the building was converted into the park’s administrative offices.",
            "audioDescription": "The Warren residence is located at 266 Warren Lane. It is a one and one-half-story white building with a red roof. The building has an irregular floor plan and a cross-gable roof. The wood-frame building was built on a 12\" wide poured concrete footing foundation. White stucco covers the exterior walls on the north and east elevation, and white horizontal wood siding covers the south and west elevations, dormers, and front gable end. Red asphalt shingles cover the roof. The north side of the house has an enclosed entrance porch. Other north elevation features include one large picture window, one 16-light wood-sash window with four fixed side lights and eight center lights in an operable casement, and one six-light wood-sash casement window. A nine-light, one panel door is on the south side of the east elevation. Four 16-light wood-sash windows, with operable centers and fixed side lights, also are located on the east elevation; three are on the first floor and one is in the shed dormer. The south elevation interior stucco chimney is topped with terra-cotta chimney pots. On the south elevation there are three 16-light wood-frame windows with operable centers and fixed sidelights, and one nine-light wood-frame, fixed-sash window in the south main gable end. On the west elevation, there are two one-light wood-frame, fixed-sash windows, three 16-light wood-frame windows with operable center and fixed sidelights. The dormer also features two four-light wood casement windows. The garage (HS 61) is attached to the house by a wood-frame breezeway. The breezeway features horizontal beveled wood siding and three fixed-sash wood-frame windows, two with nine lights and one with six lights. Although constructed prior to a 1958 appraisal, the breezeway was not enclosed until ca. 1980s. Rooms within the Warren residence are divided among a partial basement, the main floor, and a second story. The main floor contains an entryway (added in 1956), leading to the living room and the stairwell to the second story. The living room leads to a central hallway that provides access to the kitchen, dining room, den, bathroom, and bedroom. The porch, kitchen, living room, and two bedrooms and bath on the west side were part of the original construction. The dining room and den date to 1941. The upstairs, also completed in 1941, contains a central landing, bathroom, and two bedrooms; ceilings follow the roofline. Fixed furnishings include a stone fireplace and exposed ceiling beams in the living room and built-in dining room corner cupboards. On the main floor, wall-to-wall carpeting covers the original wood flooring. The wood remains exposed on the second story. The original inlaid linoleum in the kitchen and bathrooms has been covered with modern vinyl flooring (date unknown). The original six-panel doors, painted, remain in place. Except for Warren’s den, which is paneled with tongue-and -groove knotty pine, walls and ceilings are plastered. Originally stained, shellacked, and waxed, much of the door and window trim has been painted.",

The 8 foot sculpture was commissioned by the city of Louisville in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s historical trip. It pays homage to the contributions of York, born a slave and the childhood companion of Clark, and his significant role in Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery expedition from 1803 through 1806. The York Statue sits atop the Belvedere, located at the corner of Fifth & Main Streets, overlooking the Ohio River.</p> <p>The following is taken from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/york.htm\">content created by the National Park Service</a>:</p> <p>Little is known about the life of York. He was an enslaved man owned by William Clark, and later became a member of the Corps of Discovery. William Clark inherited York as property when the elder Clark died, and the two were around the same age. York was one of only two members of the original Corps who was married.</p> <p>York is often mentioned in the journals kept by both Lewis and Clark throughout the course of the Expedition. These journal entries indicate that he experienced freedoms that few enslaved people had, though these freedoms would be revoked upon his return to the Clark plantation.</p> <p>The journals indicate that York was allowed to hunt, which was notable because African Americans weren’t generally allowed to handle guns. He became the primary caregiver to Charles Floyd, who died during the Expedition from what is believed to have been appendicitis. He risked his life to save Clark, Sacagawea, and her son when they were caught in a flash flood. York is also credited with being the first African American to have a vote equal to that of a white man. In November 1805 the Corps held a vote to decide where to camp for the winter, and both York and Sacagawea cast votes on that location.<br /> <br /> When the Corps of Discovery returned from the Expedition, each member – except York – received double pay and 320 acres of land. York, on the other hand, returned to slavery. Clark denied York’s initial requests for freedom, recording in 1808 that:</p> <p><em>“I did wish to do well by him. But as he got Such a notion about freedom and his emence Services…I do not think with him, that his Services has been So great/or my Situation would promit me to liberate him.”</em></p> <p>York was finally freed sometime after 1815. With his freedom, Clark gave York a wagon and team of horses, with which York created a hauling business. By 1832, however, Clark told author Washington Irving that York’s business failed, and that he had contracted cholera and died in Tennessee. The location of his burial is unknown.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The All Star Bowling Lane is located in Orangeburg, South Carolina and was the city’s only bowling alley. This local attraction played a pivotal role during the African American Civil Rights movement. Most notably, All Star Bowling Lane was historically connected to the Orangeburg Massacre of 1968. After the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, All Star Bowling Lanes continued operation as a segregated facility. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of color, religion, race, and sexAfrican American community leaders and locals alike pushed for the bowling lane’s desegregation, petitioning the United States Justice Department with little to no success.  The manager of All Star argued that bowling lanes did not fall under the Act’s jurisdiction. Local African Americans maintained that due to All Star having a snack bar, they did indeed qualify for desegregation. Their claims were supported under the interstate commerce provision in the public accommodations section of the Civil Rights Act.<br /> <br /> By February 1968, students from nearby HBCU’s South Carolina State and Claflin University began conducting demonstrations at the site of the bowling lane.  As a way of preventing potential acts of violence, students applied for a permit to march. Their appeal included a list of demands, one of which called for an end to police brutality. However, their appeals for peaceful protest were denied. SC State and Claflin University students held their first protest on February 6<sup>th</sup>, in the form of a sit-in at the All Star snack counter. In response to this, All Star staff called local law enforcement and closed business for the duration of the day. Students returned the following evening and their peaceful protest was immediately circumvented when they were met by arresting officers. Fifteen students were arrested in total, all of whom attended local HBCUs. This triggered an immediate response from the African American community, which invoked a gathering of one-hundred students to the bowling alley site.One-hundred and fifty officers arrived at the scene, attempting to outnumber and deter growing crowds. By the night’s end,several women had been beaten and an officer injured. Roadblocks were placed around the universities by National Guardsman and South Carolina Highway Patrolmen. It was decided that South Carolina State University should be placed on lockdown, and by February 8<sup>th</sup> the campus had been closed. SC State was surrounded by a sea of local officers, National Guardsman, Highway Patrolmen, and agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Students gathered at SC State’s entryway, where they peacefully sang and gathered around a bonfire for warmth. Despite this, nine patrolmen fired on the group of students. Twenty-eight men and women were wounded.. Two South Carolina State students, Samuel Hammond, Henry Smith, and one high school student, Delano Middleton, died from gunshot wounds. This tragedy became known as the “Orangeburg Massacre”.           <br /> <br /> South Carolina Governor Robert McNair maintained that the first shot came from students, and that they had been conducting themselves in a disorderly fashion. McNair specifically placed the blame on Cleveland Sellers, former organizer of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Although Sellers had loosely been involved with All Star sit-ins, he was an Orangeburg resident advocating for African American studies. Ultimately, his residency and plans of promoting Black studies provided Governor McNair with motives for Sellers’ alleged involvement. Therefore, Sellers became the only person connected and charged with inciting protests. The young organizer served a sentence of seven months in the South Carolina State Penitentiary. The officers involved in the fatal shooting were exonerated on all charges during a 1969 trial. After the Orangeburg Massacre, tragedy struck again during the 1970s with mass shootings at both Kent State and Jackson State University. While the Orangeburg Massacre predated those events, it has not received the same level of recognition nationwide. There have been numerous organizational attempts at preserving the All Star Bowling Lane as an historic site. <br /> <br /> In 1996, the All Star Bowling Lanes became individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Center for Creative Partnerships (CCP), of whom Sellers is Board member, has been instrumental in the site's preservation. CCP is dedicated to preserving, protecting and sustaining this significant African American Civil Rights site, seminal in South Carolina civil rights history, and providing an important link to the national movement of civil rights in America. <br /> <br /> All Star Bowling Lane became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\"><b>African American Civil Rights Network</b></a> in June 2021.<br /> <br /> <i>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

            "bodyText": "<p>Charlie’s Place is located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and served as a bustling pillar of business and Black night life. Charlie and Sarah Fitzgerald were the site’s owners and opened the business in 1937. It quickly became a popular stop along the “chitlin” circuit during the Jim Crow era. Chitlin circuits were nightclubs that popular Black artists of the time would perform or frequent. Musical greats such as Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Little Richard, and The Drifters performed at these establishments across the South.  <br /> <br /> The Fitzgeralds owned Charlie’s from the 1930’s into the early 1960’s. Located in the Booker T. Washington neighborhood, and positioned on Carver Street, it sat directly beside the Fitzgeralds’  family home, as well as a small hotel, both of which they owned.Many famous Black musical artists often performed at white-owned luxury hotels closer to the ocean front. However, those establishments usually prohibited Black performers from staying there. Built in 1948, the Fitzgerald Motel served black entertainers who could not stay in whites-only hotels. A few years after the Fitzgerald was built, both the motel and Charlie's Place were listed in the 1953 Green Book Airline Edition. Green Books, formerly known as “Negro Motorist Green Book,” provided Black travelers with a handy guide for safe places for food and lodging across the United States.Despite a growth in Black businesses, the advent of the Green Book and other travel guides, in addition to other initiatives to create safe spaces for African Americans, residents still suffered violent intimidation by white locals and officials.<br /> <br /> On August 26, 1950 members of the Ku Klux Klan held a parade in the “Hill”, the neighborhood where Charlie’s Place was located. Later that day, members of the Klan returned and fired gunshots into the club. This resulted in a number of Black patrons being injured. Charlie Fitzgerald, owner of Charlie’s Place, was found severely beaten. Prominent civil rights attorney, Thurgood Marshall, assisted Mr. Fitzgerald and many of those injured in executing their legal rights. Marshall’s legal representation resulted in the Klansmen being charged, but they were never prosecuted.   <br /> <br /> Charlie’s Place provided Black laborers, professionals, and locals alike a safe space to enjoy themselves after a long day’s work. Like many places in the Deep South affected by Jim Crow, African Americans created spaces for themselves in the face of rampant discrimination. At Charlie’s Place, Black visitors could always expect great music and an escape from the oppressive force of white supremacy, if only briefly. Both Charlie’s Place and the Fitzgerald Motel serve as permanent fixtures of the African American Civil Rights movement in South Carolina. The Fitzgerald Motel and family home were restored by the city of Myrtle Beach.<br /> <br /> Charlie’s Place became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network </a>in June 2021.<i><br /> <br /> The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

            "bodyText": "<p>Modjeska Monteith Simkins was an important leader of African-American public health reform, social reform and the civil rights movement in South Carolina. Born in Columbia, Simkins attended elementary school, high school, and Benedict College and received a bachelor of arts degree in 1921. The same year, she began teaching at Booker T. Washington High School. Because public schools in Columbia did not allow married women to teach, she was asked to resign when she married Andrew Simkins in 1929.</p> <p>In 1931, Simkins entered the field of public health as the Director of Negro Work for the South Carolina Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and became the state's only full-time, statewide African-American public health worker. For decades prior to the 1930s, southern racism and poverty had created an alarming increase in deaths among African Americans due to tuberculosis, pellagra, and other illnesses. By creating alliances with influential white and African-American groups and raising funds, Simkins made a substantial impact on the health of African Americans in South Carolina. It was during this period in Simkin's life that she and her family moved to 2025 Marion Street. Simkins used this late 19th/early 20th-century vernacular house as her residence, office, meeting place, and for lodging of civil rights associates. Simkins' guests included Thurgood Marshall, who stayed here when hotels in the city were closed to African Americans.</p> <p>In 1942 Simkins lost her position with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association--partly due to her increasing involvement with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1939, when the South Carolina NAACP was formed, Simkins was already a member of the executive board of the local Columbia NAACP branch and chair of its program committee. Simkins became one of the founders of the state conference, elected to the first executive board, and the first chair of the state programs committee. In 1941 she was elected Secretary of the state conference--the only woman to serve as an officer. During her tenure as Secretary (1941-1957), her work helped the State move towards racial equality. From 1943 to 1945 she was instrumental in gaining teacher approval and support for teacher equalization lawsuits in Sumter and Columbia, South Carolina. Perhaps her most significant work took place in 1950 with the South Carolina federal court case of <em>Briggs v. Elliott</em>. Working with the Reverend J. A. DeLaine, president of the Clarendon County NAACP, Simkins helped write the declaration for the school lawsuit that asked for the equalization of Clarenden County black and white schools. The Clarenden County case was eventually reworked to become one of several individual cases set up to directly challenge the “separate but equal” doctrine in the Supreme Court case of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brvb/index.htm\">Brown v. Board of Education</a> in Topeka in 1954. Because her activism was at times controversial, her life and home became targets. An unknown person shot at her house during the time she was active with the NAACP, and she was accused of subversive activities and investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House Un-American Activities Committee.</p> <p>Simkins was able to serve in leadership positions that were traditionally unavailable to women in the civil rights movement. In 1981 she was honored by a coalition of civil rights groups, who established an endowment in her name to provide income for activists working for the causes of the underprivileged. Hundreds of people attended a memorial service following her death on April 5, 1992, and Judge Matthew J. Perry stated, “she probably will be remembered as a woman who challenged everyone. She challenged the white political leadership of the state to do what was fair and equitable among all people and she challenged black citizens to stand up and demand their rightful place in the state and the nation.”<br /> <br /> The Modjeska Simikins House was added to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in June 2021.<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

            "bodyText": "<p>Mosquito Beach Historic District is located on the South side of Sol Legare Island in Charleston, South Carolina. The historic district affectionately gained its name during the mid-1950s, due to insects collecting near the tidal creek. Mosquito Beach Historic District was originally part of an island plantation owned by Solomon Legare during the antebellum period (1797-1878). Sol Legare Island parallels the coastline of Folly Beach, and stretches approximately 2.5 miles. The island split into farming lots after the Civil War, with Black farmers serving as prominent buyers. Residency of Black farmers transformed the former island plantation into a freedmen settlement. Until the first decades of the twentieth century, Mosquito Beach was mostly undeveloped land. The farmlands extended from King Flats Creek to Holland Island Creek. The “strip” portion of the beach occupied three Black-owned farming lots prior to the 1920’s. Nelson Left, Edward Green, and John Lafayette were the lot’s owners and represented hundreds of other Black farming families in the area.<br /> <br /> Between 1920 and 1940, Mosquito Beach became a thriving tourist destination. Despite Jim Crow segregation, African Americans found ways to enjoy their leisure time. Mosquito Beach became one of six Black beaches in Charleston. Black residents were barred from visiting nearby Folly Beach, which was considered “whites-only.” In July 1963, eight young African American men “waded-in” the waters of Folly Beach. After exiting the waters, those eight young men were chased down the street by a white mob. The Folly Beach wade‐in was part of a larger movement of protests by the Black community in Charleston. There were a number of direct action campaigns, which included silent marches throughout the downtown area, sit‐ins in the city’s commercial districts and other wade‐ins at municipal swimming facilities.<br /> <br /> The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 presented African Americans with legal backing to challenge de jure segregation. However, white Charlestonians chose to directly, and at times, violently, oppose it. One week after the signing, a group of Black men from Mosquito Beach visited Folly Beach and were \"surrounded immediately by a group of several hundred white persons,\" who followed the men to the water’s edge before police escorted them back to their cars. Russel Roper, of Mosquito Beach, recalled being harassed by whites spewing abusive language and aggressive behavior. One of Roper’s friends suffered a blow to the face by someone in the white mob. Upon Roper and friends returning to Mosquito Beach, they found their vehicle gas tanks had all been filled with sand.<br /> <br /> In the early 1970’s, many of the Charleston Beaches started to desegregate. While there were numerous business and attractions in operation, this ultimately lessened the usual throngs of Black visitors to Mosquito Beach. In an attempt to increase business, locals Donald and Frances Roper built a juke joint and dance club. However, the gradual integration of Charleston’s beaches had a profound impact on the beach. Despite the changing of times, Mosquito Beach has remained a pillar of Black innovation and excellence. <br /> <br /> The Mosquito Beach Historic District became part of the the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network </a>June 2021.<br /> <br /> <i>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

Retaining its original altar, communion rail, pews, and light fixtures the church is one of only a few unaltered religious interiors in Charleston, especially from the Victorian period. The brick Gothic church with its tall steeple replaced an earlier 1872 church badly damaged by the 1886 earthquake. Today Emanuel is the oldest AME church in the South, and houses the oldest Black congregation south of Baltimore, Maryland.<br /> <br /> The history of this congregation reflects the development of religious institutions for African Americans in Charleston. Its roots stem from a religious group of both enslaved and free African Americans organized in 1791. In 1816, Black members of Charleston's Methodist Episcopal church withdrew over disputed burial ground, and under the leadership of Morris Brown, formed a separate congregation. The church's 1400 members soon thereafter established themselves as an African Methodist Episcopal church, a denomination formally established in 1816 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Two years later, Brown and other ministers of the church were jailed for violating state and local laws which prohibited religious gatherings of enslaved people and free blacks independent of white supervision.<br /> <br /> In 1822 the church was investigated for its involvement with a planned uprising of enslaved Africans led by Denmark Vesey, one of the church's founders. Vesey was raised in slavery in the Virgin Islands among newly imported Africans. He was the personal servant of slave trader Captain Joseph Vesey, who settled in Charleston in 1783. Denmark remained with him until in 1799, when he was able to purchase his freedom with a winning lottery ticket worth $1500.Vesey became a successful carpenter, especially among Charleston's majority Black population. In 1821, he formulated a plan to win freedom for the enslaved people of the city. The authorities were informed of the plot before it could take place. Three hundred and thirteen alleged participants were arrested, and 35 (including Vesey) were executed. The plot created mass hysteria throughout the Carolinas and the South. Brown, suspected but never convicted of knowledge of the plot, went north to Philadelphia where he eventually became the second bishop of the AME denomination.<br /> <br /> During the Vesey controversy, the AME church was burned. Worship services continued after the church was rebuilt until 1834 when all-Black churches were outlawed. The congregation subsequently met in secret until 1865 when it was formally reorganized, and the name Emanuel was adopted. Today, Mother Emanuel AME Church is one of more than 1400 historically significant buildings within the Charleston Old and Historic District.<br /> <br /> On the evening of June 17, 2015, a man opened fire on a Bible study group inside the church. The shooting left six women and three men dead: Rev. Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Cynthia Hurd, Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Rev. Daniel Simmons, Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor and Susie Jackson. All of the victims killed during this racist attack were African American. President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney, church pastor and South Carolina state senator. The shooting prompted the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State grounds.<br /> <br /> In June 2021, Mother Emanuel AME Church was added to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a>.<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

In order to create sand dunes, there must be a source of sand (in this case, the eroding mountains to the north), wind to move that sand, and a barrier to prevent the sand from being blown farther (the mountains to the south). The conditions at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes are perfect for the creation of dunes, and while individual grains move, and ripples form, the dune field remains.<br /> <br /> These dunes are named for the mesquite tree which grows in abundance in the area. The trees must twist and grow to avoid being buried, and leafless brown trunks are often exposed by the shifting sands. The arrival of spring brings forth a burst of bright green leaves and yellow flowers from the trees’ upper branches. Mesquite bean pods are a traditional food of the Timbisha Shoshone, and the flour from these pods can be purchased in specialty food stores today.  <br /> <br /> Sand dunes provide habitat for many animals, including nocturnal kangaroo rats and sidewinder rattlesnakes. No official trails exist at the dunes, so please watch your step when exploring and do not disturb burrows.  <br /> <br /> The Mesquite Dunes are known for dramatic shadows at sunrise and sunset, as ripples and edges in the dunes stand out in greater contrast. They are also a great place to observe Death Valley’s famous dark night skies. </p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10 AM IN THE SUMMER</span><br /> <br /> <u><strong>Hike to Tallest Dune</strong></u><br /> <strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>2 miles (3.2 km) <br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 1.5 hours<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy/Moderate<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 185 ft (65 m)<br /> <strong>T</strong><strong>rail Type: </strong>No official trail <br /> <strong>Location:</strong> Just east of Stovepipe Wells Village off CA-190<br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Paved lot with pull-through spaces for buses and large RVs<br /> <strong>Closest Restroom: </strong>Vault toilets located in parking lot. Do not leave toilet paper in the dunes.<br /> <strong>Route: </strong>Area open for cross-country exploration; choose your own route to the tallest dune. <br /> <br /> Note: pets are not allowed on the dunes or on any trail in Death Valley National Park, even if carried.

The terrain to your left is steep, with grass and trees. To the left and behind you, the back of the water trail sign is visible. The front of the sign is dark blue, showing the Cuyahoga River Water Trail logo with “Red Lock Vaughn Road.” Underneath the text is a lighter blue area with the number “24.1”—indicating the river mile. Across the river to the left is a flat area on the west bank. The terrain is flat with a downward slope. End Description.",

A few planks that have been restored near the door are straighter and orange brown in color. Further up the trunk, a wooden shutter is attached to the log with two large metal hinges. The shutter is open, with its lower edge propped up on two posts, revealing a square opening cut into the trunk behind it, forming a window. The entrance to the cabin is missing a door. People can enter the front portion of the cabin. The back part is blocked by a wooden railing. Beyond it are Tharp's original old wooden bed, table, and bench.

Then under the leadership of Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth, the church and its leader served as linchpins in the 1961 Freedom Rides and 1963 desegregation efforts in Birmingham. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c3af123-e83a-41c2-be91-de0da6047140}{88}\" paraid=\"780043893\">In 1956, Rev. Shuttlesworth and other ministers formed the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) when the state prohibited the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from operating in Alabama. The Church was one of sixty active members in the ACMHR and served as ACMHR headquarters from 1956-1961. Weekly mass meetings provided an outlet for emotional testimony, soul-lifting music, impassioned preaching, and fundraising. In the face of unspeakable violence and hatred, The Historic Bethel Baptist Church leaned on its faith to fan the flames of a movement that would eventually desegregate one of the most racist cities in the nation. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c3af123-e83a-41c2-be91-de0da6047140}{124}\" paraid=\"1629896257\">White supremacists bombed the Church and parsonage 3 times. One of the bombings took place in 1956 on Christmas night, with Shuttlesworth and his family inside. When Shuttlesworth and his family emerged from the rubble unharmed, he and his followers took this as a sign that God was with them. The next day, as planned, Shuttlesworth, other members of the ACMHR, and over 200 other African Americans rode in the white sections of city buses to protest segregation in transportation. Despite the efforts of white supremacists to stamp out the church-led Movement through intimidation, civil rights activism grew in Birmingham and eventually paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c3af123-e83a-41c2-be91-de0da6047140}{158}\" paraid=\"1626914775\">Today, parishioners attend services in a new church built a block away, but the original church is maintained as a historic site that welcomes visitors and stands as a testament to the accomplishments of the Modern Civil Rights Movement. The historic site, including its guardhouse and parsonage, are National Historic Landmarks. Visitors can sit in the same pews as movement participants and watch a short documentary on the life of Rev. Shuttlesworth and the civil rights movement. A marker outside the building commemorates the spot where white supremacists planted a bomb intended to kill Shuttlesworth as he slept in bed. Tours that wind through the historic buildings and around the grounds help visitors envision what life was like in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the courage it took for a church, a family, and a neighborhood to stand behind a belief that life could and should be better. </p>  <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<h3>The lowest point in North America is a surreal landscape of vast salt flats.</h3>   <p>Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America at 282 ft (86 m) below sea level. The salt flats here cover nearly 200 square miles (518 square km), and are composed mostly of sodium chloride (table salt), along with calcite, gypsum, and borax. <br /> <br /> Stories suggest that Badwater Basin earned its name when a mule belonging to an early surveyor refused to drink from the spring-fed pool near the present-day boardwalk. However, the water here is not truly “bad,” just very salty. Despite this high salinity, many organisms not only survive, but thrive here. The pool is home to an endemic snail naturally found only at this location, and its rim is dotted with salt tolerant plants, including pickleweed. <br /> <br /> Badwater Basin was once the site of the large ancient inland Lake Manly which evaporated tens of thousands of years before the arrival of the 1849er for whom it was named. The lake had no outlet, leading to the accumulation of sediment and salt over time. When the lake eventually evaporated, concentrated salt deposits were left behind. Today, fascinating geometric salt polygons form on the flats as groundwater rises up through these deposits and evaporates.  <br /> <br /> The pool and boardwalk are easily accessible from the parking lot off Badwater Road, but the best views of the salt polygons require an easy 1.5-2 mile (2.4-3.2 km) roundtrip walk out onto the salt flats. Be sure to look up on the cliffs of the Black Mountains to the east; here you will see a sign high above, indicating sea level. Also take a moment to pick out Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range to the west; at 11,049 ft (3, 368 m), this peak is over two miles (3.2 km) above you. Nowhere else in America can you see such a dramatic vertical relief over such a close distance.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10AM IN THE SUMMER</span></strong><br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>1 mile (1.6km) to edge of salt flat<br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 40 minutes<br /> <strong>Dificulty</strong>: Easy <br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> Flat<br /> <strong>Trail Type:</strong> Boardwalk then route, out and back <br /> <strong>Location:</strong> Badwater Road, 30 minutes (17 miles/27km) south of Furnace Creek<br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Paved parking lot with large spaces for RVs and buses<br /> <strong>Closest Restroom</strong>: Vault toilet located in parking lot<br /> <strong>Route:</strong> An ADA accessible ramp leads down to a wooden boardwalk.

            "audioDescription": "A broad, flat valley surrounded by a tall ridge line of mountains to both the west and east. The valley is covered in white salt, which in some areas forms large raised polygon shapes roughly 2-3 feet (0.6-1 meters) in diameter. The outlines of these shapes are approximately 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall. Areas of brown clay dirt ring the edge of the salt-lined valley. A white railed pathway leads to a wooden boardwalk with a sign that reads \"Badwater Basin, 282 feet/85.5 meters below sea level,\" and a ramp down to the salt flats. There is a shallow pool approximately 20 feet (6 meters) in diameter near the boardwalk, with short bushes scattered near its edge.",

            "bodyText": "<p>A wayside exhibit shows an early 1900s view of Boston Mills Road looking west from Boston Store. By this time, Boston was a paper mill town. Boston had first boomed in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-ohio-erie-canal.htm\">canal era</a> by making canal boats. Boston quieted down as canal traffic slowed with the expansion of railroads in the 1850s. It boomed again after a railroad came directly through town with the 1880 opening of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>.<br /> <br /> First, Samuel Dyke bought an existing mill on the west side of the Cuyahoga River adjacent to the tracks. He converted it into a toy marble factory. This business was short lived. Then the Cleveland Akron Bag Company opened in 1902, making roofing paper and paper bag liners. As the paper mill expanded, more workers were needed. Polish and other immigrants moved here from Cleveland to fill the need. Boston had become a mill company town. It stayed that way even after the bag company closed in 1923. Some workers drove the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">towpath</a> to work at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jaite-a-paper-mill-and-company-town.htm\">Jaite Paper Mill</a> to the north.<br /> <br /> The 1900s image shows the Commercial Hotel, which stood where the M.D. Garage is now located. Norman Wise’s grocery store was across the street. A covered bridge crossed the river. Cleveland-Akron Bag Company and its smokestack are visible next to the railroad tracks.<br /> <br /> Visitors can further explore the company town history by crossing the river to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>.</p>",

Behind you is the wide, dry bed of the canal. The street lies to your right. Past the Boston Store on this side of the street is the old M.D. Garage with vintage gas pumps in front. Across the street from that is a small white building which houses the Trail Mix Boston store. From there the street continues over the Cuyahoga River and the train tracks beyond. The graphic panel is titled “Early 1900s Boston, Bag Industry Town.” The bottom has a black and white photograph showing the view down this street in the early 1900s. A two-story building housing the Commercial Hotel stands where the M.D. Garage is now located. The Trail Mix building with the covered porch across the street was Norman Wise’s grocery store. A covered bridge went over the river. On the far side was a long factory building with a tall smoke stack which was the paper bag factory. In the upper right is a 1910 aerial view from the other side of the river. The factory complex fills the lower left corner. The covered bridge is visible toward the right side of the image next to a two-story white building on that side of the river, which was the company store. The caption reads in part, “The factory workers were paid in scrip, which they could redeem only by shopping there.” Text at upper left reads, “Boston’s economy boomed building canal boats. Later it shifted to making toy marbles and then paper. If you had been standing here in the early 1900s, the photo below shows what you would have seen. Across the Cuyahoga River stood the Cleveland Akron Bag Company. The factory employed nearly 200 people, many of them Polish immigrants. The workers made paper flour sacks and roofing paper, which were shipped on the valley’s railroad. The factory survived the Great Flood of 1913 that swept through Boston and devastated communities in several states. When the factory closed in 1923, some employees drove the canal towpath to work at the Jaite Paper Mill.” End of description.",

One of them was Major Jacob Brown. On May 17, 1846, General Zachary Taylor honored Brown by issuing an order officially naming the site Fort Brown. The town that eventually grew up in turn took its name from the fort—Brownsville.<br /> <br /> While visiting this site you can see historical markers and even what is left of one of the fort’s bastions.

Traveling to protest segregation in interstate travel, the bus carrying these activists was ambushed at the Greyhound depot in Anniston. A white mob surrounded the bus, slashed its tires, and pursued the Freedom Riders out onto the highway. <br /> <br /> When the bus tires gave out, the mob firebombed the bus as the Freedom Riders onboard prepared for violence. Trapped on the burning bus, they emerged after an explosion and showed courage and resilence as the mob beat them. The Freedom Riders survived the attack and, within a few hours, made their way to Birmingham via a convoy organized by Reverand Fred Shuttlesworth. Images of the attack made headlines around the nation and the world, drawing significant attention to the Freedom Rider cause.<br /> <br /> Visitors to the Greyhound Bus Burning Site can read interpretive panels and take a quiet moment to reflect on the courage the Freedom Riders showed in the face of violence.

By then it was the shortest route between the coalfields of Tuscarawas County to the south and Cleveland’s ports to the north. For the valley, the historic stations were a lifeline to the outside world. From train stations like these, milk, cheese, grain, and lumber were shipped to the outside world.<br /> <br /> From this point, visitors can get on the <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> or follow the paved path east to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>. Exhibits at the station explore the relationship between the Valley Railway and its rival, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>. The two forms of transportation coexisted for decades because each found its own niche. The railroad carried passengers and heavy freight, like coal and stone. Flour, grain, and other agricultural goods were often shipped on the canal.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Canal Exploration Center Station. 465 words The rail station is a long, rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches are in the middle. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. A grassy area surrounds the structure. On one side an asphalt pathway leads to the parking lot next to the Canal Exploration Center. The tracks are on the other side with a separate wooden platform. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. Your current location is at the second-most northern station. Nearby is a bulletin board case with current news. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Evolving Transportation Systems.” It has black-and-white photographs of a steam locomotive and of a canal boat. Text on the panel explains that the evolution of transportation systems in the 1800s is evident here at the Canal Exploration Center Station. As you walk between this station and the Canal Exploration Center, you will see both the river and a watered-filled section of the canal with a working lock and a towpath. Railroads were slow to reach the valley because of the steep valley walls. Not until the 1870s and the need to reach new sources of coal farther south did people see the value in constructing a railroad. Canal operations continued until the Great Flood of 1913 caused damage too expensive to repair. The other panel is titled “Canal versus Railroad.” Text on the panel states that the Valley Railway made its inaugural trip on January 28, 1880 to an enthusiastic response. It explains that in other areas of the country the arrival of a railroad often produced tensions as one mode of transportation replaced another. However, in the valley, both modes found a niche that only ended when the 1913 flood ended canal operations. At top right is a black and white photograph of a canal boat being pulled by a three-mule team. The boats could only travel as fast as the mules pulling them. Below that is a 1910 photograph of a passenger train steaming over the Cuyahoga River between Boston and Peninsula. Travel time greatly decreased with the arrival of the railroad.

Metal detectors are prohibited.\"<br /><br />Gulf Islands National Seashore. 417 words.<br /><br />This panel is four feet wide and three feet tall. Across the middle is a map showing the various areas of the park. The map includes most of the Mississippi coastline, the Alabama coastline and the westernmost part of the Florida panhandle. Areas included in the park are outlined in green - several off-shore islands near Biloxi, Mississippi and other islands off the Florida coast from Perdido Key in the west to Okaloosa at the eastern end. Park areas on the mainland include Davis Bayou near Biloxi, Fort Barrancas in Pensacola and Naval Live Oaks south of Pensacola.<br /><br />Text on the panel is in both English and Spanish. At the top text reads, <br /><br />\"This national seashore protects our historical heritage and ever-changing features of the Gulf Coast-salt marshes, marine woodlands, sparkling white beaches, and coastal waters. Walk the trails, photograph seashore plants and wildlife, swim and boat in the emerald green waters, learn the stories of early inhabitants, or just relax and enjoy the solitude.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a photograph of a white sandy beach stretching into the distance, wispy dune grass on the right and water at upper left.<br /><br />Text below the map reads, <br /><br /> Gulf Islands National Seashore includes several islands and portions of the mainland. Here you can boat, fish, and swim in the gulf waters. On land the national seashore provides campgrounds, primitive camping areas, and trails that pass through dunes, woodlands, and marshes-habitats of a variety of mammals, reptiles, and birds. For information, exhibits, and bookstores, stop at the visitor centers.\"<br /><br />Across the bottom of the panel are five photographs. Beginning at the left, the first one shows an alligator stretched out on a log in bright sunshine. The label reads, \"Wildlife.\" <br /><br />The next picture shows a group of people looking out over a grassy area surrounded by red brick walls. The back wall has large arched openings into dark spaces behind. In the middle are three uniformed men standing with rifles at their sides. At the right is a man dressed in a park uniform. The label reads, \"Tours.\"<br /><br />The middle photograph shows crooked live oak tree branches dripping with long Spanish moss. The label reads, \"Nature.\"<br /><br />The fourth picture shows three children in swim suits splashing in shallow water. The label reads, \"Recreation.\"<br /><br />The last picture shows a view down a structure made of a series of rounded arches, light coming from openings on the left. The label reads, \"History.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Castillo de San Marcos, in St. Augustine, Florida, serves as the oldest masonry fortification in the United States. Fortifications were built as a defensive wall or barrier to prevent potential attacks. During the height of the modern Civil Rights Movement, St. Augustine was selected in 1964 by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as a target city for civil rights activities. Activists obtained permits from the National Park Service to use the Castillo as a meeting place for demonstrations.<br /> <br /> In early 1963, local members of the NAACP developed a desegregation plan. NAACP leaders Fannie Fullerwood and Elizabeth Hawthorne wrote letters to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. The letter urged Johnson to cancel his trip to dedicating a historic Spanish landmark. Johnson responded, stating that he would not participate in segregated functions. President John F. Kennedy was also the recipient of a letter from the local NAACP in May 1963, advocating against a federal grant of $350,000 intended for the Castillo’s Quadricentennial. All members of the Quadricentennial board were said to be white persons and were unsympathetic to issues facing the Black residents of St. Augustine.<br /> <br /> On June 25, formal demonstrations began with Black teenagers of the NAACP's Youth Council picketing the local Woolworths and the St. Augustine Civic Center. The next day, 25 teenagers conducted sit-ins at Woolworths, McCrory's, and Service Drugs. White community members did not respond well to the peaceful demonstrations. Youth council leader Robert Hayling was depicted as a violent extremist, which garnered direct opposition from Mayor Joseph Shelley. By 1964, the Ku Klux Klan had begun a campaign of violence and intimidation. Shootings, clashes of violence during protests, and chaotic court cases nearly destroying the peaceful strides of the NAACP. Officials of the local NAACP realized that white militants were trying to seize the initiative. It was time to seek help from outside the city of St. Augustine.<br /> <br /> In March of 1964, Robert Hayling and other Black local leaders met with the aides of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the SCLC annual state meeting held in Orlando, Florida. The Black leaders from St. Augustine were able to convince Rev. C.T. Vivian to visit their town and see the conditions for himself. The SCLC watched events unfold in St. Augustine from July, and after visits with Vivian, they decided that their involvement could strengthen the community. The SCLC anticipated starting their St. Augustine campaign during the week of Easter, which gave white Northern college students a chance to participate. The inclusion of whites was an important strategy within itself, showing positive examples of integration. Hosea Williams coordinated the campaign, consisting of sit-ins, marches, meetings, and demonstrations. Each strategy had the common goal of placing a national microscope on years of oppression and convoluted race relations.<br /> <br /> Several of the meetings were held on the grounds of Castillo de San Marcos, for which permits were obtained from the NPS. The national park grounds served as a safe assembly place for activists of all backgrounds. The police department and St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office failed to protect activists. Four of the local Sheriff's deputies were known active Ku Klux Klan members. On national park property, however, local law enforcement would not have authority over the activists. The successes of the movement in St. Augustine helped to convey the importance of passing a sweeping Civil Rights Act, and in July of that same year, The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson.<br /> <br /> The Castillo de San Marcos National Monument in Florida became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in June 2021.<br /> <br /> <i>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements.</i></p>",

Advanced Redoubt was built to protect the Navy Yard and Fort Barrancas from a land-based attack. During the Civil War the Confederates briefly held Fort Barrancas and exchanged gunfire with Federal forces at Fort Pickens.\"At the right side of the panel is a map showing the four forts in the Pensacola area with orange circles showing their firing ranges. The map has the direction north at the bottom. Your current location is at Fort Barrancas, which with the adjacent Spanish Water Battery sits on the shore of the Pensacola Bay at the top of the map (to the south). Fort Pickens is shown on the western end of the island south of the bay with Fort McRee on another island to the west. Firing ranges from these three forts overlap over the entrance to the bay. Advanced Redoubt is directly north of Fort Barrancas, near the bottom of the map. The caption reads, \"Third System Forts. Americans built harbor forts during the Revolutionary War (first system) and another series of forts between 1789 and 1812 (second system).

Each cannon has a crew of eight men in blue uniforms lined up on both sides. One man holds a long pole over the rear of the cannon. Other men in uniform observe the action from the rear.At the left is an illustration of one of the soldiers. He wears a long blue jacket and knee britches with wide red cuffs and red stocking, a three-cornered hat on his head. He holds a long pointed pole with a white string looped over the end. The caption reads, \"A Spanish artilleryman holds a slow match used in firing a cannon.\"At lower right is a drawing of a cannon firing from the wall of a fort on shore at left towards a three-masted ship in the water at the right. A yellow line traces the path of the cannon ball which hits the water near the ship and the bounces up to hit its side.

The station has ample parking and is a primary starting point for train excursions and events.<br /> <br /> Historically, Thornburg Station once stood nearby and served Independence, Ohio. Small train depots were found all along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Cuyahoga Valley Line</a> at every little hamlet of any size. In the early 2000s, the National Park Service built the modern Rockside Station for passengers waiting for the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.<br /> <br /> Visions for a train line through the valley began in the 1850s. Competition and economic slumps delayed its completion until 1880. This became the shortest route between Akron and the coalfields of Tuscarawas County to the south and Cleveland’s ports in the north. For the valley, these train stations were a lifeline to the outside world. They provided passenger service and allowed farmers to ship out their milk, cheese, grain, and lumber. Exhibits inside the station describe the area’s railroad history in more depth.<br /> <br /> From this point, visitors can get on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad or head east over the river to access the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a> and <a href=\"https://cuyahogariverwatertrail.org/\">Cuyahoga River Water Trail</a> at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lock-39-trailhead-information.htm\">Lock 39 Trailhead</a>.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Rockside Station. 470 words The rail station is a long rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end and a small office in the middle. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches sit on either side of the office. The floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. On one side of the station is an asphalt parking lot. On the other side of the parking lot a bridge crosses the river and leads to the towpath. The railroad tracks are on the other side of the station past a wide grassy ditch. Wooden walkways over the ditch at either end of the station provide access to the train platform. If you stand with your back to the parking lot, restrooms are in a separate building at the left end of the station. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end (your current location) to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. At the same end of the station is a glass-covered bulletin board with current information about the train and the park. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Industrial Cleveland.” It has a black and white photograph of Cleveland from 1895 and one of the Standard Oil refinery. Text on the panel explains that by the late 1800s, petroleum refining, steel making, chemical processing, and machine-tool production made the city a thriving economic center. Prominent businessmen served on the Valley Railway’s board of directors. A photograph of Stillman Witt, a partner in a railroad construction company, is to the right of the text. The other panel is titled “Route to the Coalfields” with a photograph of a group of almost 50 miners at the entrance of a mine operated by the Marchesi Coal Company in Tuscarawas County. A railroad map of Ohio from 1873 with a band down the eastern side shows the location of an iron ore belt. Text on the panel explains that the developers of the railway capitalized on the need for a direct rail line between the new fields in Tuscarawas and Stark counties to the south and the industrial centers of Cleveland and Akron.

Some species migrated here, some adapted to or survived the changing climate during the past 10,000 years, but all will need to continue evolving to adapt to this ever-changing environment. Long-term monitoring projects taking place within the monument and nearby wilderness reserves indicate that our climate has begun to change again. Many of the plant and animal species that we associate with the Sonoran Desert are threatened: bighorn sheep, the Spadefoot toad, even our beloved saguaro. How will these species, and others, adapt to survive unforeseen changes? Can they adapt to the changing environment? What new species might move to the monument? What does the future hold for the Sonoran Desert? We are only beginning to understand these questions. This desert is a magnificent living biome with relationships that span the entire space. Plants depend on animals to disperse their seed around the desert by ingestion and digestion or by transport. Animals depend on plants for food and shelter. Even plants depend on other plants for their survival (cacti and nurse trees). Just because you see something dead in the desert, don’t assume that it has no purpose. Death begets life out here in the desert. A dead or dying saguaro may mean that a wood rat or a lizard may take comfort in its shade. The connections all over this incredible land is what makes it the Sonoran Desert.<br /> <br /> We hope you enjoyed your time on this loop drive and that you’ve learned the story of this mysterious Sonoran Desert: that everything is connected and comes full circle, that it is filled with amazing adaptations for survival, that we are just beginning to understand the Sonoran Desert, and that new things are being discovered every day. Keep your eyes and ears open and maybe you’ll discover something new too.<br /> <br /> <i>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” Dr. W. Edwards Deming</i></p>",

McBride’s Grocery served canallers at Lock 32.<br /> <br /> With the opening of the canal, Boston boomed. It grew from a small frontier hamlet to a bustling canal town. In time, stores, a tavern, hotel, blacksmith shop, boatyard, brickyard, lumberyard, broom factory, and warehouses would grow in the village.<br /> <br /> Boston is still a lived-in village, as evidenced by the houses to the west.

            "audioDescription": "Lock 32. 309 words This wayside graphic panel is near the right end of the lock walls, which are all that remain. This end of the lock is partially filled allowing access to the inside where the walls can be felt. Inside, the ground slopes down to the other end of the lock where the ground is marshy and may have standing water and higher vegetation. The left end of the lock has a wooden bridge with railings spanning the width giving closer views of that end. Text on the panel reads, “Boston Booms. The opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal turned Boston, a modest frontier settlement, into a thriving village. Between 1828 and 1836, increasing canal traffic sparked the opening of businesses. They included a blacksmith shop, hotel, tavern, two general stores, boatyard, brickyard, lumber mill, broom factory, and warehouse. McBride’s Grocery served canallers waiting to pass through Lock 32.” The right side of the panel has a black and white photograph of McBride’s Grocery next to Lock 32 with the Boston Store in the distance as the view would have been looking right from your current location. The buildings are white wood-frame with two stories. The lock gate is closed, some water spilling underneath it into the bottom of the lock while the water beyond is at a higher level. An arrow highlights the bare sandstone blocks on the walls of the lock, indicating that the photo was taken before 1905. Along the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile of the stairstep locks from the 968-foot high Portage Summit at Lock 1 at the right end and Lake Erie at 573-foot-elevation at the left end. You are currently at Lock 32 at Boston, to the left of the mid-point. As you explore the lock profile be careful of sharp corners on the stair steps. End of description.",

Geologists recognize this landscape as part of the vast basin and range province that includes much of the interior west of the United States and parts of northwestern Mexico as well.<br />  <br /> To understand how this landscape was formed, we need to go back in time 25 million years when forces deep within the earth pulled the land apart. As the land was stretched, vast areas sank and formed broad valleys. These valleys were intersected by uplifted blocks of land, creating today’s Ajo Range. Other mountain chains appeared one after the other as far as the eye could see. As the surface was slowly deformed, volcanoes, lava flows, and falling volcanic ash accumulated and resulted in the colorful layers of rock that are revealed all around you.<br />  <br /> The pink and chocolate-colored rock is rhyolite, formed from solidification of a slow moving, thick lava flow. The light brown or tan rock layers, called tuff, is volcanic ash turned to stone. Over time, the mountains have been worn down and the valleys filled by rock and debris from the powerful effect of water cutting through and carrying away layers of solid rock.</p>",

Bowser was also integral in raising money for the opening of the Richmond Hospital and Training School for Nurses. Her son, Dr. O.B.H. Bowser, who also resided with his family at this home, was a 1901 graduate of the medical school of Howard University. He would help found, along with others, the African American-owned Richmond Hospital and Training School for Nurses which continues over a century later as Bon Secours Richmond Community Hospital.

It even grows on the highest peak in the monument, Mount Ajo, which is on your left and marks the boundary between the monument and the Tohono O’odham Nation. Archeologists have discovered agave-roasting pits in the high country of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. These pits are associated with the Hohokam who cultivated agave for ceremonial purposes. Why were the Hohokam at the top of the Ajo Range?<br /> <br /> Archeologists believe that the Hohokam tradition was to move to the high country canyons after fall harvest in the valleys. Canyons, like Estes Canyon below and to your left, served as winter homes and watchmen were located at the tops of mountains to guard the community against raiders. The Tohono O’odham also used these canyons as winter homes. They were likely hunting mammals. These higher elevations also afforded a chance to catch more water. Snow and rain were more likely in the mountains. It is easy to imagine the people of the past making their way on foot up that steep rugged hill. The promise of water in dependable tinajas, natural catchments in the rock that hold rain water, were their only source of water for miles. The Hohokam and the Tohono O’odham adapted to the desert by moving biannually to find food and water. Their migratory routes were always associated with tinajas, springs or other water sources and are still visible in the monument today.<br /> <br /> Ahead is Estes Canyon, the midpoint of the Ajo Mountain Drive. Here you will find a ramada with picnic tables and restrooms. A loop trail leads into Estes Canyon and then climbs onto a ridge. It returns down through the foothills back to the parking area. Halfway around the loop a short spur trail climbs to Bull Pasture, which early ranchers used for their cattle. From the Bull Pasture Viewpoint hikers have a stunning view of Mount Ajo, the highest peak in the monument at 4,808 feet (1466 m). The trail, including the spur, is a fairly rugged 4.1 miles (6.6 km) round trip, with a total elevation gain of 865 feet (224 m). Ask at the Kris Eggle Visitor Center for more information.",

These mountains are crumbly and bulbous, a result of the slow moving magma that formed into reddish colored rhyolite rock. Organ pipe cacti and saguaros dot the hillsides.",

He worked with the O’odham people, teaching them about cattle grazing and learning human migratory routes in return. Padre Kino’s expedition mapped the region, recording invaluable water sources and ancient pathways. The expedition quickly adapted to the region, learning that trails must be near water, among high mountains and through passes. Without this knowledge, Kino’s expedition and the many people that have come since would surely have perished.<br /> <br /> Many of the maps that Padre Kino created and the names he placed on them are still in use. Looking at a map of the monument today, one can immerse oneself in the history and geology of the region. Bull Pasture gets its name from the monuments’ ranching era; Twin Peaks is named for its double-peaked appearance; Pinkley Peak commemorates Frank Pinkley, Superintendent of Southwestern National Monuments 1923 – 1940. Behind each name is a story.<br /> <br /> The Diaz Mountains are named for Captain Melchior Diaz, leader of a 15 member group in the Coronado expedition 1539-1542. In January 1541, when the expedition was close to here, Diaz suffered a freak accident and was mortally wounded. Diaz’s men had no choice but to abandon any further explorations. During his fourteen months and over 3500 miles of reconnaissance on behalf of the Coronado expedition, Melchior Diaz left a valuable legacy. The information he gathered on the native peoples he encountered offers the modern reader a glimpse into a way of life prior to European contact.",

This plant belongs to the Candlewood Family and is the only representative of this family in the United States. It’s cousin, the boojum tree, grows mainly in Baja California, Mexico, and has been described as looking like an upside down carrot. These plants store water in their roots and stems. In drier times they shed their leaves and resemble long spiny sticks. Once the rain comes they restore just as if there was never a dry spell. Each spring leaves come out and brilliant orange-red flowers bloom at the ends of the stems. These flowers attract hummingbirds to pollinate the plant and are vital to the ocotillo’s survival. The nectar found within each tubular flower is a vital energy source, crucial to the hummingbird’s survival during its long and arduous migration. This mutually beneficial relationship is another example of adaptation to the desert environment.<br /> <br /> These plants are not only beautiful but useful as well.

The fruit is high in carbohydrates and attracts many different herbivores. The mesquite adapted seed dispersal so that when seedpods were eaten in great quantities, they were dispersed across the land. Rabbits, packrats, javelina and coyote all depend on the seasonal seedpods for food. These animals, and others, help to scatter the mesquite seeds across the desert.</p> <p><br /> In the 1500s, missionaries introduced the cow, which allowed for even greater seed dispersal. Cattle no longer range in the monument but the abundance of mesquite serves as a reminder of their presence. Often called the “Tree of Life”, many desert-dwellers owe their survival to the mesquite tree. The seeds were, and still are, ground into flour used for breads. These seeds have more protein than soybeans and were a major food source for the Tohono O’odham.<br /> <br /> Another tree that sustains life in the desert is the palo verde. With its green trunk and branches, the palo verde has a very clever way of conserving moisture. By not having leaves during the hot season, it can photosynthesize and respire (that is to create energy and breathe) through its trunk, thus conserving water.<br /> <br /> The palo verde can also serve as a nurse tree. Saguaro seeds need shelter from a nurse plant such as a creosote or palo verde tree. These plants protect the young cactus from sunburn, torrential floods and the occasional winter frosts. Nurse trees such as the palo verde, mesquite and ironwood even fertilize the young cacti as the trees fix nitrogen from the air into the soil for themselves. The young cactus is “nursed” as it grows up tall and strong, spreading its shallow root system out to collect rain as it falls. This is not good news for the nurse plant. As the cactus roots spread only 3-4 inches below the surface of the soil, what started as a shelter becomes a battlefield for water. The saguaro proves victorious. Many of the monument’s larger saguaros are surrounded by remains of their dead nurse trees.</p>",

They are called chain-fruit because fruit-upon-fruit hang down, creating long chains. The joints of the plant are biologically designed to detach as an animal is walking by within its spiny reach. The spines are barbed and hook into the coat or flesh of the passer-by and the cholla joint is transported to a new location. If the conditions are favorable where it falls, the cholla joint might grow into a new plant. This cactus is sometimes referred to as a “jumping cholla” as the cholla joints seem to jump off the plant and attack unsuspecting passers-by. Reality is they don’t jump; they are just very efficient at picking up a ride. As you can imagine, picking up these hitchhikers is painful. Adapt your habits to the desert by using caution and carrying tweezers to remove any cholla joints when you are out walking.<br /> <br /> You may be surprised to learn that some birds will take up residence in these cacti; the spines prove some defense against desert predators. As you continue, look for cactus wren nests; they resemble football-shaped clumps of weeds with a side hole big enough for the birds to go in and out.</p>",

They get their name because they look fuzzy and cute, but look carefully and you’ll see millions of tiny hooked spines genetically designed to attach to anything that gets too close. These spines are an adaptation to the desert sun; they create shade for the cholla itself, reducing its exposure to the sun. Teddy bear cholla reproduce in the same manner as many chain-fruit cholla; by breaking off joints and rooting them into the ground. This means that all the cacti you see before you may have come from one plant that was dropped off in this area by an animal that brushed by another teddy bear cholla along his path. According to botanists, it is very possible that all the teddy bear cholla in the United States come from a single strain.<br /> <br /> Packrats will take the cholla joints to make a very protective nest called a midden. See if you can find one of these middens. Packrats have been known to make multi-story middens in wood piles or dead cacti. Some very surprising information has been uncovered from these cholla-covered homes. A midden in the Puerto Blanco Mountains records the teddy bear chollas’ arrival here 10,000 years ago! This cactus migrated here when the Sonoran Desert was in its infancy and from the abundance found here at Teddy Bear Pass, it has adapted quite well.</p>",

These adaptations to ephemeral ponds allow the spadefoot to thrive in the Sonoran Desert.<br />  <br /> Have you ever walked across a sandy beach or wash? Its a remarkably tiresome job. The sidewinder is named for its ability to move over loose or unstable sand. This rattlesnake has adapted to living in the Sonoran Desert by moving, or winding, in a way that allows it to move across sandy surfaces quickly and efficiently. This winding movement gives the appearance that the snake is moving sideways.<br />  <br /> Imagine spending up to nine months a year underground to escape the heat! The desert tortoise spends this much of its time below ground, coming out only to eat, drink and mate at dawn and dusk.<br />  <br /> The summer monsoons offer a welcome respite from the dry landscape and tortoises take advantage of these rains, increasing their outside activity.",

            "audioDescription": "(405 words)<br />The Kahlil Gibran Memorial is located on the east side of Massachusetts Avenue NW in the Embassy Row neighborhood of Washington, DC. The memorial park is about four hundred fifty-five yards (415 meters) northwest of Rock Creek. Directly across Massachusetts Avenue to the west is the Winston Churchill Memorial, and across the street to the northwest of the Churchill Memorial is Observatory Circle.<br />The memorial sits on two acres recessed from the sidewalk and along the edge of Woodland-Normanstone Terrace Park, a wooded forest along its western back side.<br />A twenty-five-foot long concrete foot bridge leads from the sidewalk across a shrub and flower-lined grassy area into the memorial. There are no steps in the area and although the backside is at a slight elevation, it is very wheelchair accessible.<br />The foot bridge leads to a circular arrangement of benches, paths, and walls. In the front-center is a three-foot high, fifty-foot long semi-circular gray marble wall with two-foot high curbed front, and adorned with a bronze head of Kahlil Gibran. An ornate star design encircled with a twelve-inch ring of granite adorns the ground in front of the wall and sculpture. The sculptured head emerges from a group of branches, foliage, and two foot-long doves to the right, along the wall. Inscribed on the front of the wall is:<br />KAHLIL GIBRAN<br />Poet Philosopher<br />A sidewalk leads around from either side of the wall and joins a thirty-five-foot wide, circular arrangement of benches at a slightly higher elevation than the marble wall. In the center of the benches is a small pool in the shape of an eight-pointed star, ten feet across. The limestone benches, ten feet long each and three on each side, are inscribed with the details of Gibran's life and quotes from his writings.<br />The plaza floor is designed with granite stars, octagons, and other geometrical shapes. Around the front edge of the upper plaza area is an inscription on the ground that reads:<br />THINK OF ME WHEN YOU SEE THE SUN COMING DOWN TOWARD ITS SETTING<br />SPREADING ITS RED GARMENT UPON THE MOUNTAIN<br />An outer walkway encircles the entire memorial and spans two hundred twenty-five feet around with a three-foot tall stone block outer wall.<br />Bushes and trees hang over the outer area and the forest behind provides an abundance of shade. A grass lawn lines the front of the memorial fountain area and a garden bed sits at its front edge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The large meadows and rolling hills of this gentle piece of high country contrast with peaks and crags of Mineral King destinations.

Possible destinations include: A photo of a grassy meadow. Near the edge, a rustic wood building stands by tall trees that ring the meadow. A line of upright wood posts mark a fence through the field. The caption reads, This is Hockett Meadow, 10.4 miles (or 16.7 kilometers) one way. Elevation: 8,499 feet (or 2,591meters). The trail breaks out of the trees and into this large meadow, where deer graze summer's rich grasses and wildflowers. A photo shows a fast-moving stream through a rocky clearing, surrounded by young sequoia trees. The caption reads, Golden Trout Wilderness in Sequoia National Forest. 18 miles (or 29 kilometers) one way. Elevation: 9,780 feet (or 2,981 meters) at park/forest boundary. South of the national park boundary lies Sequoia National Forest. Different regulations apply; check with a USFS ranger station for more information. A map of the Mineral King area shows our location at the Atwell Hockett Trailhead. The bottom photo is of a large flat meadow circled by conifers. A rustic log cabin with a peaked shingle roof stands in the meadow. Its chimney has a tall capped flue. It is the historic Hockett Meadow Ranger Station. A smaller wood shed is nearby.

            "audioDescription": "The text reads, This trail has three forks that lead, at times steeply, to Mosquito and Eagle Lakes and White Chief Canyon. Watch for fissures and sinkholes due to local karst geology (limestone metamorphosed to a rough marble). Like most park trails, these lead into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include: The top photo shows a tranquil lake with snow and foxtail pines lining its bank, beyond it are towering granite walls. The caption reads, Eagle Lake 3.6 miles (or 5.8 km) one way<br />Elevation: 10,010 feet (or 3,051 m) Eagle lake lies in a cirque, surrounded by towering granitic walls and ancient foxtail pines. Like several other lakes in this area, Eagle Lake has a small dam. The next photo is a reflective lake surrounded by forest. The caption reads, Mosquito Lakes 3.6 miles (or 5.8 km) one way to first lake Elevation: 9,586 feet (or 2,922m) at second lake Forest surrounds Lake #1, the lower lake, there is no camping here. Climb an unmaintained trail to the open upper lakes to camp. A map of the Mineral King area shows our location at the beginning of the Eagle Mosquito trail. The bottom photo is of a valley and cliffs are sprinkled with snow. The caption reads, The upper Mosquito Lakes basin A quote: President Barack Obama, in support of John Krebs Wilderness. \"...we will set (wilderness lands) aside and guard their sanctity for everyone to share.\"",

Behind you is a green meadow.<br /><br />On the panel, a background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of giant sequoia trees against a dark sky.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />What is Good Habitat?<br /><br />What do sequoias need to live long enough to grow this big? This 23-foot-wide (or 7 m) tree and its enormous neighbors give us our first clues. Look around where they are growing.<br /><br />To reproduce and thrive, sequoias need specific conditions: moist soil, open sunny forest, a climate that is not too cold, and bare, ashy ground. Therefore, they also need the natural processes that create those conditions. As you walk this trail, watch for evidence of these processes.<br /><br />An illustration of a circular tree slab with a curvy bark edge. The circle is divided into five sections of photos, like slices of a pie. Clockwise, from 1 o'clock:<br /><br />A photo of a waterfall cascading over large rocks.

There are several mature trees in this view.<br /><br />A caption next to the two prominent smaller sequoias reads,<br /><br />Young Sequoia<br />These \"spire tops,\" about 100 years old and 100 feet (or 30 m) or more tall, are difficult to distinguish because they blend in with other tree species.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Sun Worshipers<br /><br />Look across the meadow for a view of sunbathing sequoias. Young sequoias have branches all the way down their trunks, gathering as much solar energy as they can. Their pointed tops grow quickly toward the sun.<br /><br />As sequoias grow taller, they lose lower branches due to fire or lack of sun. Once the trees rise above the rest of the forest canopy, their pointed crowns round off. Dead tops mark the oldest sequoias. Once mature, they grow no taller, but continue to grow thicker.",

The trunk has been cut across its base, showing the tree's cross section. <br /><br />On the panel, a background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of giant sequoias against a dark sky. An illustration, layered on top of the photo, shows two giant sequoias. The tree on the left has a wide \"Flared Base\", like an overturned fluted glass or trumpet bell. The tree on the right has a \"Typical base\", with just a slight widening at its base.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />Sequoias growing in moist areas often develop flared bases. This adaptation apparently provides greater support in the soft soil. It's similar to standing with your feet wider apart for stability.<br /><br />Notice the bases of other sequoias. They may provide clues about local soil moisture.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Surviving Change<br /><br />This spot is unusually wet for sequoias. It was probably drier here when the trees in front of you began growing. During prolonged droughts, wet meadows like this one often shrink. Sequoias can get started in the drier soil around the edge.<br /><br />However, if the climate turns wet again and the meadow expands, roots get flooded. These giants may not make it. Their roots may drown. The moist soil may be too soft to support large trees, causing them to lean and finally fall. Time will tell.",

In 1937, The CCC Boys tunneled through its trunk. Today cars can drive through this tunnel. <br /><br />A black and white photo of 25 jovial young men posing for a group photo. Some have their hands on their hips or behind their backs. A couple are holding shovels. Many are dressed in brown button up long-sleeved shirts with two breast pockets. Their belted dark trousers are cuffed at the bottom. Most are wearing round canvas hats. Behind the men are a dozen white canvas tents, in two neat rows. A larger white tent is seen behind the lines of tents, with smoke billowing next to it. To the left, is a shrub covered hill with a road running beside it. An old-fashioned Model T style automobile is parked near the road. The caption reads,<br /><br />CCC Boys pose at their camp at Potwisha. <br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Tunnel Log reminds us of the work of young men who struggled to survive The Great Depression in the 1930s. The drive through hole in the log was carved by the \"boys\" of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). <br /><br />The Great Depression left millions unemployed. Congress created the CCC to put young men to work and get paychecks to their families. The CCC worked mostly on public lands, including Sequoia National Park. <br /><br />Despite youth and inexperience, the CCC boys proved remarkable in developing many features of this park and at thousands of other places across the nation. They built roads, trails, buildings, campgrounds, water systems, and more much of which is still used today. <br /><br />A black and white photo of a large fallen sequoia covered with snow laying across a road. An old-fashioned automobile with a hard top with rounded corners and close, rounded fenders. is parked facing the log. The caption reads,<br /><br />When this sequoia fell across the road on December 4, 1937, CCC worker Roy DeVoe of Weldon, California, suggested cutting the tunnel. The tree extended 275 feet long, with a base of 21 feet. <br /><br />A black and white photo of a large fallen sequoia with two old fashioned, Model T style cars parked on the top of the trunk. Several visitors are standing or sitting next to their cars. The caption reads,<br /><br />Auto Log circa 1920s <br /><br />The text explains that in the past it was common to alter natural features to create attractions that drew people to the parks. Today, national parks are valued more for preserving landscapes unchanged.<br /><br /> A photo of curved dirt road with boulders piled up along either side. A very large rock spans between those boulders, creating a bridge across the road. A man stands under the rock for scale. A photo of Tunnel Rock from the 1930s.",

At the start of the path, a large rectangular metal sign on wood posts reads, \"Amphitheatre\" with an arrow pointing to the right. A symbol icon shows a human figure, from the waist up, in the center, with three curved lines radiating out from its waist. A frame with program information is attached to the center of the sign. Along the bottom of the sign are two rectangular panels attached with metal hooks that can swing up to reveal program information. You are surrounded by Buckeye and Live Oak trees. When you reach the Amphitheater area, to the left there is an open dirt area for presentations and a campfire pit on the ground, enclosed by large rocks. On the right is the seating area. Two sets of long benches are angled inward to face the presentation area, creating a \"V\" with a five-foot-wide aisle running down the center. There are three benches on each side of that aisle. Wood posts with lights provide lighting on the path and at the Amphitheater. A metal bear-safe storage box is located at the back of the seating area.",

This is the first stop on a self-guided tour that will take you around the grounds of the estate, past the mansion and outbuildings, and through the gardens. As you walk to the front of the house, you may wonder \"Why is Melrose part of a National Park?\" Simply, because it is one of the best-preserved estates in the Deep South from the mid-1800s. For that reason, it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Melrose helps tell the American stories of an economy based on growing cotton and the world of chattel slavery. </p> <p>This land was once part of a series of Indian villages. The early French settlers called this area “Natchez” after the name of the native people who lived here. As the number of settlers and their enslaved African workers grew, so did disputes with the Natchez. After a series of wars, the Natchez Indians and some Africans rose up against the French in 1729. The French drove the Natchez out of this area and sold many of them into slavery. Over the next 70 years, European countries enticed settlers into the area with offers of large land grants. One early settler, Alexander Moore, bought land on this site in 1790, not long before the region entered the United States as part of the Mississippi Territory. </p> <p>The story of the Melrose estate begins many years later when John McMurran bought part of Moore’s plantation in 1841. By then the land was described as an “old waste cotton field.” McMurran crafted the estate that you see today. By 1860, Melrose was home to John McMurran, his wife Mary Louisa, and their two children. It was also home to twenty-two enslaved people of African descent who worked on the estate. </p> <p>After the Civil War, the McMurrans sold Melrose to Elizabeth and George Malin Davis. They then left it to their daughter Julia and her family. Julia’s son, George Kelly, and his wife, Ethel, moved to Natchez in 1909. They made Melrose a focal point of the Natchez Spring Pilgrimage tours that started in 1932. After Ethel Kelly’s death in 1975, John and Betty Callon purchased and restored the estate. The unique importance of the Natchez story led Congress to create a new national park in 1988. Natchez National Historical Park tells the story of all the peoples of Natchez. The Melrose estate with its land, its historic buildings, and its museum collection, serves as the centerpiece of the park.  </p>",

            "audioDescription": "The View: You are surrounded by large sequoia trees. Their green canopy provides welcome shade. The text explains that the road to Moro Rock is part of the legacy of America's first black national park superintendent. Captain Charles Young, a West Point graduate, commanded the cavalry units of Buffalo Soldiers who were assigned here in 1903. Before there were park rangers, the military guarded national parks. Young's troops were the first African-Americans to do so. In just one summer, he and his men completed many projects. They took some of the first vital steps towards long- term protection of this park. Captain Young later earned the rank of Colonel, and became a national figure. A sequoia named for him stands a short distance along the trail. A black and white photo of a man mounted on a horse standing on a wooden bridge. His saddle rests on a thick blanket. The saddle's foot strap has a leather flap that wraps around the ankle of his boot. He is dressed in a dark long-sleeved shirt and light-colored pants, and wears a brimmed felt hat. He wears long leather gloves that come up to his forearm. His pants are tucked into buttoned knee boots. In this rare 1903 photo, a Buffalo soldier poses on the Marble Fork Bridge in Sequoia National Park. A black and white photo portrait of Charles Young. He is clean shaven. He wears a white shirt under a buttoned jacket. On his collar are the letters \"U.S.\" and a U.S. Calvary pin of two crossed swords with a number \"9\" in the center. A quote by Charles Young next to his portrait reads, \"The people of the adjoining country and tourists are awakening to the benefits and beauties of the park and desire to protect the game and Forest....\" Text to the right reads, Who were the Buffalo soldiers? Buffalo soldiers were African Americans who served in the United States cavalry after the Civil War, primarily in the American West. It is believed that American Indians- who revered the buffalo- gave the name and tribute to the soldiers' courage, skill, and appearance. These soldiers carried the name with pride.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Double Ditch Indian Village is an archaeological site located seven and one-half miles north of Bismarck, ND. For nearly 300 years (from approximately AD 1490 – 1785), this site was the location of a large earthlodge village inhabited by the Mandan Indians. According to Mandan oral history, Double Ditch was one of seven to nine villages simultaneously occupied near the mouth of the Heart River. The Mandan population in this area probably totaled 10,000 or more during this time. The earthlodge villages were centers of trade between the Mandans, their nomadic neighbors, and later, Euroamerican traders. A massive smallpox epidemic swept the interior of North America about 1781-1782. This catastrophe was apparently responsible for the abandonment of Double Ditch and all the other Mandan villages near the Heart River. The Mandans had moved to new villages farther upriver. People of Mandan Indian ancestry live today throughout much of the Northern Great Plains. As one of the Three Affiliated Tribes, the Mandan tribal headquarters are at Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.</p> <p>The Mandans built dome-shaped houses of logs and earth, known as earth-lodges. All that remains of the earthlodges on the surface are circular depressions. The men usually decided how large an earthlodge would be, and the women did most of the building. To build an earthlodge, a wooden framework was erected, then covered with layers of willow branches, grass, and finally, earth. It took about 150 trees to build one earthlodge. Earthlodges typically were 35 to 45 feet in diameter, although they varied from 20 to 65 feet, and housed a family of eight to twenty people.</p> <p>The Mandans are one of the best-known agricultural tribes of the Missouri Valley region. The Missouri River valley provided water, food, and shelter for the Mandans. Abundant timber and game could be found in the wooded bottomlands, and bison flourished on the surrounding prairie grasslands. The terrace-edge settings of the villages offered access to garden land and abundant timber as well as extensive views up and down the valley. The Mandans developed a rich and elaborate culture based on farming and bison hunting. Farming produced a large surplus of food which could be stored for use during leaner times and traded to nomadic, non-farming groups. Principal crops include corn, beans, and squash. Sunflowers and tobacco also were grown.</p> <p>In the archaeological record the dominant role of bison, hunted for their hides and meat, is evident. Other animals also were hunted and trapped, including pronghorns, deer, wolves, rabbits, beavers, muskrats, porcupines, foxes, mink, badgers, and bobcats. A diverse variety of birds (waterfowl, hawks and eagles, grouse, cranes, owls, woodpeckers, crows, ravens, and small songbirds) and fishes (sturgeons, gars, mooneyes, pikes, suckers, catfishes, and cods) are represented in the archaeological record. These animals all contributed to the subsistence of the villagers. Each supplied an important source of bone for tools and ornaments, as well as being tapped for their hides, furs, and plumage.</p> <p>Fortification systems consisted of a deep moat and a wall of wooden posts that formed a palisade. Natural features, such as steep terrain and riverbanks, also were used for added protection. Fortification systems attest to the fierce warfare between villagers and surrounding nomadic tribes that is reported in early historic records.</p> <p>The raised areas around the village are midden mounds or earthen mounds ranging from one to ten feet high. There are more than 30 mounds surrounding the village. The oldest mounds, dating to AD 1550-1650, occur directly atop Ditches 3 and 4. Excavations showed some mounds to be accumulations of household refuse – animal bones, broken pottery, and ash from hearths – carried and dumped in huge heaps. Other mounds were composed partially or entirely of fill excavated from elsewhere in the village, clearly indicating that those mounds were intentionally constructed. During one phase of occupation, the village defense involved a combination of Ditch 2, which lacked bastions, and several large mounds placed as strong points just inside the ditch.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em><br /> <br /> <br /> During the late 1800s and early 1900s, social reformers established <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/settlement-houses-in-chicago.htm\">settlement houses</a> in cities to address issues created by urbanization and industrialization, such as housing shortages and unsanitary living conditions. In 1889, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jane-addams.htm\">Jane Addams</a> and Ellen Gates Starr established Hull-House in Chicago, the first settlement house in the United States.<br /> <br /> By the late 1800s, Chicago had begun its transformation into the manufacturing hub of the United States. The steel, clothing, and meatpacking industries attracted thousands of workers from Europe and the American South. The Nineteenth Ward on the Near West Side became an enclave for Eastern European working-class immigrants. Many of them took low-wage jobs in sweatshops and garment factories in the surrounding neighborhoods.<br />  <br /> Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr founded Hull-House to offer social services to the community. Some of those services included legal aid, an employment office, childcare, and training in crafting and domestic skills. While touring Europe in 1888, Addams and Starr had visited Toynbee Hall in London and been inspired to create their own institution. Hull-House expanded from one aging mansion, built by Charles J. Hull in 1856, into a 13-building complex that spanned an entire city block. Its facilities included a gymnasium, theater, art gallery, libraries, pools, classrooms, a kindergarten, and dormitories.<br /> <br /> Many of the staff who worked at Hull-House were educated, white women from middle- and upper-class families. Some lived full time at Hull-House, while others commuted from their homes in other Chicago neighborhoods. Their work at Hull-House exposed them firsthand to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/hull-house-and-the-garbage-ladies-of-chicago.htm\">unsafe and unsanitary conditions</a> faced every day by the working-class residents of the Nineteenth Ward. Some Hull-House workers also became involved in social and political reforms, such as protective labor laws for women and children, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">women’s suffrage</a>, and addressing neighborhood housing and sanitation problems. <br /> <br /> Hull-House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.<br /> <br /> <strong>Selected Sources:</strong><br /> <br /> Addams, Jane. <a href=\"https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/addams/hullhouse/hullhouse.html\">Twenty Years at Hull-House with Autobiographical Notes</a>.

Continuing straight ahead takes you to the Lodgepole Market Center, which will be on your right. As you approach the building, you will pass a dining area on the right, with outdoor tables covered by market umbrellas. <br /><br />The Lodgepole Market Center is a two-story building planked in dark wood. It has several dormer windows poking out through the roof. A peaked roof extends out over the main entrance, supported by large beams and posts rising from a low stone wall. This creates a seating area and shade outside the glass double doors at the market entrance. A second entrance of double doors is next to the outdoor dining area<br /><br />Opposite from the Lodgepole Market Center entrance is the end of the Lodgepole Visitor Center, where the restrooms are located.",

In August of 1812, Captain Brush of the Ohio Militia reached Frenchtown with supplies for Detroit, but could not proceed further because the Native Confederation had blocked the military road. After three failed attempts to break through to Frenchtown from Detroit, the U.S. surrendered to the British on August 16, 1812.<br /> <br /> All the troops in the Michigan Territory were included in the terms of surrender, including Brush’s. The next day, British Captain Elliot accompanied by a Wyandot Indian and a Frenchman, reached Frenchtown and approached the stockade. When the British officer made contact, he was blindfolded and brought into the stockade. Captain Brush refused to accept that General Hull had surrendered, accused Elliot of being a spy and placed him under arrest. The next day some of the Michigan Militia that had been present at the surrender made it to Frenchtown and verified the surrender. Instead of complying with the terms, Brush and his men immediately headed back to Ohio with as much as they could carry, leaving the helpless Elliot bound in the stockade.<br /> <br /> Prior to the first Battle of Frenchtown, the British burned the stockade to prevent the U.S. from being able to use it.<br /> <br /> After the war, the acre of land the stockade once stood on was purchased by the Hon. Charles Noble who built a house on it. During the interurban period, a large powerhouse that provided electricity to the rails was constructed on the property. Sitting at the end of the Monroe Street bridge, traffic had to turn left or right to get past it. In later years a gasoline station, a bank and a veterinary clinic have occupied the site. While not as pronounced today, north and south bound traffic still must maneuver around what was the location of the stockade. You can stand at the corner of East Elm Avenue and North Monroe Street and imagine the Wayne Stockade that once stood there.",

The caption reads, Franklin Lakes. 5.7 miles (or 9.2 km) one way Elevation: 10,331 feet (or 3,149 m) at first lake. Colorful metamorphic rocks skirt the trail but, at the lakes, the gray granitic presence of Florence Peak dominates. Franklin Pass lies almost three miles beyond the lakes. The next photo shows a green valley with patches of snow. The caption reads, Farewell Gap. 6.4 miles (or 9.8 km) one way. Elevation: 10,587 feet (3,227 m).<br /><br />Farewell Gap, the low point in the prominent \"V\" to the south, marks the boundary between Sequoia National Park and Sequoia National Forest. A map of the Mineral King area shows our location at the beginning of the Franklin Farewell trail. The bottom photo is of a rocky \"v\" shaped valley dotted with trees and small patches of snow. A rocky mountain range lies beyond. The caption reads, View toward Franklin Pass A quote by Hanshan, Poet: \"Who can leap the world's ties And sit with me among the white clouds?\"",

There are several large, weathered branches on the ground in the wooded area around the amphitheater.<br />To your right, and slightly downslope, is a platform with a stone base. It has six stairs, on both the right and left sides. The stairs lead to a curved stage. Behind the stage is tall wooden structure, painted tan, with a white screen in the center. The sides of the structure angle slightly inward, each with a tall narrow window. <br /><br />To the left of the projection wall is a campfire ring made of stones that stick up about one foot above the ground. <br /><br />Starting 15 feet from the edge of the stage area, there are twenty, 20-foot-long wood benches for seating. They are lined up in two sets of ten, with a five-foot-wide aisle running down the center. The benches angle slightly inward toward the stage, creating a V shape.<br /><br />About ten feet behind the bench seating is a small, tan, wood planked projection building. It has a locked wood framed window on the side that faces the screen.<br /><br />If you are facing the stage and go to the trees to the right of the middle of the seating area, there is one Jeffrey pine near the path. If you scratch its trunk, you will find that it smells like butterscotch.<br /><br />On the right side of the wall, about halfway up, is the National Park Service logo, in the shape of a brown arrowhead, pointed downward. Inside the arrowhead are the words in white lettering, \"National Park Service\" with a green sequoia tree shape to its left. Near the bottom of the arrowhead is a white buffalo silhouette set against a green meadow, with a white lake and snowcapped mountain behind it.",

It also grows on an unusually steep slope for sequoias. <br />In the photo, taken from a ridge, large treetops give way to the Great Western divide and canyons of the Kaweah River. The caption reads,<br />Paradise Ridge.<br />3.7 miles (or 6.0 km) one way.<br />Elevation: 8,460 feet (or 2,579 m.)<br />Openings in the trees allow views toward the gigantic Great Western Divide to the east and the canyons of Kaweah River to the north.<br />A map of the Mineral King area shows the location of Paradise Ridge Trailhead. <br />The bottom photo is a view of treetops that open up to sequoia covered mountains. The caption reads,<br /><br />A view into Mineral King Valley on the climb to Paradise Ridge.<br /><br />A quote from Mary Austin (Inyo writer). <br /><br />\" Man is not himself only...He is all that he sees.\"",

This Special Recreation Management Area is managed by the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/bonneville-salt-flats\">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM). The salt flats are about 12 miles long and 5 miles wide with total area coverage of just over 46 square miles.<br /> <br /> <strong>From the BLM: </strong>Trapper and frontiersman Jedediah Smith crossed the Salt Flats while returning to Utah from an expedition to California in 1827. John C. Fremont and his U.S. government-sponsored expedition crossed the heart of the Salt Flats in 1845 while trying to find a shorter overland route to the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <br /> The next year Fremont’s route across the Salt Flats would become known as the Hastings Cutoff as part of the California Trail. Promoted by Lansford Hastings as a faster, easier route to California, Hastings Cutoff proved to be just the opposite for the Donner- Reed Party of 1846. What contributed to the party’s infamous winter survival in the Sierra Mountains was the delay the emigrants<br /> experienced while crossing the Salt Flats. Their wagons became mired in mud just below the thin salt crust. Artifacts from the Donner-Reed Party, and other<br /> emigrants that crossed the trail, are on display in the Donner-Reed Museum.</p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p>Motor vehicle use is limited by seasonal closure during the spring when the salt is moist or has standing water on the surface. Closure dates may vary and will be posted by sign. For more information contact the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/bonneville-salt-flats\">Salt Lake Field Office</a>.</p> <p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p> <p>No overnight camping on the salt flats.

            "audioDescription": "The Old Corner Bookstore is situated on the corners of School and Washington Streets. It has a gambrel roof, with the roof pitching down toward Washington Street. The School Street side shows the four stories that make up the building. On the first floor of the building, there are two bay windows that extend out over the sidewalk. There are twenty four panes of glass and the framing is yellow wood. On the edges of the first floor at the corner are a set of double doors leading into the structure. There is also a historic plaque made of dark metal on the first floor on the corner of the School Street and Washington Street sides. In between the first and second floors is a sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill, the current tenant as of 2020. On the second floor are five windows spaced evenly along the floor. Each window has twenty four window panes that are edged in yellow wood. On the corner of each side of the building, there are lighter red bricks extending slightly out of the wall to give it a textured look going up one story to the bottom of the roof edge. In between the second and third floor is a double horizontal line of red bricks that are slightly extended out of the building face. It extends across the top of the five windows of the second floor. The third floor has only three windows spaced, each with twenty four panes of glass edged in yellow wood, evenly across it due to the roof slope. In between the third and four floor is a double horizontal line of red bricks that are slightly extended out of the building face. It extends across the top of the three windows of the third floor. Located at the top center of the fourth floor is one window with twenty four window panes edged in yellow wood. The Washington Street side only has three visible floors. There is a historic sign on the corner of Washington Street and School Street made of dark metal. On the first level there are two bay windows with twenty four panes of yellow wood. They extend out over the sidewalk of Washington Street. In between the two bay windows is a doorway. Above the windows and door on the first floor is another sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill. The second floor has three windows spaced evenly across it with twenty four panes of glass and edged in yellow wood. The roof line is just above these windows. The roof is made of grey shingles with white wood edging it. There are two dormer windows that extend out of the roof. They are made of white wood on the extension with grey shingles. The building is surrounded by many red brick buildings and red brick sidewalk. The remaining two sides immediately abut the neighboring buildings.",

At the confluence of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers, the riverfront attraction boasts bronze interpretive panels telling the story of each painting, spot lighted when the sun goes down. Visitors and locals alike experience an appreciation of art and history 24/7. As a tourism attraction, the portraits of Paducah’s past inspire both young and old like icing on the cake for this charming western Kentucky river town.</p> <p>Originally sponsored and funded by the private sector, an all-volunteer group of dedicated citizens started and continues to coordinate the City-maintained attraction. Now in its 25th painting season, Dafford muralists return annually to touch up or sometimes entirely repaint images. Books, postcards, posters, prints, t-shirts and coloring books are sold to support maintenance. Book signings and special events celebrate the project. Tours hosted by Paducah Ambassadors are a favorite while self-guided walking tours are popular year round. View all images and learn more about the project: PaducahWallToWall.com to learn more.</p>",

The land is located on the ancestral homeland of the Ponca people and was part of their reservations in the 1800-1900’s. The building where the museum is located was built in the 1930’s with the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps to serve as the headquarters for tribal government and as a community building for the Northern Ponca members. It has since been repurposed as an office site and museum displaying Ponca artifacts from different eras to tell our story.</p> <p>The Tribe’s Powwow Arena was placed next to the Museum for that historical and cultural significance. Considering the fact that many Ponca members no longer live in Niobrara, it provides an opportunity for them to come back to the homeland and feel that connection to the earth. The Annual Norther Ponca Powwow is held on the 2nd weekend of August and is open to all who wish to join in a celebration of Ponca culture.</p> <p>Around the Powwow grounds and Museum, an educational trail was put in. Along this path are statues that depict traditional Ponca stories such as How the Rabbit Caught the Sun and the Coyote and the Turkeys. There is also a recreation of a traditional Ponca earth lodge for visitors to enter and experience. During work hours, staff is available at the museum to give guided tours to tell these stories and explain more about Ponca history and culture.</p> <p>The crowning jewel is the statue of Chief Standing Bear overlooking the grounds. Now with a road and a parking lot, the statue represents an important moment in Ponca history when Chief Standing Bear fought for the right, in court, for the Ponca to return to Niobrara after being relocated to Oklahoma. If visitors are lucky, the Tribe’s buffalo herd can be visible from here, too.</p> <p>Come visit to learn more about the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska!</p>",

Deployed to protect the park in the summer of 1903, Charles Young and his men travelled by horseback from the Presidio in San Francisco to Sequoia National Park, reaching their destination 16 days later. Assigned to extend a wagon road leading into the park, Young and his men made steady progress, meeting the goal of extending the road into the Giant Forest.<br /> <br /> The African-American army company working on the road were known as â€˜Buffalo Soldiers'. The citizens of nearby Visalia were so impressed with their work, they insisted that one of the giant trees be named in Captain Young's honor. Young declined, asserting that 2,000-year-old living trees should not be diminished by attaching any human's name. He acquiesced when it was agreed upon that the person honored would be Booker T. Washington.<br /> <br /> The significance of this Giant Sequoia tree was forgotten over time. After nearly 100 years, this tree has been rediscovered, and in 2003-on the hundredth year anniversary of the tree's dedication-a rededication ceremony was performed to honor Charles Young and Booker T.

As a result of changes in the course of the river, Horse Island has been absorbed into the Missouri shoreline in the vicinity of this marker, and the Mississippi River has shifted its course eastward, carrying away the original village of Kaskaskia.</p> <p>When the party reached Horse Island, Capt. Meriwether Lewis left his co-commander, William Clark, in charge of the keelboat and pirogues, while he was put ashore to walk the six-mile distance to Fort Kaskaskia. The fort was now an American Army post situated on the high ground on the east side of the Kaskaskia River opposite the village of Kaskaskia.</p> <p>Clark and the rest of the men, meanwhile, pushed their boats into the Mississippi and begin to work their way around a long and difficult bend, known as Coco Bend. Clark had wanted to make calculations of latitude with his sextant but a thick morning mist obscured the sun. The west side of Coco Bend hugged the Missouri shore and Clark observed a range of highlands next to the river. At 1 p.m., the party passed Joseph Donahoe’s landing. Boats loaded salt from the salt works in Saline Creek at this place. Two hours later, Saline Creek itself was passed. In addition to the salt works on this creek, there was also a thriving settlement. The party rounded Coco Bend and pulled up to Kaskaskia Landing on the Illinois shore. On the opposite side of the river was the former west bank community of Old Ste. Genevieve, known locally as “misar” (phonetic for misère in French, or misery in English). This community was relocated after disastrous floods in the 1780s.</p> <p>There is a roadside historical marker for visitors to glen into the times and landscape of 1803 when they camped here.</p> <p>(description courtesy <a href=\"https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3TFV_Kaskaskia_Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition_Across_Missouri_Perry_County_MO\">waymarking.com</a>)</p>",

            "audioDescription": "The next wayside includes 3 vertical panels. The first panel, entitled \"Lumber piled high,\" features a large black-and-white photo of a half-dozen mustached men standing among stacks of logs piled on the ground in a snow-covered forest. A few of the men hold axes, while one man in the foreground stands beside a pair of oxen joined by a wooden yoke that is in turn chained to a single log lying in the snow. Text below the title tells us: When D. H. Day invested his life savings and more to purchase the sawmill on Glen Lake, he wasn't content to do business as usual. He modernized. He improved. He converted a two-and-a-quarter mile, horse drawn, wooden tramway to the dock into a narrow-gauge railroad, thereby building a faster and more profitable mill operation. Day developed Glen Haven as a company town to provide for the needs of lumberjacks, dock workers, and farm hands. He purchased and ran a company store, improved the roads, and even brought in the telegraph. Rejecting the practice of clear-cutting, Day left young trees behind to grow and seed, thus introducing the practice of reforestation to northern Michigan. Superimposed over the background photo at the top of this panel are 2 smaller black-and-white snapshots. The photo on the left shows several neat stacks of long, flat hardwood boards flanking a locomotive engine. The tops of the stacks reach higher than the locomotive, and several men stand atop a car attached behind the engine. A caption accompanying this photo tells us: The Glen Lake sawmill could process 2,000 board feet of hardwood and 30,000 board feet of hemlock a day from the surrounding forest. The second photo depicts the exterior of the Glen Lake sawmill. One tall chimney pipe juts from the building's sloping roof, and a row of 14 wooden barrels stand perched atop the roof's peak. Men and horses stand in front of the building. Two captions read: Day paid his lumberjacks 15 cents an hour and dock hands 35 cents an hour. Why are there barrels on the mill's roof? Early fire suppression. The clue is the ladder on the cedar-shingled roof.<br /><br />The wayside's second panel, entitled \"Welcome to Glen Haven!\", features a black-and-white map drawing of the land area between Glen Lake, appearing in green along the top of the panel, and Lake Michigan, also green, located at the bottom of the panel. Text below the wayside's title reads: Back when this area was first getting settled, there were no trains, and roads were just sandy ruts. If you had visited then, you would have come by boat-the main mode of transportation. Along the route, little villages, like Glen Haven provided essential services for passing vessels and travelers: a long dock out to deep water for loading and unloading vessels, wood cut and dried for fuel, a blacksmith shop for repairs, a general store for buying a hat to replace the one that blew off in the last storm, and a boarding house for lodging folks waiting to resume their journey. Today, many of those towns have disappeared, others have grown into big cities with no trace of the old village, but this frontier port still stands because resident and ambitious businessman David Henry, or D. H., Day's vision and innovative enterprises wouldn't let it die. Superimposed over this larger map in the panel's lower left corner is a smaller map showing the roads and buildings of Glen Haven Historic Village. This map insert is a magnified version of Glen Haven as it appears on the larger map near the panel's lower right corner. On this map, Glen Haven village is situated above Glen Haven dock, which extends into Lake Michigan. The third panel is a color map of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Most of the panel's left side and its entire top half is colored blue to indicate Lake Michigan and Manitou Passage. Pictured in green in the middle of the lake to the west and north of the passage are South Manitou Island and North Manitou Island, respectively. A notation tells us that the elevation of Lake Michigan is 580 feet, or 177 meters. A key in the panel's top right quadrant indicates the location of various features including wilderness areas, picnic areas, campgrounds, beach access areas, ranger stations, and 13 hiking and/or skiing trails. Text placed alongside and below the key explains: Park boundary extends ¼ mile into Lake Michigan. Parcels of private property exist within the park's authorized boundary. Many small areas are not shown on the map Respect all property owners' rights.<br />Trails for hiking and/or cross-country skiing begin at designated locations. Detailed trail maps are available. On the map itself, the words \"Philip A. Hart Visitor Center\" appear in white letters inside a small green rectangle located just left of center in the panel's bottom half.",

            "audioDescription": "The Village Campground is the only campground on North Manitou Island. Located about two-tenths of a mile north from the Village Dock, this small campground contains 8 designated campsites, 2 community fire rings, and one outhouse. Each individual campsite is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Standing alongside the trail leading to the campground is a wooden post supporting a small wooden sign with the words \"Village Campground\" and, below it, \"West Side via Pole Bridge\" carved into its face. An arrow carved to the left of \"Village Campground\" indicates the campground's location to the left, and an upward facing arrow indicates that the bridge is located straight ahead. The Village Campground consists of several small clearings surrounded by trees. The locations of the individual campsites in these clearings are indicated by wooden posts measuring about 3 feet tall with white triangles painted near their tops. Take care as you step around the campsites as you may encounter some fallen logs as well as a wooden bench at each site. These benches are each constructed of a single wooden timber perched atop 2 smaller wooden blocks positioned at each end. The community fire rings are topped with metal grills that can be lifted to place wood into the otherwise open rings. Each metal ring measures approximately 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches high. Campers may collect dead and downed wood found on the island to make open fires in these pits during their visit. The outhouse is located in a large clearing near the trail leading into the campground. Placed in front of the outhouse door is a wooden slat platform with an approximate height of 1 inch. The outhouse door opens outward from right to left. Located a few yards in front of the outhouse is another wooden platform, about 5 inches high, holding a trash receptacle with an upward-slanting metal lid. As you approach the receptacle from the outhouse, you must walk around the platform to the right. The front of the receptacle will now be on your left. Turn left 90 degrees to face the receptacle. There is a handle on the lid's top edge. Also standing in the ground is a structure consisting of 2 metal poles-one vertical pole measuring about 7 feet tall and a second pole of nearly the same length positioned horizontally atop the first pole to create a large letter \"T.\" Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping on the island. Note that camping is allowed in the wilderness area on North Manitou Island, but open fires are prohibited outside the Village Campground.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The North Unity School is located just east of Narada Lake, just north of M-22 near the end of the wooden bridge of the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail where it crosses the wetlands of Narada Lake. It was an early building of the community of North Unity.<br /> <br /> North Unity, a community of immigrants, largely from Bohemia, (the western half of the present Czech Republic, bordering southern Germany), was where Shalda Creek empties into Lake Michigan.<br /> It had a schoolhouse, sawmill, and store. In 1859, it was awarded a post office. John Shalda built a gristmill on the Lake Michigan outlet of Shalda creek.<br /> <br /> The North Unity School was built around 1856 of the horizontal log construction that is to traditional the Czechs and Bavarian Germans. The logs were close-fitted so that the top of one rested on the log below it for its full length with only an occasional small gap. The corner notches are interlocking dove-tail joints. The dove-tails were cut with a saw. The school has been restored to its original log appearance.<br /> <br /> The school was located about 1.5 miles south of the center of town, likely to either accommodate farm children dispersed at considerable distances from the shores of the Lake or because of the availability or price of land<br /> The North Unity School is ideally accessed from the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail.<br />  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "The North Unity School, located east of the intersection of Basch Rd. and M-22 and up a hill from the bike path near M-22, is a small log building dating to the original settlement of North Unity. The weathered gray logs forming the structure measure about 10 to 14 inches high, with 9 logs total spanning both the width of the building's facade and each of its two sides. The logs, which have been hewn and therefore form a flat surface, are stacked tightly, without gaps. The building's corner notches consist of large interlocking dove-tail joints. The school's gable roof has a slight overhang, and the wide boards and narrow battens forming the facade's triangular gable itself are positioned vertically. There are 2 multi-paned double hung windows trimmed in similarly weathered wood on each of the building's 2 sides and 2 more windows flanking the single wooden door on its facade. This entrance door-multi-paneled and painted white-opens inward from left to right. There are 2 steps leading into the building.<br />The North Unity School, which is also located just west of Narada Lake, is not on the Driving Tour of Port Oneida as there is no parking or turnaround near the school, nor is there an entrance to the school property. Visitors will need to park on M-22 and walk in.",

            "audioDescription": "The Platte River Campground is a year-round facility that lies in a wooded area within walking distance of the Platte River and less than 2 miles away from the beaches of Lake Michigan. Both the campground and the ranger station standing at its entrance are located 10 miles south of Empire on Lake Michigan Road about ¼ mile off M-22. This is the largest campground at the park, offering a wide variety of nearly 180 camp sites, including back-in and pull-through sites with electric hookups for RVs, tent-only sites, walk-in sites, and hike-in/tent-only group sites. Each site has a campfire ring, picnic table and restrooms with flush toilets and sinks. Hot showers are also available. Most of the sites at this campground are accessible from a series of paved loop roads located behind, or to the east of, the ranger station. The smaller group and walk-in camp areas are located to the north of the ranger station. Water spigots are located throughout the campground with several serving each loop. The Platte River Ranger Station is a one-story structure with wooden board and batten construction and a red-tiled hip roof. There are 2 concrete walkways leading from the parking area to the station-one walkway running directly alongside the building and, about 3 feet to this first walkway's right, another walkway leading to a covered seating area. As you step along the wide concrete walkway closest to the building, you will encounter a metal drinking fountain jutting out from the exterior building wall on your left, and then, about 2 feet further forward and also on your left, a small vestibule containing a pair of restrooms. As you step into the vestibule, turn right 90 degrees to access the door to the women's restroom or turn left 90 degrees to access the men's restroom. These restrooms are wheelchair accessible. The building entrance is also located on the left, about 8 feet beyond the restroom vestibule. Situated several feet in front of the ranger station entrance is a wide U-shaped wooden bench sheltered by a hip roof supported by a series of large square pillars. Most of the floor in front of the entrance is concrete, although the bench itself stands on a wooden plank floor. This wooden floor extends along the left side of the outermost concrete walkway leading back to the parking area. Standing on a separate wooden floor section to the left of this wooden walkway are 2 metal receptacles, the first for landfill materials and the second for mixed recycling. Reservations for camping at the Platte River Campground are accepted for the summer months only, from Memorial Day to Labor Day. An amphitheater located adjacent to the Ranger Station provides evening programs every day during the summer. Fees for camping at the various sites vary. Nearby features include a separate backcountry campground and numerous hiking and backpacking trails. There are also opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, and fishing on Platte River and Lake Michigan.",

            "audioDescription": "A wayside panel stands near the covered bridge. This panel, entitled with the quotation \"...a perfect setting for a Perfect Day,\" features a large map drawing of the scenic drive, which appears to the left, or west, of Glen Lake. Text below the title tells us: Pierce Stocking (1908-1976) wanted to preserve this area's natural beauty. In the early 1960s, the local lumberman began envisioning \"a haven of rest\" called Sleeping Bear Dunes Park. It opened to the public in 1967. For just $2.75 per vehicle, visitors could drive a fourteen-mile scenic roadway, relax at picnic areas, and delight in spectacular views of Lake Michigan, Glen Lake, and the sand dunes. When Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore purchased Stocking's park in 1976, they renamed it Philip Hart Nature Trail after the U.S. Senator from Michigan who fought to establish the Lakeshore six years earlier. Staff considered removing the scenic drive to protect the fragile dunes. Ultimately, they realized what Stocking had: if you want people to love this earth enough to conserve it, they also have to be able to enjoy it. So the drive remained, and the Lakeshore renamed it in honor of Stocking and his resolve to preserve this place for future generations. This map contrasts the loop you're driving on today (blue) with Stocking's original route (orange). Pictured below this text in the panel's bottom left corner is a color photo of a stocky man, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, standing beside a black dog. A caption accompanying the photo reads: Pierce Stocking worked at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Cadillac, Michigan during the Great Depression. The skills he acquired there helped him construct this drive. What do you think this area would look like today without Stocking's efforts? Appearing in a horizontal line to the right of this photo are 4 smaller photos with text, all falling under the general title \"Evolution of a National Treasure.\" Text accompanying the photo on the left, entitled \"Great Lakes Gardens,\" tells us:<br />The drive's original entrance, the Great Lakes Gardens, showcased rose bushes, hiking trails, and ponds in the shape of all five Great Lakes. Text below the second photo, entitled \" A Very Steep Hill,\" explains:<br />From the gardens, Stocking's drive curved up the dune face to Picnic Mountain. Cars stalled; transmissions failed. This ascent was soon dubbed \"Suicide Hill.\" The text accompanying the next photo, entitled \"Porcupine Damage,\" reads:<br />The Lakeshore rebuilt Stocking's covered bridge in 1986 in order to accommodate taller vehicles and to repair damage done by munching porcupines. The last block of text, entitled \"Road Revisions,\" explains:<br />To prevent erosion of the dunes, the Lakeshore moved the drive's entrance; closed segments (orange); and rerouted the drive into a one-way loop (blue). Running along the length of the panel's bottom edge is a timeline beginning with 1960 on the far left and ending with 2016 on the far right. It is noted that in 2011, Good Morning America named the Lakeshore \"The Most Beautiful Place in America.\" Section 3 (182 words)<br />Affixed at an angle to the top of a wooden base located near the wayside panel is a small metal plaque with a verdigris, or bluish-green patina. Appearing in raised letters at the top of the plague is the title \"Pierce Stocking, 1908 through 1976.\" Text below the title reads: Pierce Stocking, a native of northern lower Michigan, worked as a lumberman and spent much of his leisure time in the woods. He wanted to share his love of nature with others and conceived the idea of constructing a scenic drive onto the Sleeping Bear Dunes. He envisioned people of all ages and degrees of physical fitness experiencing the sand dunes and the bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan. At the same time, he hoped to protect the fragile dunes and woods from excessive human use by concentrating activity along the road and at scenic overlooks and picnic areas. In 1967, Pierce Stocking fulfilled his dream with the opening of the scenic drive to the public. The drive was operated privately until 1977 when it became a part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.",

            "audioDescription": "Located along the first leg of the one-way loop making up Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is an approximately 13-foot-long covered bridge with a gable roof. This bridge, which is the first numbered stop along the drive, is constructed of reddish-brown vertical wooden planks. Affixed to the face of the triangular gable located just below the roof's peak is the arrow-shaped sign representing the National Park Service emblem. This version of the emblem includes the words \"Department of the Interior,\" which appear in white at the bottom of the sign. Flanking the road passing under the bridge, and extending several feet beyond the bridge on both ends, are two low wooden guardrails. A pull-off area found just past the bridge offers a spot from where you may both view and photograph the bridge. Note that the covered bridge can be accessed by car, foot, or bicycle. The vehicle clearance under the bridge is 13½ feet. Next draw your attention to a wayside panel standing near the bridge. This panel, entitled with the quotation \"...a perfect setting for a Perfect Day,\" features a large map drawing of the scenic drive, which appears to the left, or west, of Glen Lake. Text below the title tells us:Pierce Stocking (1908-1976) wanted to preserve this area's natural beauty. In the early 1960s, the local lumberman began envisioning \"a haven of rest\" called Sleeping Bear Dunes Park. It opened to the public in 1967. For just $2.75 per vehicle, visitors could drive a fourteen-mile scenic roadway, relax at picnic areas, and delight in spectacular views of Lake Michigan, Glen Lake, and the sand dunes.When Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore purchased Stocking's park in 1976, they renamed it Philip Hart Nature Trail after the U.S. Senator from Michigan who fought to establish the Lakeshore six years earlier.

So the drive remained, and the Lakeshore renamed it in honor of Stocking and his resolve to preserve this place for future generations.This map contrasts the loop you're driving on today (blue) with Stocking's original route (orange).Pictured below this text in the panel's bottom left corner is a color photo of a stocky man, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, standing beside a black dog. A caption accompanying the photo reads: Pierce Stocking worked at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Cadillac, Michigan during the Great Depression. The skills he acquired there helped him construct this drive. What do you think this area would look like today without Stocking's efforts?Appearing in a horizontal line to the right of this photo are 4 smaller photos with text, all falling under the general title \"Evolution of a National Treasure.\"Text accompanying the photo on the left, entitled \"Great Lakes Gardens,\" tells us:The drive's original entrance, the Great Lakes Gardens, showcased rose bushes, hiking trails, and ponds in the shape of all five Great Lakes.Text below the second photo, entitled \" A Very Steep Hill,\" explains:From the gardens, Stocking's drive curved up the dune face to Picnic Mountain. Cars stalled; transmissions failed. This ascent was soon dubbed \"Suicide Hill.\"The text accompanying the next photo, entitled \"Porcupine Damage,\" reads:The Lakeshore rebuilt Stocking's covered bridge in 1986 in order to accommodate taller vehicles and to repair damage done by munching porcupines.The last block of text, entitled \"Road Revisions,\" explains:To prevent erosion of the dunes, the Lakeshore moved the drive's entrance; closed segments (orange); and rerouted the drive into a one-way loop (blue).Running along the length of the panel's bottom edge is a timeline beginning with 1960 on the far left and ending with 2016 on the far right. It is noted that in 2011, Good Morning America named the Lakeshore \"The Most Beautiful Place in America.\" Affixed at an angle to the top of a wooden base located near the wayside panel is a small metal plaque with a verdigris, or bluish-green patina. Appearing in raised letters at the top of the plague is the title \"Pierce Stocking, 1908 through 1976.\" Text below the title reads:Pierce Stocking, a native of northern lower Michigan, worked as a lumberman and spent much of his leisure time in the woods. He wanted to share his love of nature with others and conceived the idea of constructing a scenic drive onto the Sleeping Bear Dunes. He envisioned people of all ages and degrees of physical fitness experiencing the sand dunes and the bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan. At the same time, he hoped to protect the fragile dunes and woods from excessive human use by concentrating activity along the road and at scenic overlooks and picnic areas.In 1967, Pierce Stocking fulfilled his dream with the opening of the scenic drive to",

On one of the steamer's trips to Chicago, the Iowa stopped at South Manitou to take on wood. George was impressed with the beauty of the island and the surrounding country.

Fifteen years after arriving on the island, at the age of 42 with almost no money, George Hutzler's hard work, thrift, and careful planning led to him to become the most successful farmer on the island. He planted an apple and cherry orchard and loved carnations, which he grew near the house.<br /> <br /> George's son, John, took over the farm after his father and lived there throughout his life.

            "audioDescription": "The George Johann Hutzler Farm, also known as the G. J. Hutzler Farm, is one of 3 surviving farmsteads on South Manitou Island. This farm is located on the hiking trail leading to South Manitou Island's north shore, about one mile north of the island's cemetery. George Johann Hutzler was the half-brother of George Conrad, or G. C., Hutzler. The 2 primary buildings found here are a white clapboard farmhouse with a gambrel roof and a large wooden pig barn with a gable roof. Both of these structures stand in a grassy clearing surrounded by woods. On the periphery of the clearing along the tree line, you may also encounter a small outhouse or shed and a pile of wooden boards remaining from another outbuilding, now collapsed. Take care as you explore the grassy yard surrounding the house and barn as you may encounter uneven ground. Lining the front and sides of the 2-story farmhouse are several multi-paned double-hung windows including 2 windows flanking the building's glass-pane entrance door. The door's threshold is situated at least 1 Â½ feet above the ground, but there are no steps. A small wooden sign bolted to a short pole standing in front of the farmhouse reads: \"C. J. Hutzler. Circa 1856.\" The large 2-story frame barn is the oldest remaining portion of the Hutzler homestead. Its walls are constructed from weathered vertical wooden planks sitting atop a foundation consisting of several wooden timbers measuring as much as 16 inches square. These timbers are stacked lengthwise with their rough-hewn exposed ends alternating to form a checkerboard-like pattern in the foundation's corners. The structure's gable roof is covered with wooden shingles. There are no windows in the barn, but the interior is partitioned into three sections, each with its own entrance.",

The first panel, entitled \"Decades before his time,\" features a large black-and-white photo of 3 men standing beside an early-20th-century automobile parked on a roadway running alongside a grassy field. Two of the men-the one positioned in the middle of the photo and the man standing on the photo's right side-wear 3-piece suits. Nailed to the trunk of a tall leafy tree standing between these 2 men is a sign that reads \"West Michigan Pike.\" Text below the wayside's title tells us:David Henry Day came to Glen Haven in the mid-1800s as agent for the Northern Transportation Company. A decade later, he had purchased the company, the town, and 5,000 acres of adjacent timberland. D.H. Day was a visionary; an entrepreneur.

Northern Michigan continues to produce a wide variety of fruit including cherries, apples, peaches, apricots, pears, and now grapes. He donated land to the State of Michigan to create its first state park and campground-what we now know as D. H. Day Campground.Superimposed over the large background photo at the top of the panel are two additional images. The image on the left depicts a mostly yellow and black pamphlet showing a map route leading east from Chicago around the lower tip of Lake Michigan near the bottom of the map, then north along the lake's eastern coastline through several towns and cities, finally ending at Mackinaw at the top of the map. A title on the pamphlet reads: \"West Michigan Pike, Northern Link of the Dixie Highway.\" A caption accompanying this image reads:To promote automobile tourism as a future industry for Glen Haven and the region, Day always properly graded the roads. He personally financed the construction of M-109, which today is called the D. H. Day Highway, and was on the board of the West Michigan Pike.A smaller black-and-white photo located to the right of and slightly overlapping the pamphlet image shows 2 dirt roads merging into one as it leads between 2 stone pillars flanking a wide entrance to the open landscape beyond. A small sign affixed to a pole standing at the fork in the road reads: \"Campers Welcome.\" This photo's caption explains:The extensive network of Michigan State Parks was begun under Day's leadership. The tourism industry, based on the beautiful natural resources of Northern Michigan, continues to be a main source of economic vitality for the region.The wayside's second panel, entitled \"Welcome to Glen Haven!\", features a black-and-white map drawing of the land area between Glen Lake, appearing in green along the top of the panel, and Lake Michigan, also green, located at the bottom of the panel. Text below the wayside's title reads:Back when this area was first getting settled, there were no trains, and roads were just sandy ruts. If you had visited then, you would have come by boat-the main mode of transportation. Along the route, little villages, like Glen Haven provided essential services for passing vessels and travelers: a long dock out to deep water for loading and unloading vessels, wood cut and dried for fuel, a blacksmith shop for repairs, a general store for buying a hat to replace the one that blew off in the last storm, and a boarding house for lodging folks waiting to resume their journey. Today, many of those towns have disappeared, others have grown into big cities with no trace of the old village, but this frontier port still stands because resident and ambitious businessman David Henry, or D. H., Day's vision and innovative enterprises wouldn't let it die.Superimposed over this larger map in the panel's lower left corner is a smaller map showing the roads and buildings of Glen Haven Historic Village. This map insert is a magnified version of Glen Haven as it appears on the larger map near the panel's lower right corner. On this map, Glen Haven village is situated above Glen Haven dock, which extends into Lake Michigan.The third panel is a color map of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Most of the panel's left side and its entire top half is colored blue to indicate Lake Michigan and Manitou Passage. Pictured in green in the middle of the lake to the west and north of the passage are South Manitou Island and North Manitou Island, respectively. A notation tells us that the elevation of Lake Michigan is 580 feet, or 177 meters. A key in the panel's top right quadrant indicates the location of various features including wilderness areas, picnic areas, campgrounds, beach access areas, ranger stations, and 13 hiking and/or skiing trails.

            "audioDescription": "Now draw your attention to a wayside panel located off the pullout on the right. Entitled \"The Dune Cycle,\" this panel features 10 color drawings picturing a single high dune in various stages from bare sand to coverage by a full forest. Text below the wayside's title tells us: You are standing on a battlefield. The forest is advancing on the dunes; meanwhile, dunes are infiltrating the forest. Believe it or not, 80% of the park is forested, but at one time most of that land was bare sand. Ecologists call this cycle of transformation \"succession.\" It starts with sand and wind. Long ago, glaciers created the sand; the wind comes from Lake Michigan. As the sand piles up, plants anchor the dunes. However, when hikers walk on dune grasses, the sand compacts and crushes their fragile roots. With no roots to hold the dune in place, it blows away, creating big cavities called \"blowouts.\" At the next stop, you will learn how a blowout has mortally wounded the Sleeping Bear. The 10 drawings representing the dune cycle are arranged along the panel's top, bottom, and side edges. They are labeled \"A\" through \"J\" in a clockwise fashion with drawing \"A\" located in the middle of the panel's left edge and drawing \"J\" appearing directly below drawing \"A\" in the panel's bottom left corner. Text accompanying these drawings reads: A. Blowin' in the Wind. How sand moves in the wind depends on the size of the grains. Large grains tumble or \"creep\" along the ground.

The Lake Michigan Overlook is the crown jewel of the Scenic Drive; no words can really describe its beauty. This is why you came to the dunes, isn't it? The overlook opens to a myriad of blues from shore to horizon, to glorious sunsets, and brilliant night skies. A popular stop, you'll find lots of people, but there's plenty of room for everyone.<br /> <br /> From the platform, about 450 feet above the lake, if the visibility is good, you will see South Manitou Island ten miles to the northwest; Empire Bluffs four miles to the south; and Platte Bay beyond that. Still further south is Point Betsie, the farthest point of land you can see, 15 miles away as the crow flies. Wisconsin is 54 miles due west, but thanks to the curvature of the earth, you will not see any \"cheeseheads\" waving back at you! Lake Michigan is the largest lake completely within the United States and is the fourth largest fresh-water lake in the world.<br /> <br /> The bluff has been wearing back at the rate of about a foot per year. Waves wear away the base the bluff and sand and rocks from above slide down to the beach. This process has gone on for many years, so we can infer that this hill once extended much further out into the lake. The shallow waters offshore also seem to indicate that a peninsula once extended from here about 2 miles out into the lake. This means that the site of this overlook used to be inland protected from the strong winds off the lake.<br /> <br /> The vast majority of visitors take in the view from atop the bluff and don't risk erosion, injury, and rescue fees by going down-not to mention the hour or two it can take to climb up!<br /> <br /> Take your time, your camera, and a deep breath. Spend some time at the waysides. Learn about the legend and perhaps an Anishinaabek word or two, the migration of the mother bear, and treacherous seas.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A paved path through a section of maple-beech forest leads to the wooden boardwalk that is the approach to Lake Michigan Overlook. This boardwalk winds upward and then downward through sand to a ramp offering a final descent to the overlook's observation deck. The deck is positioned atop a steep bluff that descends to the lake's shoreline 450 feet below. The boardwalk leading to the observation deck's long approach ramp is flush with the sand and without railings. The last leg of this boardwalk slopes downward as it meets the steep ramp, which continues sloping downward, without steps. Both the ramp and deck have 4-foot-high safety railings on all sides. The rectangular area forming the deck is flat, positioned directly above Lake Michigan's shoreline. There is a wooden bench with a back and arms located alongside the boardwalk on your right as you approach the observation deck and another bench placed along the paved path where the 2 paths join.<br />Although much of the bluff is made of a mixture of sand, gravel, and rocks, sparse native plants-grasses and low bushes- are also present. On a clear day, this overlook offers visitors a wide view that includes, to the left, or south, Empire Bluffs and Platte Point, and to the right, or north, South Manitou Island. A small sign affixed atop a wooden pole located to the right of the boardwalk entrance reads: \"Warning. Sand Slide Area. Steep Bluffs. Stay on Trail.\" Affixed to the pole below the sign is a laminated paper sheet entitled \"Sleeping Bear Dunes: Have a Safe Visit. Lake Michigan Overlook number 9.\" Additional information listed as bullet points reads: The National Park Service recommends that you do not attempt to climb down the dune in Lake Michigan. Climbing this dune causes erosion and impacts the dune ecosystem. Every year, people have to be rescued; some of them are seriously ill or injured. Rescue could take hours, cost you several thousand dollars, and put rescuers at risk of injury. It is best to enjoy the view from the top! One last sentence appearing in red lettering above an image of the black, white, and yellow National Park Service Search & Rescue emblem reads: Be Prepared and Stay Safe! Text on a second sign located alongside the boardwalk as you near the deck ramp issues one final warning: Enjoy the view from here. Don't risk injury and rescue fees by going down or the 2 hours it may take to climb back up!",

The wind action alone can dry out plants, expose root systems, or even completely bury vegetation, including trees.<br /> <br /> The cottonwood is the only common tree of the dunes and is well adapted to the dune environment. Because it grows fast, the tree can keep pace with burial by sand. Cottonwood trees grow in a cluster. They reproduce by cloning, sprouting new trunks from roots. The network of roots helps to hold the sand in place, and the tree itself acts as a windbreak, stabilizing the dunes. The dense root networks of various grasses also hold the sand in place. Once the dune is stabilized, new plants can begin growing on it, plants which are not able to survive on an active dune. Common juniper, the evergreen shrub growing among the grasses, is one of the typical plants of stabilized dunes.<br /> <br /> The dunes cover just a small area because they depend on strong winds off Lake Michigan to exist. The active dune zone extends for only about a mile from the lake. Further inland, the wind loses its energy and can no longer build dunes.<br /> The basswood tree across the road is a good example of the contest between trees and vegetation and the wind. Wind action has been threatening the tree's stability. If you were that tree, how much longer do you think you could keep your balance and stay standing?<br /> <br /> As you continue on to the Lake Michigan Overlook, notice the startling contrast between the open, sunny environment of the dunes and the lush, shady world of the beech-maple forest. Sugar maples and American beech are the predominant trees, but non-native insects and diseases are having a devastating effect on these forests. Beech bark disease is killing the beach trees, emerald ash borer, the ash trees. Most of these non-native pests are moved into the Lakeshore by hitching a ride on firewood. Help up protect the forest by leaving your firewood at home!</p>",
            "audioDescription": "As you leave the dunes area and step into the site's maple-beech forest, you will encounter a basswood tree located on your left. This tree is located across the street from a pullout on the right. The rough bark on both the tree's trunk and its wide-stretching limbs has a mottled dark gray surface. Twisted around one another and extending outward several feet just above and along the sandy ground surrounding the basswood's trunk are a series of gnarled branches and exposed roots. Take care as you approach the tree, as these branches and roots may present a tripping hazard.",

But, as the family grew and needs changed, each generation put their mark on the home, whether this was by adding new rooms or changing the function of already established spaces. </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ee9454-4d85-4920-8486-8aa46693dfff}{46}\" paraid=\"546982494\">William Floyd inherited the home, wealth, and status of the family when he was just 20 years old. Roughly a month after proclaiming his support for independence in July 1776, William Floyd and his family were forced to flee their estate as British forces moved to occupy the grounds. Redcoats quartered in the Old Mastic House for the duration of the Revolutionary War as Long Island remained a royalist stronghold. According to family lore, “Unka Steve” an enslaved man from Barbados was entrusted with staying behind to observe and report on the occupation of the estate.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ee9454-4d85-4920-8486-8aa46693dfff}{108}\" paraid=\"1457700930\">In 1783, Floyd returned to the estate with his family and began the work to restore the estate which was in disrepair after its occupation by the British. Floyd’s 1792 portrait shows the updated and expanded home, with a new main hall and parlor as well as east and west service wings. When Thomas Jefferson and James Madison visited Floyd in 1791, they would have seen a stately manor house and a thriving productive farm. </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ee9454-4d85-4920-8486-8aa46693dfff}{156}\" paraid=\"865784271\">William Floyd left the estate to his son Nicoll in 1803 when he moved with his second wife and two young daughters to Westernville, NY. The home remained in the family for many generations.  </p>",

            "audioDescription": "The Blacksmith shed contains artifacts and exhibits. It is a short walk down the road from the pier. Restrooms and the Orientation exhibit area are nearby. The one room shed measures 10 feet by fifteen feet. A 6-foot extension wall to the left of the building creates an open-air porch with a steeply pitched shake roof. Two door openings provide access. The walls are of two different styles, flat horizontal boards and board and batten. The interior floor is dirt. The open doorway, one small square window, and cracks between the wall boards let sunlight into the space. The interior and porch area exhibits are described in the next section starting with the interior exhibit panels and artifacts. As you enter the shop, a large piece of free standing equipment is in the left corner of the room, a vise with drill press. The metal column comes up from a base at the floor and holds the circular drill table at waist height. The column continues up to the chuck and spindle where a capstan wheel adjusts the height of the drill. A plaque on the base of the vice reads: Press and Vise The blacksmith shop was a machine shop as well as a forge. This press which dates back to the Caire era (1880-1932) was used for drilling and threading pipes. An exhibit panel on the back wall behind the vice displays a black and white photograph of the exterior of the blacksmith shop. Text reads: The Blacksmith Shop The blacksmith shop was a hot, noisy, sweaty place, but it played a key role at Scorpion Ranch. An isolated ranch needed to be self-sufficient – a blacksmith shop made this possible. The blacksmith was kept busy making or repairing Scorpion’s tools and gear. Everything with metal parts passed through the smithy – on a given day the blacksmith might shoe horses, repair wagon wheels, sharpen plows and make oar locks. Continuing around the room to the right, hanging from the walls and on display are a variety of implements, chains, farm tools, building supplies, horseshoes, an anvil and another drill press in the forge area behind a waist high exhibit shelf that runs the length of the room and divides the forge area from the entryway. The shelf sits on top of a wall of ornamental ironwork crafted out of blacksmith tools welded together in an artful style. The exhibit area from left to right has a series of six tools mounted to a panel and labeled by letter. They are meant to be touched. a. Shovel b. Poker c. Tongs d. Pritchel e. Forepunch f. Iron Bar Text reads: A Day at the Forge Basic blacksmithing didn’t require much – only a hot fire, simple tools and brute strength. “Forging” is changing the shape of a piece of metal by heating and hammering it. It’s a very physical process. Although the Scorpion blacksmith shop was probably operated by one person, an assistant “striker” may have added his blows when vigorous hammering was needed. Leg vises anchored to the floor gave the blacksmith extra support when hammering. Three line drawings illustrate a portable forge, an anvil and a grindstone Text reads: portable forge- Not all blacksmithing at Scorpion took place in the shop. This portable hand forge and leg vise were taken out into the field, probably for shoeing horses. anvil An anvil is the iron block on which the blacksmith works metal. To keep it steady, this anvil was mounted on a sturdy log embedded in the dirt floor grindstone The blacksmith held a tool against the stone to sharpen it. Foot pedals made it easier to keep the stone turning. The next exhibit along the shelf describes how to make a horseshoe in 12 steps. 1. Build a fire in the forge. Use blacksmithing coal, (a soft coal, free from impurities). When packed down around the fi re, it changes to coke, a lightweight material that burns with a clean, intense flame. 2. Use the shovel and poker to adjust the fire. 3. Use your left hand to work the bellows or crank the blower to add oxygen to the fire so it burns hotter. 4. Stick the iron bar into the forge to heat. 5. Heat the section you’ll be working onto a bright-red heat, almost but not quite white hot. 6. Using the tongs, draw the iron bar out of the fire and turn to the anvil. 7. Pick up a small hammer. 8. Using the round face of the hammer, bend the iron bars over the anvil. 9. Once the horseshoe is the right shape, start the nailholes using a forepunch. The shape of the punch should exactly match the head of the nail. 10. Hammer a stamp into the hole to make a space for the shank of the nail. 11. Sharpen the pritchel on the grindstone. To complete the hole, hammer a pritchel into the hole. A little piece will drop out. 12. Lay the shoe flat on the anvil and hammer all around to level. Text continues: The island needed a gang of blacksmiths The Scorpion smith was in good company – there were once six blacksmith shops on the island. Blacksmiths at the satellite ranches, or outranches, dealt with day to day objects, while hinges, ornamental ironwork and railings were made at the main ranch bla",

Though visitors probably can’t see all of the city’s offerings in one trip, the Historic Paducah Audio Tour makes it easier to see some of the places that played an interesting role in Paducah’s history.</p> <p>Starting the tour at the Visitor’s Bureau (formerly a Victorian storefront), visitors will be able to see some of Paducah’s major landmarks, such as the National Quilt Museum, as well as its more less recognized buildings, including the sleek and modern city hall from 1965 and the gorgeous cast-iron storefront of the Cohen Building from the 1870s. The highlight of the Historic Paducah Audio Tour is perhaps the riverfront, which acts as the focal point for past and present-day life in Paducah.</p> <p>Whether this is your first time in Paducah or your 50th, the Historic Paducah Audio Tour will offer a unique perspective of this charming city.

Their journey’s endpoint is where Confluence’s work began, with an installation that draws together the site’s bay side and ocean side, interweaving the stories of the Corps of Discovery expedition and the Chinook people in a single, steadily unfolding experience.</p> <p>Visit the site today to find a restored native landscape that integrates artist Maya Lin’s artwork with the site’s shifting cultural and ecological history. As you walk along oceanfront dunes, read excerpts from Lewis and Clark’s journals and see the Pacific Ocean as they saw it. Run your hands along the smooth surface of a fish-cleaning table formed from a single block of native basalt and inscribed with a Chinook creation story. Follow a path of crushed oyster shells inland from the coastal forest, and read the text of a Chinook song of praise along the way. Encounter a group of five cedar driftwood columns surrounding a cedar tree trunk that existed before Lewis and Clark arrived.</p> <p>Confluence’s Cape Disappointment site is complete and was dedicated on May 7, 2006. Two self-guided tours are available.</p> <h4>Waikiki Beach Self-Guided Tour:</h4> <p><strong>1. Cedar Circle </strong><br /> In a secluded grove, cedar driftwood columns surround a cedar tree trunk that predates Lewis and Clark’s arrival.</p> <p><strong>2. Amphitheater and Walkway</strong></p> <p>From the existing amphitheater, a path of crushed oyster shells leads you from the coastal forest environment through dune grasses to a secluded grove. As you walk, read the lyrics of a Chinook praise song that was recited at this site on November 18, 2005, the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s arrival.</p> <p><strong>3. Boardwalk</strong></p> <p>Along one of several trails at the site, learn about Lewis and Clark’s 4,133-mile journey from St. Louis to the Pacific in their own words. Read text from their journals inscribed in a boardwalk that leads from an existing amphitheater to Waikiki Beach.</p> <h4>Baker Bay Self-Guided Tour</h4> <p><strong>1. Fish Cleaning Table</strong></p> <p>Cut from a single polished block of native basalt, this artistic fish-cleaning table is inscribed with a Chinook origin legend that tells the story of the interdependence of the Chinook people and the Columbia River’s salmon.</p> <p><strong>2. Overlook</strong></p> <p>A simple, curved viewing platform offers an unobstructed view of Baker Bay and its surroundings. Text from the Lewis and Clark journals etched into the surface of the platform evokes the scene and moment they finally arrived at their destination.</p> <p>Confluence connects you to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices.

Each one frames and tells you a little bit more about this place in terms of the Native American tribes who came here, and this was a very important place for them.”</em></p> <p>– Maya Lin</p> </blockquote> <p>Lewis and Clark first passed what is now Confluence Story Circles at Sacajawea State Park on October 16, 1805. Because of its significance as a well-established gathering place for Native people, the explorers knew where they were for the first time since entering uncharted territory. Maya Lin has designed seven story circles that explore the Native cultures, language, flora and fauna, geology, and natural history of the site. As you pass from one story circle to the next, consider how the intersection of the Snake and Columbia rivers, cultures, communities, and environmental forces have shaped and continue to affect the land around you.</p> <h4>Story Circles</h4> <p>Maya Lin’s artwork at Sacajawea State Park tells the tales of people, place and the connection between them in text etched into seven circles, some raised above and some lowered into the ground. The information in the story circles comes from tribal stories, Lewis and Clark’s journals, Yakama elder and Sahaptin speaker Virginia Beavert, Ph.D., and the natural history of this site, which has been a gathering place for Native people for more than 10,000 years.</p> <h4>Timeline</h4> <p>The formal dedication of the site happened on Friday, August 27, 2010. The dedication was highlighted by tribal, local and civic speeches, music, and prose. Maya Lin presented her thoughts to an audience of more than 300.</p> <h4>Partners</h4> <p>Sacajawea State Park is managed by Washington Sate Parks with support from the Friends of Sacajawea State Park.</p> <h4>Directions to Sacajawea State Park</h4> <p>From Highway 12 in Pasco, WA, follow Sacajawea Park Rd to the park entrance. The Confluence Story Circles are in the treed area where the two rivers meet.</p> <p>Note: This Washington State Park requires a <a href=\"https://discoverpass.wa.gov/\">Discover Pass</a>, $30 Annual or $10 One Day. Fees may apply. Open April 1 to October 31. The parks’ interpretive center is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Call 509-545-2361 for tours and more information.</p> <h4>About Confluence</h4> <p>Confluence connects you to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices. We are a community-supported nonprofit that works through six art landscapes, educational programs, and public gatherings in collaboration with northwest tribes, communities, and the celebrated artist Maya Lin. For more information, call (360) 693-0123.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Lost Horse Mine was one of the few successful mining operations of the more than 300 mines in what is now Joshua Tree National Park. The mining rights were originally purchased by Johnny Lang for $1,000. Realizing for safety that he needed more people in such a remote location, Lang brought in three partners before they were ultimately bought out in 1895 by J.D. Ryan, a wealthy rancher from Montana. From 1894 to 1931 the mine produced more than 10,000 ounces of gold and 16,000 ounces of silver (worth approximately $5 million today).<br /> <br /> According to legend, the day shift was producing significantly more than the night shift so Ryan hired a private investigator to figure out what was happening. Upon discovering that Lang was pocketing half the ore for himself, Ryan forced Lang to decide between selling out or going to jail. Ultimately Lang sold his share and moved his prospecting to a nearby canyon.<br /> <br /> In 1905, miners hit a fault and lost the vein of ore forever. Over the next couple of decades the mine changed hands several times and went through long periods of inactivity before ultimately becoming a part of Joshua Tree National Monument in 1936.<br /> <br /> Today, the Lost Horse Mine can be reached on the Lost Horse Mine Loop Trail as part of a four mile out and back hike with 550 feet of elevation or as part of a longer loop for those that want a longer hike. Fences have been placed around the mine for safety, do not try to cross the fence and enter the mine as the area is unstable. Historic structures may seem safe but can easily crumble under a person's weight. Do not be fooled by appearances! Lost Horse Mine is a unique place and an important part of Joshua Tree's history. Please protect this place and report graffiti and other vandalism to <a href=\"mailto:JOTR_Graffiti@nps.gov\">JOTR_Graffiti@nps.gov</a>.</p>",

But around each lot they left a border, or bauk, of trees; great old oaks, tall hickories and pines to stand against the sky-line.\"  <br /> <br /> - Cornelia Floyd Nichols, Letters to My Great-Great-Granddaughter, June 1934 </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{19fcff96-8264-496d-b9da-e05a8e635772}{252}\" paraid=\"230806920\">When Nicoll Floyd (1705-1755) established his home on this land, he situated the manor house about a mile back from the water. From this location, the home was not only protected from the harshest winds and storms, but it also provided the family with a view of activities in the lower acreage, Moriches Bay, and Fire Island. Enslaved Blacks developed the lower acreage into an elaborate grid of cultivated fields, pastures and ponds. The farm prospered through the late 18th century and early 19th century, as William Floyd and his son Nicoll employed the skilled labor of enslaved Blacks, free and indentured Indigenous people from the neighboring Poospatuck reservation, and free day laborers.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a87064e-a240-49e2-ac4e-f57f824ee887}{13}\" paraid=\"1613328374\">When the Floyds scaled back and eventually abandoned farming in the late 19th century, they maintained the fields and trails for recreation and hunting. John Treadwell Nichols, husband of William Floyd’s great-great-granddaughter Cornelia, was Curator of Birds and Fishes for the Museum of Natural History in New York. For John and his son David, the estate was an invaluable resource for the study of birds and animals. While you wander the estate, you might even come across a box turtle that was marked and tracked by John, David, and even now National Park Service staff.  </p>",

Today the Unkechaug Nation is centered nearby at the Poospatuck reservation. Poospatuck, meaning “where the waters meet,” is one of the oldest recognized sovereign Native American reservations in the United States. Over the centuries the Unkechaug have fished, farmed, hunted, lived and worked on this land.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19fcff96-8264-496d-b9da-e05a8e635772}{64}\" paraid=\"21471750\">When European colonists arrived in the 17th century they utilized a complex legal system and foreign bureaucratic procedures to dispossess Indigenous Long Islanders of their land, conferring ownership to individuals and making claims to large areas such as the Manor of St. George, patented originally to William “Tangier” Smith. While the land that would become the William Floyd Estate was originally deeded to the Unkechaug in perpetuity from the Manor of St. George, it was later sold by the Smith family to William Floyd’s grandfather, Richard Floyd II. </p> <p paraeid=\"{19fcff96-8264-496d-b9da-e05a8e635772}{90}\" paraid=\"1376217041\">Soon after purchasing the more than 4,000 acres of land in 1718, laborers for the Floyd family began the back-breaking work of clearing fields, constructing ditches, planting and tending crops, and doing the innumerable agricultural and domestic jobs that were required to establish and operate a farm of this scale. This work was largely performed by indentured and enslaved people until slavery was abolished in New York in 1827 and indentured servitude was phased out by the Floyds in the mid 19th century. Immigrant wage labor entered the mix in the 1840s and continued into the 20th century. As you walk through the land, look for the ditches and mounds that continue to mark the edges of long abandoned fields, the “lopped” trees that were bent over to create living fences, and the cleared fields that once grew corn, rye, wheat, and clover.  </p>",

It is a phonetic spelling of the word “Pightle,” which referred to a small enclosure near a house or a piece of land in an open field. It initially served as the headlands to the agricultural fields and pastures of the lower acreage, a brief break in the landscape between the manicured lawn of the family home and the commercial enterprise of the working farm. By the 1860s, however, the Floyd family chose to give up farming in favor of careers in politics and law. As the house became a summer retreat for hunting and entertaining guests, the Pikle became a borderland for the forest that grew up around the home. Today, it continues to serve as a haven for wild birds and animals.  </p>",

            "bodyText": "RIVER RAISIN History<br /> <br /> Why is it called River Raisin?<br /> The River Raisin went by several different names throughout history. Natives called the river Nummasepee, or ‘River of Sturgeon’. The river’s extensive floodplains created extensive sturgeon breeding grounds that fed into Lake Erie. French explorers called it La Rivière aux Raisins (The River with Grapes), because of the wild grapes growing along its banks. The British found it easier just to call it River Raisin.<br /> <br /> Early River Raisin settlers were often called “The French”. They were descendants of the original colonists who left France for Canada in the mid-1600s. Over the generations, many French-Canadians moved to Detroit. Finally, many Detroiters with French-Canadian heritage moved to River Raisin. They were French-speakers, faithfully maintaining French cultural traditions, especially their devout Catholicism. So – in the centuries of living in North America, these people were called “The French”. River Raisin settlers were also called habitants, which is French for ‘inhabitants’, and Canadiens, French-speaking settlers of French-Canadian heritage. The Settlement itself was often called “Frenchtown” by non-French speaking outsiders.<br /> <br /> Was French the Only Language Spoken at the Settlement?<br /> Definitely not! The non-Native settlers were vastly outnumbered by Native people living in the area. In the early days, the most successful communicators at River Raisin spoke French, at least one Native language, and maybe some English. Hundreds of young habitants left Detroit and settled along the River Raisin, to build businesses and start new farms and families. Many already had productive relationships with Native Tribes who had land on River Raisin. The “newcomers” negotiated deeds for land with Tribal friends, mainly the Potawatomi, Wyandot, Ottawa and Chippewa. While the British ruled the region, it was illegal to negotiate private land grants between the “French” settlers and Tribes, however, they did not enforce these laws. When the region became part of the United States, non-Native landowners were permitted to keep the property they had obtained from the Tribes in order to gain their allegiance.<br /> <br /> The first Non-Native settler was a “French” settler, twenty-one-year-old François Navarre. His family had lived in Detroit for many years and were highly regarded in government and business. Navarre took up residence at River Raisin in 1785 and persuaded a number of friends and relatives to join him. Navarre was an undisputed community, business and church leader when first the British, and then the Americans, controlled the River Raisin Settlement. He served as a ranking officer in River Raisin’s militia, opposing the British in the Battles of the River Raisin. Sometimes called “the Father of Monroe”, François Navarre died in 1826 and is buried in Monroe’s Old Burial Ground. <br /> <br /> Why Were Many River Raisin Properties Called “Ribbon Farms”?<br /> River Raisin settlers wanted ‘riverfront property’. This would provide direct access to fresh water for residents, crops and livestock; food from abundant fishing and waterfowl; and essential transportation by water (in these early times, the land routes were only dirt trails through dense forests). To achieve this, the settlers adopted a system their ancestors had used in Canada. Properties were very narrow, but they extended away from the river for up to three miles. Because they were long and narrow, the plots were nicknamed ribbon farms. Homes and outbuildings (barn, stable, smokehouse, etc.) were located close to the chemin, a dirt trail that followed the river on both banks. This style of farm ensured that neighbors’ houses or cabins were within shouting distance of each other, facilitating communications, especially during times of danger. They were also within walking distance for nightly social activities. Ribbon farms were originally ‘subsistence’ farms, producing food that would provide only for the resident family. The farms typically yielded corn, wheat, oats, vegetables, orchard fruits, and livestock.<br /> <br /> Over the years, the River Raisin Settlement evolved from a frontier outpost to a community, after Detroit, becoming the second largest European settlement in the Michigan Territory. The earliest settlers were fur traders, providing equipment, food, clothing, tools, weapons, alcohol and other items, in exchange for furs from throughout the Great Lakes. The furs would then be shipped first to Canada, and then to European markets. By the 1790s, a bakery and several mills and distilleries were in operation. Extensive orchards had been planted, and the settlement was producing surplus cider, corn and wheat for the Indian fur trade and to supply military garrisons. Blacksmiths fabricated household items and repaired firearms, kettles and traps. Silversmiths fashioned household items and produced regalia that the traders exchanged with the Indians for furs and pelts. Some Detroit merchants owned property fronting on the River Raisin, with hired labor or tenants who worked their farms, stores, mills and distilleries.<br /> <br /> As a result of the 1795 Jay Treaty, British troops withdrew from Detroit finally placing the Michigan Territory under American control. A number of non-French settlers arrived, many were American citizens, descendants of colonists from Great Britain or other European countries. The French often referred to them simply as ‘Yankees’. Under the governance of the United States, River Raisin Settlement saw the creation of a militia (part-time military forces similar to today’s National Guard), effective law enforcement and a functional legal system). The influx of new residents strained relations between the settlers and Native people. In 1806, the local militia built a 200-foot square stockade with a blockhouse inside. Named the Wayne Stockade after U.S. General “Mad” Anthony Wayne, the structure was intended as a refuge for River Raisin settlers in the event of Native raids. This structure was burnt down in August 1812 after the surrender of the Michigan Territory.<br /> <br /> Today the Frenchtown Unit contains the highest concentration of sites related to the Battles of the River Raisin (also called the Battles of Frenchtown) and their aftermath. We encourage you to begin your tour by visiting the Battlefield’s Visitor Center in Monroe. Open year-round, the visitor center offers exhibits and activities for people of all ages. You can explore what was at stake through the stories of the many groups who violently collided in defense of their nations and how the aftermath of the battles continues to influence us today. The River Raisin Trade Depot, located inside the visitor center, offers educational books, games, souvenirs and more for sale. From the visitor center, you can follow the trails to important locations within the battlefield, which extends all the way from Lake Erie to the east and downtown Monroe, Michigan to the west.<br /> <br /> Location: River Raisin National Battlefield Park Visitor & Education Center 333 North Dixie Highway Monroe, MI 48162 Phone: 734-243-7136 Hours: 10am – 6pm, 7 days a week<br /> <br /> Admission Fee: NO<br /> Things to do: Parking: Parking is available<br /> River Access: Trail Access: YES Passport Stamp: YES",

Seeming to change shape in the summer fog or afternoon heat, the three islets of Anacapa look like an island of deception or a mirage. Almost five miles long, these islets (appropriately named East, Middle, and West Anacapa Islands) are inaccessible from each other except by boat. They have a total land area of about one square mile (700 acres). Waves have eroded the volcanic island, creating towering sea cliffs, sea caves, and natural bridges, such as forty-foot-high Arch Rock-a symbol of Anacapa and Channel Islands National Park.<br /> <br /> Exploring East Anacapa's two-mile trail system allows visitors to experience the island's native vegetation, wildlife, and cultural history. Although for much of the year the island vegetation looks brown and lifeless, the winter rains transform the landscape. Emerging from dormancy, the native plants come alive with color. The strange tree sunflower, or coreopsis, blossoms with bright yellow bouquets that are so vivid and numerous they can sometimes be seen from the mainland. Vibrant red paintbrush, island morning glory, and pale buckwheat add touches of color to the island's palette.<br /> <br /> Seabirds are probably the most conspicuous wildlife on Anacapa Island. Thousands of birds use Anacapa as a nesting area because of the relative lack of predators on the island. While the steep cliffs of West Anacapa are home to the largest breeding colony of endangered California brown pelicans, all the islets of Anacapa host the largest breeding colony of western gulls in the world. Western gulls begin their nesting efforts at the end of April, sometimes making their shallow nests just inches from island trails. Fluffy chicks hatch in May and June and fly away from the nest in July.<br /> <br /> The rocky shores of Anacapa are perfect resting and breeding areas for California sea lions and harbor seals. The raucous barking of sea lions can be heard from most areas of the island. Two overlooks (Cathedral Cove and Pinniped Point) provide excellent spots to look down on seals and sea lions in the island coves.<br /> <br /> Anacapa's rich kelp forests (ideal for kayaking, snorkeling, and diving) and tidepool areas provide visitors with the opportunity to meet some of the resident ocean animals up close. Visitors may also catch a glimpse of the fascinating undersea world of the kelp forest without getting wet. During the spring and summer, park rangers dive into the Landing Cove on East Anacapa with a video camera. Visitors can see, through the eye of the camera, what the diver is seeing-bright sea stars, spiny sea urchins, and brilliant orange Garibaldi-by watching video monitors located on the dock, in the mainland visitor center auditorium, in classrooms, or via the Internet. And, divers can answer questions from visitors as part of this distance learning program.<br /> <br /> Anacapa Island has a rich human history as well. Shell midden sites indicate where Chumash people camped on the islands thousands of years ago. In addition, visitors can view the 1932 light station whose mission revival style buildings include the lighthouse, fog signal building, one of four original keeper's quarters, a water tank building, and several other service buildings. The original lead-crystal Fresnel lens, which served as a beacon to ships until an automated light replaced it in 1990, is on exhibit in the East Anacapa Visitor Center.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Island Facts</strong></u></p> <p>- Located in Ventura County.<br /> <br /> - Fourteen miles from Ventura.<br /> <br /> - Five miles long and 1/4 mile wide.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall is between eight and thirteen inches per year.<br /> <br /> - Supports 265 species of plants, including two found only on Anacapa and 20 found only on the Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa deer mouse is only found on Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> - West Anacapa is home to the largest breeding colony of California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> - Scripps's murrelet colonies are recovering following rat eradication in 2002.<br /> <br /> - Frenchy LeDreau lived at Frenchys Cove from 1928 to 1956.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa lighthouse, turned on in 1932, was the last permanent lighthouse built on the West Coast.<br /> <br /> - Harbor seals and California sea lions rest and breed on the island.<br /> <br /> - Home to 30 sea caves.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Things to Do</strong></u></p> <p>Anacapa Island is the perfect place for a half-day, one-day, or short overnight camping trip. If you have time to visit just one island, this may be the place. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Anacapa Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived. For more information than what is listed below visit: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/\">nps.gov/chis</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips year round. Travel time is about one hour.Almost all trips are to East Anacapa Island. A limited number of trips are offered throughout the year to Frenchys Cove on West Anacapa Island. Visitors must climb from the boat up a steel-rung ladder to a dock. Once ashore, visitors must climb 157 stairs to the top of the island. Non-landing trips are also available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is no water available on the island. Visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> Picnic tables are available at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> A small visitor center is located in one of the historic Coast Guard buildings. Features include displays on the natural and cultural resources of the island and the original lead-crystal Fresnel lens from the Anacapa Lighthouse.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats run to the islands, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after Island Packers boats arrive on the island. During the spring and summer, Channel Islands Live programs are offered where park rangers with special microphone-equipped dive masks and underwater video cameras descend into towering kelp forests and interact with you on this virtual underwater hike.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Although hiking options are limited with only two miles of trails, the scenery is unmatched. Except for the staircase to the top of the island, the figure eight-shaped trail system is relatively flat and easy while meandering over gentle slopes to dramatic overlooks, magnificent coastal views, and the last permanent lighthouse built on the West Coast. Hikers must stay on trails to protect fragile vegetation and nesting seabirds and for visitor safety. Middle Anacapa and West Anacapa are not open to hiking. They are set aside for the island wildlife except for Frenchys Cove on West Anacapa that can be reached only by boat.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available (seven sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided. No water is available. Distance from landing to campground is one-half mile and includes a 157-stair climb.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. Since Anacapa is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove on East Anacapa via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. Excellent watersports can be experienced at the Landing Cove. The underwater visibility is usually very good and the water is teeming with life since it is located within a marine reserve. Kayaking east towards Arch Rock or west towards Cathedral Cove provides great wildlife viewing, sea caves, and arches.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the marine reserve that is located on the north side of Anacapa Island, including in the the Landing Cove. Also, no fishing is allowed (except for commercial and recreational lobster and pelagic finfish) in the marine conservation area on the north side of West Anacapa Island. Fishing is allowed outside these marine protected areas. To fish in Channel Islands National Park,m possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> There is excellent wildlife viewing on Anacapa. A variety of seabirds can be seen throughout the year, including brown pelicans, cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and western gulls (gull nesting and chicks can be observed from the end of April through July). Seals and sea lions may also be viewed from Pinniped Point, Cathedral Cove, and the boat. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. The brilliant yellow coreopsis flowers usually peak between late January and March. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. The only accessible site on Anacapa Island for tidepooling is at Frenchys Cove on West Anacapa Island. A limited number of trips are offered throughout the year by Island Packers.There is no access to Frenchys Cove or any other tidepools from East Anacapa.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Channel Islands Live: Webcams and Broadcasts</strong></u></p> <p>Remote, isolated, rugged, and sometimes inaccessible, the park can be challenging to experience. Now, through advanced technology, Channel Islands Live brings the park to you.<br /> <br /> Join rangers as they dive through Anacapa Island's towering kelp forests and hike it's dramatic trails.<br /> <br /> Channel Islands Live includes interactive broadcasts where visitors can talk to the rangers and ask questions, curriculum-based presentations for schools, and webcams for monitoring island and underwater features. By bridging the channel through technology we are helping plant the seeds of understanding that can grow into the desire to preserve and protect this extraordinary place.<br /> <br /> Park visitors and students can join us for these programs on Anacapa Island, at the Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center in Ventura Harbor, in classrooms, and on the Internet.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/live-programs.htm\">Live Broadcasts</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/ocean-webcam.htm\">Ocean Webcam</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/anacapa-landing-cove-webcam.htm\">Anacapa Island Webcam</a><br />  </p> <p><u><strong>History and Culture Overview</strong></u></p> <p>Just 13 miles from the Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center in Ventura, Anacapa Island is the second smallest of the Channel Islands at roughly five miles long and one-half mile wide. The native Chumash once called this island \"Ennepah,\" a word meaning deception or mirage which alluded to this island's changing shape when viewed at different times from the mainland and other islands. Anacapa is actually a narrow chain of three islands appropriately called East, Middle, and West Anacapa. Emerging from the fog of the Santa Barbara Channel, Anacapa Island drifts in and out of sight, beckoning visitors from the mainland as it has for centuries.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on Anacapa</strong><br /> Archeological evidence suggests that the native Chumash people were visiting Anacapa Island as long as 5,000 years ago. Abalone and mussel shells, bones from fish, birds, and pinnipeds, and human artifacts such as bone tools, shell beads, projectile points, and fish hooks all suggest extensive human activity on the island. Due to the absence of fresh water on the island, it is likely that seasonal camps were used for fishing and other activities.<br /> <br /> Despite the lack of archeological evidence of permanent settlements on the island, Chumash legend holds that the American Indian population of the Channel Islands began on Anacapa. In the early 20th century, anthropologist John Harrington extensively interviewed a Mission San Buenaventura Chumash man named Fernando Librado who told Harrington a story passed on orally through generations of Chumash Indians. According to the story, eight families traveled to Anacapa Island after a civil war on the mainland and settled on the north side of the middle island. For water, they dug a hole and used seepage at Indian Cave on West Anacapa. After a time, the eight families left Anacapa for Santa Cruz Island, eventually spreading to all the northern islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>European Contact</strong><br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was the first European explorer to make contact with the Channel Islands in 1542. Although he passed Anacapa, he and his crew never settled there. Cabrillo named the northern Islands Las Islas de San Lucas, which included Anacapa.<br /> <br /> Learning that there were no American Indians on the island, few European explorers visited Anacapa the following decades. Its small size and relative unimportance left the island largely unrecorded for a period of 250 years. The 1793 expedition by Englishman George Vancouver standardized the names of the Channel Islands. Vancouver recorded Anacapa as \"Enecapa\" and the present spelling appeared on maps in 1854.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ranching</strong><br /> Like many of the other Channel Islands, Anacapa Island was used for sheep ranching during the latter half of the 19th century. It is uncertain exactly when ranching began on Anacapa. It is believed that three men owned ranches prior to the first recorded lease which began in 1902. H. Bay Webster, himself a sheep rancher on the island, recalled that the first sheep ranch had been established by George Nidever before 1885, although he may have been confused with events on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> Ranchers used Middle Anacapa for the main headquarters of their sheep operations and the livestock were landed on the northwest side of the island. Sheep survived year-round, but on a marginal basis. With no dependable supply of fresh water, many recalled the somewhat dubious story that the sheep would lick the moisture from the morning fog off of each other's coats. To improve grazing, sheep ranchers introduced exotic grasses to the island. By the 1930s the sheep had destroyed most of the native plants and had begun to eat the endemic Astragalus miguelensis. As a result, many of the sheep died, bringing an end to sheep herding on Anacapa.<br /> <br /> <strong>Residents</strong><br /> Heaman Bayfield Webster, a former island seal hunter, long-time Ventura resident and assistant postmaster, established residence on Middle Anacapa with his wife and two sons in 1907. For $31 per year, he leased all three of the islands \"for grazing and farming only,\" establishing the first government-recorded ranch on Anacapa. The family spent summers and two winters on the island tending to a flock of nearly 300 sheep. In the fall of 1911, Webster set up a school in a tent for his children and hired a governess to teach them, the first school house on the Channel Islands. Most of Webster's income came from tourism and wool.<br /> <br /> Perhaps the most illustrious resident of Anacapa Island was Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau. The Frenchman made his way to the island in 1928, taking up the life of a fisherman and hermit. He built several huts perched on a ledge overlooking the area now called Frenchy's Cove. Focusing on lobster fishing, Frenchy sold fish to passing Larco Company boats and hosted visitors and fisherman passing by. Friends old and new brought him food and supplies in return for lobster, abalone, and conversation. He was an educated man, apt to discuss literature and sing an aria in a tenor voice. During prohibition he made money by watching over caches of liquor stored in many of Anacapa's caves by rumrunners and bootleggers.<br /> <br /> When the US Government created the Channel Islands National Monument in 1938, which included both Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands, it appeared that Frenchy might be forced to leave. So impressed, however, was National Park Service biologist Lowell Sumner with LeDreau's concern for the natural history and welfare of the island that Lowell suggested LeDreau \"be allowed to remain on the island as long as he desires.\" Frenchy became the de-facto caretaker of Anacapa Island for the National Park Service until 1956 when, at the age of 80, he was forced to leave after a fall left him with severe injuries. He had lived on Anacapa Island for 28 years.<br /> <br /> In 1932, the Anacapa Island Light Station was completed on East Anacapa Island. The lighthouse and fog signal are still operated by the US Coast Guard and the original Fresnel lens is on display in the island's visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>The National Park Service</strong><br /> On April 26, 1938, the Channel Islands National Monument was established. It included both Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands. Nearly twenty years later, in July 1959, Anacapa Island opened to visitors and provided park ranger services. Closest to the mainland, Anacapa is the second most visited island of the Channel Islands National Park.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong></u></p> <p>Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

Visitors may land here with their own boat or go with Island Packers.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Tidepooling</strong><br /> The only accessible site on Anacapa Island for tidepooling is at Frenchy's Cove on West Anacapa Island. A limited number of trips are offered throughout the year by Island Packers. There is no access to Frenchys Cove or any other tidepools from East Anacapa.<br /> <br /> Once at Frenchy's Cove, follow the trail east and then south as it wraps around to the other side (south side) of the island. From there, follow the beach west at low tide to the exposed tidepools near Cat Rock.<br /> <br /> Due to their relative isolation and protection, the tidepools in Channel Islands National Park are some of the best within southern California. Anemones, sea stars, urchins, limpets, periwinkles, chitons, barnacles, mussels, and many other beautiful species can be seen at numerous pristine tidepool sites such as Frenchys Cove.<br /> <br /> The area between the land and the sea is not distinct, but is a zone of transition. This area may be covered with water during high tide or exposed to sunlight during low tide. Life in this intertidal region must be the hardiest within the marine environment-able to withstand hours of exposure and the incessant pounding of the energy-filled surf.<br /> <br /> Intertidal life has adapted to the sea and the land. When looking at a tidepool area, notice how plants and animals may be found in certain areas and not in others. Those living in the upper splash zone are tolerant to sunlight, heat, and water loss and have either a means to \"shelter\" themselves or the ability to move into an area of greater moisture. An animal with a tightly closed shell or a shell firmly attached to rock will hold water within, so that it does not require water surrounding it at all times. Animals found in rock crevices and submerged pools usually require more moisture to prevent them from drying out.<br /> <br /> How an animal feeds often depends on its ability to move. An animal that moves about is able to search for its food. Some graze the rocks for algae, while others feed on settled debris. An animal that remains stationary feeds on food particles suspended within water.<br /> <br /> Because space is a limiting factor, there is competition between organisms. Many animals and plants are found in a small area, some may live on each other, or use an old shell as a surface on which to live. This is one important reason why collecting is not permitted-you may be taking away a home.<br /> <br /> Although hardy against the forces of nature, the plants and animals of the intertidal zone cannot entirely endure the impact of humans. Since individuals interact with one another, minute changes in the area could disrupt the entire community. While exploring, please keep in mind these tidepool tips:<br /> <br /> - Watch your step! The rocks can be very slippery and there may be small animals on the rocks.<br /> - Keep an eye on the waves. The surge can sneak up on you.<br /> - Take your time and look carefully. Tidepool organisms are often very small and camouflaged.<br /> - Do not collect anything! Not only is it unlawful, but if animals and shells are taken, there may be nothing left for others to enjoy.<br /> - If you pick up an animal to observe, please place it back where it was found. That particular spot is its home territory.<br /> <br /> Although you may not know the animals by name, through simple observation a great deal of information can be learned. Consider, for example, what keeps it from drying out? Why doesn't it get swept out to sea? Does it search for food or wait for food to come to it?<br />  </p> <p><strong>Tidepool Species</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Snails</strong></em><br /> Snails are abundant in the intertidal zone. Varieties include black and brown turban snails and periwinkles. At low tide some nestle tightly in crevices. Most snails graze on algae, scraping them off the rock with a rough, tongue-like radula.<br /> <br /> Snails can withdraw into their shells, behind a trapdoor-like bony plate called an operculum. This protects them from predators and water loss. Some exude mucus that coats their shells and helps them stick to the rocks and hold in precious moisture.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Barnacles</strong></em><br /> Related to crabs and shrimp, barnacles cluster on surfaces at every level of the intertidal zone. They attach themselves headfirst and use their feathery legs to absorb oxygen and net food that floats by. Barnacles' shells are a series of connected, overlapping plates. Some are volcano shaped and some are camouflaged to their surroundings. Varieties include the acorn, pink, and gooseneck barnacles.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>California Mussel</strong></em><br /> Mussels anchor themselves with tough, fibrous threads. Shells up to six inches long protect these animals. Their gills provide the mussels with oxygen and help them capture food. When the tide is in, they open just enough to filter the seawater for tiny floating plants and animals. As one of the most abundant animals in the intertidal zone, mussels are also a key food source for others in the food chain.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Chiton</strong></em><br /> Chitons cling to the rocks with their foot at low tides. When the tide is high and it is safe, they venture out to eat by scraping algae, bacteria, and diatoms off the rocks. Chitons blend in well with the rocks in the intertidal zone. Their shells are made of eight overlapping plates. Like pill bugs on land, these armored animals roll up to protect themselves from predators. The three-inch-long mossy chitons are one of several species here. Their mossy looks come from the stiff hairs that fringe their edges and the algae that often grow on their shells.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Algae</strong></em><br /> Algae are near the bottom of the tidepool food web. They use photosynthesis to capture light energy from the sun. Large algae cling to the rocks and seafloor with root-like holdfasts. Algae range in size from single-celled organisms to 150-foot-long giant kelp. Rockweed algae grow to 10 inches in the intertidal zone. They mark the high-tide line like \"bathtub rings.\" Coralline algae, once mistaken for coral, are crunchy due to calcium carbonate in their cell walls. They range from flat to three inches in height.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sea Star</strong></em><br /> Sea stars use hundreds of suction-cupped feet to move and capture food, which they eat with stomachs in the center of their bodies. Bat stars have extra webbing between their arms. They graze over algae and rocks in the intertidal zone, eating tiny algae, plants, and animals. The most common sea stars found in the intertidal zone are the ochre stars. Up to 18 inches across, they can be found in ochre (orange), yellow, red, brown, or purple. They feed upon mussels from the intertidal zone, freeing up habitat for other species that thrive there.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Striped Shore Crab</strong></em><br /> These crabs live on the sand, mud, or rocks near tidepools, splitting their time between land and sea. They eat algae and animals-dead or alive. Striped shore crabs make the tiny clicking sounds that are heard near tidepools. As they outgrow their shells, they cast them off. The new underlying soft shells harden quickly. Striped shore crabs are common on the Channel Islands. They are striped in black and green, with red or purple claws, and grow to two inches in diameter.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Anemone</strong></em><br /> The giant green anemone and the slightly smaller aggregate anemone are both common in tidepools. They look very similar to one another. However, the giant green anemone is usually solitary, and the aggregate anemone lives in colonies of many individuals. Both are blue-green in color, which comes from algae living inside of them. Their tentacles capture and paralyze small animals, dragging them to their central mouths to be digested. At low tide they retract their tentacles to stay moist. Sand and gravel stick to their surfaces, serving as camouflage. They grow to 10 inches wide.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sea Urchin</strong></em><br /> Sea urchins live in the intertidal zone to 100 feet in depth. At low tide, they take shelter from waves in rock cavities. At other times they roam in search of their favorite foods, giant kelp and other algae. Urchins have hard, round shells called tests, covered with spines. Spines can break off in human skin and be painful and hard to remove. Related to sea stars, they have similar tube feet that stick out between their spines for maneuvering and capturing prey. They also have a central mouth with strong jaws and sharp teeth.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sandcastle Worm</strong></em><br /> The sandcastle worm is about two inches long and forms tubes of cemented sand grains that shield the worm's body. These worms build huge colonies of honeycombed, reef-like structures that often appear like a rock to the casual observer. If you look closely you can see the openings of individual worm houses.<br />  </p> <p><strong> Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau</strong><br /> Frenchy's Cove was named after Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau, an emigrant from Brittany, France, who arrived on Anacapa in 1928 prior to the establishment of the National Monument. LeDreau had studied for the priesthood but became disenchanted with the church and so took to the sea. He reportedly joined the U. S. Navy and fought in the Spanish-American War. While on leave in California he met a woman named Emma and married, producing three children. His wife died in the 1918 flu epidemic and in his grief LeDreau took up fishing, drinking and the life of a hermit.<br /> <br /> After settling on Anacapa he built or adopted several huts perched on a ledge overlooking what would be called Frenchy's Cove. With no natural water source, he gathered rainwater in barrels, and collected driftwood for fires. LeDreau focused his energies on lobster fishing, for which he constructed wood and wire traps held afloat by empty wine bottles. He sold fish to passing boats, and acted as a popular host to fishermen, and island visitors on boats, as related by historian Karen Jones Dowty:<br /> <br /> \"In his customary red flannels and a three-day stubble on his face, Frenchie would be stoking the fire from a wood pile that housed his colony of semi-wild cats. Beer and wine would be passed around. The sea stories would start and so would another day in Frenchie's Cove.\"<br /> <br /> Friends old and new brought him food and supplies in return for lobster, abalone and conversation. He was an educated man, apt to discuss literature and sing an aria in a tenor voice. LeDreau also served as watchman over caches of liquor temporarily stashed in certain caves and the chicken coop on the island during prohibition and made \"good money.\" LeDreau told Don Meadows about the time when a purse seiner loaded with 1,000 cases of Scotch whiskey approached the island in need of storage, so LeDreau showed the crew a large cave near his camp. For three days' storage he received five cases of whiskey, fifty dollars and an equal amount worth of supplies.<br /> <br /> LeDreau's livelihood could have been threatened by the creation of Channel Islands National Monument in 1938 but for his beguiling character and interest in the island's natural history. When park service biologist Lowell Sumner visited Anacapa that year to evaluate its resources, he found that LeDreau exhibited an accurate knowledge of and interest in the pelicans and other wildlife, and suggested that he be given some sort of minor custodianship and authorization to warn away would-be egg collectors. \"Mr. LeDreau was exceedingly friendly and helpful to the investigating party. He is undoubtedly a conscientious well meaning person who would be happy to assist in the preservation of the various features of the island.\" The only drawback was Frenchy's cats, but Sumner dismissed their dangers to wildlife by explaining that they were well fed by their master. \"In any event,\" wrote Sumner, \"it is recommended that the livelihood of Mr. LeDreau not be interrupted and that he be allowed to remain on the island as long as he desires.\"<br /> <br /> By 1941 LeDreau was receiving copies of Superintendent Scoyen's letters and called an informal caretaker. Park personnel established camp with him when they visited the island, stayed in his cabins, and used his rowboat and outboard motor. LeDreau chased off vandals and reported on happenings at the island during the early years of the national monument. The only other inhabitant on the island as of June 1939 was a lobster fisherman named Cal Vollin who was said to have lived there for many years. For years Frenchy's cabins appeared in photographs of the cove area and his presence became known farther afield.<br /> <br /> Sidney Lang of Bakersfield visited with Frenchy LeDreau in 1950 when he and friends established camp for a week at Frenchy's Cove. Lang considered LeDreau to be a hermit who enjoyed company:<br /> <br /> \"We invaded his privacy without notifying him or seeking permission. This seemed to please him rather than perplex him. From the first he was friendly and helpful. He greeted us with all of the expressions of happiness of which a Frenchman is capable short of kissing us on the cheek. He made us feel that we had been long expected and that he was glad we had arrived.\"<br /> <br /> Lang described LeDreau's bouts with alcohol, his expertise at locating fishing spots and his dirty cabin, where the walls \"were nearly obscured by smoke from the kerosene stove and lamps and the grease from many skillets of sea food.\" But Frenchy had a fine view of the ocean through the shack's window, and his personality made up for any shortcomings in housekeeping. Lang wrote that LeDreau's attire \"seemed to fit his situation but did not invite close association. His cap, shirt and pants were stained, spotted, and glazed from toiling with things of the sea. Long underwear gasped for fresh air where loose buttons and shirt sleeves allowed it to escape. It took only minutes to find that his character contrasted with his outward appearance.\"<br /> <br /> The National Park Service allowed LeDreau to stay as a caretaker into the 1950s. Superintendent Scoyen visited with Frenchy in the fall of 1950 and then wrote to his superiors that \"Mr. Raymond (Frenchy) LeDreau still maintains residence on the island. Neither Frenchy nor his shack show any change, except that additional junk has accumulated around the place . . . I think all are agreed to leave the old Frenchman undisturbed.\" A bureaucrat in the San Francisco office agreed with Scoyen's assessment, writing that LeDreau \"does a little lobster fishing and is quite old, and may well be permitted to end his days there. His cabin is clean, but the surroundings should be better policed . . . .\"<br /> <br /> Raymond LeDreau continued to act as the caretaker and greeter at Anacapa until, at age 80, falling from the cliff near his shack, sustaining severe injuries. He was reportedly found semi-conscious and bloody by passing fishermen, who took him to the mainland for treatment. He apparently returned to his cove but the park service decided that it would be in his best interest to leave the isolated island and so, after 28 years on Anacapa, Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau was taken to the mainland where he immediately and mysteriously disappeared.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Pelicans of West Anacapa Island</strong><br /> Except for the beach at Frenchy's Cove, West Anacapa is designated as a Research Natural Area and is closed to the public in order to protect nesting California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> Anacapa Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for sea birds and shore birds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> On the north slopes of West Anacapa, California brown pelicans typically nest and raise their young from January through October. In fact, West Anacapa has the largest and most consistently used brown pelican nesting colony on the West Coast of the United States. Brown pelicans will abandon their nests if disturbed, leaving the eggs and chicks defenseless against predators such as gulls and ravens. A serious disturbance can cause an entire colony to be abandoned. For this reason Anacapa's isolation is a critical factor in the successful nesting of these seabirds.<br /> <br /> But even the island's isolation could not protect California brown pelicans from human impacts. The gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and pesticides have all been detrimental. The pesticide DDT nearly caused the pelican to become extinct as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, on neighboring Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made with just one chick surviving. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, the recovery of the California brown pelican and other seabrid species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</strong></em> </p>",

But by the late 19th century, the old \"family vault\" had become a decayed ruin, with the burial vault sunken into the ground, and worn and broken gravestones surrounding it.<br /> <br /> Restoration and preservation efforts at the burial ground began in 1906, ten years after the obelisk was placed to honor the birth site of George Washington. Funded by the Virginia chapter of the Society of Colonial Dames of America, Washington descendants cleaned up the gravestones and enclosed them with a block wall and an ornate iron gate. <br /> <br /> By the time the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed in 1923, the burial ground was again in disrepair. One of the group's primary goals was to \"...rescue from decay and preserve the old family vault and burial ground which is in a most neglected condition.\"<br /> <br /> The burial ground restoration effort became another place of contention between the Association, their architect, and the National Park Service. Concerned that the Association's plan for the burial ground was contemporary and expensive, the NPS wanted to pay homage to the ancestors in a \"...simple, typical Colonial graveyard.\" In the end, the design chosen came down to cost, with the National Park Service's cheaper option being selected. Restoration appears to have been completed in 1931, just before the official opening of the park. <br /> <br /> Today, the burial ground stands silent; as a reminder of the efforts to remember the lineage of George Washington at the place of his birth. ",

            "bodyText": "<p><em>pʰts̓awapʰ hoti is the Chumash word for Gull Island. It means 'house of cormorant.'<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> Gull Island is a small rocky island approximately 55 feet high, located on the south side of the island about a mile off shore from Punta Arena. The place name appears on the June 1882 U.S. Coast Survey map Pacific Coast from Santa Monica to Point Conception.<br /> <br /> In 1934, a survey station was located on Gull Island \"on the highest and north westernmost hump of the main section of Gull Island\" surveyor by Charles K. Green. An automatic light was installed near the south edge of the nearly flat top shortly after the survey station was established.<br /> <br /> <b>An Ideal Isolated Home</b><br /> Gull Island and Santa Cruz Island are home to eleven different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> Thirty shorebird and twelve seabird species have been recorded, including: half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls; 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets; the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.; and the the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Impacts to Seabirds</b> </strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island. On Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Seabird Monitoring and Restoration</b> </strong><br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> On Santa Cruz Island, these efforts have focused on closing off public access to certain habitat critical sea caves and restoring seabird habitat on Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks. These rocks are important nesting islets for burrow-nesting seabirds. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing non-native vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and closures to protect nesting seabirds. For more information about seabird restoration visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/seabird-restoration.htm\">Seabird Restoration Videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.montroserestoration.noaa.gov/restoration/seabirds/santa-cruz-island/\">Montrose Settlement Restoration Program</a> .<br /> <br /> <u><b>Ocean Habitat</b></u><br /> <br /> <strong><b>Mixing of Waters and the Diversity of Marine Life</b> </strong><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. Santa Cruz Island lies in the middle of this transition zone. The western half of the island harbors numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on this eastern end of the island.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island also serves as the meeting ground for seabirds and shore birds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, have nested at Fraser Point on the island's west end. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>The Giant Kelp Forest</b> </strong><br /> From this vantage point, one also has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park-the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow 2 feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredientcalled algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Marine Protected Areas</b> </strong><br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commerci;al harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

In the classic story of plant succession, lichen spores carried on the wind are among the first life forms to return to the barren landscape after the glacier ice melts away. Landing on rocks, the lichen spores anchored themselves to the rock, and began to break down the rock surface making it possible for mosses to find purchase. Moss further breaks down the rock into soil making it possible for flowering plants and trees to move in. Alder helps put nitrogen into the soil making it possible for bigger trees to grow, like quick growing willows and cottonwoods. Later, spruce seeds germinate in the alder-leaf litter and, once they emerge into sunlight, they also grow rapidly. The spruce trees grow to great heights and will eventually crowd out the other trees. This process of each organism preparing the land for the one that follows is called succession. However, it is not always as systematic as that. If a spore or seed arrives in an area and finds what it needs to live, it will grow.</p>",

What is it that makes it valuable?  </h4> <br /> This rugged volcanic landscape is in the ahupuaʻa (divisional land system) of Pānau Nui. Ahead is a volcanic pressure dome called Puʻuloa (Long Hill). Centuries ago, this place was once part of a thriving Hawaiian community. Rock-carved  images known as petroglyphs cover this area. Petroglyphs were made using pōhaku (rock). Native Hawaiians used a sharp stone to peck or incise impressions into the lava surface. The archaeological site of Puʻuloa contains over 23,000 petroglyph images making this the largest petroglyph site in the state of Hawaiʻi.  <br /> <br /> Decades ago American anthropologist Kenneth Pike Emory (November 23, 1897 – January 2, 1992), seemed to dismiss the importance of petroglyph sites stating; <br /> <br /> <em>“The most that can be said for picture writing [petroglyphs] among Hawaiians is that it is in an experimental stage. Certain places and bowlders were favored for the carving of petroglyphs partly on account of the suitableness of the rock and partly, no doubt, because the practice had there gained a start. No special significance need to be attached to the location of the petroglyph centers except perhaps that they were places often visited by the travelling native.”  </em><br /> <br /> Continue on the tour to find out if he was right or wrong.  ",

            "bodyText": "<p>This large circular, domed mausoleum is the final resting place of President William McKinley.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio but he called Canton home throughout his adult life. <span>In 1861, McKinley enlisted as a private in an Ohio infantry regiment and participated in several Civil War battles. After the war h</span>e began his career in this city, met his beloved wife, and ran for the highest office of the nation here. He was the last Civil War veteran elected president. His election in 1896 launched an era of Republican dominance that continued until 1910. McKinley governed during a period of intense American expansionism. Domestically, he supported policies that benefitted American business, including high protective tariffs and deflationary fiscal policies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">On September 6, 1901, an anarchist shot McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He died eight days later. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">After lying in state at the United States Capitol, McKinley’s body returned to Canton.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Mark Hanna, McKinley's <span>lifelong friend, political mentor, and manager,</span> and some of McKinley’s friends immediately began planning a suitable memorial. They chose this site in Canton’s Westlawn Cemetery that McKinley once suggested would be an appropriate location for a soldiers’ and sailors’ memorial. The McKinley National Memorial Association, organized in 1901, purchased the site, and appealed to the public for the $600,000 needed to create the memorial. Construction began in 1905. Nine different States donated materials used in the memorial, completed in 1907. Ida McKinley died that year; she lies next to her husband in the memorial chamber. William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, a private nonprofit organization under the umbrella of the Stark County Historical Society, administers the memorial and its grounds.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The McKinley Memorial that contains the tomb stands on a grass-covered hill overlooking the city of Canton. Designed by architect H. Van Buren Magonigle, the circular, domed pink granite building rises 96 feet above ground and measures 79 feet in diameter. The double bronze doors of the entrance were the largest in the nation at the time of installation. Originally a long, narrow reflecting pool stretched out from the base of the hill in front of the memorial. This feature, together with the 108 stone steps that lead up to the mausoleum, symbolized the President's sword in time of war. In 1951, a depressed lawn replaced the pool, but the sword effect remains. Midway up the steps is a large bronze statue by Charles Henry Niehaus of President McKinley delivering his last speech in Buffalo.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Colored marble laid in a cross pattern forms the floor of the mausoleum. The bodies of McKinley and his wife lie side by side in two polished, dark-green, granite sarcophagi, resting atop a ten-foot-square of polished dark maroon granite in the center of the space. Their two young daughters are also laid to rest here. Three semi-circular arched bays encircle the central chamber. The entablature and frieze extending around the bottom of the dome contain words from McKinley's last speech.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the </em></span><em><a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a></em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded preservation work at the McKinley Memorial in 2000. </em></span></p>",

If you turn and face the building, the right half of the building formerly housed the Mechanics Savings Bank. This bank was the third chartered by African Americans in Richmond. It was founded by John Mitchell, Jr. and it opened for business in January of 1902. Mitchell was a Jackson Ward-based African American journalist, editor, and proprietor of a newspaper. He was also a fraternal leader who had been on the Board of Directors of the True Reformers Bank. This location of the Mechanics Savings Bank was constructed in 1909 and opened for business in 1910. The bank was designed by a white 3 architect by the name of Carl Ruehrmund. The African American contractor in charge of construction was Daniel J. Farrar. Farrar apprenticed in the building trades under his father, Joseph E. Farrar, a leading African American contractor who served on City Council during the 1880s. The Mechanics Savings Bank failed in 1922.<br /> <br />  The Southern Aid Society purchased the building in 1930 and added a four-story western and a northern wing to the building when it later became its headquarters. Founded in 1893 in Richmond, Southern Aid Insurance Company is believed to be the first chartered non-fraternal African American-run and owned industrial insurance company in the South. It is a prime example of how inextricably linked the African American churches and its pastors were to the major African American banks and insurance companies in Richmond. Southern Aid had, as its founding president, the Reverend Z.D. Lewis who pastored the Second Baptist Church. For decades, Southern Aid was the oldest African American-owned insurance company in America. It is no longer in existence.",

            "bodyText": "The Japanese YWCA, in San Francisco, California was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.  The two-story building at 1830 Sutter St. is being recognized for its association to the history of Japanese American Issei (first generation) women, the African American Civil Rights movement, and the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights movement. <br /> <br /> The Japanese YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association), also known as the Issei Women's Building, is a rare public emblem of the struggles and accomplishments of Nikkei women in the United States. Barred by segregationist policies from use of key facilities in the main YWCA chapter, in 1912 Issei (immigrant generation) women formed the first independent Japanese YWCA in the U.S. to address social and service needs of women and children. This building, designed by noted architect Julia Morgan and completed in 1932, was funded by money raised within the Japantown community, as well as donations from the national and San Francisco YWCAs. Because California’s Alien Land Law prevented Issei from owning property, the Japanese women asked the San Francisco YWCA to hold title to the property in trust for the Nikkei community.  <br /> <br /> When all people of Japanese ancestry were forcibly removed and incarcerated under Executive Order 9066 during WWII, the building was turned over to the SF YWCA, which in turn leased it to the American Friends Service Committee from 1942 to 1959. The building was the location for numerous gatherings that advanced multiple political and social causes, including the fight for African American civil rights and for homosexual rights. The SF YWCA moved into the building in 1960 and programmed it until the late 1990s when they announced the building’s sale. Inspired by the 1980s campaign for Japanese American redress, a multi-generational group of Japanese Americans led a successful legal struggle to regain title to the building so that it could be kept in use for the benefit of the Japanese American community.  <br /> <br /> In July 1912, twenty Japanese women in San Francisco decided to form an independent chapter of the YWCA because “the number of Japanese women coming to the United States has been increasing every month and issues concerning the women and children are matters of urgent necessity confronting us….” They enlisted another twenty members and began operating from a former hotel building at 1120 Gough Street (demolished) where they established an office and dormitory. Limitations of the building on Gough street led to the construction of this building.  <br /> <br /> The Japanese YWCA was erected in 1932 of wood frame construction. The building consists of a two-story-over-raised-basement frame building constructed in 1932 and a one-story-over-raised-basement addition with rooftop enclosure constructed in 2017. The 1932 building was designed by Julia Morgan in a Japanese-inspired eclectic style to serve as the Japanese Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA). The 2017 addition, which abuts the west side of the building, is compatible yet visually subservient to the adjacent 1932 construction. <br /> <br /> The YWCA offered ongoing programs for employment placing and school counseling. Classes included flower arrangement, Japanese tea ceremony, knitting and embroidery, cooking (Western and Chinese), interior decorating, and millinery/sewing. Lectures were offered on music history, current affairs and economics, religions, history, law, and modern literature and drama. Although most of the programming was developed for Nikkei girls and women, the Japanese YWCA also hosted events for a broader YWCA audience. In March 1934, a citywide meeting of the SF Business Girls’ Club was held at here. Three years later, a tea honoring Helen Keller was hosted by the Japanese YWCA just prior to her journey to Japan “on a speaking trip in the aid of the many blind of the Japanese empire.”  <br /> <br /> After orders from the Western Defense Command authorized by Executive Order 9066 removed Japanese Americans from Japantown, the SF YWCA leased the building at 1830 Sutter Street to the San Francisco office of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC). The building became known as the Friends Center. A Quaker organization, AFSC was founded in 1917 to support conscientious objectors and to aid civilian victims of WWI.They worked with the SF Friends Center and the Japanese YMCA to aid Japanese aliens who were subject to new restrictions on travel and employment. AFSC’s activities during WWII included support for conscientious objectors and refugees, as well as soliciting funds and resources for civilians directly affected by the war. The Northern California Section’s commitment to supporting Japanese Americans who had been their neighbors continued and included the program to relocate Japanese college students from the West Coast to educational facilities in the Midwest and Eastern U.S. A San Francisco chapter of the national civil rights organization, the Committee on Racial Equality (CORE), was formed in 1943 and based here. Archival records and press coverage establish that the AFSC operated from 1830 Sutter Street through 1959 and organized or hosted a remarkable range of activities and public events related to civil rights and social justice in the Western Addition and the wider Bay Area. The AFSC raised funds and hosted lectures, panel discussions and symposia on worldwide refugee conditions, and on social issues in the U.S. including prison conditions, migrant worker housing and housing segregation. <br /> <br /> Under AFSC stewardship, the building gained two powerful connections to LGBTQ history. The first was in the activities of Bayard Rustin. Rustin. Rustin was a pioneer in bringing a new confrontational approach that adapted Ghandian nonviolence to attacking racism in the United States. Rustin’s work in San Francisco and the West included addressing racial housing covenants, organizing against segregated public facilities, and a visit to Manzanar War Relocation Center. Credited with shaping the pacifist strategy of the African American civil rights movement, Rustin was the central organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. The second connection with LGBTQ history was in May 1954, 1830 Sutter Street was the location for the first annual convention of the Mattachine Society. The society was the pioneer homophile organization in the U.S. First known as the Mattachine Foundation, the society was founded in 1950 in Los Angeles by Harry Hay and others who conceived of homosexuals as an oppressed minority. They sought to form a group that would free gay men and women of negative attitudes.<br /> <br /> In 1959, the AFSC moved to another location. January 1, 1960, the SF YWCA took over management of the building and its programs and began referring to it as the Western Addition YWCA.<br />  ",

Richmond Beneficial was organized in 1894 by a founding president, Reverend Wesley F. Graham and others. Graham, who was 5 pastor of the Fifth Street Baptist Church, would also found the American Beneficial Insurance Company in 1902. This building [which] would serve as headquarters for Richmond Beneficial opened to the public in June of 1912.<br /> <br /> As was customary for the time, this was a multi-purpose building. At the time of its opening it housed, in addition to the insurance company, the Capital Shoe Company and meeting rooms for rental to fraternal and social organizations. The Richmond Beneficial building had the distinction of being designed and constructed by African Americans. It was designed by professor Charles T. Russell, a native of Jackson Ward and one of the earliest licensed African American architects in Virginia. Russell received his training in the building arts at Hampton Institute and received further training at Tuskegee. He will design and oversee the major renovations of several notable African American businesses, residences, and churches. Professor Russell was also the founding president of the National Builders Association. The construction of this building was done by the African American firm of Moore and Archer. Henry J. Moore, of the firm, apprenticed under Joseph Farrar, the father of contractor Daniel J. Farrar. Moore also served on City Council during the 1890s. This insurance company no longer exists.<br /> <br /> The small building next to the Richmond Beneficial building formerly housed the Second Street Savings Bank. The Second Street Savings Bank was chartered in 1920 making it the sixth bank to be chartered by African Americans in Richmond. Its founding president was John T. Taylor and the bank was closely aligned with the Richmond Beneficial Insurance Company next door. The Second Street Savings Bank was also designed by noted African American architect, professor Charles T. Russell and it was constructed by African American contractor Daniel J. Farrar.<br /> <br /> Due to a dwindling pool of depositors and an economic downturn, the shareholders of the Second Street Savings Bank and Maggie Walker’s St. Luke Bank and Trust met in December of 1929 and voted to merge the two banks. The new bank opened for business in January of 1930 as the Consolidated Bank and Trust. The Commercial Bank and Trust would merge with Consolidated Bank and Trust approximately one year later to complete the merger of the three African American banks. For decades, Consolidated Bank and Trust was the oldest, continuously run African American-owned bank in America.",

It was practically the only high ground in the area controlled by US forces during the siege of Chattanooga between September and November 1863. US soldiers used Signal Point to communicate with the outside world by creating a complex signaling system on portions of high ground along the Tennessee River. Signal Point was the key station receiving and sending messages from the besieged city to Bridgeport, Alabama, thence by telegraph to the North. Once US forces opened the supply line to the city from Brown's Ferry on October 27, 1863, the signal station at Signal Point was primarily used for observing and reporting Confederate troop movements in the area. <br /> <br /> Today, Signal Point is a popular hiking destination.

The light was turned on in 1932, and remains on to this day, to warn vessels of Anacapa's rocky shores.<br /> <br /> At 11:00 pm on December 2, 1853, a frightening jolt woke the passengers aboard the side-wheel steamer Winfield Scott. Rushing on deck, they discovered that the ship had run aground in dense fog. Water poured into the ship's hold through two gaping holes in its wooden hull. Boarding the lifeboats, the passengers rowed to safety on Middle Anacapa Island, but the Winfield Scott was lost. Its remains lie submerged off the island's north shore.<br /> <br /> Despite the wrecking of the Winfield Scott and other ships off Anacapa's coast, a light was not placed on the island until 1912. Because of Anacapa's isolation, and the difficulties of building and supplying such a remote station, the first light was an unmanned, acetylene beacon placed atop a fifty-foot-tall metal tower.<br /> <br /> Responding to requests for better navigation aids along the Santa Barbara Channel, the Bureau of Lighthouses replaced the beacon with a lighthouse containing a 3rd-order Fresnel lens in 1932. The lens is now on display in the Anacapa Island Visitor Center.<br /> <br /> Buildings to support the lighthouse were constructed in the Spanish Revival style, characterized by tile roofs, stucco walls, and arched openings. The light station resembled a small town, with four residences flanking a main street that led to the powerhouse, oil house, general services building, fog signal building, lighthouse, water tank building, and other support structures. A series of ninety steps with two landings and a crane were built to transport people and gear from the landing cove to the top of the steep cliff.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lighthouse Timeline</strong></p> <p>- On December 2, 1853, the side-wheel steamer <em>Winfield Scott</em> collided with Middle Anacapa Island. The wreck's notoriety led President Franklin Pierce to sign an executive order the following year, reserving Anacapa for lighthouse purposes.<br /> <br /> - The island's rugged terrain made the cost too high for immediate construction. Charles Hillinger, in the The California Islands, wrote that when members of the U. S. Coast Survey team visited Anacapa in 1854 they reported that it was an ideal but impossible site for a light station. Quoting a report, Hillinger wrote, \"It is inconceivable for a lighthouse to be constructed on this mass of volcanic rock-perpendicular on every face, with an ascent inaccessible by any natural means . . . .\"<br /> <br /> - In 1874, Congress funded a less expensive mainland station at Port Hueneme.<br /> <br /> - At the turn of the century, increased shipping traffic heightens the need for an Anacapa light. In 1911, Congress funded an automatic acetylene beacon mounted on a 50 foot metal tower at the eastern edge of Anacapa. In clear weather, the light could be seen from 20 miles in the distance. A whistling buoy was also anchored 5/8 of a mile offshore.<br /> <br /> - An estimated nine-tenths of all vessels trading up and down the Pacific Coast passed through the Santa Barbara Channel by 1920. Members of the American Association of Masters, Mates and Pilots demanded a fog signal as well as a light. A permanent lighthouse, however, required authorization by Congress. When the tank steamer <strong>Liebre</strong> grounded on the east end of Anacapa Island on February 28, 1921, directly under the light tower, local inspectors blamed the inadequate station and the capsized whistling buoy.<br /> <br /> - In 1928, the Bureau of Lighthouses allocated funds for an Anacapa lighthouse, the last major light station on the west coast. The Bureau of Lighthouses Annual Report for 1929 gave an estimated total for the entire project of $186,000.00. It included station residences, service buildings, hoisting derricks, a fog signal, radiobeacon, and miscellaneous improvements for the water supply, sanitation, and grounds improvement.<br /> <br /> - Construction was carried out in two phases--landing facilities and roads, followed by the tower and support buildings. The engineering fete was completed in 1933 at a cost of $110,490. The new station provided beacon and foghorn service plus weather and radio monitoring.<br /> <br /> - The new lighthouse's keeper, Frederick Cobb, lit the first light on March 25, 1932. Located on the highest point of East Anacapa Island, the Anacapa Island Lighthouse became an indispensable resource to shipping and passenger boats. At the top of the 39-foot concrete cylindrical tower flashed a third-order Fresnel lens, one of the most advanced lighthouse beacons in the world.<br /> <br /> - From 1931 through the 1960s, the light station housed a crew of between 15 and 25 people who maintained the lens, fog signal and tower, hourly weather and radar monitoring and reports, and a radio tower.<br /> <br /> - In 1938, Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands were established as Channel Islands National Monument.<br /> <br /> - In 1939, the U.S.Coast Guard replaced the Lighthouse Service.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa light is blacked out during World War II, when the facilities were used as a coastal lookout station by the U.S. Navy.<br /> <br /> - In 1961 the U.S. Coast Guard modernized the light station by replacing the fog signal system and installing electrical appliances. The following year, however, a new plan was outlined to automate the Anacapa Island Light Station and to establish a rescue facility at Point Hueneme Light Station.<br /> <br /> - U.S. Coast Guard tender crews were phased out in the early 1960's. By 1967, Anacapa's light is fully automated and was able to be operated from the mainland.<br /> <br /> - In 1966, orders were approved to demolish three of the dwellings, the engine equipment building, shops, water tank house in one phase. Phase two removal included: the hoist house on the lower landing, the lower derrick and hoist equipment, burning the general services building, converting the power building to emergency quarters for servicing personnel, and burning the remaining quarters building. In May 1967, three of the houses were demolished.<br /> <br /> - In 1970, the U.S. Coast Guard and National Park Service signed a cooperative agreement. The lighthouse and fog horn continued under U.S. Coast Guard jurisdiction. The other facilities were to be maintained by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> - With the addition of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, Channel Islands National Park was established in 1980.<br /> <br /> - The light and fog horn were converted to solar power in 1989. An acrylic lens (airport beacon) replaced the original Fresnel lens, which was carefully relocated to the Anacapa Visitor Center. These modern lenses are small versions of Augustin Fresnel's invention, using the same technology employed by the nineteenth-century physicist.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa Island Light Station was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Twelve buildings and structures listed as contributing resources in the nomination form were: lighthouse tower; fog signal building; assistant keeper's residence; general services building; tank house; derrick building; oil house; power house; lower landing; upper derrick landing; landing stairway; and concrete watershed (rainshed).<br /> <br /> - In 1993, a conservation project restored the Fresnel lens to its original lustre. Guided by the NPS Archaeological Preservation Office, the lens was disassembled, polished to remove corrosion, lacquered, waxed and reassembled by park personnel.<br /> <br /> - In 1995, the lighthouse was restored by the U.S. Coast Guard.<br /> <br /> - Today, while the park manages the island, the U.S. Coast Guard continues to operate the lighthouse and fog signal building as an active aid to. For safety reasons, visitors to Anacapa Island are not permitted to tour the lighthouse.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Fresnel Lens</strong></p> <p>Constructed in 1932, the Anacapa Island Light Station featured a third-order Fresnel lens, the most advanced example of lens technology at the time.<br /> <br /> In 1822 the Frenchman Augustin Fresnel (fray-nel) improved the dioptric, or refractive, lens used in many lighthouse beacons. Resembling a giant beehive surrounding a single lamp, the glass prisms at the top and bottom refracted the light, sending it out in a narrow sheet. The dioptric section is a round bull's-eye panel that produces the bright flash of the light. The light appeared brighter and more concentrated, giving it a much more effective and farther range. In the United States Fresnel lenses were made in seven sizes, or orders, the first-order being the largest.<br /> <br /> In 1932 a rotating, catadioptric, third-order Fresnel lens with a 1000-watt incandescent bulb assembly was installed in the Anacapa Lighthouse. Manufactured between 1900 and 1903 by the Chance Brothers Company in England, it was transported to the United States and stored with other lenses to be used in west coast lighthouses. As each lighthouse was built, a lens was taken out of storage and installed in the lighthouse tower. Powered by diesel generator, its 600,000 candlepower had a visibility of 24 miles!<br /> <br /> Until the 1960s the light station required a crew of 15 to 25 people to care for the lens and tower. The lighthouse was automated to run for several months at a time in the 1960s. An automatic lamp changer halved the number of times a tender would have to change a burned-out bulb. The brass structure of the lens was painted black because it was no longer regularly polished.<br /> <br /> In 1989, the U.S. Coast Guard replaced the original Fresnel lens with a plastic, solar-powered unit now used in the lighthouse. These modern lenses are small versions of Augustin Fresnel's invention, using the same technology employed by the nineteenth-century physicist.<br /> <br /> You can see the original Fresnel lens on display at the Anacapa Island visitor center. In 1993, a conservation project restored the Fresnel lens to its original lustre. Guided by the NPS Archaeological Preservation Office, the lens was disassembled, polished to remove corrosion, lacquered, waxed and reassembled by park personnel.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Fog Signal</strong></p> <p>The original diaphone fog signal once stood on the roof of this one-story building, but now the automated electronic device is less conspicuous.<br /> <br /> Funds had been allotted for fog signal diaphones and their installation in late 1931. Power would be generated on the island. Technicians set the two-tone diaphone to blast for three seconds on a 30 second cycle. The resonators of the diaphone were depressed slightly in order to counteract the usual upward bending of the sonic beam.<br /> <br /> The S. S. Golden Sun of the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company reported in 1933 that this was one of the best fog signals it had ever experienced. On the negative side, however, the S. S. Lightburne reported that the \"Anacapan [sic] fog signal is 3 second blast and 27 second silent and Pt. Hueneme fog signal is 4 second blast and 26 seconds silent period, consequently naturally having expected to make Anacapa we thought had done so and hauled ship NE'ly. to pass light to Starboard hand. About this time fog lifted slightly and we seen that fog signal was on Pt. Hueneme and proceeded on our voyage accordingly. Comment in question is that since the blast and silent per periods of the Lights mentioned have a difference of only one second it is confusing in identifying either in a fog.\"<br /> <br /> At this, the Port Hueneme characteristic was changed.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "LIGHTHOUSE AND FOG SIGNAL BUILDING Located on the highest and most eastern point of East Anacapa Island, the lighthouse and fog signal building are surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs. 11 miles of channel waters separate us from the mainland and its mountain ranges to the north and east. An easy walk up the dirt trail takes you to the lighthouse. The coast guard operates the lighthouse. For safety reasons, visitors are not permitted to tour the lighthouse, or fog signal building. The next two paragraphs describe the lighthouse and fog signal THE LIGHTHOUSE The lighthouse is 39-foot concrete cylindrical white stucco tower in the Spanish Revival style. At the entrance is a red portico and steel door. Three rectangular windows are at various levels along the sides and eight rectangular windows wrap around the tower near the top. The tower is topped with a railing that encircles the glass lantern room with diamond-shaped window panes. Behind the glass cylinder is the solar powered acrylic lens. The original Fresnel lens (pronounced (fray-nel) is on display in the Visitor Center. THE FOG SIGNAL BUILDING Next to the lighthouse sits the fog signal building. This 16 square foot, one story, white stucco building has a flat roof of terra cotta clay tile topped with a small, chimney like, white tower. The tower creates a second tier that houses the signal equipment. Metal rods stick out the top of this tier and hold the two signal horns. Solar panels are mounted to the back of the building.",

Lock 29 Trailhead is a popular, often crowded access point for the village and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a>. It also provides parking for <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> and the <a href=\"https://cuyahogariverwatertrail.org/\">Cuyahoga River Water Trail</a>.<br /> <br /> The trailhead is named for canal Lock 29. The path beyond the kiosk lets you walk into the lock. Exhibits explain the lock and an aqueduct that once carried the canal over the Cuyahoga River. On the towpath, travel 2.3 miles north to the historic village of Boston. About a mile south is Deep Lock and connecting trails to old stone quarries.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">railroad arrived</a> in 1880. Its construction removed one of the curves of the Cuyahoga River to reduce the need for bridges. Peninsula Depot now serves Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad passengers. The walkway near the trailhead entrance drive leads to the depot.<br /> <br /> The walkway also leads to Peninsula’s restaurants and shops. The area was settled originally as Connecticut’s Western Reserve. Stroll the village to enjoy New England-style architecture. As you browse, you might find yourself in a former bar, hotel, or immersed in a story of times past.<br /> <br /> At the trailhead, paddlers can use a put-in for the Cuyahoga River Water Trail. The <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye Trail</a>, a long-distance trail that circles Ohio, passes through the trailhead. Follow the blue blazes through town to go north or head south using the Towpath Trail.<br /> <br /> Late in the late 1800s, residents of the cities of Cleveland and Akron discovered the valley as a place for respite and relaxation. Today, Peninsula is a haven for cyclists, hikers, runners, paddlers, birders, and history buffs.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Lock 29 Trailhead. 428 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits at the edge of the parking lot to the left of a sidewalk that leads to the Towpath Trail and more exhibits at Lock 29. As you face the kiosk, the river bend is to the left. Restrooms are located in a small building on the other side of the parking lot near the train tracks. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location in the middle of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Lock 29 Trailhead. The Ohio and Erie Canal made Peninsula a busy industrial town and popular overnight stop for canal travelers. The village had boatyards, mills, hotels, taverns, and other businesses. Today visitors can stroll through the historic downtown and stop to shop and dine. Travel 2.3 miles north on the towpath to the historic village of Boston. About a mile south is Deep Lock and connecting trails to old stone quarries.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

            "bodyText": "Bill “Bojangles” Robinson was born Luther Robinson in Jackson Ward in 1878. As a youngster, Robinson reportedly took the first name of his younger brother. He began to shine shoes and dance at an early age and his gifts did not go unnoticed. Before long, he began to travel with vaudeville acts up and down the East Coast. His innovative tap dancing routines would bring him critical acclaim. Robinson starred in over a dozen films, co-starring opposite child star Shirley Temple in several of the films.<br /> <br /> Bill “Bojangles” Robinson is not only remembered for his innovative tap dancing techniques but for his philanthropy as well. As he traveled, during one of his visits back home through the intersection that now surrounds his statue, he observed a child narrowly escape being struck by a car. Robinson paid over a thousand dollars to have a light erected at this intersection. Robinson also served his country in World War I as a member of the 369th Regiment from New York. Robinson was honored during his lifetime when a theater was built and named in his honor in the Church Hill section of Richmond. Some of the elder residents of Church Hill remember his return for the grand opening of the theater. Bill Robinson died in 1949. In a lasting tribute to his legacy, the Astoria Beneficial Club commissioned sculptor Jim Witt [sp.?] to create this statue of Robinson and it was unveiled in 1973.",

            "bodyText": "Richmond has been called the “Harlem of the South” and no corridor underscores why better than North Second Street. One of the most popular entertainment venues for decades was the Hippodrome Theater, located to our right at 528 North Second Street. During its heyday, the Hippodrome was to Jackson Ward what the Apollo was to Harlem. This theater opened in around 1914 and, for several decades hosted some of the most popular vaudeville acts and movies starring African Americans. Internationally-known musical performers like Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Duke Ellington, and James Brown also graced its stages. Many of the performers who played the Hippodrome stayed across the street at the famous African American-owned Slaughter’s Hotel and the Miller’s Hotel which was located on the southeast corner of Second and Leigh. Miller’s Hotel would later become the Eggleston Hotel. All of these hotels have since been demolished.<br /> <br /> Next door is 526 North Second Street. This building was formerly the mansion of the Reverend W.L. Taylor. Reverend Taylor was the second national leader of Grand Worthy Master of the True Reformers. The True Reformers were inarguably the most powerful African American fraternal and business organization of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Many subsequent leaders of African American banks and insurance companies received their initial training with the True Reformers organization. The W.L. Taylor mansion, upon its completion in 1907, had over twenty rooms and was believed to be one of the largest residences built for an African American at that time in America. When Reverend Taylor and his family threw open the doors of their home to the public, for the official open house in February of 1908, it was a grand affair. Visitors were greeted at the door by none other than pioneering banker Mrs. Maggie L. Walker. The Taylor mansion was designed by noted African American architect J.A. Lankford of Washington, D.C. Lankford had several noteworthy commissions in Richmond. However, one of his most noteworthy commissions was the True Reformers’ building which still stands, over a century later, at 12th and U Street in Washington, D.C.<br /> <br /> Richmond has also been called “The Cradle of Black Capitalism” for good reason. Between the years of 1889 and 1929, there were six chartered African American owned banks in Richmond and each had a presence in Jackson Ward. On North Second Street alone, there are three African American banks and at least four African American-owned insurance companies.",

This Federal-styled brick home, with beige trim, is located at 105 West Jackson Street at the intersection of Chamberlayne Parkway and Jackson Street. Built in the 1840s, this is the former home of Reverend William Washington Brown. Brown was born in 1849 in Habersham County, Georgia and escaped from slavery as a boy and traveled throughout the South. He later joined the Union Army and attained an education.<br /> <br /> He was summoned to Richmond around 1881 by members of the temperance organization, the True Reformers, and subsequently transformed the True Reformers into one of the largest African American fraternal and business enterprises in America. The 7 True Reformers made African American business history when, in March of 1888, they received a charter from the state of Virginia to open the Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain of the United Order of True Reformers. Thus, the True Reformers bank became the first chartered by African Americans in America. The bank opened for business on April 3, 1889 in Brown’s home, here at 105 West. Jackson Street. The symbolic date of April 3 was chosen because it was the anniversary month and date of the arrival of Union troops in Richmond after the fall of the city at the end of the Civil War. It should be noted that the former Capital Savings Bank of Washington, D.C. received its charter in October of 1888 and opened shortly thereafter and prior to the opening of the True Reformers bank. However, the True Reformers bank retained the distinction of having been the first African American-owned bank chartered in America. The bank was later housed in the True Reformers Hall in the 600-block of North Second Street. The bank collapsed in 1910.",

Only the Natchez Trace, part of which remains here, made inroads into tribal territory.<br /> <br /> When the Chickasaw ceded the land to the United States in the early 1800s the Natchez Trace became a boundary. The land behind you became government property under the 1805 treaty. In 1816 the tribe ceded a much larger tract including the land in front of you.<br /> <br /> In 1837 the Chickasaw were removed from their homeland. Chickasaw Removal is the most traumatic chapter in Chickasaw history. As a result of Congress’ Indian Removal Act, the Chickasaw people were forced to remove to Indian Territory. The foresight and skilled negotiating practices of Chickasaw leaders led to favorable sales of Chickasaw lands in Mississippi. This allowed the Chickasaw Nation, unlike other tribes, to pay for our own removal.<br /> <br /> Chickasaw families were met with hardship and death along the Removal, traveling hundreds of miles in extreme cold and heat; however, Chickasaws suffered less than other tribes because they controlled their departures and chose favorable seasons to travel. This undoubtedly saved many lives that otherwise could have been lost.<br /> <br /> Other tribes removed to Indian Territory were the Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole. The Chickasaws were one of the last to remove. In 1837, They signed the Treaty of Doaksville with the Choctaw Nation and purchased the right for the settlement of the Chickasaw people in their own district within Choctaw Territory. Most Chickasaws removed to Indian Territory from 1837-1851. However, Chickasaw families continued to arrive in Indian Territory up to the 1890s, as evidenced by Chickasaw tribal enrollment in the Dawes Rolls.<br /> <br /> As the Chickasaw began to move into their district, they discovered Plains Indian tribes roaming freely across the lands. These tribes still lived a migratory lifestyle and made frequent raids on Chickasaw homesteads. The Plains Indian tribes did not understand the United States removing other tribes onto their historic homeland. To fulfill the treaty promise to protect the removed Southeastern tribes, the federal government built Fort Washita and Fort Arbuckle to maintain peace between the various tribes. Chickasaws still desired their own separate territory to restore governmental authority for their people and separate affairs from the Choctaws. In 1856, the Chickasaws separated from the Choctaws and created their own constitution for their own separate lands.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/trail-of-tears-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Trail of Tears on the Natchez Trace Parkway </a>for additional information.",

            "bodyText": "Brashears Stand is named after Turner Brashears, who moved to the area in the late 1700s. He became a trader with the Choctaw and learned their language.<br /> <br /> In 1806 Turner Brashears placed an advertisement in the Natchez newspaper about his stand labeling it “A house of Entertainment on the road leading from Natchez to Nashville.” Travelers on the Natchez Trace generally seemed to be pleased with their treatment and accommodations at Brashears Stand. In 1807 Reverend Jacob Young, a Methodist preacher, wrote “Near the line that divided the Choctaw Nation from the Mississippi Territory stood a fine public house kept by a man by the name of Brashears...He treated us very well but knew how to make a high bill.” In addition to earning money from his stand operation, Brashears prospered by selling land and enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of Brashears Stand visible at the site.<br /> <br /> Brashears Stand is also a trailhead for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walking-or-biking-the-chisha-foka-multi-use-trail.htm\">Chisha Foka Multi-Use Trail</a><br /> <br /> There is a boardwalk here that leads to the <a href=\"https://mscrafts.org/\">The Bill Waller Craft Center, Home of the Craftmen's Guild Of Mississippi.</a><br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional iformation.<br />  ",

Trace travelers no doubt talked about Levi's stand. It was nicer than most, and offered respite from the miles of footsteps that defined a Trace journey. Inns, or stands, provided occasional shelter for travelers along the Natchez Trace from the 1790s to the 1840s. These stands offered food to eat and food for thought: local news, information, and ideas. The ever-changing mix of diverse people – whites, American Indians, African Americans – interacted at the stands on a regular basis.<br /> <br /> It was Colbert's negotiating and language skills that sustained him as a tribal leader. Bilingual, with a Scottish father and Chickasaw Mother, he took advantage of the opportunities in both cultures. Across several decades, Colbert sat among the Chickasaw during treaty talks. Using his knowledge of both white and Chickasaw society, he protected both the Chickasaw homeland and his own interests. <br /> <br /> A dogged negotiator, at the time of his death in 1834, Colbert was trying to amend an 1832 treaty to gain better terms his the Chickasaw people.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of Levi Colbert's stand visible at the site except for where the spring comes out of the ground. A short trail leads to the Buzzard Roost Spring where it is easy to picture how precious the small spring was to trace travelers. A short decent on steep steps will reveal a quiet haven set in a cool and shady glen, the perfect retreat for a hot summer day.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS.

Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",

Conflict erupted December 7, 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, an American naval base in Hawaii. The USCGC Taney is the only surviving ship that was present at Pearl Harbor navy base that day. Berthed at Honolulu Harbor the morning of the attack, the USCGC Taney readied her guns and began firing at attacking Japanese planes. The following day, December 8, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan.

The vessel also had many other responsibilities throughout the war. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USCGC Taney remained in Honolulu to track and gather intelligence on Japanese vessels in the area.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to Japan, the United States was also at war with Nazi Germany in the early 1940s. The USCGC Taney also fought against Germany in 1944, when the ship served as an ocean convoy escort.

The number of kilns- ten in all – is itself an attractive feature, especially since they are all laid out in a perfect line up in the canyon.”</h3> <br /> This excerpt from a study published in 1969 by National Park Service Historian, Benjamin Levy, reveals that a trip off the beaten path, up Wildrose Canyon, is well worth the detour. Completed in 1877 to supply charcoal for the Modock Mines 25 miles to the west in the Argus Range, these kilns were likely only used until 1879.   <br /> <br /> The kilns were built from local stone, and the mortar is a lime, sand and gravel mix. During the kilns’ operation, wood was harvested from the surrounding hillsides, loaded into the kilns, and fired to produce charcoal. The charcoal product was then transported by pack animal, and possibly wagons to be used in smelters for lead-silver mines. Charcoal was the preferred fuel source for use in mining furnaces because it burns more slowly than wood, and produces a much greater heat, which is needed for refining ores.  <br /> <br /> Many of the trees used as fuel in the kilns were local Pinion Pines. Pinion pines are the source of pine nuts (think-pesto!), which were a traditional staple of the Timbisha Shoshone diet. The nuts ripen in the fall, and can be stored for several years, making them a valuable food source.<br /> <br /> The best way to reach the Wildrose Charcoal Kilns is by taking the Emigrant Canyon Road turnoff of Highway 190 (minimum 1.5 hr detour). This paved road offers spectacular scenery, while winding through hills, valleys, and washes. Be alert for wild burros, whose ancestors were left behind during the mining days; these animals often stand in roadways and have been known to bite and kick when approached. The final 2 miles (3 km) is gravel, and although it is generally passable by most vehicles, check current conditions before making the trip. <br />  ",

The structures are approximately 25 feet tall, with a 30 foot (9 meter) interior diameter. Each structure has an open arched doorway in the front, approximately 4.7 feet (1.4 meters) wide by 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall, and a second open arched doorway in the rear, opposite the front doorway. The rear doorway is approximately 12 feet (3.7 meters) off the ground and is approximately 3 feet (1 meter) wide by 3.7 feet (1.1 meters) tall. Neither opening has a door. The kilns have three rows of open vent holes between the stones, which measure approximately 4 inches (10 centimeters)by 4 inches (10 centimeters) and are spaced 1.5 feet (0.46 meters) apart vertically. The floor is dirt.",

A few clusters of tall trees are near a wooden fence that zigzags between the parking area and the meadow. A small yellow sign bolted to the wooden fence reads, give plants a chance, please stay off. An illustration of a foot, ready to step on small flowers and plants is inside a red circle with a line slashed diagonally through the circle.

            "audioDescription": "Boston Store Trailhead. 474 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits at the side of the parking lot here behind the two-story, white Boston Store. Standing with your back to the parking lot, the Towpath Trail is to your right with the dry canal bed on the far side. These continue along the right side of Boston Store. To the left of the kiosk is a white building with restrooms, with entrance on the far side of the building. Between the restrooms and Boston Store is the M.D. Garage, its front facing the street on the opposite side. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location here in Boston near the center of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Boston Store Trailhead. Boston was once a bustling canal town with a lumberyard, brickyard, boatyards, and mills. Later it was a company town for a paper bag factory. Today, Boston is the heart of Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Stop at the visitor center to plan your adventure. Hike a short distance north on the towpath and follow connecting trails about 2.5 miles to the 60-foot Brandywine Falls, a favorite park attraction. Walk or bike 2.3 miles south to historic Peninsula for dining and shopping.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

A large fissure had opened up in a quiet forest along Chain of Craters Road. Soon red-hot lava burst forth to announce the start of a new eruption, the birth of Maunaulu (growing mountain).<br /> <br /> Maunaulu grew over a new vent that sustained 12 towering fountains from May to December 1969. At times, the fountains reached 1,770 feet (540 m) high—500 feet (150 m) taller than the Empire State Building! It is said that this was Pele’s brother, Keoʻahikamakaua, the spirit of molten fountains, wielding his spears of lava. Here, you can witness how this sacred Hawaiian landscape continues to undergo rapid and extraordinary change.<br /> <br /> Today when we come to Maunaulu, we see a steaming landscape of destruction and twisted rock. We also discover a fragile and surreal beauty—a place where life regenerates on the volcano’s raw flows. In the future, as in the past, the earth will tremble, and molten lava will cover all you see. An awesome power constantly recreates this land. It is Kīlauea— a force of constant change.",

The area contains nationally significant archeological sites that chronicle approximately 12,000 years of American Indian occupation. These sites are associated primarily with Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian cultural periods. The Trail of Tears National Historic Trail follow sthe route of the Brown's Ferry Road that crossed Moccasin Bend and commemorates the forced removal of Cherokee Indians from their ancestral homelands. Important Civil War-era earthworks and associated resources constructed by US forces are located along Stringers Ridge, which effectively screens most of the Moccasin Bend unit from downtown Chattanooga. The 768-acre district became a unit of Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park in 2003. ",

            "bodyText": "<p>The British steamer, <i>Lugano</i>, from Liverpool, was headed for Havana with cargo that included fine silks, wines, rice, and other foods valued at $1 million. She was also carrying 116 passengers, including 12 women and children. All of the passengers except two were Spanish immigrants en route to Cuba.</p> <p>On March 9, 1913 in high winds and heavy seas and significantly off course, Captain P. Penwill grounded on Long Reef. The tug Rescue was radioed, and safely took the passengers of <i>Lugano</i> to Key West while the Captain and crew remained aboard. Cargo was removed, and the hold was intentionally flooded to prevent further pounding on the rocks. By March 20, seven large loads of cargo had been removed and taken to Key West. Wreckers were busily pumping water out of <i>Lugano</i> so that her boilers could be re-lit, allowing her own pumps to dewater the hull. By March 22, their efforts succeeded, but even with the ship’s pumps working night and day, the ill-fated vessel was still lodged on the reef and listing heavily to port. On March 27, The Miami Herald reported there were over 75 wrecking boats attempting to save the cargo. The ensuing confusion and foul weather made it easy for unscrupulous salvors to slip away and stash cargo on nearby reefs. Much cargo was stolen by the Key West wreckers of <i>Dr. Lykes</i>, including linens and 350 cases of brandy. Rumors of the thefts prompted U.S. Customs to dispatch officials to monitor the wreck.</p> <p>By April 4, the crew had abandoned <i>Lugano</i>, which was again full of water. The Lee Brothers, wreckers from Miami, were later contracted to deliver the ship to Key West for $17,000.00. The estimated value of the saved cargo was $150,000.00. <em>Lugano</em> was three stories deep below the water line and was the largest boat to ever go on the rocks of the Florida reefs up to that time.</p> <p>All efforts to refloat <i>Lugano</i> were abandoned on April 15. Two days of high winds pounded the already battered vessel until it was considered a total loss. Wreckers removed nearly everything, leaving only the hull. A settlement on May 28, 1914, gave the primary salvors $64,126.67, the secondary salvors $14,084.30, and the remaining salvors $2,228.18. The schooner <i>Dr. Lykes’</i> share was forfeited because of discrepancies between cargo collected and cargo delivered.</p> <p>In February, 1917, the yacht Ada M struck <i>Lugano</i>, which was the first report of a ship hitting this wreck. A warning to mariners was issued on January 13, 1920 stating that the wreck of Lugano was a danger to navigation. The wreck was estimated to be 3000 tons and had a broken mast and stack visible under water.</p> <p><i>Lugano</i> now lies 25 feet underwater on Long Reef in Biscayne National Park.</p>",

Once the gateway to tremendous fortunes, it is now your gateway to spectacular scenery, vast wilderness, and adventure. For those willing to leave the pavement behind, this road provides access to many natural and historic wonders of our largest park. Today's road originated in 1909 as a railway constructed to support the Kennecott Copper Mines. When large scale mining ended in 1938, most of the rails were salvaged for scrap iron. In 1971 a new bridge was constructed over the Copper River and the rail bed was covered with gravel, creating today's surface of the McCarthy Road.</p> <p>Narrow and winding, the road still reflects its railway origins. In places, remnants of railroad ties may surface along with the occasional spike, creating unexpected hazards. Although traffic and weather often result in ruts and washboarded surfaces, under normal summer conditions most passenger vehicles can make the trip. The road ends at the Kennicott River, a half-mile short of McCarthy and five miles short of historic Kennecott.</p> <p><strong>McCarthy Road Basics:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Begins at mile 33 Edgerton Highway, in Chitina, AK.</li> <li>60 miles, allow 2 hours EACH WAY.</li> <li>Unpaved and maintained by the Alaska state DOT. Rough road conditions and potholes are common.</li> <li>McCarthy Road is a remote area with little to no services. Before starting your trip, FUEL your vehicle in Glennallen, Copper Center, Kenny Lake or in Chitina.</li> <li>Drive slowly, carefully, and courteously.</li> <li>We recommend that you carry a full-sized spare and an adequate jack.</li> <li>Private land adjoins many parts of the road and in the McCarthy/Kennecott area. Please respect private property.</li> <li>Cell phone coverage is very limited.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Look for the mile-marker posts along the McCarthy Road and follow along with this guide:</strong></p> <p><strong>The Town of Chitina </strong></p> <p><strong>Latitude: </strong>61.514862060546875 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-144.43997192382812<br /> <br /> Pronounced, \"Chit-Na,\" this railroad town sprang to life in 1910. Chitina was once bustling as the major stopover and service point for the trains that carried ore from Kennecott to ships in Cordova. The railroad is gone, but today Chitina is busy during the summer fishing season and serves as a gateway to the park. Restrooms and informational panels can be found at the downtown wayside. There are restaurants, shopping, and lodging options in Chitina. There are no gas stations here.</p> <p><strong>Chitina Ranger Station</strong><br /> During the summer months, stop by the historic Chitina Ranger Station. This log cabin, which was constructed in 1910 by the Ed S. Orr Stage Company to house its local superintendent, serves as an enduring reminder of Alaska's colorful transportation history. One of Chitina's oldest surviving buildings, it was rehabilitated by the National Park Service and now serves as a visitor contact station. Current information about road conditions, the park, hikes, fishing opportunities, and other essential topics can be obtained there.</p> <p><strong>State Wayside - The Beginning of the McCarthy Road</strong><br /> This is the start of the McCarthy Road. It is a paved pull-out with vault toilets and exhibit panels.</p> <p>Just beyond the wayside, the road goes through a deep narrow gap known locally as the \"railroad cut.\" Actually it was originally a tunnel and was later altered into an open roadcut. The rocks exposed here are schist and phyllite typical of the Chugach Range.</p> <p><strong>Mile 0.4-0.7</strong><br /> There are several small pullouts here with some great views of the confluence of the mighty Copper and Chitina Rivers. The Copper is the only waterway that cuts through the Chugach Mountains, which extend for about 200 miles in a great arc across south-central Alaska. At the confluence, the Copper River is actually smaller than the Chitina River which is considered its tributary. At this point the Copper is about 1/2 mile wide, while the width of the Chitina is over one mile! The Chitina carries more water year-round than the Copper. Even though the Chitina River drains a smaller area than the Copper, it has more runoff due to greater precipitation in its watershed.</p> <p>The Copper and its tributaries, including the Chitina, drain an area that covers approximately 24,000 square miles. Much of this drainage basin lies within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and about 3,500 square miles, or 17% of the drainage basin, is covered by glaciers. Because of this glacier influence, high water in the Copper River typically occurs not during the snow melt of spring, but during summer hot spells that cause rapid melting of ice. Low water usually occurs in late winter when everything is frozen.</p> <p>In 1950 the U.S. Geological Survey established a stream gauging station at the head of Woods Canyon, about 3.5 miles downstream, well below this confluence. Records from that gauge show that the average discharge of the Copper River has been 37,510 cubic feet per second (CFS) or slightly over 27 million acre feet per year. The largest recorded flood since 1950 was on August 8, 1981, when the river discharged over 380,000 CFS at the gauge. The lowest flow was recorded in March of 1956 when the river carried only 2,000 CFS at the gauge.</p> <p>Rocks exposed on the west <em>(left)</em> side of the road between here and the bridge are gneiss, schist, and phyllite with some quartz veins.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Copper River, Fishwheels, and Mount Drum\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Fishwheels_in_Chitina2.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>The Copper River, Fishwheels, and Mount Drum.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 1.4</strong><br /> As you drive across the Copper River Bridge, you can see the confluence of the Copper and Chitina Rivers. Several small pull-outs provide views of the rivers. Do not stop in the middle of the bridge for photos. After the bridge, the road becomes gravel.</p> <p>The large snow covered mountain visible to the north is volcanic Mount Drum (12,010'), part of the Wrangell Mountains. Suspended sediment loads of the Copper and Chitina Rivers are high, but the dissolved sediment loads are low; these rivers are dirty...but not polluted. Millions of tons of natural sediment, mostly silt and clay are carried downstream each year.</p> <p>The muddy waters that result from all this suspended sediment create an aquatic environment that is not very favorable as a permanent home for most fish. Therefore the Copper and Chitina Rivers have rather small resident fish populations. They do, however, have fantastic populations of migrating fish during the times that mature salmon \"run\" up to clear-water spawning beds and juveniles run down to the ocean each year. The muddy waters of the Copper allow successful salmon fishing by the use of dip nets and fishwheels; neither of these methods would work in clearwater streams.</p> <p><strong>Mile 1.6</strong><br /> On the south (right) side of the road is the Copper River Campground. This is a non-Park Service primitive campground. It is located just after crossing the bridge. This area has 12 sites, picnic tables, fire pits, and vault toilets.</p> <p>On the north (left) side of the road is the Copper River and the Kotsina River delta. The National Park Service has an easement here where you can access and view the Copper River. An easement is an area of land where visitors are granted the right to cross private property. Please follow the easement markers and respect the private property that you are crossing. Visitors can use a small site along the Copper River where they may park a vehicle, load and unload rafts, and temporarily camp for up to 24 hours. This is an excellent place to view the river and to witness Alaskans catching red, silver, and king salmon with dipnets and fishwheels.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Bluffs along the Kotsina river\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/kotsinabluffs.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Look for the brightly colored deposits of a large volcanic debris in the bluffs along the Kotsina River.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 2.0-2.5</strong><br /> There are several small turnouts from which the lower Kotsina River can be seen. The Kotsina, a moderate size tributary of the Copper River, gets much of its water from Long and Kluvesna Glaciers which drain southward off Mt.Wrangell.</p> <p>Brightly colored deposits of a large volcanic debris flow are exposed on the south side of the road and can be also seen in the Kotsina River bluffs a mile to the north. Field studies show that these deposits came from great volumes of ash and clay that were originally high on Mt. Wrangell. They became liquefied when volcanic activity produced much steam and also caused melting of snow and ice. Movement probably began as a volcanic mudflow, but as the mudflow raced down steep slopes of the mountain and along the Chetaslina River it ripped out large pieces of bedrock and picked up loose blocks of rock and river cobbles to become a volcanic debris flow.</p> <p>Materials from this event are called the Chetaslina Volcanic Debris Flow and they were deposited along the Copper Valley and in the lower portions of its tributaries from the Tonsina to the Chitina. These debris flow deposits are overlain in various places by lava flows and also by stream, lake, wind, and glacial sediments. Furthermore, they have experienced considerable erosion by stream activity and by a major glacial advance that occurred after the debris flow. Radioactive potassium-argon dating of a lava flow which overlies debris flow deposits indicates that the Chetaslina Volcanic Debris Flow took place about 200,000 years ago.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 5.0-5.4</strong><br /> Rocks poorly exposed on the north (left) side of the road are basalt and greenstone of the Nicolai Greenstone rock unit. These rocks originated as flows of basaltic lava during the Triassic Period, about 220 million years ago. Later they were partially altered by heat and pressure to form the greenstone that is widely distributed in the Wrangell Mountains and is the source of copper mined near Kennecott. As you continue, you'll discover that limestone is also exposed on the north side of the road.</p> <p align=\"left\">There are several small pullouts that offer nice views of the Chitina River and Chugach Mountains to the south. The Copper River and its tributaries (including the Chitina River) drain an area of approximately 24,000 square miles. Much of this drainage basin lies within the park and almost 25% of it is covered by glaciers. Because of this glacial influence, high water in the park's large rivers typically occurs not during the snowmelt of spring, but summer hot spells that cause rapid ice melting. Low water usually occurs in late winter when everything is frozen.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"The Chitina is a classic example of a braided river\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/chitinaview_1.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Fed by glaciers, the Chitina is a classic example of a braided river</figcaption> </figure>   <p align=\"left\">Streams throughout the world exhibit three basic patterns in their channel form: straight channels, which are uncommon in large streams; meandering channels, which consist of many curves and loop-like bends; and braided channels. The Chitina is a classic example of a braided river as are many of the other rivers in this region. Braided rivers are characterized by many dividing and re-uniting channels and by numerous islands and gravel bars. The braided channel pattern tends to develop in rivers that; a) carry a lot of sand and gravel, b) have fairly steep slopes, or gradients, and c) undergo frequent fluctuations in water level.</p> <p align=\"left\">The Chitina River meets these conditions. In the area we can see here, it drops about 13 feet per mile, which is steep for such a large stream. Glaciers provide the stream with a great deal of sediment ranging from fine clay to boulders. Weather patterns cause flow variations because the river rises during warm and/or wet weather and drops during cold and/ or dry weather. Consequently, much of the sediment being transported to the sea is temporarily stored as islands or bars of gravel, sand, and mud along the Chitina River. If you happen to be viewing the river after several days of hot weather, most of the islands and bars will be flooded.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 10.1</strong><br /> Strelna Lake. A pull-out on the north side of the road provides access to a 1/3-mile trail to Strelna Lake. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, although you can find other fish here as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 10.6</strong><br /> Silver Lake. A short trail on the south side of the road provides access to Silver Lake for fishing. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, and you may find other fish as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 12.3</strong><br /> Sculpin Lake. A pull-out on the south side of the road provides access to a 1/4-mile trail to Sculpin Lake. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, although you can find other fish here as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 14.5</strong><br /> Kotsina Trail - Backcountry Trailheads. The Kotsina Trail departs from the north side of the McCarthy Rd and provides access to backcountry hiking routes. Take this trail 2.5 miles to the Nugget Creek trailhead or 3.8 miles to the Dixie Pass trailhead. The first part of this trail is a road, but it is not maintained and may not be passable for low clearance vehicles. It may be a better option to park your car at the McCarthy Road and hike to the trailheads. Ask a park ranger for more information and route descriptions.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 15.5</strong><br /> The road starts to run southeast here in a low valley between two long ridges of gravel. These gravel ridges are good examples of lateral moraines that were deposited along the margin of a large glacier as it receded.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 15.9</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. The road is now entering land managed by Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17</strong><br /> A few turnouts on the south side of the road offer good views of the Kuskulana River and bridge. Exposures on the other side of the road show the type of sediments that make up glacial moraines.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Kuskulana Bridge\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/kuskulana.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>The Kuskulana Bridge is perched 238 feet above the raging Kuskulana River.</figcaption> </figure>   <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17.2</strong><br /> Kuskulana River Canyon and Bridge. A spectacular achievement, the Kuskulana Bridge was constructed during the winter of 1910. Imagine riding high in a heavily loaded ore train across the two icy rails. Perched 238 feet above the raging Kuskulana River, this single-lane railroad bridge is for many the most hair-raising part of the entire drive. It was the only railroad bridge in this area constructed of steel girders that span the canyon rather than timber pilings driven into the streambed. The bridge is supported primarily by the metamorphic bedrock of the inner gorge rather than the thick layer of glacial gravels near the surface. The Kuskulana’s muddy waters reflect its origin from the melting of several glaciers that drain off the southern and western slopes of Mt. Blackburn.</p> <p align=\"left\">This is a one-lane bridge. Watch for oncoming traffic. Please do not stop in the middle of the bridge for pictures. We encourage you to park at either end of the bridge and get out of your vehicle to enjoy the views.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17.3</strong><br /> Kuskulana Bridge Wayside. This rest area has vault toilets and is a gravel pull-out.</p> <p><strong>Mile 20-21</strong><br /> Vegetation and poor drainage in this area are influenced by the presence of permafrost at relatively shallow depths. This is a good place to contemplate the problems of road construction and maintenance in areas of permafrost, muskeg and swamps.</p> <p><strong>Mile 24</strong><br /> Gilahina Butte to the south <em>(right)</em> of the road is composed of gabbro and gneiss; its sides have been smoothed by large glaciers that formally flowed down the Chitina Valley.</p> <p><strong>Mile 26.8</strong><br /> Clear waters of the Chokosna River support salmon spawning beds.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Gilahina Trestle\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/trestle.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>A classic reminder of a bygone era, this impressive trestle was constructed in eight days during the winter of 1911.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 29.0</strong><br /> Gilahina River & Gilahina Trestle Wayside. This wooden structure was originally 890 feet long and 90 feet high, required one-half million board feet of timber, and was completed in eight days in the winter of 1911. Due to the rugged landscape, over 15% of the entire railway was built on trestles such as this. This rest area offers vault toilets and a gravel pull-out. There is a short 1/2 mile hiking trail that departs from this rest area. Please do not climb on the trestle.</p> <p><strong>Mile 34.8</strong><br /> The Crystalline Hills north of the road are composed mostly of gneiss and gabbro, but some of the lower slopes are made up of a light colored marble. These hills are an excellent place to see Dall Sheep. Take a moment to pull over and look up into the hills. Watch for bright white spots on the hillsides - these may look like patches of snow, but they could actually be sheep!</p> <p><strong>Mile 44.0</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Non-Federal Land. The road is entering privately-managed land.</p> <p><strong>Mile 44.5</strong><br /> The Lakina River gets some of its water from melting glaciers. The bridge was originally built across a river on the Glenn Highway but later removed during a highway upgrade project. Still later it was re-assembled on the Lakina. The bridge itself has functioned well in this location, but it is obvious that a much longer structure would be preferable. There have been repeated erosion problems and washouts of the long eastern approach to the bridge.</p> <p><strong>Mile 45.5</strong><br /> Long Lake. Each year, an average of 18,000 sockeye salmon struggle up the silty Copper and Chitina Rivers to spawn in this lake. This is a unique run. Salmon begin entering the lake as late as September and spawning continues until April. Glacial till and gravels deposited by ancient glaciers and glacial streams mantle the slopes around the lake.</p> <p><strong>Mile 48.3</strong><br /> Looking across the Long Lake inlet streams, the remnants of a C.R. & N.W. Railway trestle can be seen. Marble and limestone is exposed at the trestle footings and in road cuts nearest the stream. The road cuts through sandstone and conglomerate as it ascends the east side of the stream valley.</p> <p><strong>Mile 55.2</strong><br /> State Wayside. This wayside is a gravel pull-out and has vault toilets and exhibit panels.</p> <p><strong>Mile 56.7</strong><br /> Swift Creek, a small clearwater stream drains off Fireweed Mountain. Steeply dipping mudstones of the Chititu Formation are exposed in the cutbank on the west side of the stream. Fireweed Mountain is made up of these dark-colored mudstones and light-colored, silica-rich igneous rocks.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.0</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. The road is now entering land managed by Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.1-58.4</strong><br /> The Kennicott Glacier and River can be viewed from several small turnouts on the southeast <em>(right)</em> side of the road. Ice of the glacier is mantled by rock material, ranging from large boulders to very fine glacial flour that is still in transit. A short walk around the glacier terminus will make it obvious why glacial streams are so muddy. The Kennicott River runs from the glacier down to the Nizina River, so it is only five miles long. Bluffs along the Kennicott River apparently reflect down-cutting by stream erosion after the glacier melted back from its earlier, more extensive size. It can be seen from these viewpoints that the river valley gets progressively deeper going downstream. The Kennicott River drops over 250 feet in its five mile run between the glacier and the Nizina River. Where it empties into the Nizina, the Kennicott River is in an erosional canyon over 350 feet deep; ten miles further downstream the Nizina is entrenched over 600 feet where it joins the Chitina River.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.6</strong><br /> McCarthy Road Information Station. This National Park Service information station contains posted information that is updated during the summer. Day-use parking is available as well as vault toilets, updated bulletin boards, and a short hiking trail. No overnight camping or parking is available. This station is generally not staffed.</p> <p><strong>Mile 59.4 - The End of the Road!</strong><br /> Kennicott River & Parking. You've made it to the end of the road, but in many ways, your adventure is just beginning. All visitors must leave their vehicles at the end of the road and walk, bike, or take a shuttle into McCarthy and Kennecott.</p> <p><strong>McCarthy - 1/2 Mile from the Footbridge</strong><br /> Homesteaded in 1906, McCarthy quickly grew into a lively community with a story all its own. McCarthy served as the supply and recreation stop for the entire Kennecott mining district. Town history is well portrayed by the local museum and guide services. Today, McCarthy retains much of its original flavor. Accommodations, dining, guide services, flightseeing, and air taxis are some of the services available here.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Kennecott\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/historyculture/images/kennecott.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Kennecott\" /> <figcaption>Kennecott Mill</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark - 5 miles from the Footbridge</strong><br /> Like a time capsule, the impressive structures and artifacts left behind when the mines were depleted represent an ambitious time of exploration, discovery, and technological innovation. Currently, the National Park Service is stabilizing and rehabilitating many of the old buildings.</p> <p><strong>Kennecott Visitor Center</strong><br /> The Kennecott Visitor Center is located within the historic landmark. Park rangers and local guide services conduct programs and town tours daily during the summer. This is where most hiking trails depart - trails lead to the Root Glacier and up the mountains to spectacular views and historic mining structures.</p> <p><strong>Jumbo Creek Camping Area - 1.4 miles from Kennecott</strong><br /> This primitive camping area has no amenities. It is reached via foot travel only. Water is available from nearby streams and there are bear boxes for storing food.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

We hope you’re excited to embark upon this once in a lifetime journey. The rough and challenging McCarthy Road winds through the park and into the heart of this rugged Alaskan terrain. Remoteness requires a little planning, so we hope you have all the essentials: extra food & water, a road guide & map, a park newspaper, binoculars, proper outdoor gear & clothing, a spare tire & adequate jack, and a strong sense of adventure! The McCarthy Road provides for breathtaking mountain vistas, the chance to see wildlife and an opportunity to explore the vast landscape. You can also learn the surprising tale of a railway built solely to serve the bustling Kennecott Copper Mines. The McCarthy Road stretches for 59 scenic miles from the famous Copper River to the historic towns of McCarthy and Kennecott. The roadway originated as a railway, completed in 1911, to transport copper ore from the remote Kennecott Copper Mines to a coastal port for shipping. When large scale operations ended in 1938, most of the rails were salvaged for scrap iron, but were subsequently lost to a tsunami following the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake. The remaining rails were pushed aside along the road. In 1971 a new bridge was constructed over the Copper River, the first large river you cross just one mile west of the town of Chitina. The rail bed was then covered with gravel, creating what we now call the McCarthy Road. Narrow and winding, the road still reflects its railway origins. In places, remnants of railroad ties may come to the surface along with the occasional spike, creating unexpected hazards. Although traffic and weather often result in ruts and bumpy surfaces, under normal summer conditions most passenger vehicles can make the trip. Please allow faster vehicles to pass, by pulling over and using turnouts. Due to the narrow road and limited visibility, we suggest extreme caution for large RV’s on the McCarthy Road. Remember the speed limit is 35 mph and most times you’ll need to go slower due to changing and hazardous conditions. Also, the McCarthy Road can have soft shoulders and may be slick in rainy conditions, so travel with care. In dry conditions, the road can be extremely dusty. If you’re passing on-coming traffic, slow down so that both vehicles are able to see the edge of the road as you’re passing. Increase your following distance to stay safe in these dusty conditions. This will make for a more enjoyable ride for all travelers on the road. Driving the entire length of the McCarthy Road can take about 2 to 3 hours oneway. Some other important facts to note about this road: At several points along the way, you’ll notice signs showing private land interspersed among the national park and national preserve lands, so please respect private property. Cell phone coverage varies by carrier, but is generally good with some dead zones. Other carriers may have no coverage at all. There are several waysides and rest areas located along the road, with vault toilets and picnic tables, but no running water. Last, but not least, there are no fuel stations along the McCarthy Road, but fuel may be seasonally available in McCarthy, at the end of the road. Tire repair service may be seasonally available in McCarthy and Chitina. There are no other services along the road, so please plan accordingly.",

At 2.7 miles round-trip, this loop trail only gains 600 feet of elevation, making it an excellent option for many ages and abilities! The trail runs parallel to the Ohanapecosh River before crossing it, leading hikers to a bridge with a stunning view of Silver Falls. The turquoise water churns below, turning white as the water rushes around rocks, and between the eroded walls of the small canyon. The trail continues along the other side of the Ohanapecosh River, leading hikers back to the campground.<br /> <br /> The trail has two trailheads in the Ohanapecosh Campground. Hikers can begin their journey from Loop B (near the visitor center), or across the river near the campground amphitheater. Watch children closely on this hike and do not venture on to the rocks, as they are very slick. There are no backcountry camps along this trail. Pets are not permitted. This trail is typically hikeable from May to October. The Ohanapecosh area is not accessible by vehicle in the winter months.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Hikers can access the <strong>Grove of the Patriarchs</strong> and the <strong>Eastside Trail </strong>from the Silver Falls Trail by traveling north at the north end of the loop rather than going back to Ohanapecosh.

The majority, approximately 70 percent, died from such illnesses as cholera, typhoid fever, gonorrhea and dysentery. The rest died from accidents in and around the fort.</p> <p>Along with the soldiers, about 40 civilians who died at or near the fort between 1859 and 1872 were also buried there.  Fort Larned also served as an Indian Agency, and as a result of an unfortunate incident, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/little-heart.htm\">there is one Indian buried in the post cemetery</a>. <br /> <br /> Also in the cemetery is a single brown pointed obelisk that stands taller than the other headstones. This monument, made of native stone, was placed in the cemetery in 1867 by soldiers of the 3rd U.S. Infantry stationed here at that time. The inscription reads:  “J.B. MacIntyre Col. USA Died at Fort Larned Kansas, May 9 1867. Was one of the officers, of Extra Duty, Maintained the Honor of his Country G. [Gallantly] the Days of the Recent Rebellion”</p> <p>Following the fort’s closing in 1878, the military bodies were exhumed and reburied at the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in 1888.</p> <p>On September 19, 2009, those soldiers who were reburied at the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery were recognized. A bronze monument was dedicated in Section B with the names of 62 soldiers, giving them recognition for their service. The identities of three soldiers still remain unknown.<br />  </p>",

Fort Larned National Historic Site protects a small area of grassland, offering a window into this now radically altered ecosystem.</p> <p>Today, mule deer and white-tail deer are the only hoofed mammals still here. You can still find many small mammals, though. Fox squirrels, thirteen-lined ground squirrels, prairie dogs, pocket gophers, beavers, skunks, raccoons, opossums, coyotes, muskrats, weasels, and badgers all make their home here. Occasionally, you might even see an armadillo in the northern extreme of their range.</p> <p>Several species of reptiles may also be found at Fort Larned like lizards, toads, turtles, bullsnakes, blue racers, hog-nosed snakes, and garter snakes.<br /> <br /> The nature trail’s variety of habitats provide for numerous species of birds such as hawks, orioles, kingbirds, blue jays, and red-headed woodpeckers, among many others. Fort Larned is located on the Central Flyway, a major bird migration corridor. White-fronted geese, sandhill cranes, and many other species pass over Fort Larned during spring and fall migrations.</p> <p>Dozens of species of grasses, forbs, and shrubs constitute the plant life of the grasslands, providing food and shelter for animals as well as impressive wildflower displays.</p> <p>Cottonwood trees, dependent on the water available in the river, line the banks of the Pawnee Fork. Historic photos show far fewer trees than today, largely because the trees were susceptible to naturally-occurring prairie fires and were also used for fuel.<br />  </p>",

They were an important part of fort life, providing goods and services not available to soldiers through the regular army supply system. Soldiers and officers could get such things as food, clothing, tobacco, and personal items from the sutler's store. <br /> <br /> Army regulations provided for one sutler per post so the trader who got the license had, in effect, a captive market. However, there were restrictions imposed by the Army for this privilege.  They were supervised by a post Council of Administration, which assessed a fee every few months  of several cents for each officer and enlisted man on the post. The Council also determined  “the quantity and kind of clothing, small equipment, or soldiers’ necessaries, groceries, etc.” the sutler had to have available for sale.  In order to keep soldiers from overspending their meager pay, the sutler was not allowed to extend credit to a soldier for over half of his monthly salary.  He also could not sell alcohol to them without the permission of their officers.<br /> <br /> Due to a mix up, Fort Larned had two posts sutlers for several years. The two areas circled on the picture indicate the location of each sutler's operation. The red frame building to the west is where the original sutler's store was located. The building is a reconstruction of the sutler's quarters. The store itself was a sandstone building constructed in 1863. Where you are standing is the site of the second sutler's store. This second complex had a restaurant, general store, recreation hall, billiards, and a one-lane bowling alley for military and civilians.<br />  </p>",

Other than a surface supply from Water Canyon, tapped by the Mores in the 1870s, developed sources of water on the island include only a remote spring and a system of wells located near the ranch complex.<br /> <br /> The More family developed a water system in the early 1870s to supply the ranch complex. A dam in Water Canyon, apparently no longer existing, impounded water that was delivered in riveted iron pipe for a distance of two miles.<br /> <br /> A circular, rock-lined reservoir at the ranch complex appears to have been fed by this line as well. Remnants of the original pipeline remain in Water Canyon, and the old reservoir is a landmark near the Russ Vail house, east of the south end of the eucalyptus windbreak. Part of the reservoir wall has been destroyed, and vegetation, including a eucalyptus tree, is encroaching.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers developed most of its cattle watering systems in the vicinity of the main ranch and Carrington Point. On the south side of the island, one small system was developed at Clapp Spring. While the island was well watered by natural sources (perennial streams), these sites needed development because of concentrations of cattle and lack of natural sources.<br /> <br /> The major source of water for ranch operations is located in the appropriately named Windmill Canyon west of the ranch house. At an unknown date before the 1930s someone drilled or dug a well and installed a windmill and a redwood storage tank. Water from this reliable source fed by gravity the ranch houses, outbuildings, and troughs in the ranch complex.<br /> <br /> For some time the Vails used a tractor or old Army vehicle on jacks to pump water from the well. Later the Vails built a pump house. As of 1984, two hand-dug wells, measuring four by four feet and 40 feet deep, were present; one was active, with a storage tank in place. In the late 1980s the NPS replaced and updated the well, windmill, and pump system. Water is piped from the sources in Windmill Canyon also to the NPS housing, campground, and main ranch residences.<br /> <br /> Clapp Spring, near the top of San Augustin Canyon, produces a fine and reliable water source. Water from the spring runs by gravity through a pipe from the springhouse at the source to a concrete watering trough on the Sierra Pablo road. No one knows who found and developed the spring. Clapp Spring allegedly got its name from an incident when its pure water cured an old cowboy's venereal disease. True or not, the water is excellent. Ranch workers bottled it in five-gallon containers for drinking water.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a raised grassy field, surrounded by seasonal creeks on most sides. On this field, a dirt road loops around a white building with green trim. It is 20 feet wide by 10 feet deep by 8 to 10 feet high, on a poured concrete foundation, with plywood walls, and a slanted roof. The paint on the walls is faded and flaking off in spots. <br /><br />On the taller, front side of the building is a front door, on the right side. The left side of the building has a light mounted under the roof overhang and one window, centered at about a 6 foot height. Below the window, at the bottom of the building wall, a metal pipe curves out and into the ground. Adjacent to the pipe, buried in the ground, is a cement cover, with the words, \"Water\" and \"Brooks\". The back of the building has three pipes at the base of the wall. Two curve out and into the ground; the other curves to the right, and seems wrapped and capped with a tap or spigot. The right side of the building has a pipe that curves out of the building about one foot above the bottom of the wall at the right corner. It curves into the ground, but has an arm of spigot about half to the ground. There is a red handle on this spigot, and another on the main pipe, below the spigot.<br /><br />The outer edges of this field are dotted with scrubby shrubs that grow thicker as the ground slopes downward toward the seasonal creeks below. Small trees like willows and cottonwoods grow near the creek beds. In the distance are rolling hills, covered with scrubby brush, with a few bare patches of sandy colored rock or soil.<br />",

How did these shells get there? It must be the ocean at work-or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify these sites as \"middens,\" debris piles containing remnants of past societies-the Tongva, the Chumash, and their ancestors. The island's 30 or so midden sites suggest that occupation dates back at least 4,000 years, and probably even more than that. However, due to the lack of a steady supply of fresh water and the few terrestrial resources, permanent settlements were never established on Santa Barbara Island. The island was instead used on a seasonal basis and as a stopover between Santa Catalina and San Nicolas Islands.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Tongva and Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of the ancient island life of these peoples. The Tongva and Chumash were skilled craftspeople and seafarers, with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the middens reveals that they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the Santa Barbara Channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> These middens also reveal that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be traded for with villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were used as currency of trade in the Tongva and Chumash areas and throughout California.<br /> <br /> To produce these beads, chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells. Chert, a hard, durable silica rock, was found in considerable quantities on Santa Cruz Island. Because Eastern Santa Cruz Island had chert of the proper type and quality needed for tool construction, this location became the center for manufacturing chert microdrills. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island and the other Channel Islands were not isolated enough to protect the island Tongva and Chumash from the diseases the Spanish explorers and missionaries brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Tongva and Chumash had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics, as well as by drought and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the islanders would leave their traditional island home by the mid-1800s.<br /> <br /> Although much of the islander's history and way of life has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of Santa Barbara Island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Tongva and Chumash, remind us how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br />  </p> <p><b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol , helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law.

Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</strong></em><br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash and Tongva History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash and Tongva on Santa Barbara Island</strong><br /> Due to the lack of fresh water and few terrestrial resources, Santa Barbara Island most likely did not support any permanent native settlements. Recent studies show evidence that occupation of the island dates back at least 4,000 years, suggesting seasonal visits to the island. Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a></p> <p><br /> <strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash. It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em><strong>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students,</strong></em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named ˜elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, ˜elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, ˜elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Anacapa Island, while surrounded by relatively calm waters when compared to those west of it, experiences dangerous fogs and Santa Ana winds. A number of vessels wrecked on or near the island although only one seemed to have been related to pilot error. The wreck of the <em>Winfield Scott</em> in 1853 was the most important of the Channel Islands shipwrecks.<br /> <br /> Westervelt and MacKay of New York built the <em>Winfield Scott</em> in 1850 for a route between New York and New Orleans. Named for the commanding general of the U. S. Army, Mexican War hero and presidential nominee, the 225-foot steam paddlewheeler began travel between the east and west coasts when she joined the New York and San Francisco Steamship Line in 1852. She set a record for that route (via Cape Horn) of less than 49 days. She then took passengers between Panama and San Francisco, usually in overcrowded conditions. In July of 1853 the Winfield Scott was sold to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.<br /> <br /> Loaded with over 300 passengers and crew and a reported $1 million in gold bullion (some accounts but the figure at $2 million), the <em>Winfield Scott</em> departed San Francisco on December 1, 1853. The next evening Captain Simon F. Blunt chose to pass through the Santa Barbara Channel to save time, but in a dense fog crashed into Middle Anacapa at full speed at 11:00 in the evening. Apparently Blunt had turned southeast thinking he had cleared Santa Cruz or Anacapa Islands. Purser Watkins gave this account, which was published by the Alta California:<br /> <br /> \"The ship's bow struck first, staving two holes in the bow; then, in backing off, her stern struck and knocked away her rudder. Most of the passengers had gone to bed but they came on deck in alarm. They could only look out into a thick fog and see nothing of the land. After losing the rudder, the ship drifted off the island a few hundred yards and then was swept back to strike the shore again with her bow. She had already taken on much water and now sank up to her guards.<br /> <br /> The Captain immediately sent out a boat to see where he could land the passengers. The purser reported that a little island separate from the main one was nearest and that the passengers could be placed on it for the night. The next morning the passengers, some mail, and the treasure were taken onto the main island. Captain Blunt stayed cool, provided bedding and provisions for the passengers, and moved among them unceasingly in his efforts to make them comfortable.\"<br /> <br /> After being brought from the small pinnacle some 200 yards offshore to the island in the ship's boats, the large group camped on the island for up to a week. The California saw smoke from the passengers' fires and rescued the women. It returned on December 9 and, in heavy swells, removed the rest of the passengers, leaving the ship's company on the island who attempted to save mail, baggage, furniture and some machinery from the wreck. Other boats appeared for salvage opportunities, including that of Captain Horatio Gates Trussell, who used wood and two brass thresholds from the wreck in the construction of his Santa Barbara home.<br /> <br /> On the 10th the steamer Southerner hove into sight and landed provisions for the officers and crew. Up to that time, the Winfield Scott had not been broken up by the action of the waves. When the Republic arrived the next day, however, the midship was sunk and Captain Blunt gave up all hope of saving her or getting her off the ledge. The crew went out to the ship and saved what they could before boarding the Republic for San Francisco. Some time later, the side-wheeler toppled off the ledge and sank. The valuable cargo was apparently saved although the lure of gold still attracts divers, who are prohibited by federal law from disturbing the wreck site.<br /> <br /> In 1894 and during World War II major salvage took place on the Winfield Scott. One firm blasted the wreck in order to remove hundreds of large copper bolts and much of the iron machinery. The wreck became popular to sport divers who are now prohibited by antiquity laws from removing any artifacts. The wreck of the Winfield Scott is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> The wreck scatter is surveyed each year by the National Park Service. The scatter is considered to be small for such a large vessel, with the bow and stern missing. The most prominent piece of wreckage is purported to be the port paddle wheel, which stands above the bottom.</p>",

Prior to the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan, the United States activated a number of defense mechanisms on the Pacific Coast, but this event put coastal defenses at the forefront of military activity in California. Following the attack, at least three Japanese attacks occurred on the California coast, including the torpedoing of a freighter off Los Angeles and a submarine firing on the Ellwood Oil Field near Santa Barbara. The evolving war in the Pacific spawned a network of coastal lookout stations and aircraft warning installations from San Diego to the Canadian border. The Navy established coastal lookouts on all of the Channel Island, and radar posts on Santa Barbara and Santa Rosa Islands.<br /> <br /> The station consisted of a technical radar site overlooking the ocean near South Point, the housing and operations camp on a small, dry pond near Pecho Peak, and storage buildings and a barrack at Bechers Bay. The housing and operations camp had sixteen wood-frame buildings, including seven barracks, a mess hall, a bath house, a motor repair building, a generator building, various storage sheds, and a pit latrine. A water supply system was composed of one or two dams in upper Water Canyon and a lift system to a water tank, which then fed the water by gravity to the camp. The radar station included a buried concrete radio building, mobile anti-aircraft gun, buried five-room concrete operations or bunker building, generator house, storage building, pit latrine, water tank, and radar beacon unit.<br /> <br /> One of the most fascinating structures remaining at this Army camp is the flagstaff base, a concrete slab in the shape of a star, measuring 10 feet in diameter. A four-inch pipe supported the flagstaff, and the builders of the camp inscribed the date and their detachments in the slab: \"26 AUG 1943 / 770 / MP BATTALION / CO C / THIRD PLATOON\" and \"LAFW / 658 SIGNAL / AW CO / DET SIX.\" These inscriptions have provided the only clue as to who occupied the base: the 770th Military Police Battalion, Company C, Third Platoon and the Los Angeles Air Defense Wing, 658th Signal Corps Aircraft Warning Company, Detachment Six. Their activities, other than manning the radar site as a forward observation and warning system, which requires a relatively small crew, remains somewhat of a mystery. It is likely that the military police battalion used the island for training and provided general protection.<br /> <br /> After the Battle of Midway in June of 1942 the Japanese threat diminished, thus lessening the importance of outposts like this. The site was eventually abandoned by the end of 1945. The Army turned the camp over to Vail & Vickers, who used the buildings for a while, then disassembled them for materials or moved small ones to other locations on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the </strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> _</p>",

In addition, Cabrillo is now considered to be Spanish rather than Portuguese. Nonetheless, the monument was placed by a civic organization with pride, based on the evidence available at the time.<br /> <br /> <b>Cabrillo and San Miguel Island</b><br /> In 1542 Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo was the first European explorer to reach the isolated, windswept shores of San Miguel Island. However, he was certainly not the first to \"discover\" it. When Cabrillo came ashore there were approximately 100 Chumash living in 2 villages along the island's coast, including a village at Cuyler Harbor. The Chumash and their ancestors had been living on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years.<br /> <br /> Cabrillo's chronicler Juan Paez de Castro wrote about San Miguel Island: \"Wednesday, the 25th [October 1542], they left these islands, that is, the one farthest to windward, which has a very good port inside which no bad effects will be felt in any kind of sea weather. They named it Posesión. That day they only sailed a little because there was no wind . . .\" Then, on \"Thursday, the 23d [November 1542] they arrived on their return at the Islas de San Lucas, at the one named Posesión.\" Paez de Castro wrote that \"they named this island the ˜Isla de Juan Rodriguez'\" and mentioned the Chumash names for the island which they had apparently learned from the friendly occupants. Antonio de Herrera wrote in 1615, \"In the eight days they were at this port they were well treated by the Indians, who go naked and have their faces painted in a checkerboard fashion.\"<br /> <br /> Returning to San Miguel Island after exploring northward on the coast, Cabrillo's party hauled out their frigata San Miguel at Cuyler Harbor to recaulk and repair planking. Either here or on another island the fleet wintered; debate continues whether the long-accepted location of San Miguel Island is accurate. Nevertheless, the Chumash were not as welcoming this time. Francisco de Vargas recalled in 1560: \"With the natives of this island he had some great fights as they came out in a warlike manner. During all the time the fleet was at the Island Capitana the Indians never stopped fighting.\" It was at this winter location, possibly San Miguel but also likely Santa Cruz or Santa Catalina, that Cabrillo sustained his mortal injury and died. The fleet returned to San Miguel Island again on March 5 but \"did not dare enter the port,\" according to Paez de Castro, \"on account of the storm which was blowing, which made the sea break in fifteen fathoms at the entrance. It was a north-northwest wind and the entrance is narrow.\"</p>",

One chronicler of the Cabrillo expedition wrote that local natives called the island <strong>Ciquimuymu</strong> , with two villages named <strong>Cico</strong> and <strong>Nimollollo</strong> . Accepted Chumash knowledge notes the island being called <strong>Tuqan</strong> , with the same name applied to its largest town that was probably located at Cuyler Harbor. A smaller settlement named <strong>Niwoyonmi</strong> has not been located. The occupants of this island would have experienced harsher climatic conditions than their neighbors on Santa Rosa or Santa Cruz islands; there were few locations that afforded good shelter, although water was available. Archeologists considered that the more intense conditions on the island likely spurred the San Miguel Chumash into extensive trade, especially with people on the mainland east of Goleta. San Miguel's occupants also had strong ties with those of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> Humans settled San Miguel Island at a very early date, as evidenced by evaluation of archeological materials found at Daisy Cave and other sites along the coastline. Preliminary results from excavations at Daisy Cave indicate a society reliant on the sea for sustenance, and one that had adapted through the development of technologies considered to be the earliest examples known in the New World, including the use of fishhooks and line. Fish bones from Daisy Cave have been dated as up to 11,500 years old, suggesting that the island was occupied as early as its neighbor, Santa Rosa Island; together (the four northern islands were one large island during this early period) these would represent perhaps the oldest known settlement in the region.<br /> <br /> As with the occupants of the other Channel Islands, the combination of pressures from the mainland missions, disruption of their trade and subsistence activities and invasions by European hunters eventually caused the Chumash to vacate the island, reportedly as early as 1816. However, the exact date when the last Chumash occupants of San Miguel Island were removed or left is not known. Fernando Librado, J. P. Harrington's Chumash informant, claimed that many people were killed in a fierce storm at the time of removal from the island, but the story has not been substantiated.<br /> <br /> The Chumash presence on San Miguel Island is today represented in the archeological record. Many important discoveries have been made indicating early habitation and technological innovation. Further investigations will lead to a better understanding of the social structure, subsistence and technology of the island residents and their relationships with mainlanders and other islanders.<br /> <br /> The earliest descriptions of the island Chumash culture and the first historical documentation of contact activities are found in the accounts of the various explorers who traveled in the region between 1542 and 1603. Cabrillo's chronicler Juan Paez de Castro wrote about San Miguel Island: \"Wednesday, the 25th October 1542], they left these islands, that is, the one farthest to windward, which has a very good port inside which no bad effects will be felt in any kind of sea weather. Paez mentioned the Chumash names for the island which they had apparently learned from the friendly occupants. Antonio de Herrera wrote in 1615, \"In the eight days they were at this port they were well treated by the Indians, who go naked and have their faces painted in a checkerboard fashion.\"<br /> <br /> Returning to San Miguel Island after exploring northward on the coast, Cabrillo's party hauled out their <em>frigata San Miguel</em> at Cuyler Harbor to recaulk and repair planking. Either here or on another island the fleet wintered; debate continues whether the long-accepted location of San Miguel Island is accurate. Nevertheless, the Chumash were not as welcoming this time. Francisco de Vargas recalled in 1560: \"With the natives of this island he had some great fights as they came out in a warlike manner. During all the time the fleet was at the Island Capitana the Indians never stopped fighting.\"<br /> <br /> Direct contacts with the island were few after Cabrillo's fateful voyage. Vizcaíno had contact with island Chumash in 1602, as his chronicler wrote: \"At dawn the captain's ship was near an island [San Miguel] in the shelter of which it was calm. A canoe came out with two Indians and a small boy, their eyes being painted with antimony. They asked us to go to their land; however, there was such a heavy sea and the island presented so many shoals that we did not dare to go to it, but veered out to sea . . . \"<br /> <br /> <u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><b>Chumash on the Channel Islands</b></p> <p>Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word <strong>Michumash</strong> , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br />  </p> <p><b>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</b><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.</p> <p><br /> <b>Missionization</b></p> <p>By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br />  </p> <p><b>Contemporary Chumash</b><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/collections-research/anthropology/chumash-life/\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.santaynezchumash.org/chumash-history\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a></p>   <p><b>Limuw: A Story of Place</b><br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.</p> <p>Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students .</em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</b><br /> Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the <strong>tomol </strong> began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, <strong>'Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual <strong>tomol </strong> crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the <strong>tomol </strong> was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p> <p> </p>",
            "audioDescription": "From the middle of the Nidever Canyon, if you are facing down toward the ocean, you will be facing north. A narrow one-mile trail is carved into the steep canyon wall, leading to Cuyler Harbor Beach below. Along some parts of the trail, wooden planks are laid into the dry ground, creating steps. At the base of the canyon are large sand dunes that give way to the beach below. Prince Island can be seen in the distance. It is tall and rocky, with a plateau on top. Behind you, the trail leads up to the Cabrillo Monument, the campground, and the ranger station. <br /><br />The hillsides along Nidever Canyon Trail are covered with a large variety of flowering plants. Dudleya, a succulent with thick grey-green leaves clustered in a rose shape, an inch or two high. Red stems rise up from these clusters, topped by yellow rounded flowers about four inches tall. <br />Coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, is topped by a spray of yellow, daisy-like flowers, and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers, in the spring. During drier seasons, the plant appears dead, as the top withers into a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dried leaves.<br />Island buckwheat, with soft grey-green rounded leaves and, in season, clusters of button-like yellow flowers. Non-native grasses also grow in the canyon. Water is almost always present in the bottom of the canyon. Depending on the time of your visit, there is also a seasonal waterfall. Landbirds are often seen here. <br />",

How did these shells get there? It must be the ocean at work-or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify these sites as \"middens,\" debris piles containing remnants of past societies-the Tongva, the Chumash, and their ancestors. The island's 30 or so midden sites suggest that occupation dates back at least 4,000 years, and probably even more than that. However, due to the lack of a steady supply of fresh water and the few terrestrial resources, permanent settlements were never established on Santa Barbara Island. The island was instead used on a seasonal basis and as a stopover between Santa Catalina and San Nicolas Islands.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Tongva and Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of the ancient island life of these peoples. The Tongva and Chumash were skilled craftspeople and seafarers, with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the middens reveals that they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the Santa Barbara Channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> These middens also reveal that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be traded for with villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were used as currency of trade in the Tongva and Chumash areas and throughout California.<br /> <br /> To produce these beads, chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells. Chert, a hard, durable silica rock, was found in considerable quantities on Santa Cruz Island. Because Eastern Santa Cruz Island had chert of the proper type and quality needed for tool construction, this location became the center for manufacturing chert microdrills. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island and the other Channel Islands were not isolated enough to protect the island Tongva and Chumash from the diseases the Spanish explorers and missionaries brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Tongva and Chumash had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics, as well as by drought and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the islanders would leave their traditional island home by the mid-1800s.<br /> <br /> Although much of the islander's history and way of life has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of Santa Barbara Island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Tongva and Chumash, remind us how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol , helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law.

Recent studies show evidence that occupation of the island dates back at least 4,000 years, suggesting seasonal visits to the island. Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island.

A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a></p> <p><br /> <strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash. It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em><strong>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students,</strong></em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named ˜elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, ˜elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, ˜elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing at the center point of a large open grassy plateau, at a Y-shaped point in the trail system, where three trails converge. It is marked with an upright 4-inch by 4-inch post about 3 feet high. From this point, two trails run almost parallel toward Signal Peak, a rounded hill in the distance, to the southwest. After a while, one trail veers southeast toward the Sea Lion Rookery and Cat Canyon at the southern end of the island. The third trail runs north toward the campground, Visitor Center, and Landing Cove.<br /><br />All of these narrow trails are slightly depressed into the sandy soil, creating groove in the landscape that is a foot or two wide, and several inches deep. The ground is blanketed with dried gray grass and small broken twigs. In patches, on either side of the trail, are grasses, crystalline ice plant, saltbush, and coastal sagebrush. A few coreopsis dot the landscape. These have thick branches topped with tufts of green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy brittle, brown mop of dead leaves and blooms in late summer and early fall. <br /><br />To the west, in the distance, you can see the ocean. <br />",

            "bodyText": "<p>With the islands having never been connected to the mainland, plants, seeds, and spores over millions of years were carried from the mainland by ocean currents, wind, and birds or in the fur of animals that reached the islands. Due to continuous isolation from the mainland, many plant communities on the islands are unique, including the absence of some common mainland species and the presence of many island endemics (species that grow naturally only on one or more of the Channel Islands).<br /> <br /> Since the Chumash did not practice agriculture, they used native plants as a primary source of food and medicine. Native plants also provided important construction materials for canoes, houses, bows, arrows, nets, baskets, beds, clothing, footwear, ornaments, and a variety of other items used in daily life.<br /> <br /> With nonnative browsing and grazing animals now removed, many native plants are spreading beyond the steep canyon walls and cliffs-where they remained protected from grazing for nearly 150 years-and reestablishing themselves throughout the island. Take time to look carefully in Water Canyon (or other island canyons such as Lobo and Cherry Canyons) and you should see some of the following species.</p> <h3>Toyon</h3> <p>Also known as Christmas berry or California holly, this plant is an evergreen chaparral and coastal sage scrub species that grows on all of the larger islands and on the mainland as well. Due to sheep grazing and reduced fire frequency, toyons on the island are more tree-like than most found on the mainland. During the summer and fall the small flowers decorating the tips of the branches give way to clusters of bright red berries. During the winter these berries provide an important food supply for birds.<br /> <br /> The Chumash ate toyon berries as well, roasting them or letting them wilt in the hot sun before eating. Toyon was also a valuable source of hardwood for manufacturing a variety of implements such as arrows, harpoons, fish spears, digging sticks, and gaming pieces. The Chumash often used heat or steam to shape and form objects made from toyon and other hardwoods.</p> <h3>Island Scrub Oak, Coast Live Oak, and Island Cherry</h3> <p>Island scrub oak is a thin-branched shrub with flat, smooth-edged leaves that are rich green on the upper surface and a dull gray underneath. Coast live oak is a much taller and stouter tree, with cupped, spiny-edged leaves and \"hairy armpits.\" Turn over one of the leaves and look for a small, fuzzy white patch where some of the side veins of the leaf join the central vein.<br /> <br /> The acorns from these oaks, along with those from six other species that grow on Santa Rosa Island, were an important food source for the Island Chumash and many other California Indian groups. Each fall acorns were gathered, hulled, dried, and stored in large granary baskets. When prepared, acorns were ground into meal, leached to remove the tannic acid and bitter flavor, and cooked into mush. Other seeds and herbs may have been added to enhance the (generally bland) flavor.<br /> <br /> Although the Island Chumash gathered acorns, oaks are less abundant on the islands than on the mainland. To increase their supply of acorns and other medicinal and food plants, the islanders engaged in trade or undertook gathering expeditions to the mainland. The island Chumash also compensated for the short supply of acorns by substituting other plant foods in their place. One important alternative was island cherry. Most often, island cherry grows as a large shrub. However, in deep, moist soils and sunshine it can grow to a forty-foot tree. This plant blooms from spring through early summer. When ripe, the fruit ranges in color from dark purple to black and is characterized by a large seed and pulpy flesh. In addition to eating the pulp, the pits were boiled in several changes of water to release the toxic chemicals. Then the pits were mashed to the consistency of refried beans and eaten.</p> <h3>Monkey Flower</h3> <p>Monkey flower is common in chaparral throughout California. Known as \"sticky\" monkey flower because the deep green leaves secrete a gluey substance, they bloom from January to May and were named for the monkey face that sometimes can be seen within the orange to pale yellow flowers. A mainland species, endemic island species, and a hybrid between the two occur here on Santa Rosa Island. The island endemic species differs from the mainland species in the lack of sticky leaves and its bright red flowers. The hybrid produces peach or bronze-colored flowers. These plants are commonly seen on rock walls where the nonnative animals could not reach.</p> <h3>Lemonade Berry</h3> <p>Lemonade berry is a shrub with thick, leathery leaves. The Chumash would steep the sticky, lemon-tasting berries in water to make juice, or they would suck on them like candy. One should be careful, however, since lemonade berry belongs to the same family as poison oak and can trigger a skin rash in those sensitive to it.</p> <h3>Santa Cruz Island Ironwood</h3> <p>Thousands of years ago the Channel Islands had a moister climate, as did much of southern California. Different plant communities and different animals, such as pygmy mammoths, existed on the islands. The Santa Cruz Island ironwood is a relic of this earlier environment. Fossil evidence indicates that ironwoods once grew on the mainland as far north as Washington and as far east as Nevada.<br /> <br /> Today the ironwood grows only on islands in locations where conditions approximate California's earlier, wetter climate. Small groves of these trees are often found on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, where they grow mostly in north-facing canyons cooled by fog. In fact, fog is an important element in the ironwood's successful adaptation and survival. Moisture from fog collects on the leaves and drips down to the soil surrounding the trunk, thereby increasing the amount of water available to the tree. This also helps to sustain the other larger tree species on Santa Rosa and the other islands.<br /> <br /> Ironwood has dark green, highly serrated, finger-like leaves and in summer produces many small white flowers.</p> <h3>Poison Oak</h3> <p>Poison oak grows on all of the Channel Islands except Santa Barbara Island and is readily identified in spring as a three-leafed shrub or vine with bronze-green foliage. During late summer and fall the leaves turn a red or rust color and white berries develop. Poison oak can cause allergic reactions and rashes if it comes in contact with the skin. Please do not touch. The Chumash used poison oak to treat warts, cankers, and skin cancer and to staunch blood flow.</p> <h3>Coastal Prickly Pear</h3> <p>The coastal prickly pear is a cactus that blooms in May and June, producing a shiny yellow flower with dense layers of petals. The plant's shallow root system spreads over a wide area to extract maximum moisture while its sharp spines reflect the sun and wind to help protect the plant from deyhydration.<br /> <br /> The spines also helped protect the plant from cattle, sheep, elk, deer, and pigs, allowing it to spread into the overgrazed sage scrub and grasslands. Forney's map of 1873 depicted numerous thickets of cactus across the island. Mrs. Woolley said, \"the thing I remember most vividly is that when I was young there was lots and lots of cactus. Fields of it, acres of it.\" Edwin Stanton on neighboring Santa Cruz Island, an avid student of agricultural science, used cochineal insects to rid his island of native prickly pear cactus. The cochineal insects appear as small, silvery white mounds on the cactus pads. These insects weaken and eventually kill the cactus by sucking sap from the plant. Both Mrs. Woolley and Al Vail speculated that Stanton's \"bugs\" migrated to Santa Rosa Island and eliminated most of the cacti. Mrs. Woolley noted that \"it just died by the acre.\"<br /> <br /> The Chumash harvested the sweet prickly pear fruit and used its beet-red juice as a paint and dye. The long, sharp cactus thorns were used for decorative ear piercing and tattooing. Vertical and transverse lines were commonly tattooed on the cheeks and chin, although tattoo designs were applied also to the forehead, arms, and other parts of the body. To create a dark blue tattoo, the skin was pricked with a cactus thorn and the punctures rubbed with charcoal. When the wounds healed the pigment was sealed under the skin.</p> <h3>Dudleya (Live-forever)</h3> <p>Perhaps no plant is more versatile in adapting to different habitats than dudleya. These low-growing, fleshy succulents with a waxy coating commonly grow on dry, rocky outcroppings like the walls of Water Canyon.<br /> <br /> However, they also can be found on stabilized sand dunes, grasslands, and scrub habitats in conditions varying from full sun to shade. This adaptability is reflected in the variety of dudleyas found on the Channel Islands, including four species on Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> On these canyon walls one can find candleholder and Greene's dudleya. These Channel Island endemics also occur on San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands. The other dudleya species, Santa Rosa Island live-forever and munchkin dudleya, occur just on<br /> Santa Rosa Island and they grow only on the island's eastern tip. See page 58 for more information about these unique dudleyas.</p> <h3>Wild Cucumber</h3> <p>Another plant that evolved to deal with the dry conditions of southern California (average rainfall on Santa Rosa is approximately 19 inches) is the vine-like wild cucumber that often can be seen along the hillsides in the oak understory. This plant has an immense, poisonous, fleshy root, or underground tuber, that stores water and nutrients.<br /> <br /> Wild cucumber is one of the very first flowers to bloom from January to June. The plant sprawls over trees, shrubs, and the ground, leaving a tangle of dried stems and leaves by midsummer. In spring however, the wild cucumber forms large, egg-shaped, bright green fruits covered with big soft green prickles that turn hard and spiny as the fruits dry.<br /> <br /> Inside are large seeds. The Chumash made necklaces of these seeds, polishing them along their oiled bodies. They were used also as marbles by Chumash children.</p> <h3>Other Native Plant Species</h3> <p>Other plants to look for include giant coreopsis, scouring rush, coastal goldenbush, indian pink, Santa Cruz Island buckwheat, island red buckwheat, and California poppy.</p>",

A creek flows down from the canyon, ending in a long, narrow lagoon with olive green colored water, that stretches out toward the sandy shoreline. Lining the sides of the lagoon are tall cattails, with upright stalks and narrow green leaves, and, in season, brown cylindrical spikes, shaped like broom handles. <br /><br />On its approach down into the canyon and the lagoon, the road cuts though the surrounding hillsides, exposing alternating horizontal layers of rocks and sandy soils. Clinging to these rocky surfaces are dudleya, a low-growing, fleshy succulent with a waxy coating, and yellow flowers on a tall thin stalk, in season. <br /><br />The rest of the hillsides are covered in grasses and scrubby brush made up of a variety of plants: Sagebrush, with a thin stalk, with feathery leaves, like dill, and a tall spike at the tip, covered with tiny flowers in spring.

In 1882 he was living in Illinois and sent two of his sons to scout out homesteading opportunities in Sully County, South Dakota. They returned with a favorable report. Seven members of the Blair family moved to Sully County and filed homestead claims.The Blair family was followed by other black homesteaders.<br /> <br /> The Blairs were already educated when they arrived. They helped found and operate the local schools. In 1896, Benjamin Blair became the first black person in South Dakota to sit on a school board. He later served as chairman. The Blairs were successful land agents and entrepreneurs and wanted their children to be educated.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Blairs were serial entrepreneurs. They turned their land into successful farming operations. Daughters Betty and Winnie Blair ran a restaurant and bakery. Sons Benjamin and Patrick operated a livery. In 1906 Benjamin Blair and others formed the Northwestern Homestead Movement. They hoped to recruit other African American settlers to South Dakota.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The McGruders were another prominent family in the community. John and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ellen-mcgruder.htm\">Ellen McGruder</a> migrated from Missouri. They purchased 1,200 acres through land agent Betty Blair. After John died, Ellen McGruder and sons George and James also homesteaded in the area. They established successful farm operations, including raising sheep and cattle.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The McGruders were also deeply committed to educating their children. Cecil Roosevelt McGruder attended school through the eighth grade. His nine children attended the Fairbank School through the eighth grade. They went to live with families in Pierre for high school and helped with housework and childcare. Several of Cecil’s children attended college at the Northern State Teacher’s College in Aberdeen.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> As of 2019 several McGruders still lived and owned original homesteaded land in the area. They are all that remain of the black homesteader community.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Sully County black homesteader community remains a powerful reminder of generations of African Americans who sought opportunity in the Great Plains to pursue their dreams of land ownership, education, and civil equality.<br /> <br /> Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/home/black-homesteading-in-america.htm\">Black Homesteading in America</a>.",

Along the Santa Fe Trail, two sides fought for their own gains and their own causes. The American Civil War played out here along the Santa Fe Trail over three days in what is called the Battle of Glorieta Pass.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{277e8cf8-f858-41c0-aabc-38ebbe1ad82a}{163}\" paraid=\"305113791\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis approved Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley’s plan to raise a force of Texans to invade New Mexico Territory. His objectives were to capture military supplies from Union forts in New Mexico and to recruit New Mexicans, Utah Mormons, and Colorado miners to the Confederate cause. The mineral wealth of the West would enrich the Confederacy and, if the ports of California could be taken, the South would have blockade-free international trade. Jefferson Davis's decision instead set forth a chain of events that would make the Battle of Glorieta Pass the \"Gettysburg of the West.\"  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{277e8cf8-f858-41c0-aabc-38ebbe1ad82a}{187}\" paraid=\"573423675\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">If you would like to learn about the Civil War in New Mexico, hike the Battlefield Trail or attend a ranger-led tour.

            "bodyText": "<h4>Enlisted Barracks</h4> <p>The two barracks buildings, completed in 1867, were designed to hold two companies each of enlisted men. They were divided in half and each side had a squad room, first sergeant's room, mess hall and kitchen. The average company size was 80 men so quarters were definitely cramped. Four men slept on each bunk, two on each level lying head to foot. The first sergeant, the company's senior enlisted man, got a room to himself. <br /> <br /> There was no central mess hall on post for the soldiers. Soldiers ate with other men of their company in the barracks mess hall. The army didn't have trained cooks so the job rotated among the men in the company as an extra duty. This meant the quality of the food prepartion depended on how well each man could cook. <br /> <br /> In this building, the left (west) side has been restored as infantry barracks, the right (east) side as the post hospital. The east side had originally been for a cavalry company but when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/10th-cavalry-at-fort-larned.htm\">10th Cavalry</a> left in 1869 it was converted into a new Post Hospital in 1872.   </p> <h4>Hospital </h4> <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fort-larned-post-hospital.htm\">post hospital</a> in the east half of the barracks building was a big improvement over the former adobe hospital building that leaked mud from the ceiling when it rained. Even with a solid roof overhead, medical care was crude by today's standards, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Army doctors were some of the best trained and qualified doctors in the country but they were still limited by the medical knowledge of the day. There were few medicines at the time to cure people and doctors had very little understanding of how diseases spread. Still, the doctors stationed at Fort Larned did the best they could to heal the soldiers under their care.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Enlisted Barracks and Post Hospital 649 words The Enlisted Barracks and the Post Hospital are in the second of the two barracks building on the north side of the Parade Ground. It is a one-story sandstone block building facing the Parade Ground. The building is 172 feet long with an 11 foot deep wood porch running the length of the building. The porch roof is an extension of the building roof and is supported by 18 white square wood columns, nine feet apart. The building has a gable roof covered with brown wood shingles. There are five brick chimneys and two white square wooden cupolas covering ventilation shafts across the ridge line at the top of the roof. From left to right are three chimneys, a ventilation cupola, a chimney, a ventilation cupola, and a chimney. The chimneys are between 30 and 40 feet apart across the top of the roof. The first ventilation cupola is between the third and fourth chimney, the second one is between the fourth and fifth chimney. The first and last chimney are two feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has 10 windows and three doors with both the window frames and the doors painted white. From the left as you face the building are: three windows, a double doorway, four windows, a double doorway, two windows, a single doorway, and one window. The windows are five feet tall by three feet wide. The double doorways are eight and a half feet tall by four and a half feet wide and are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The doors are six and a half feet tall by four feet wide. There is a row of five glass panes, one foot high by eight inches wide, above both sets of double doors. The glass panes are recessed one foot from the front of the doorway. The single doorway is eight and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide and is recessed one foot from the front of the building. The door is six and a half feet tall by three feet wide. There is a row of two glass panes, one foot tall by eight inches wide above the door. The glass panes are recessed one foot from the front of the doorway. The windows and doors are spaced eight to ten feet apart across the front of the building with the first and last windows six feet from their respective ends of the building. The porch is six inches above the ground. Wheelchairs can access the porch from the west end where an eleven foot wide, 16 foot long brown asphalt path, parallel to the main Parade Ground path, connects the porches of the two barracks buildings. The path slopes down gently to ground level from the east end of the Visitor Center porch, then gently back up to the west end of the Barracks/Hospital porch. The porch is level with the doorway, allowing for wheelchair access into the building. The two double doorways are open, the single doorway is closed and is not used as a public entrance. The first doorway on the left leads into the restored barracks area of the building, which is furnished to represent the enlisted men's quarters in an Indian Wars-era frontier fort. It has a squad room, first sergeant's room, mess hall and kitchen. The squad room, first sergeant's room and kitchen are not accessible to the public and are blocked by plexiglass barriers. The next doorway, near the center of the building, leads into the restored hospital area of the building, which is furnished to represent the fort's hospital. There are a surgeon's office and operating room, storage area and attendant's sleeping quarters, two hospital wards, and a kitchen and mess hall. Only the two hospital wards are accessible to the public, the other rooms are blocked by plexiglass barriers. End of description.",

Instead, they built blockhouses, which provided a defensive structure in case of Indian attack.<br /> <br /> Fort Larned's blockhouse was built in the of winter 1864-65 to strengthen the fort's defenses after a Kiowa raid in June of 1864. The Kiowas were able to steal 172 of the fort's horses and mules. This hexagonal stone building contained a powder magazine, two levels of rifle slits or loopholes, an underground passageway, and well. However, it was not needed for defense, so in 1867 it was converted into a guardhouse and served as the post jail.<br /> <br /> The original structure was dismantled around 1900 by civilian owners who used its sandstone blocks to build other structures and to shore up the wooden porches on officers' row. When the building was rebuilt in in 1986, at least 200 of the original stones were used in the reconstruction.<br />  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Blockhouse 433 words The Blockhouse is located outside the northeast corner of the Parade Ground at the end of a seven foot wide, 94 foot long pathway extending out from the path on the south side of the parade ground. Approximately 50 feet before the building, the path curves slightly to the right, ending at the doorway. The Blockhouse is a one-story, six-sided sandstone block building. Each side of the building is 21 feet long. It has no windows, just a double row of loopholes, or rifle slits, on all six sides. The first row of loopholes is three and a half feet from the ground, the second row of loopholes is six feet above the first row. The loopholes are seven inches tall by five inches wide on the outside, and one foot tall by 10 inches wide on the inside. They are 18 inches long from the outside of the wall to the inside. The building has a low-sloping conical roof covered with wood shingles. There is a seven foot tall wooden sentry box, painted white, extending up from the center of the roof. Each side of the sentry box is approximately 5 feet. The building has one double doorway, five feet wide by six and a half feet tall located in the center of the wall facing the path. The doors are painted white and are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The doorway is level with the ground and is wheelchair accessible. The building has a dirt floor that slopes down slightly towards the middle where a wood support pole, three and a half feet in circumference extends from the floor to the roof. The building was originally constructed for defensive purposes but was later used as the post's guardhouse and jail. The inside of the building has been restored to reflect both of those uses. There is a wooden platform extending three feet out from the wall seven and a half feet from the floor to allow soldiers access to top row of loopholes. The platform extends from the left side of the doorway all the way around the interior wall to the right side of the doorway. It's supported by four and a half foot long two-by-fours angling out from the wall about three and a half feet below the platform and up to its outer edge. The support boards are spaced approximately seven and a half feet apart all the way around. There are also two reproduction iron ball and chains lying on the floor to reflect the building's eventual use as the post jail. End of description.",

            "bodyText": "<p>This overlook is one mile from the visitor and provides a much needed resting spot as you climb to the island highest point, 635-foot Signal Peak. It also allows for excellent views of Webster Point.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 5: Signal Peak Tour-Geographical Isolation</b><br /> As you follow the ridgeline between the island's two highest points, 635-foot Signal Peak and 562-foot North Peak, take a moment to look across the island. You may notice the broad, elevated coastal plain stretching in front of you, one of six on the island. These plains are remnants of what geologists call \"marine terraces\"-ancient shorelines carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created today by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in the folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today-Santa Barbara Island, as well as the other Channel Islands, continues to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, the Channel Islands have been separated from the mainland. And unlike the four northern islands, which were once joined as a single, \"super island\" known as Santarosae, Santa Barbara Island has never been connected to another neighboring island.<br /> <br /> For decades, however, scientists assumed that the northern islands (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands) were connected to the mainland by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Santarosae</strong></b><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a gently sloping ridge, about halfway up Signal Peak, a rounded hill. In clear weather, there are views of Webster Point down the slope to the northwest, and of the ocean on either side of that point. Webster Point is a rocky peninsula of land that sticks out into the ocean like a large paw with pointed claws. The claw closest to us curls toward us, creating a tiny, sheltered cove. Just inland from that cove, a deep canyon cuts into the plateau at the shoreline. As the shoreline curves south toward us, the rocky slopes rise up into tall, steep, rocky cliffs.<br /><br />Near us is an eight-foot wide wooden bench, on two posts, facing Webster Point. Be careful if you decide to sit on it as it is covered with white seagull droppings. On the ground, a few feet in front of it, is a railroad tie-a thick wooden beam about 8 inches by 10 inches by 6 feet in length.<br /><br />The land around you is mostly bare soil, with patches of grass, and an occasional clump of scrub brush, only a few inches high. The soil has tiny fragments of broken shells and white rocks. There is a darker blanket of vegetation downslope, closer to Webster Point.",

Kayaking east towards Scorpion Rock or west towards Cavern Point provides great wildlife viewing and sea caves. Kayaking from Prisoners Harbor is also very scenic. <br /> <br /> For the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area on Santa Cruz Island visit: [Channel Islands Adventure Company](http://www.sbadventureco.com/adventures/channel-islands/#Sea-Cave-Kayaking). For kayak guide and outfitting services in other areas of Santa Cruz Island (excluding Scorpion area), visit the [Visitor Services List](https://www.nps.gov/chis/parkmgmt/visitor-services-list.htm).<br /> <br /> Several locations on Santa Cruz Island offer good surfing. Generally, the north shore is best during the northwest swells of winter/spring and the south shore is best during the south swells of summer/fall. However, all surf spots are remote and are best accessed by private boat due to the island's rugged terrain and the hiking distance from the designated landing areas.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>While fire is key to the health of this forest, it presents challenges. Fires that are too big and hot may kill some sequoias, even the occasional monarch. Fires that are too small don't clear the ground sufficiently or open the forest to more sunlight. Fire puts smoke into the air, and leaves blackened terrain that some find unattractive. You can learn more by visiting a burned area a year or two after a fire, and see what kind of changes have taken place.<br /> <br /> This exhibit, titled \"A Natural Process,\" shows how fire plays a part of sequoia growth.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The View: About 20 feet in front of you is a large sequoia tree. The center of its base has been hollowed by fire, leaving little wood to support the tree. A charred tree stump is next to it. A photo of a fire burning near the base of a sequoia tree. The text reads, A Natural Process Frequent natural fires shape this ecosystem. Fires have touched every mature sequoia many times. Thick insulating bark protects mature sequoias from all but the hottest flames. The Tennessee Tree before you has burned more dramatically than many, yet it still survives. How? Sequoia wood is high in tannin, a chemical that helps exposed wood to resist rot and insects. Where bark remains, nutrients can still flow. Look up to see how much of this tough tree lives on. A photo shows the ground next to a sequoia tree trunk. It is thickly covered with pine needles and small branches. The text reads, Sequoias depend on fire. Fire clears leaf litter away and opens the cones, allowing seeds to reach the bare mineral soil they need to grow. A photo shows a bright green young seedling sprouting up from darkened soil with patches of white ash. The text reads, Wildfires create open spaces where sunlight can reach the forest floor. Young trees in these clearings get abundant sunlight, water, and nutrients. On the right side of this exhibit is a photo of a sequoia tree trunk, engulfed in flames. Smoke billows around the tree. The text reads, Fire eventually conquered the tree to the right, leaving only a stump. Before it died, however, the tree left its legacy: thousands of seedlings that sprouted after earlier fires. Some of the trees around you may be its offspring.",

The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern edge of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Boston Run Trailhead. Boston Run is a one of many headwater streams that flow into the Cuyahoga River. It winds in and out of view as you travel the serene ravines and ridges of this trail loop.

Along the path is a wooden bench to relax on.<br /><br />A photo of gentle rolling hills, densely covered with dark green trees and shrubs. <br /> <br />The text reads,<br /><br /> All life in the Sierran foothills around you depends on communities of native plants. Adapted to the local climate, these tough plants form the basis of this entire ecosystem. <br /><br />They survive due to fascinating adaptations that help them to live through the hot, dry summers here. As a result, they can provide year-round food and shelter to the animals of the foothills. <br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />Growing native plants <br /><br />Wherever you live, a community of native plants evolved to fit your climate. These plants require little irrigation, pest control, or overall care. What plants are truly native to your soil? <br /><br />A photo shows thin green branches with clusters of hand-shaped leaves.

The caption reads,<br /> <br />Deergrass gathers water effectively with its far-reaching root system. <br /><br />A photo shows a bush with small clustered leaves, and tall upright spikes of flower clusters made up of tiny light blue flowers that circle up the flower stems. The caption reads,<br /><br />Silver bush lupine's pale leaves deflect some of the sun's strong rays. <br /><br />A photo of a branch with flat paddle shaped leaves, with bunches of small pink bell-shaped flowers dangling below. The caption reads,<br /><br />Manzanita leaves stand up, rather than lay flat, to limit exposure to sun. <br /><br />A photo shows a branch covered with clusters of tiny short, needle like leaves. The caption reads,<br /><br />Tiny chamise leaves lose less water through evaporation to the dry air. <br /><br />A photo shows several plants, each with a rounded cluster of green spiky leaves at its base and a single 8 to 10-foot-tall flower spike. Many small white flowers cluster around the top of this spike, combining into the shape of a giant, thin football.

The lower foothills are a lighter olive green with short vegetation. Often there is a haze over the valley to the right. To your left, above the mountain peaks it's clearer.<br /><br />The background image on the exhibit is a long-exposure photo from the walkway at the top of Moro Rock. The rock is silhouetted in black as the handrails reflect the last sunlight. The mountains beyond take on a textured gray against the last glow of sunset behind them, the upper sky is dark. The stars appear as hundreds of white curved lines streaking across the dark sky. <br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Daytime views from here reach miles into the wilderness. At night, you can see even farther. In the dark, our universe reveals itself in uncountable stars.<br /><br />Why protect dark skies? For nocturnal animals, who need darkness to live. For diurnal wildlife, who seek safety in the night. For knowledge gained from telescopes that require darkness to probe the cosmos. And for you to enjoy the fascination, beauty, and inspiration of the heavens.<br /><br />Dark skies grow rarer as artificial light spills across the landscape from afar, as shown by the late night long exposure above. Today's improved lighting, however, can help. Fixtures that focus light downward, rather than up and out, save energy and restore darkness, even miles away.<br /><br />An image shows a rainbow spectrum of colors depicting a view toward the west. Five cities are identified across the bottom. Each city creates a warm color, that morphs into a cooler color in the higher atmosphere. The cities from left to right: <br /><br />Los Angeles, 169 miles, 272 km. Red<br /><br />Bakersfield, 83 miles, 133 km. Orange <br /><br />Porterville, 36 miles, 58 km. Orange <br /><br />Visalia, 34 miles, 55 km. Red<br /><br />Fresno, 60 miles, 96 km. Purple<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />This filtered image of the late-night view to the west from Moro Rock shows sources of artificial light.

Shapes in the left rectangle show early growth in life-sized scale. The text reads,<br /><br />Sequoias Take Shape<br /><br />You can't miss mature sequoias, given their immense size and cinnamon-colored bark. Like children, young sequoias represent the future of this forest community yet they often go unnoticed. Can you spot them? <br /><br />On the left side of this rectangle, you can feel a raised oval, which is the outline of a sequoia cone, with about 20 tiny seeds below it. <br /><br />The text reads, <br /><br />Each cone holds about 200 seeds the size of oat flakes. They must land on bare soil to grow. <br /><br />To the right of the cone is a seedling a few weeks old. If you feel the round top, it shows that the seed coat is still attached to the plant. The text reads,<br /><br />The first leaves out of the seed are long and soft. Short, prickly needles grow the next year.<br /><br />To the right of the seedling is a taller sapling, with short needles.<br /><br />Moving right to the second indented rectangle, you will find the shape of more mature sequoias, shown at about one 200th of actual size. <br /><br />On the left side is a spire-shaped young tree, filled with branches from top to bottom. The text reads, <br /><br />Given plenty of water, these \"teenagers\" grow quickly upward. Pointy and cone-shaped, they have a grayish bark.<br /><br />On the right side of this rectangle is an outline of a mature sequoia tree with a thick, bare, lower trunk, and short stubby branches near the top. The text reads, <br /><br />As sequoias age, lower branches drop off and bark thickens. Their crowns of foliage grow rounded and irregular.<br /><br />The Braille information provided on this exhibit has already been explained in this Audio Description.",

The women are wearing knee length dresses, jackets, and rounded hats. The men wear trousers and buttoned shirts. Some have ties and brimmed hats. A ranger stands above the group, wearing a hat with a stiff brim, a white shirt and tie under a five-pocket buttoned jacket, and jodhpurs. He is pointing forward and upward. Many tourists are looking in that same direction. The caption reads,<br /><br />Park ranger Frank Been leads a group at Moro Rock in 1930. Been was hired a year earlier as the park's first fulltime paid ranger naturalist.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Moro Rock is one of the places in Sequoia National Park where, in 1922, naturalists began \"translating\" the landscape for early park visitors. Naturalists offered walks, talks, and campfire programs, which combined information with inspiration, and visitors loved it. <br /><br />For many people, parks are beautiful but mysterious. What shaped the land? Why does something grow here and not there? The tradition of naturalists helping visitors to combine fascination with knowledge continues today, kindling a commitment to parks in untold numbers of people. <br /><br />A quote by Colonel J. R. White, Park Superintendent, 1926: <br /><br />\"The expansion of museum, nature walks and campfire lectures is the surest protection against degeneracy into jazzy amusements\"<br /><br />A black and white photo of an older man. He is wearing a stiff, wide brimmed felt hat. The hat has a medium sized, cylindrical crown with a dimpled rounded peak. A wide band with an emblem encircles its crown and a leather strap is tucked under his chin. He wears a white shirt and tie under a jacket with curved lapels, covered buttons, and two large buttoned pockets across the chest. He gazes downward, peering at the ferns surrounding him. The caption reads,<br /><br />Walter Fry<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Sequoia's First Naturalist <br /><br />As a young man, Walter Fry came to the Sierra Nevada to log. After counting more than 3,000 rings on a cut sequoia, he turned instead to protecting the trees. Fry eventually became the first civilian superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.<br /><br />Later, in 1920, Stephen Mather, (first director of the National Park Service) concluded that every park needed naturalists. Two years later the Sequoia Nature Guide Service was born when Superintendent John White called on his predecessor, Walter Fry, to volunteer. Working part time, Fry thus became Sequoia National Park's first naturalist.",

On most days, the sky is smoggy, with a murky brownish layer of air that hangs over that valley. <br /><br />A photo of a sunset view from this wayside exhibit. The face of Moro Rock is visible on the left, an orange haze with purplish mountains in the distance. The text reads,<br />What's in the air?<br /><br />A century ago, forest - fire smoke often clouded summer views from here. Today, particulate pollution--tiny bits of dust and chemicals-more commonly blurs this scene. What's changed? People now limit the spread of most fires. However, many more vehicles, industries, and agricultural processes are producing particulates.<br /><br />But not all pollution can be seen. Formed from vehicle exhaust and common volatile fumes, ozone by itself leaves views clear. Yet it damages plants and animals, especially along air drainages. The good news: despite population growth, ozone has not increased much. Our efforts can make a difference.<br /><br />A map of the wind pattern over the California coast and the San Joaquin Valley. The wind stream enters from the Pacific Ocean at the San Francisco Bay area, then divides into northern and southern streams, with a long curl that moves circles into Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. The text reads,<br /><br />Take a deep breath. It's not just mountain air you're breathing; it's an exotic mix. It flows here from Asia as well as from the Bay area. It brings pollution from afar, but even more from nearby. Mountains around the San Joaquin Valley trap the air, until warm winds lift the pollutants into the parks.",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road. On the west side of the road is a white building, vinyl shingle siding, dark green trim and a gabled, or simple peaked, green roof. The building is raised one or two feet off the ground, supported on concrete blocks. The front of the building faces north. There are four fixed or casement windows, each with a single panel with 12 glass panes, divided by thin wooden mullions. Between the third and fourth window is a narrow white door, with remnants of a white wooden landing with steps down to the ground. The planks of the landing are broken and sagging. A thick bush with dark green, oval-shaped leaves is growing at the corner closest to the road. The road side of the building has a triangular slatted vent opening just below the eaves of the roof. There is also a narrow door, about two feet above ground level. Below it are two blocks of cement with a deteriorating wooden plank laid across them, creating a \"step\". To the left of the step, leaning against the building, is a two foot tall, L-shaped metal post. At one end, like a fan, are three metal bars that connected to a flat rectangular metal panel that reads,<br /><br />Bowjon<br /><br />The south and west sides of the building have no windows, door, or other features. <br /><br />In the distance are views of the ranch house and the red barn of the ranch complex.<br />",

Forrest's cavalry, launched an attack on the Union line held by Brigadier General John A. McClernand near this location. This road was known at that time as Forge Road because it led to Randolph Forge.<br /> <br /> Soldiers with both the 26th Mississippi and 26th Tennessee infantries, later joined by other regiments, were successful in pushing General McClernand's Division from its position. Soldiers with the 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 18th, 20th, 30th, and 41st Illinois Infantries fought valiantly to hold their positions, before they were exhausted and scattered, needing ammunition to continue the fight. <br /> <br /> For a brief time, Forge Road was open, which would have allowed a way of escape for Confederates.  By nightfall, after more than six hours of continuous battle, the Confederates were ordered to return to their original positions. The way of escape was now closed, as Union forces moved to reoccupy the area once more.<br /> <br /> The Texas Monument was placed in this location in 1963 to honor of the Texas troops who fought at Fort Donelson.  ",

The Great Temple Mound is where the village chief would have lived, and was built in four separate stages with clay steps going up the northern slope. It’s estimated that 10 million baskets of dirt, weighing about 60 pounds each, were used to build the 55-feet-tall mound! Today, there are steps that allow visitors to climb to the top of both mounds for a spectacular view of the surrounding area.",

Continue west through the parking lot, which will turn into a walkway bridge of about ninety feet over Rock Creek. Follow the path about eighty feet, at which point it will turn left. The Potomac River now will be on the right. Continue south and travel two hundred feet, past a cement landing at Thompson Boat Center on the left. Proceed through this area onto a gravel patch and continue another fifty feet. At this point the Potomac River edge will be approaching. Turn left and proceed fifty feet along a two-foot wide gravel path. The wayside will be on your right.<br />The wayside faces south and is set among the ruins of an old canal lock. A wooden pedestrian bridge is ten feet to the left, and a twenty-foot patch of overgrown grass sits between the sign and the lock ruins.<br />The three by four-foot sign is a faded light brown.

Here canal boats entered the canal to bypass mountains, swift currents, and shallows. Boats exited Tide Lock into the Potomac River to proceed to downstream ports to off-load cargo.<br />A 200-foot dam (right side of photo below) crossed the mouth of Rock Creek, creating a basin where canal boats docked and off-loaded cargo.<br />A photograph covers the entire sign, showing a landscape of a bridge and a structure of wood beams carrying over a creek lined by stone walls. Two men stand with a horse on the left in the foreground. A small white building with one window sits at the end of the bridge, and other buildings can be see lining the background. The creek opens up to a river on the right.<br />A one by three-inch white map shows the Potomac River curling around the southern tip of Washington, DC. <br />Text to the left reads:<br />\"Boats from Tide Lock could enter the Potomac River and go downstream to the Washington Branch Canal, where present-day Constitution Avenue is located. A lockhouse building still standing at 17th Street and Constitution Avenue is the only remaining evidence of this branch canal.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Located on the Potomac River, it was a logical choice for the canal's terminus. Canal activity further spurred Georgetown's economic growth. By the late 1800s, it was a bustling industrial port, with loads of cargo transferring between ocean-going ships, smaller boats, and wagons. On the canal, mule-drawn coal boats sidled up alongside Georgetown's warehouses to unload their freight. After their week-long journey down the 184.5 mile canal, canal families looked forward to the sights and sounds of Georgetown.<br /> Construction of the canal began in 1828. Thousands of men, primarily immigrants, performed the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging and blasting through soil and rock. The skilled laborers, including stonemasons, carpenters, and blacksmiths created the dams, locks, culverts, aqueducts, and the Paw Paw Tunnel. Though each section of the canal started operating as it was completed, the entire route between Cumberland and Georgetown officially opened on October 10, 1850. After years of decreasing profits and devastating floods, operation of the canal ceased in 1924. <h3>Canal Boat Tour - (MAY BE OPERATIONAL IN 2021)</h3> <br /> <br /> The canal boat tour takes about an hour. On the tour, you will travel through a lock and learn more about the canal, its history, and the people who made a living delivering cargo between Cumberland and Georgetown. <p> </p>",
            "audioDescription": "(1224 words)The Georgetown ranger contact station is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, at the northeast intersection of Thomas Jefferson Street, NW and the C&O Canal.The location is a two-story end unit row house, set at the northwest corner of Lock 3 of the C&O Canal. The red-brick building's front door is located on Thomas Jefferson Street. Four brick steps lead up to the white painted front door. An alcove with three windows is on the right, and three windows line the second floor.The visitor entrance is located on the southern, canal side. Two swinging glass windows are above on the first floor, and a single window sits on the top level. Four other windows and a door with an iron gate are set along the south side. A two by four-foot brown sign sits on the south, canal side that reads: \"Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park.\" The visitor entrance is set in a ten square foot alcove area lined with a two-foot high wood ledge bench. To the right of the door is a glass sign featuring Georgetown Visitor Center information. Along the northern side of this area are three white signs, about six feet tall set from ground level.The left sign features on its top third a brown and white picture of an industrial waterfront. Smokestacks and iron riggings are visible from across a wide river.The bottom of the sign features a timeline which spans all three signs. This portion covers 1825 to 1865. Noted at the top is \"1828 Ground Broken for Canal\" and \"1861-65 Civil War.\"The below are three photographs. The left picture, beneath the year 1825, shows men with horses on a wide and barren dirt landscape. Text above them reads:The canal was initially envisioned by its supported as a trade route between east and west. However, by the time the canal reached Cumberland, plans to extend it to the Ohio River at Pittsburgh had been abandoned for financial reasons.The middle picture, beneath the year 1850, shows a horse drawn carriage next to a railroad track in a dirt trench along a river above. A white house sits at the river's edge and smoke billows from machinery along the riverbank to the left. Text above reads.The canal was most active and profitable between 1865 and 1900. Over five hundred boats carried nearly one million tons of cargo annually between Cumberland and Georgetown. More than 90% of the boats arrived in Georgetown filled with coal.The final picture of the right shows an image of a canal crowded with nine canal boats sitting in the water. Text above them reads:The canal stretched 184.5 miles between Georgetown and Cumberland. Rising 605 feet in elevation along the journey, the canal averaged 60 feet across, six feet deep, and included seven dams, 11 aqueducts, and 74 lift locks.The middle sign is titled at the top:The Canal through GeorgetownBelow is map showing the canal as it passes from Rock Creek on the right, across the sign to the Aqueduct and Key Bridge on the left. The map shows locks one through four on the right side, and an arrow indicates your location between locks three and four. A dark blue line indicates the canal, and a brown line laid next to it shows the towpath.The bottom third of the sign is a continuation of a timeline that runs through all three signs. Represented here are:1890 B&O Railroad Takes Over Canal1914-18 World War 11924 Floods Close CanalThree black and white pictures line the bottom of the sign. Furthest left, below the year 1875, is an image of a canal, full of water and lined with four story brick row houses and buildings. A building with two tall smokestacks sits along the canal's right side. Text above reads:Georgetown grew to accommodate the canal's business. New wharves supported the distribution of coal, stone, and timber. Flour, paper, and cotton milling became successful industries in the town, using the canal as a new source of water power.The middle picture, under the year 1900, shows a canal scene crowded with canal boats lined up in the water. A man sits on the boat in the left foreground, and two girls stand along the towpath on the right. Text above reads:The Georgetown section of the canal includes four locks. As boats approached Georgetown and lined up to unload cargo, they created traffic jams on the canal. Boat crews sometimes waited days to unload before they could begin the return trip.The right-side picture, under the year 1925, shows a man in overalls and boots turned and facing away as he stands atop a boat in a canal. A boy and girl are at his sides, also facing away. He holds their hands as they float down the canal. Text above reads:Canal families eagerly anticipated their arrival in Georgetown. After a week on the boat, traveling through rural country and small towns, parents would allow their children to go up the city's streets to buy candy, ice cream or see a movie.The right sign has along its top third a black and white image of a man in hat and suspenders walking along a canal towpath with three horses t",

The 22-mile section of the river from Georgetown to Seneca has four dangerous areas that are unsafe for any type of water related recreation including boating, canoeing, fishbone, swimming, wading or rock hopping. Do not enter the water. This warning applies to the river areas around the Washington Aqueduct Dam, Great Falls, Little Falls Dam, and Little Falls Rapids. Serious and often fatal accidents occur at these locations every year.<br />A map to the right identifies areas too dangerous to enter the river and to avoid. These are Washington Aqueduct Dam, Great Falls, Little Falls Dam, and Little Falls Rapids:<br />Washington Aqueduct Dam:<br />A water supply dam for Washington, D.C. located just above the Great Falls. If this hazardous dam doesn't stop you, the falls just below it will! The Great Falls, MD parking lot is the last take-out before the dam.<br />Great Falls:<br />Where the Potomac River drops 40 feet over a steep jagged rock wall and into a narrow gorge. The falls are impassible. Use the C&O Canal to bypass the dam. You can reenter the river at Rocky Cove below the falls.<br />Little Falls of the Potomac<br />Located just upstream from Chain Bridge, this narrow chute of extremely powerful currents is hazardous. Many boaters and fishermen have drowned here. Take your boat out along the canal in the immediate vicinity of Sycamore Island. You can reenter the river at Fletchers Boat House.<br />Little Falls Dam:<br />Located four miles downstream from Cabin John Bridge, this innocent-looking small vertical drop is deadly. The river flowing over the dam is recycled back toward the dam wall rather than downstream. Trapping any object including people in the backwash. Many who end up in this vicious backwash drown.

            "bodyText": "Situated on the southern corner of the Green, atop a hill overlooking the city of Springfield, sits the Junior Officers Quarters (Buildings 5 and 6).<br /> <br /> Superintendent J.G. Benton submitted a request for funds for the Junior Officers Quarters in 1867, which was denied. Two years later in March of 1869, he submitted new plans and estimates which were approved. The plans this time, included the duplex design incase as Benton stated, if there was ever a need for another officer at the Armory, along with a new location on the old fire engine site (old guard house) on the southern corner of the Green. The estimated cost for the buildings was around $15,000. <br /> <br /> In 1869 the construction of the duplex began with the masonry structure completed in 1870. The Junior Officers Quarters was built in the Second Empire Style with many architectural elements that reflected the Victorian Period influence, a departure from the classical architecture that was used in many of the other Hill Shops. This departure gives the Junior Officers Quarters and the southern corner of the Green a distinctive look and feel. <br /> <br /> The duplex was built with utilities that were typical for the time which included gas lighting, plumbing, copper boilers to heat water, and hot-air furnaces! With multiple stories, modern utilities and elaborate interior design elements, the building provided much comfort to the officers and their families. Even with all the modernization, people were still traveling by horse! Along the road is an elevated brown stone step that allowed residents and visitors to easily jump onto their horse or step into their carriage. <br /> <br /> As new families moved in and there was new leadership at the Armory, the Junior Officers Quarters underwent many renovations that included enlarging the parlors, added windows, the addition of a one-story ell and a two-story addition to Quarters 5. By the close of the Armory, the quarters that were built identical were completely different reflecting the needs and desires of the various occupants. <br /> <br /> The Junior Officers Quarters were listed in the Massachusetts Most Endangered Historic Resources and in 2017 the building underwent major restoration including rebuilding portions of the foundation and historic chimneys as well as repointing the brickwork. <br /> <br /> In 1960, it was designated as a contributing building to the Springfield Armory National Historic Landmark and is registered in the National Historic Register of Historic Landmarks. With the close of the Armory in 1968, the building ownership was transferred to the State of Massachusetts to Springfield Technical Community College. Today while the building is not occupied, it still brings to remembrance the activity and families of the Armory.",

The double pitched roof is made of black and grey slate with four chimneys on the main building and one the rear extension. Around the porch, windows and roof there is intricate carved white scroll work.",

The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",

Each cannon is roughly 12 ft long and is mounted on a large metal base which raises it to about 15 ft high. The barrel of the cannon is 15 in in diameter. Both Canon and base are painted black. This rests on a half circle mounts made of stone and metal.",

You can access Kennecott from McCarthy - walk the road between McCarthy and Kennecott (an extra 4.5 miles), take the commercial shuttle, or ride a bike. This trail does NOT access the Erie Mine.<br /> <br /> Distance: 4 miles round-trip from Kennecott to the glacier or 8 miles round-trip to the Erie Mine tram cables.<br /> <br /> Time: 2-6 hours round-trip (hiking duration).<br /> <br /> Maps: USGS Maps, McCarthy 1:250,000, McCarthy (B-6), (C-6) 1:63,360<br /> <br /> Difficulty: Easy to Moderate. Terrain is relatively level with moderate elevation gain and loss.<br /> <br /> Highlights: Glacier viewing, mining artifacts, views of Mt. Blackburn, Regal Mountain, and Donaho Peak. Route: From the Kennecott Visitor Center, walk through the Kennecott Mill Town, north towards the Root Glacier. About a half-mile beyond the visitor center, the road will split. Stay straight. (The right hand trail leads to Jumbo and Bonanza Mines.) The trail will soon cross over Bonanza Creek and Jumbo Creek and then wind its way through the lateral moraines of the Kennicott and Root Glaciers. Approximately 1.5 miles after leaving Kennecott, the trail reaches the Root Glacier access trail. (Primitive campsites, along with an outhouse and food lockers, are available in this area.) To access the glacier, turn left at the sign and follow the trail as it winds down the moraine to the toe of the glacier. This trail crosses Amazon Creek, which is a seasonal stream. Depending on recent rainfall or spring melt, you may need to cross this stream.<br /> <br /> Hazards: The Root Glacier can be very slippery and dangerous. Crampons are strongly recommended. Avoid walking along the edge of Root Glacier as rotting ice and swift, cold water are potentially dangerous. Bears are present along the entire route. For maximum safety, travel in groups, be noisy when you are walking, and never give any food to a bear.<br /> <br /> Notes: If you are camping at the Jumbo Creek Camping Area or Donaho Basin, it is required that your food is stored in the bear-resistant food boxes or your own Bear Resistant Food Container (BRFC).",

The rapids mark the upstream end of the tidal Potomac. In the 1800's, a dam diverted water from the stream into the reservoirs that supplied the District Of Columbia with water. When the Washington Aqueduct was built, the dams were removed. Streams like the Little Falls Branch, flow under the canal through culverts. There are approximately 180 culverts along the 184.5 miles of canal.</p>",

The canal flows parallel to the towpath on its eastern side. To the west a creek flows away from the canal and towpath, through lush forest towards the Potomac River.<br />A dirt trail runs alongside the creek on its south side. About twenty feet down the trail, a tunnel is visible back to the east which allows the water to run under the towpath.

Travel north about four-tens of a mile on the towpath from the Chain Bridge overpass. A gravel path will be on the left. Just north along the left side of the towpath, will be two red and white signs.<br />The sign on the left is about three by three feet tall and written across a red border in white letters reads: \"Danger.\" Below on a white panel, with translations in Spanish and Vietnamese reads:<br />Extremely strong current/undertow<br />Stay off rocks at river's edge<br />No swimming or wading<br />The right sign reads in red letters, with Spanish translation below:<br />Trash Free Park<br />The gravel trail becomes a twenty-foot wide cement paved road after about ten feet and descends slightly into the forest. At about one hundred yards large jagged boulders begin to line the left side of the trail. Twenty feet further there is a ten-foot tall stone and rock wall that lines the right side as well. Low water, about one-inch deep flows slowly on the path to the west towards the Potomac River.<br />Continuing west, the tall forest trees lessen. The path stays in a straight line and becomes more open, though still lined by rock on both sides. Some trees and vegetation hang over the high rock sides. <br />After about two hundred yards into the path, it turns to the right and rises slightly up a five-foot ramp into a cement plaza area. The cement runs about one hundred feet north to south and eighty feet east to west. At the south west corner of the plaza are four cement steps with cement railings on both sides that lead to another platform area.<br />The twenty by forty-foot rectangular space is surrounded by a three-foot high, one-foot thick cement wall. It sits along the east edge of the Potomac River as water rushes by from right to left. A ten-foot buffer of rock and large boulders lines the area between the plaza and river.<br />Lush forest trees fill the western hillside across the river and three large mansions sit along the top. To the south about three hundred yards along the river the Chain Bridge spans east to west.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

            "audioDescription": "Pine Grove Trailhead. 247 words Here at the corner of the parking lot is a covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel. Three unpaved trails through the woods meet here. As you face the kiosk, the trails to the left and behind the kiosk both lead to the Ledges Trail, a 1.8-mile loop. On the right is the Pine Grove Trail, a 2.2-mile trail that provides a relatively flat walk through areas with planted pine trees along the edge of wooded ravines. The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern side of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place of retreat from urban life. Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Pine Grove Trailhead. Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. Managed by different agencies over the years, the park gave Akron and Cleveland more space for recreation and play. Most of the Virginia Kendall structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.” End of description.",

In late summer, meadow flowers attract butterflies and other pollinators.<br /> <br /> Pine Hollow provides access to the park’s interconnected trail system. The 3.3-mile Salt Run Trail starts to the left of the parking when facing the hills. The 4.5-mile Wetmore Trail is across Quick Road.

            "audioDescription": "Happy Days Historic Sign. 466 words This large sign sits at one end of a parking lot. As you face the sign, a paved path runs to the left and into a tunnel under the road, heading to Happy Days Lodge 200 yards away. To the left of the path is a grassy lawn with a picnic table. Behind you, at the far end of the parking lot, is a covered kiosk with trailhead information. This historic sign is 17 feet wide. The left end is a 6-foot-wide, 7-foot-high stone wall. The right side is a frame made of wooden beams mounted on a stone base, which holds a bulletin board and two graphic panels. Feel free to touch the irregular stonework. The middle panel on the sign is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern edge of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Happy Days Lodge. Happy Days Lodge is a legacy from the difficult years of the Great Depression. Civilian Conservation Corps workers built it as a summer camp for Akron children in 1938-1939. Today it continues to provide recreational opportunities. People can enjoy concerts, participate in programs, or rent the facility for special occasions. The panel at the right end of the sign is titled “Places to Go.” The background of the panel is filled with a photograph of a wide waterfall cascading down a layered rock face. The caption reads, “Brandywine Falls, with its spectacular 60-foot drop, is the park’s most popular destination. It is located northwest of Happy Days Lodge.” Along the bottom of the panel are five smaller photographs. From left to right they show the front of a locomotive from the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad which provides a relaxing way to tour the valley. Next, a woman bicycles on the Towpath Trail which follows the route of the Ohio and Erie Canal. Next is a three people looking over a railing at the lily pad-covered Beaver Marsh. Next is a picture of the white Canal Exploration Center with exhibits about how the Ohio & Erie Canal shaped the nation. The last photo shows a trail through moss-covered cliffs along the nearby Ledges Trail. Text on the panel recommends stopping by the Boston Mill Visitor Center at 6947 Riverview Road, just north of downtown Peninsula, for assistance in planning your visit. End of description.",

Along the right side of the kiosk a paved path leads through a grassy area towards a pier which extends out into the small lake. Opposite the pier is a stone building. Directly behind you as you face the kiosk is a wayside graphic panel titled, “Honest Work.” The parking lot stretches to your left and behind you. The parking lot is edged with stone posts, one-foot square and ranging in height from one to two feet. Past the left side of the kiosk, the pavement leads to an unpaved path that enters the woods.

Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place of retreat from urban life. Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. The Civilian Conservation Corps built Kendall Lake in 1934-35 for recreational use. For years, people flocked here for the swimming beach, toboggan run, and ice skating. Today’s visitors come to fish, rent snowshoes and cross-country skis, and enjoy nearby trails.” Text at the top of the wayside graphic reads, “The guard posts circling the parking lot are a result of the ‘honest work’ President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, would provide young unemployed Americans. Conceived under Roosevelt’s New Deal, the CCC put 250,000 young men to work rebuilding the country during the Great Depression. For the guard post project, corpsmen were taught how to quarry local Berea Sandstone and shape it into 3-foot by 1-foot by 1-foot posts. These posts were then ‘planted’ around most area parking lots. Over 1,000 guard posts were paced around the roads and parking lots of Virginia Kendall Park. The project achieved three major CCC goals: developing the nation’s park areas; teaching vocational skills; and providing work for young men.” At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of the young men at work installing the guard posts. Next to the photo is an engineer’s drawing showing that most of the 3-foot height of the posts was buried in the ground. End of description.",

On-going archaeological research supports the oral history that tells of thousands of years of use by different groups of people. <br /> <br /> When doing a flyover of Cape Krusenstern, visitors find the area easy to spot. As most of Cape Krusenstern is close to sea level, the towering cliff of Battle Rock stands out.<br /> <br /> This location often plays host to the National Monument's musk oxen in the summer months. The musk oxen tend to seek the higher ground to catch the sea breeze, giving them the opportunity to cool themeselves. It also allows them a brief escape from the thick mosquitoes and bugs that inhabit the tundra during summer months. <br />  ",

The cliff then rises, consisting of sharp drops and rough ground. On top of the cliff is a mostly bare space with tundra plants starting sporadically and then increasing in thickness, spreading out as the hill slopes slowly back into the tundra. During the summer months, the plants around Battle Rock gives the area a greener color. In the Fall, Winter, and Spring, the area is often covered in a blanket of ice and snow, blending it into the water surrounding it.",

It is about 0.75 miles to Bench Lake and another 0.5 miles to Snow Lake, for a total roundtrip distance of 2.5 miles with approximately 700 feet of elevation gain. “The Bench” is a relatively flat, shelf-like landform on the west side of Stevens Canyon created by a lava flow that erupted about 91,000 years ago. The first part of the trail climbs up to The Bench, through patches of subalpine meadow and huckleberry shrubs to a short spur trail to reach Bench Lake. Continue on the main trail, with sections of steeper log steps, to reach Snow Lake. Snow Lake is tucked into a cirque of the Tatoosh Range and fed by snowmelt. Snow Lake has backcountry camping sites and a restroom. A wilderness permit is required for overnight camping. The trail, especially around Snow Lake, can have patches of snow well into late June or even July.</p>",

It lies inside a caldera, or volcanic basin, created when the 12,000 foot (3,660 meter) high Mount Mazama collapsed 7,700 years ago following a large eruption.<br /> <br /> An average 67 inches of precipitation, rain and melted snow (annual average of 42 feet of snowfall (13 meters)) supply the lake with water. There are no inlets or outlets to the lake. The lake level fluctuates slightly from year to year while evaporation and seepage prevent the lake from becoming any deeper.</p> <h3>Deep Blue</h3> <p>Crater Lake's great depth, purity and clarity (avg 103 feet deep), and the way sun light interacts with water determines the lake's color. Water molecules absorb the longer wavelengths of reds, oranges, yellows, and greens while the shorter blue and purple wavelengths are more easily scattered.  The scattered blue light penetrates deeper into the clear water then is redirected back up to the surface where we can see it. Around the edges where the water is less deep, some of the unabsorbed green sunlight is reflected back up. The color of the lake can vary from day to day depending on wind, cloud cover, and the angle of the sun</p> <h3>Wizard Island Plus Three</h3> <p>Following the collapse of Mount Mazama, lava poured into the caldera even as the lake began to rise. Today, a small volcanic island, Wizard Island, appears on the west side of the lake. This cinder cone rises 767 feet (234 meters) above the lake. At its summit is a small crater, 300 feet (90 meters) across and 90 feet (27 meters) deep.<br /> <br /> Out of sight and underwater are three more volcanoes that grew while the lake was filling. The Rhyodacite Dome is the youngest of these and occurred about 5000 years ago. </p> <h3>Life in the Lake</h3> <p>Between 1888 and 1942, five species of fish were introduced into Crater Lake. About 60-thousand rainbow trout and kokanee salmon continue to thrive. Scientist have identified over 165 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, along with invertebrates that live throughout the lake. Amphibians, including the native Mazama newt, exist in shallow areas but are in danger due to the introduction crayfish, a predator. <br /> <br /> Large colonies of a native moss circle the lake at depths between 100 feet (30 meters) to 400 feet (120 meters). </p>   <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  </p>",

During the summer, hikers must <b>stay on trails</b> at all times to protect the delicate subalpine meadows around the lake. Boating and fishing is not permitted in Reflection Lakes. During the winter, snowshoers and hikers can still access the area and winter camp around the snow-covered lake. <br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Several trails intersect around Reflection Lakes. The <b>Lakes Trail</b> is an approximately three-mile loop trail that starts from either end of the parking lots next to the lakes. Starting from the west side of the lake, the trail climbs up to the ridge above the lake, follows the ridge to Faraway Rock, then descends back to the lake. Faraway Rock overlooks Louise Lake and Stevens Canyon to the east, as well as providing views to the southwest of the Tatoosh Range and Reflection Lakes. The trail is dirt, broken at times by tree roots and rocks. The eastern side of the loop from Faraway Rock to Reflection Lakes is steeper, with rock and log steps. Trails connecting to the Lakes Trail lead to Paradise through the Paradise Valley or along Mazama Ridge to the Skyline Trail.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pinacle-peak.htm\">Pinnacle Peak Trail</a> is a popular 2.5-mile roundtrip trail that starts to the south of Reflection Lakes. The rocky trail climbs 1,050 feet up several switchbacks through subalpine meadows to a saddle between Pinnacle Peak and Plummer Peak in the Tatoosh Range. The trail can have patches of snow lingering well into summer and steep, exposed drop-offs. From the saddle, view Mount Rainier to the north or look south for glimpses of Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens.

            "audioDescription": "Reflection Lakes are tucked between Mount Rainier to the north and the Tatoosh Range to the south at the northwest end of Stevens Canyon. The lakes are surrounded by forest with patches of subalpine meadow around the shore. The largest of the Reflection Lakes is framed by Stevens Canyon Road, with long stretches of parking and paved sidewalks along the lake side. A secondary, smaller lake is to the east. The sidewalk along the road is bordered by a low rock wall with metal-framed wayside exhibits along the wall at two locations. Stone steps lead down to a dirt trail on either end of the parking and in the center. On the opposite side of the road from the center parking area is the trailhead for the Pinnacle Peak Trail, with a trail information sign in a wood frame to the right of the trailhead.",

            "bodyText": "<p>During the first two decades of the 1900s, Thurmond was a classic boomtown. With the huge amounts of coal brought in from area mines, it had the largest revenue on the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. Having many coal barons among its patrons, Thurmond's banks were the richest in the state. Fifteen passenger trains a day came through town-its depot serving as many as 95,000 passengers a year. The town's stores and saloons did a remarkable business, and its hotels and boarding houses were constantly overflowing. With the advent of diesel locomotives, and less coal coming in from local mines, the town began a steady decline. The many businesses closed down, and most residents moved on.</p> <p>Today, the town of Thurmond remains surprisingly untouched by modern development. It is a link to our past, and a town with many stories to tell. New River Gorge National River invites visitors to experience the impact of the industrial revolution, and the mission of the National Park Service to preserve our nation's heritage.</p> <p>To reach Thurmond, take U.S. Route 19 to the Glen Jean exit, north of Beckley. Follow the signs to Thurmond, seven miles down WV Route 25 (Route 25 is a narrow, winding road and is not recommended for RVs and trailers).<br /> <br /> <strong>Thurmond in Prosperous Times</strong><br /> <br /> The year 1873 marked the completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway mainline. It was also the year that Captain W. D. Thurmond acquired 73 acres along the railroad, a strategic position for developing a town.<br /> <br /> Thurmond was the heart of the New River Gorge, carrying shipments of coal from the surrounding coal fields. The town of Thurmond grew as the coal and timber industries expanded in the gorge. The rail yard was expanded to meet the railroad’s needs. By 1910, Thurmond was the chief railroad center on the C&O Railway mainline.<br /> <br /> In 1910, the C & O operation at Thurmond was first in revenue receipts, producing more freight tonnage than Cincinnati, Ohio, and Richmond, Virginia, combined. Freight was not the only key to this town’s success. Seventy-five thousand passengers passed through Thurmond in 1910, delighting in all it had to offer.<br /> <br /> At its peak, Thurmond had two hotels, two banks, restaurants, clothing stores, a jewelry store, movie theater, several dry-good stores, and many business offices. The town continued to thrive through the early decades of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> <strong>Thurmond in Decline</strong><br /> With the onset of the Great Depression, several businesses closed, including the National Bank of Thurmond. The town’s economic vitality waned after two large fires wiped out several major businesses.<br /> <br /> By the mid 1930s there were other indications that Thurmond’s heyday was ending. The American public had begun its love affair with the automobile, and good roads made travel by car easy. C & O Railway changed from steam to diesel locomotives in the 1940s. Thurmond had been a steam town, its rail yard and crews geared toward the short service intervals of steam locomotives. The switch to diesels left many of the rail yard structures and jobs obsolete.<br /> <br /> Once the heart of the New River Gorge, Thurmond remains its soul. Memories continue to be made here in the 21st century. The town is still incorporated and hosts an annual reunion for former residents.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stabilizing Thurmond’s Past for the Future</strong><br /> The Thurmond Depot was restored as a visitor center by the National Park Service in 1995. There are over twenty other park-owned structures in Thurmond. The National Park Service began a stabilization program in 2003, including repairs to preserve buildings until the time that they can be rehabilitated or restored. Work includes removal of overgrown vegetation, improvement of drainage around the buildings, installation of more permanent metal panel roofs and gutters, removal of hazardous porches and additions, the installation of window louvers to provide adequate interior ventilation and some exterior restoration work.</p>",

            "bodyText": "The First Baptist Church has a unique history in Nicodemus. Church/religion was very important for the settlers of Nicodemus as the town was settled by several Preachers. The First Baptist Church was established in 1878, in the beginning the Nicodemus Colony members attended church services in a dugout. Members of the church when wanting to be baptized were baptized in a creek located on Thomas Johnson's Homestead north of town. Thomas Johnson was a deacon of the church and arrived with the first colony in September 17, 1877.  Eventually the congregation was established enough to build a small structured church. As the town grew the church grew and the congregation needed a larger building. A larger building was built in 1907 and the older generations tell the story how the larger church building was built around the smaller building and the smaller building was demolished piece by piece and removed out the door and windows of the newer church building. The congregation used that method so that they could continue to hold church services while the new church building was being built.The First Baptist Church was the first building in Nicodemus to receive electricity in early 1950. The congregation built a newer building to the North of the church in the 1970's. Currently, Nicodemus First Baptist Church is still in full operation, the church members meet Wednesday night for bible study and Sunday mornings for teachings.",
            "audioDescription": "Description of Baptist Church - The First Baptist Church sits on a 1/4 acre of open space, the square building is approximately 75-100 feet in height, it has a triangle pitched roof with wood shingles. The building has four windows that are all towards the front of the building. Inside the historic church it is a wide open space with the altar and pulpit towards the right of the church. The ceiling of the church is covered in a decorated tin material. Outside the Baptist Church is an interpretive wayside. Written on the way side. \"Sunday school prayer meetings gospel, singing, spirited preaching, church suppers and special events all graced the sanctuary of the First Baptist Church. Churches are the cornerstone of black communities throughout the US. Before Emancipation, restrictive laws often prohibited blacks from gathering in larger number except in churches. Rev. Samuel Roundtree, one of the five Nicodemus organizers and promoters recruited homesteaders from Baptist churches in Central Kentucky. Soon after arriving in the fall of 1877 Rev. SIlias Lee organized the Nicodemus First Baptist Church. At first the congregation worshipped in a dugout at Tom Johnson’s homestead north of town. Later they worshiped in a large e sod structure at this location. 1880 they built a large limestone church on the main street of the growing town. 1907 the Congregation substantially enlarged the church and the front entrance moved to the side of the building. The original church was incorporated within the new one.\"",

One of Crater Lake's two islands, it is 170 feet (51.8 meters) high, 500 feet (152 meters) long, and 200 feet (60.9 meters) wide.<br /> <br /> At first glance, the dark, jagged island just offshore calls to mind the image of a ghostly ship with tall masts and drooping sails. Phantom Ship is actually a resistant remnant of an ancient volcanic cone that was engulfed in the growing Mazama volcano.

Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Everett Covered Bridge. This covered bridge is a reminder of Ohio’s transportation history. The original was built in the late 1870s to carry horses and wagons, and later automobiles, over Furnace Run. It was destroyed by a 1975 flood. The current bridge is an accurate reconstruction, open to foot traffic only.

The pine trees found on Cumberland Island in Timucuan times would have been much larger than any found here today.<br /> These large trees were harvested to make canoe-like vessels called pirogues. Timucuans did not carve these trees into canoes but used the power of fire to hollow out a cavity. Embers would be set on the log to char the top of the log. The charred wood was scooped out with shell tools and the burning continued until the log was hollowed out to make a canoe. Wet clay was applied to the areas that should not be burned.

It can be seen the length of the River Trail as well as throughout the island’s maritime forest ecosystem. Neither Spanish nor moss, this plant is more closely related to the pineapples and other Bromeliads than any type of moss. This is an epiphyte which is a plant that collects moisture and nutrients from the air.  It is not a parasite and generally does not damage branches unless it gets too dense and heavy. Many animals such as insects, bats, birds, lizards, and snakes rely on Spanish moss for shelter. Timucuan women collected the moss, smoked it over a fire or boiled it to get rid of the insects then wove it together to make a skirt or a sash. Spanish moss was used through the mid-1900s for stuffing pillows and mattresses instead of wool because moths are not drawn to it. Today it is used mostly for floral arrangements.  <br /> <br /> This is the last station on the River trail.<br /> As you travel around the rest of the island, imagine only relying on the resources around you for survival. There are many hidden uses of the plants found on Cumberland Island that were utilized by Native Americans. The more we learn about the many uses of plants, the more we can reconnect with the natural world. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the rest of your day on Cumberland Island!",

As young plants just emerging from the ground, they can be easily confused with other palm species. It can be distinguished from saw palmetto by a long midrib that extends into the leaf, giving it a ‘v’ shape. Clusters of small dark blue berries ripen in winter and are reported to taste like dates. Seeds and berries were used for treating headaches and fevers. Fibers can be peeled from the leaves and woven into rope, which was used for fishing nets and traps.

The red bay produces round, single seeded, dark blue and purple berries in October. Many red bays have large areas of brown leaves.

These serrations help to protect the plant from predation. The plants typically grow in a horizontal fashion, with the main stem partially buried underground. This helps protect the plant from fire. Fibers gathered from along the stem could be woven into cloth as well as rope. Berries the size of grapes are found in clusters that ripen in late summer and contain high levels of sugar and oil. These berries could be dried for storage then later reconstituted by cooking or soaking in hot water. The taste, however, was said to resemble “rotten cheese steeped in tobacco” by early Europeans.

Grapes ripen in July and August and were gathered for food and the vine tendrils were often nibbled as a refreshing snack. Raccoon and turkey are often seen munching on the purple fruit.

On July 7, 1742, decisive British victories at Gully Hole Creek and Bloody Marsh ended these claims. <br /> <br /> In June of 1742, a Spanish armada sailed north from Saint Augustine to invade the English colonies in hopes of taking lands that they considered theirs. Spanish commander Manuel de Montiano, the governor of Florida, hoped to destroy Frederica and lay waste to the coast as far north as South Carolina. On the morning of July 7, 1742 the Spanish suffered a defeat near Fort Frederica at Gully Hole Creek. That afternoon, Spanish reinforcements hoped to approach along the Military Road toward the fort but were met with an ambush. Scottish Highlanders (British) hidden in the woods along the marsh opened fire. The battle was decisive and short-lived. Legend has it that the marsh ran red with blood as the British muskets routed the Spanish force.<br /> <br /> The dual disasters proved fatal to the Spanish invasion of St. Simons Island and any hopes of controlling territory in Georgia.<br /> <br /> <strong>Bloody Marsh is located on St. Simon's Island, on 11806 Old Demere Road. It is open from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm, 7 days a week, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas Day and New Year's Day.</strong>",

Ten yards to the south (right) along the marsh stands a rectangular stone monument with two-tiered foundation and pointed top and metal plaque. Beyond the grassy area with pavilion, waysides, and monument to the east, a salt marsh area with mud flats and cord grass extends a large area to a distant tree line.

It is a structural reinforced fiberglass polyester plastic portable home, meant to be easily moved to a desired site, usually by helicopter. Noted for its ellipsoid shaped shell which characterizes its spaceage Futuristic architectural style, the residence measures 26’4” (8m) in diameter, 13’2” (4m) high with a total floor area of 520 square feet (48.5 square meters), and weighs approximately 11,900 pounds (5,500kg). Following extensive exterior and interior restoration, the resource is in excellent condition retaining its integrity of design, workmanship, materials, setting, feeling, and association to its 1969 period of significance. In recognition of owner Milford Wayne Donaldson’s restoration effort and resulting preservation of this fragile resource, essential to saving the building and raising the profile of the entire family of similar buildings, the property is identified as the Donaldson Futuro.  <br /> <br /> The Donaldson Futuro is an example of America’s collective confidence as a leader in space flight, technology advancement, and economic prosperity. The property is also the first serially produced plastic house in California and the U.S. and the first all structural glass-reinforced polyester house in California, which became a notable icon in California space-age architecture. It is the first Futuro to arrive in California, the only one in the state until 2015, and the only Futuro in California to have obtained a building permit for residential occupancy, following the extensive restoration of this fragile and rare property type.  Its locale within the San Jacinto Mountains is reminiscent of the mountainous setting and general environment comparable to Finnish architect Matti Suuronen’s original design intent. The period of significance is 1969, the year the Futuro was fabricated and shipped to California from Futuro Enterprises in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. <br /> <br />  ",

The soft wood was often used to carve statues of animals as well as for canoes and pirogues. The flakey bark makes a good fire starter.

Its dark green leaves are present throughout winter until the new leaves appear in the spring. The outstretched branches form a dense canopy. Thick, waxy leaves protect the tree from excessive salt spray. Prior to use, they were soaked in water to remove the bitter tannins. The nuts were then dried and ground into a meal for bread. These same acorns also attracted wildlife such as deer, squirrel, and turkey which made for easy hunting. In the late 1700’s, live oaks were sought-after for building ships. It is estimated that by 1802, 80% of the live oak trees were harvested from Cumberland Island. The strong, dense wood of live oaks resisted rot and even cannon balls, hence the nickname of the U.S.S. constitution, ‘Old Iron Sides’. The curved, twisted growth of live oaks made them desirable for ship building.  ",

Smilax is a genus that encompasses many species of woody vines. The common name of these vines, such as catbrier, greenbrier, and deer thorns, all indicate the thorny nature of the vine. The spikes are not actually thorns but are termed prickles. Prickles are projections of the plant’s skin, while thorns are modified branches. These prickles help protect the plant from predation. Smilax grows well in a variety of habitats, such as dunes or under the canopy of the Maritime forest.  Young new growth and tendrils from the vine were nibbled as a fresh green. Smilax grows a large tuber that allows the plant to sprout back quickly after a fire or other disturbance. These tubers were gathered, soaked, and mashed to separate the starches, which were used to make bread.",
