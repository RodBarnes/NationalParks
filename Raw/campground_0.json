Two separate mountain ranges are visible to the east and west. Ten campsites are spread out over the entirety of the two-mile loop trail, and are marked by brown wooden posts that emerge straight up from the ground. Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yucca’s dark brown, round seeds. Each site is marked by a bright orange post that protrudes from the ground, with the site number on it.",

The campground loop is gravel with slight inclines although vehicles with 4-wheel drive or high clearance are generally not required. There are 22 full hook-up sites (water, sewer, 30 AMP) that can accommodate RV’s up to 50 foot long. The dry camping area consists of 3 separate loops (A-C) that have 80 concrete padded sites that can accommodate tent, trailers and RV’s. Each loop road is asphalt so 4-wheel drive or high clearance vehicle are not required. There are slight inclines in the road, but the Individual sites are mostly level with a paved driveway and gravel tent pad (may be challenging for wheelchairs). Each site has a charcoal grill and picnic table but because the sites are gravel and, possibly on an incline, maneuvering a wheelchair may be difficult. In the center of the campground (approximate 5 minute walk from furthest site) are accessible restrooms with flush toilets, sinks and showers. Pets are allowed as long as they are on a leash and under control at all times. Please call the Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas at 435-684-3032 for more information.",

            "audioDescription": "Over 2 million visitors annually come to enjoy the scenic beauty of Cades Cove and its many historic structures. Popular activities here include hiking, biking, touring the 11-mile Cades Cove Loop Road and observing wildlife. Whether blanketed in bright wildflowers in the spring or vivid colors in the fall, the scenery at Cades Cove never disappoints. Cades Cove is a broad, verdant valley surrounded by mountains and is one of the most popular destinations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It offers some of the best opportunities for wildlife viewing in the park. Large numbers of white-tailed deer are frequently seen, and sightings of black bear, coyote, groundhog, turkey, raccoon, skunk, and other animals are also possible. For hundreds of years Cherokee Indians hunted in Cades Cove, but archeologists have found no evidence of major settlements. The first Europeans settled in the cove sometime between 1818 and 1821. By 1830 the population of the area had already swelled to 271. Cades Cove Campground is open-year round and combines the feel of primitive camping with the modern convenience of flush toilets and drinking water. During peak season (May - October) a camp store provides visitors with basic necessities as well as bike rentals. Events like Interpretive Programs in the nearby amphitheater and Bicycle Only Days on the loop road provide visitors with a fun and unique experience. Reservations are now required year-round to camp in Cades Cove Campground. All campsites are drive-up. No more than two motor vehicles or one vehicle with trailer are allowed per campsite. Please keep wheels, including trailer wheels and guest cars, on the pavement. Park only in designated spaces. Overflow parking is available for excess vehicles. The maximum number of occupants, per campsite, is six. All tents must be pitched on the tent pad, where provided.

The parking area contains 1 pit toilet, which is the only toilet in the backcountry area. The short dirt side trails to the campsites are indicated by wooden posts off of the main loop and lead to cleared flat areas with a wooden post site marker where tents can be set up. All the campsites are shaded by tall trees. Campsite 1 is one of the farthest campsites from the parking area and is located in a mixed forest of pine and hardwood. Campsite 2 in also far from the parking area and is located up a short, steep hill to a knob on a ridge top. Campsite 3 is located on the edge of the Chopawamsic Creek floodplain near an open meadow that provides easy access to the creek for fishing or birdwatching. Campsite 4 is located the furthest from the main loop trail up a hill to the top of a ridge. Campsite 5 is located on a ridge close to the main loop trail on a mostly flat walk from the parking area. Campsite 6 is the closest to the main parking area on a sheltered ridge. Campsite 7 is near an old homesite in an open hardwood forest on a wide ridge. Campsite 8 is near an old field in a mostly level area. Chopawamsic Backcountry Area is bordered by Quantico Marine Base so firing operations can occasionally be heard when camping here. Breckenridge Reservoir is a large open water reservoir in the far south of the backcountry area that is shared with Quantico Marine Base. The north side of the reservoir is open to visitors to the backcountry area, and although there are no direct trails to the reservoir, Lykes Lane is an old farm road located on the eastern edge of the backcountry area that can be used to access it.",

Past the ranger station the road continues into the campground loops. The campground has six campsite loops, labeled A through E. Loop A is the first loop to the right. Turnoffs for loops B-D continue in order on the right as you drive down the main road of the campground. A few individual campsites border the left side of the main road. After loop D, the main road curves to the right, with loop E branching off to the left before the main road terminates with loop F, which has 5 sets of parking areas for group camping. The campground amphitheater is located to the right of the main road between loops C and D. There are seven restrooms. One restroom is located between the middle of loop A and B, one is on either end of loop C, two are in between the main road and either end of loop D, one is between loop E and F, and finally one is on the left side of loop F. To access the Nisqually River from the campground, exit the campground via the main entrance and follow the road to the right to the Carter Fall trailhead.

The camp offers 92 individual sites, all with grills, tables and campfire rings, perfect for a meal or a late-night s'mores session. Hookups and showers are not provided, but flush toilets and drinking water are available. Deep Creek is in the southeastern portion of the park and provides a moderate climate, typified by mild winters and hot, humid summers. Because of its proximity to water, Deep Creek is an ideal campground for water recreation and books up quickly during summer months. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a hiker's paradise, with plenty of trails easily accessible from the Deep Creek campsites. An easy 1.6 mile roundtrip hike will allow you to enjoy two beautiful waterfalls in the Deep Creek area. Walk Deep Creek Trail 0.7 mile to the junction with Indian Creek Trail. On your way you can view elegant Tom Branch Falls located on the far side of Deep Creek. Turn right at the junction with Indian Creek Trail and proceed approximately 200' to Indian Creek Falls. The falls are 25 feet in height. Deep Creek runs on the edge of the campground and provides easily accessible fishing, wading and tubing. Visitors can also enjoy high-quality backcountry fishing in the cool waters of the countless streams and rivers that snake through the mountains, with trout available in abundance.",

At the beginning of the Flamingo campground and looking west, there is a white registration office located in the median between the incoming and outgoing paved campground lanes. From here, the campground is separated into two loops with road access encircling the campsites of each. Following a right turn to the northwest after the registration office, you are taken to T-Loop which is available for RV and tent camping with multiple pull-through style campsites. Trash receptacles are in the center median as you enter this loop following the one-way road to the right. Many sites in this area have electricity and water. Two shower and restroom facilities are in the loop area. The first one has a water source and a sanitary pump-out station for RVs. Some sites have shade trees. A campground host is located at site number 16. If following the road straight to the west from the registration office, A-Loop will be entered which is a tent camping only area. The one-way loop will take you past turn outs for vehicles and campsites. Some sites have shade trees. Two facilities provide showers and restrooms, the first one has a water source and sanitary pump-out station. Most of the campsites in these two loops have picnic table and fire ring access. Additional sites can be found by following the outbound lane from the registration office. By taking an immediate right turn to the southeast, the ECO Tent area will be on the right between the road and Florida Bay connected by a series of slightly elevated walkways. These tan enclosed canvas-like structures are often available in a furnished condition with each having electricity and a fan. Some Eco Tents are wheelchair accessible. Restrooms and water are available at a facility close to the Eco Tents walkway access. Continuing past the Eco Tents towards the east and located on the right is a low-lying grassy area with some fire rings and picnic tables. This is the walk-in tent camping and group site area located between the road and Florida Bay. This area does not have shade available. The restroom and water source facility is located just past the area where the road ends in a loop to take you back towards the registration office and main park road. Parking is available at all loop individual campsites whereas the Eco Tent and walk-in area have small parking lots along the road.",

Across the moat from the fort is an open field and approaching the grassy campground, the groups site is indicated by a sign and a grouping of gray picnic tables and black grills. Continuing south west, smaller campsites are indicated by a picnic table, grill and 6 foot wooden pole with several hooks for hanging food and other camping materials. Wide leafed sea grape trees, palm trees and button wood trees offer sun and wind protection over small sandy patches in the grass where tents can be erected. Continuing southwest through the campground and towards the coaling dock platform, a sandy path winds around campsite, palm trees and ends at the bathroom facility. The bathrooms are located in a brown, square, wooden building up a gradual inclined ramp with thick black tap to prevent slipping. Two adjacent doors each lead to vaulted toilets. Leaving the restroom a series of signs to the left highlight interpretive information and indicate a short route to a sandy beach. Walking along the white sandy path there are small succulent green plants covering the ground of the remining camp area. Here, there white sand and waves crashing along the moat wall. Following the beach back to the fort, the campground area again comes into view as you circle back to the docks.",

            "audioDescription": "The Gulpha Gorge campground is located between Gulpha Creek and Highway 7-South. The campground road is essentially a big loop connecting all the amenities and facilities of the campground together. There are tall trees that fill the spaces between the campgrounds and create a remote-feeling atmosphere. As you enter, the picnic area is immediately available on the left. There are stone tables/benches with free standing grills available. The picnic area overlooks Gulpha Creek and is very shady. Driving through the campground, you'll first see the dump station, the campground hosts campsites, and then will drive through several campsites on the loop. At the end of the loop is the campground's amphitheater. The amphitheater is sloped downward, with a stage and A-frame structure at the bottom. There are many rows with benches, separated by wide-aisles leading down to the stage. Behind the amphitheater is Gulpha Creek and the access point for Gulpha Gorge trail. Leaving the amphitheater, you'll drive by more campsites, Gulpha Creek is now on the right hand side, and eventually will come to the fee station. This is a ranch style building, with ornamental bushes in front, that has maps, brochures, park information, and the fee station to pay for your campsite. Continuing down the road, you'll drive through the rest of the campsites, and eventually will reconnect with the entrance road, passing the picnic area on the right-hand side before getting to Highway 7 South.",

An occasional Ponderosa pine towers above the other vegetation providing some shade especially in the Coyote Loop of the campground. The campground is paved and each campground space includes a picnic table and in-ground grill. Each loop also has a restroom facility with a paved walkway leading to it.
