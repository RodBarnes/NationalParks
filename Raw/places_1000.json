            "audioDescription": "For your safety, please remain behind the railroad ties on the ground. From the northern post for trail stop #3, you are at the edge of a steep cliff facing north across the Channel towards the mainland in the distance. The edge of the cliff is about two feet in front of you and drops several hundred feet straight down to the ocean. The cliff continues east and west along the full length of the island. At 8 o’clock, at the bottom of the cliff is a tall shallow cave filled with a small beach. There, you can usually spot tiny tan and brown lumps that are actually pinnipeds, a scientific family that includes seals and sea lions. They generally lay still and may be mistaken for rocks when seen from this far away. Every few minutes however, one or two will roll around, flap their flippers, or fight with one another. Their bellows can often be heard, even from this distance. At 9 o’clock, around a rocky outcrop, is another shallow beach at the base of the cliff. More pinnipeds are often seen there. Just offshore a kelp forest can be seen below the water, interspersed with patches of sandy ocean bottom. From 11 o’clock to 1 o’clock, Santa Barbara County can be seen on the distant mainland, across the channel. At 2 o’clock is Ventura County. At 3 o’clock is the white, cylindrical Anacapa lighthouse, about 6 stories tall.",

An easy walk up the dirt trail takes you to the lighthouse. The coast guard operates the lighthouse. For safety reasons, visitors are not permitted to tour the lighthouse, or fog signal building. The next two paragraphs describe the lighthouse and fog signal THE LIGHTHOUSE The lighthouse is 39-foot concrete cylindrical white stucco tower in the Spanish Revival style. At the entrance is a red portico and steel door. Three rectangular windows are at various levels along the sides and eight rectangular windows wrap around the tower near the top. The tower is topped with a railing that encircles the glass lantern room with diamond-shaped window panes. Behind the glass cylinder is the solar powered acrylic lens. The original Fresnel lens (pronounced (fray-nel) is on display in the Visitor Center. THE FOG SIGNAL BUILDING Next to the lighthouse sits the fog signal building. This 16 square foot, one story, white stucco building has a flat roof of terra cotta clay tile topped with a small, chimney like, white tower. The tower creates a second tier that houses the signal equipment. Metal rods stick out the top of this tier and hold the two signal horns. Solar panels are mounted to the back of the building.",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road in a canyon, surrounded by rocky hills that are covered grasses that are often brown, with patches of grey-green scrub brush and coreopsis with thick branches topped with tufts of feathery green leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dead leaves in the drier seasons. Near the start of the trail, small trees are clustered along the bottom of the canyon. A wooden sign on a wooden post reads, Lobo Canyon Trail Nearby, under some coast live oaks, with small oval grey-green leaves, are two picnic tables. As you start down the road, it narrows a thin trail, and the view dramatically changes. The canyon grows steeper and narrower, and greener and lusher along the canyon bottom. The trail passes under many oak trees, draped with lace lichen, which looks like long, thin, gray, lacy shawls of fabric, that drape down from the branches. Here, a variety of plants thrive, including toyon, with long green oval leaves and clusters of buds, flowers or red berries, depending on the season; willow, with a sweeping canopy of light green leaves that turn yellow in the fall; cattails, with tall thin green leaves, and brown cylindrical spikes shaped like broom handles; blackberries, with prickly green leaves; and horsetails, with tall hollow green stalks with ringed sections. As you descend along the trail, in many seasons, a stream will flow by your side, curving along just to the right of you. The shady oaks give way to shrubs and grassland bordered by magnificently carved sandstone cliffs. These steep tan-colored cliffs are made of horizontal layers of rock within a curving vertical face, as if a giant stack of pancakes, had been carved away with many spoons. Above the curved cliffs, the top layer of earth projects out, like a little lip. The hillsides above the cliffs have the same kinds of plants seen on the hills at the start of the trail, with the addition of coastal prickly pear, a broad cactus with grey and green pancake-shaped leaves covered with thorny spines and, in season, pear-shaped red fruit, also covered in spines. About half way down the trail, a side trail takes you to a cathedral-like side canyon, surrounded by the carved sandstone cliffs, with a bowl-shaped base, and many alcoves and caves to explore. As you go further down the trail, cool ocean breezes tell you when you're getting close to the beach. At the mouth of Lobo Canyon, the creek often forms a small lagoon just before the beach.",

Students at Tougaloo, whose campus is located ten miles north of Jackson, led a multi-year effort to end racial discrimination in the state's capital city. The nine historic buildings on the campus date from the mid-19th through the early 20th centuries.<br /> <br /> <span>Tougaloo College was founded in 1869 by the American Missionary Association to provide teacher education and industrial training for African Americans in Mississippi. From its start Tougaloo College served all races; a white student was among its first graduating class. Tougaloo students and white students at the nearby Millsaps College, a white Methodist school, formed academic and social bonds, setting, for the time, a rare example of racial cooperation.<br /> <br /> In 1960 Tougaloo installed a president who would lead the college through the turbulent years of the civil rights movement. Dr. Adam Beittel began a successful exchange program with several northern schools, including Brown University, which brought white students to Tougaloo. Because Tougaloo College was a private institution administered by a board in New York, it was free from State control. Students at Tougaloo began protesting racial discrimination in Jackson, and led a boycott of restaurants in the city which refused to serve blacks. Many students were arrested for protesting at the businesses and for trying to attend segregated white churches and concerts. President Beittel frequently bailed the students out of jail. The students also led a successful campaign to encourage white entertainers not to participate in segregated performances in Jackson. In the 1960s Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee members Bob Moses and James Lawson held voter registration and nonviolence workshops on campus.<br /> <br /> Resistance to the civil rights activities of the students brought violence to the Tougaloo campus, as faculty housing on the edge of the school often became the target of drive-by shootings. In 1964 the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (created by the legislature to defend the state from the encroachment of federal authority) successfully prevailed on Tougaloo's Board of Trustees in New York to dismiss Dr. Beittel as college president by threatening trouble between the college and the State if Beittel remained. The Board removed Dr. Beittel, but by this time the student movement on campus was waning.<br /> <br /> Tougaloo College has continually sought to enhance the education of its students, as well as to promote harmonious racial relations between whites and blacks. As the center of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, Tougaloo College played a vital role in advancing the black community in the State.</span></span><br /> <br /> <strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

At your feet, grass grows up through a thin layer of decomposed asphalt a hard-packed cement-like surface. Before you, facing the parking area and angled toward the ocean, is a beige two story building. It has clapboard siding and a gabled, or simple peaked, roof, covered with brown shingles. The front of the building has four white roll-up garage doors, big enough to accommodate a large truck. The three doors on the right are new, with aluminum panels. The door on the far left is older, made of a grid of wooden sections, six squares wide by seven high. At mid height, the squares are six windows, running horizontally across the door. The rest are wooden panels, with faded and peeling white paint. The right side of the building has a single story extension with a slanted, shed roof. The front of this extension has a metal door, and a sliding glass window. The side of the extension has three windows. A metal picnic table sits on the ground outside these windows. On a flat grassy area, near the building, on the right, or ocean, side, are three picnic tables. To the left side of the building, overgrown with scrubby bushes, is a second structure. It looks similar to a carport. The front of the building is open. It has cement walls on the other three sides. The back of the structure partially cuts into the gentle hill where it sits. A gabled roof is supported by three wooden poles. The roof is damaged and has a large hole on one side. Behind the buildings is a hillside blanketed in scrubby brush with patches of grass.",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>September 1957 </strong></p> <p>On the evening of September 2, 1957, the day before the schools were to open in Little Rock, Governor Orval Faubus appeared on statewide television and announced that he intended to surround Central High School with Arkansas National Guard troops because of “evidence of disorder and threats of disorder.”  Faubus said, </p> <p><em>“The mission of the State militia is to maintain or restore order to protect the lives and property of citizens.” </em></p> <p>Two days later, nine African-American students, the “Little Rock Nine,” attempted to enter the school, but were turned away by the troops. </p> <p>While the NAACP and the school board pursued the matter through the federal courts, all of the Nine were denied entry to the school for the next two weeks. During this time Philander Smith College opened its doors to the students. The faculty provided tutorial opportunities for the students to enable them to stay current with their studies and rejoin their white classmates. </p> <p><em>“Realizing that the dilemma of integration wasn’t going to be resolved quickly, everybody seemed to be concerned about our falling behind in our schoolwork. Teachers from our community along with other professionals were offering to give us books and to tutor us. It felt good to dress in school clothes and go to Philander Smith, our community’s college. For part of each day, I studied schoolwork and spent time with my eight friends, enjoying a thimbleful of normality.” </em></p> <p>Melba Patillo Beals, Little Rock Nine</p>   <p><strong>The Faculty Responds </strong></p> <p>Dr. Ozell Sutton attended Philander College and graduated in 1950. He was the president of the Little Rock chapter of Philander Alumni. He recalled his involvement in tutoring the Little Rock Nine.:</p> <p><em>“The subject of the tutorial was how do we get through this?  We learned strength, vitality, and throughout the civil rights movement that young people were our contacts with what ought to be. They (Little Rock Nine) forced me to act out my commitment...I learned how to struggle, and what it means to be committed...Philander was there, willing and ready to assist.” </em></p>   <p><strong>Philander Students Continue the Fight </strong></p> <p>In March 1960, nearly 50 students participated in a sit-in demonstration at Woolworth’s lunch counter in downtown Little Rock. Store managers closed the lunch counter and five Philander Smith College students were arrested after refusing to leave. They were charged with loitering and with “creating a disturbance in a public place.” Chief of Police Eugene Smith reported that all five were “sitting there with their backs to the counter” reading books and magazines. </p> <p>George Howard, Jr., an attorney for the five students argued in court that the arrests were a violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. He said that criminal laws should not be used to help private business owners deprive customers of equal treatment. </p>   <p><strong>September 1997  </strong></p> <p>In 1997, President Bill Clinton attended a candlelight vigil at Philander Smith College in observance of the 40th anniversary of the Central High desegregation crisis. In his speech, he stated, </p> <p><em>“...Parents and family members who were threatened with the loss of their jobs, neigh­bors who gave them everything from money to food to transportation and, of course, the faculty here at Philander Smith, who volun­teered to tutor them, [gave] an extraordinary gift. And I would say to all of you who were involved in that, they all turned out pretty well, and I thank you for that.” </em></p>   <p><strong>What Is An HBCU? </strong></p> <p>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are postsecondary institutions that were originally founded for the purpose of providing educational opportunities for African Americans before and after the Civil War. </p> <p>Today, there are over 100 HBCUs, located in 20 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. They include accredited two- and four-year as well as graduate and professional institutions.<strong> </strong></p>   <p><strong>Philander Smith Today</strong></p> <p>Philander Smith College was established in Little Rock in 1877 to provide educational opportunities for former slaves following the Civil War. The college was opened under the supervision of the Freedmen’s Aid Society of The Methodist Episcopal Church, and it was named Walden Seminary.  In 1882, Adeline Smith, widow of Philander Smith-an Illinois philanthropist-donated $10,500 to Walden Seminary. The school’s trustees renamed the institution Philander Smith College in recognition of this gift. Philander Smith College awarded its first baccalaureate degree in 1888 and became accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1949. </p> <p>Today, Philander Smith College is one of four historically black colleges and universities in Arkansas and is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and the United Negro College Fund.  The college places special emphasis upon the importance of service among its faculty and students and encourages their participation in the greater Little Rock community.  Among its illustrious alumni, Philander Smith College includes Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former U.S. Surgeon General, Charles Adams, an inventor who developed the U.S. Postal Service sorting machine, and Huburt “Geese” Ausbie, former Harlem Globetrotter. <br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/hbcu\">Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve the historic structures on HBCU campuses, funded restoration and renovation work on the James Monroe Cox Administration Building at Philander Smith College in 2018. </em></p>",
            "audioDescription": "Founded in 1877, Philander Smith College is a small, privately supported, historically Black, four-year liberal arts institution related to the Board of Higher Education and Ministry of the United Methodist Church and is located at 900 W. Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive in Little Rock. The school campus is located in central Little Rock. Interstate 630 (the Mills Freeway) was constructed just north of the campus, which is bounded by 10th and 14th streets to the north and south, and Gaines and Chester streets to the east and west. The core of the campus was originally built for Little Rock Junior College (now the University of Arkansas at Little Rock), and a two-block section of it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of its centerpieces is the former U.M. Rose School building, now the Cox Administration Building, designed by the noted Arkansas architect John Parks Almand in 1915, when he was working for Charles L. Thompson. The campus also includes the \"Old Gym\", a gymnasium built by the WPA during the Great Depression; and a former barracks building of the Camp Robinson Air Force Base, which was moved here in 1948.",

The view: From the southern post for trail stop #3, you are at the edge of a steep cliff facing south toward the Pacific Ocean. The edge of the cliff is about ten feet in front of you and drops several hundred feet down to the ocean. The cliff continues east and west along the full length of the island. At 8 o’clock, are the red roofs of the Visitor Center and other buildings. At 9’oclock, Anacapa Island stretches eastward to a narrow tip, pointing toward the Santa Monica Mountains, in the distance on the mainland. Near the very end of the island is the white, cylindrical Anacapa lighthouse, about 6 stories tall. Far below, at the base of the cliff is a steep rocky shore, with small pockets of small cobble and sand beaches. There, you can usually spot tiny tan and brown spots lumps that are actually pinnipeds, a scientific family that includes sea lions and seals up to 16 feet long. Most of them lay still on the shore, and may be mistaken for rocks when seen from this far away. Every few minutes however, one or two will roll around, flap their flippers, or fight with one another. Their bellows can often be heard, even from this distance. At 10 o’clock, sea birds sit on a large rock just offshore. From here to 2 o’clock is the broad Pacific Ocean, with no other land visible. Boats are sometimes seen offshore. At 3 o’clock East Anacapa Island continues westward. The northern edge of Middle Anacapa Island is seen in the distance.",

            "audioDescription": "On the valley floor, within the protection of a wide canyon is the Scorpion Ranch housing complex that consists of a two-story ranch house with a kitchen, bakery with a built-in masonry oven, dining area and two rooms upstairs for housing ranch staff. A bunkhouse and a storage shed, about the size of a garage, are also within the 5-foot-high wooden split rail fence that surrounds the compound. Gardens, shrubs and fig trees edge the buildings. The two-story, adobe Scorpion Ranch house, now the visitor center with exhibits, is tucked in close to the canyon walls and faces the open valley to the south. The ranch house was built in 1886 of rubble-wall masonry and rests on a stone and mortar foundation. The building has a rectangular plan that measures 51 feet by 18 feet. It has a shed roof and walls that are 20 inches thick and composed of local stone, adobe bricks, mortar covered with white stucco, and limestone. Windows across the face of the building provide natural light. The first floor has two main rooms, both are open to the public with exhibits and audio visual components that describe the natural and cultural history of the area. The bakery is at the west end of the building and also contains exhibits. The bunkhouse is located immediately south of the adobe ranch house. Built in 1914, this one-and-a-half story wood frame structure has a simple, gable-roof and white board-and-batten siding.",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing on a sandy dirt road, more than 300 feet long, running roughly east to west, from the ocean side near the landing dock road, toward the ranch barns. There are 6-foot high wooden fences on the north and south sides, creating a long, narrow corridor. To the east is a glimpse of the ocean. Toward the southeast, just beyond the fence, a long line of eucalyptus trees form a windbreak. The fences on the north side of this road, and some of the south side, are part of a series of ranch corrals. The corral fences are constructed of posts, with four wooden plank rails, each about one foot by twelve. As you walk west along the road, toward the ranch buildings, on your left, you will see a long pen that parallels the eucalyptus windbreak. About half-way down the road, on the left is another pen with a large water trough. At the far end, straight ahead, is a large corral, adjacent to a blacksmith shop barn. A little to the right, farther away, is a larger horse barn with a large corral connected to it. Turning around to return east, back along the same road toward the ocean, this larger pen feeds into smaller pens, ending with a row of six small pens connected by a narrow fenced corridor",

The edge of the cliff drops off about ten feet in front of you and about 50 feet to your left. Toward 8 o’clock, about 20 feet to your left is a bench. Beyond the cliff’s edge is the Pacific Ocean with no other land in sight. At 12 o’clock, the rest of the Anacapa islets stretch out toward the west, rising and falling like a sea serpent swimming through the water. Pelicans and other seabirds dot the surfaces of these islets, cliffs, and the rocky shorelines. Middle Anacapa Island is visible, as is West Anacapa, and the landing there, called “Frenchy’s Cove.” Boats are often seen anchored off the cove. In the distance is Santa Cruz Island. From 2 o’clock to 3 o’clock, across the channel, is Santa Barbara County on the distant mainland.",

Torrey pines occur naturally in only two locations in the world—on the cool, fog drenched northeastern slopes of Becher’s Bay and just north of San Diego. The easier, moderate route allows visitors to view the pines along the flat Coastal Road. The strenuous route follows the loop trail to the top of the grove, providing spectacular views. For the best route take the loop trail up the western edge of the grove, along the top, and down the steep, eastern side of the grove. For an easier, more gradual descent, follow the road down to Southeast Anchorage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Distance:</strong> 5 miles to base of pines; 7.5 miles via the loop trail (both are round trip from pier)<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate to strenuous</p>",
            "audioDescription": "You are standing high on a rocky hillside, overlooking a wide ocean bay, surrounded by tall Torrey pine trees. In the distance, the coastline curves out to Carrington Point. In the middle of that curve are a cluster of buildings at the ranch complex, and a wooden pier that stretches far out into the ocean. The Torrey pines have tall thin dark brown trunks have bark with a cracked surface, like a cracked pie crust or alligator skin. Overhead, the tips of branches end in clusters of long spikey dark-green needles—up to about 10 inches long. Growing on the branches are brown oval -shaped pine cones, made of dozens of splayed open seed scales with gaps in between them. The rocky, bumpy ground surface below the pines is blanketed with brown pine needles; a few twisted, dead pine branches; and fallen pine cones. Some pine cones have rolled downhill, and collected at the bottom of gullies. Below the trees are a few smaller plants: island manzanita bushes, with red branches and green oval leaves with bunches of berries that are green, yellow, or red, depending on the season. Scrub oaks, with small bush-like trees with grey bark, small olive green, oval shaped leaves, and, in season, acorns shaped like a smooth cone, with a knit beanie hat on top. Monkey flower, with green oval leaves and small red flowers. Underfoot, the rocky ground surface is covered with lichen, a pale green crust-like growth, that looks like blotches of spray paint. Above the trees, you can often hear the screech of red tail hawks. One may also find Allen’s hummingbirds—tiny, 3 inch long birds with fast fluttering wings, green backs, and purple throats. Sometimes you also find the colorful San Clemente spotted towhee, a large sparrow with a white-spotted black back and a black rump. Its breast is black, its belly white, and its sides are reddish brown. It has a black head with red eyes. Its wings are black with white spots and its long tail is black with white corners. As one heads south from the Torrey pine forest, a grassy hillside drops down toward low rolling hills, with sandy Skunk Point, in the distance.",

Two nationally recognized leaders of that fight, Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall, were closely associated with Howard University. From 1929, Howard Law School became an educational training ground, through the vision of Charles Hamilton Houston, for the development of activist black lawyers dedicated to securing the civil rights of all people of color. <br /> <br /> <span>Howard University also provided preparation of the legal strategy presented by Thurgood Marshall and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) Legal Defense Fund leading to the historic decisions in </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brvb/index.htm\">Brown v. Board of Education</a><span> ending segregation in education. The university represents the role that institutions of higher learning played in bringing about racial desegregation in education. Howard University led the country in the education of civil rights attorneys dedicated to legally securing desegregation, the academic research supporting the unconstitutionality of segregation, and the community outreach needed to challenge and define the interpretation of the United States Constitution in American society. No other university provided the same level of support to the desegregation fight.</span></span><br /> <br /> The graduates of Howard Law School, Houston and other faculty, litigated many of the cases involving challenges in education. In fact, nine of the 10 lawyers who argued <u>Brown</u> were graduates of or professors at Howard Law School. The best known graduate was Thurgood Marshall, who, when appointed in 1967 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, became the first African American to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States. After obtaining his undergraduate degree from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, Marshall graduated from Howard Law School in 1933 and immediately began his campaign against segregation, providing counsel in a host of civil rights cases. When Marshall became director-council of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 1938 he directed the legal attack on segregation at all educational levels, arguing successfully in <u>Sipuel v. Oklahoma State Board of Regents</u>(1948), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oklahoma-bizzell-library-norman.htm\">McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education</a> (1950), and <u>Sweatt v. Painter</u> (1950). Marshall served as lead attorney on <u>Brown</u>, capitalizing on his previous desegregation success. In addition to producing a cadre of civil rights attorneys through the law school, the university contributed to the preparation and presentation of the Legal Defense Fund strategy. Graduates of the university, arguing in groundbreaking litigation, looked to their alma mater to provide research, expert testimony, and legal critiques of their litigation efforts.<br />  </p> <p><em><strong>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about the civil rights movement themes and histories.

            "audioDescription": "You are standing at Skunk Point, flat sandstone slab that stretches far out into the ocean, covered, inland, by an enormous white sand beach. The rock is a light, pinkish tan in color. Closer to the water, thin grooves or channels appear in the rock, running in the direction of the water. Near the mid-tide mark, the rock slab begins to break into smaller chunks and the surface is covered with bright green algae. Here at the point, various currents and ocean swells often collide, creating turbulent waters. Waves seem to break in various directions, creating crisscrossing lines of foamy white water. The water close to shore is a pale turquoise in color, changing to a darker blue farther from shore. Visible from the most commonly visited parts of the island, the triangular-shaped beach behind Skunk Point seems far larger in reality than it appears from a distance. Although its size varies with the seasons, the beach can be almost four miles long and almost a mile deep. The Skunk Point Marine Reserve begins to the east of Skunk Point and continues down to the southern tip of the beach. To the northwest is Bechers Bay, followed by Carrington Point in the distance. To the southeast is East Point. In good weather, Santa Cruz Island can be seen in the distance, to the east. There is an extensive back sand dune area along the beach which is off limits in spring and summer, in order to protect the nesting and foraging areas for the endangered western snowy plover. You are standing on a rocky shoreline. The stone is a conglomeration of sand and thousands of rocks, ranging from the size of a small nut to a small watermelon, that poke up from a smooth surface, creating a trip hazard, so please watch your step. As you move closer to the ocean, deep pools are nestled in gaps of the shoreline. One pool is the size of a small swimming pool. Near the mid-tide mark, the rock surface is carpeted with slippery, bright green algae. Seaweed with rubbery branching leaves, grips the rocks along the edges of the pools. The sea floor in the pools is mixed of sand, sandstone, and cobblestones, covered with a wide variety of animals. Among these may be ochre stars, which are orange, five-armed sea stars with white dots. Bat stars, orangish-red sea stars with five wide arms. Sea urchins, red, purple and black creatures with spiky needles radiating outward, like a spiky ball. Anemones, circular greenish animals surrounded by a ring of pale, pointy tentacles, that curl up into a tight ball if touched. California sea cucumbers, tan and bumpy cucumber-shaped creatures. Mossy chiton, a well camouflaged animal, with a hard brown oval shell, and thick, brown mossy fringe around its outer edge. The deepest of the pools is connected to the ocean by a channel through the rocks. Ocean waves create surges of water that rush through the channel. In the waters off shore and in the deeper pools, are tangled strands of brown kelp. The kelp’s ropelike stalks reach from the ocean floor up to the water’s surface, with short, rubbery, lasagna-like blades sticking off of it. Western snowy plovers are endangered small birds, with bodies about the size of a lime. They have light brown backs and wings, white breasts, narrow wings that end in a sharp point, and feather-less leathery brown legs and feet. Their rounded heads have a short black beak, and their feathers have a narrow black stripe across the forehead, a black horizontal stripe behind large black eyes, and a thin white ring around their necks. Below this ring are small dark rectangular patches; on one either side of their necks. The plovers scrape out shallow depressions in the sand where they lay their eggs. These are well camouflaged, and hard to see in the sand. Young snowy plovers are about the size of a person’s thumb when they hatch. They leave their nests within three hours of hatching, and begin to forage on their own. Plover parents work hard to keep their young safe. If a predator approaches their nest, they will pretend to be injured to lure the predator away. If their chicks are wandering when a predator appears, they will signal the chicks, which then flatten themselves against the sand to be less visible. If conditions are right, the Western snowy plovers may raise two or even three broods each year, in these vulnerable, sandy nests. These plovers were listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. To help restore their population, the National Park Service closes several beaches on Santa Rosa and other Channel Islands during the breeding season.",

At your feet, scattered across the sand are tiny broken shells, driftwood, a few small rounded rocks, and broken pieces of kelp stalks and leaves. The ocean water near the shore is light turquois blue in color, growing darker blue further from the shore. On the inland side, the beach rises up into shallow, sandy dunes, mounds covered with small green plants. These curve up to meet the base of rock cliffs that tower almost 50 feet above the beach. Tall grass grows at the top of those cliffs. The cliffs follow the curve of Bechers Bay. If you are facing the ocean, to the left, or north, in the distance, is the wooden pier. It is a long narrow platform, supported of tall upright poles, extending a couple of hundred yards out into the ocean. To the right, or southeast, just past the top of the cliff, is a hillside covered with a dark green stand of Torrey pines. Beyond that is Skunk Point, a sandy spit of beach in the far distance.",

In the middle is a pavilion with a metal roof supported by four posts, covering three large signs. Behind the pavilion, against the wall is a metal bench. At the right side of the paved area a sidewalk makes a looping path about 100 yards long in total through meadow-like vegetation. At the far end of the loop are 4 more signs, two at each corner, and another metal bench.<br /><br />The signs under the pavilion discuss nearby trail sites to the east, north-east and west, some of which are included in this app for the Oregon Trail.<br /><br />The signs along the looping sidewalk cover other topics. One titled \"Eye of the Needle\" reads in part, \"The historic junction of three great western frontier trails - the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Trail - is located approximately one-half mile to the north. To the southwest lay the Santa Fe Trail and to the northwest was the road to Oregon and California...Between the late 1830s and the early 1850s, as many as 200,000 emigrants may have passed through this gateway in order to start a new life in the Oregon Territory or to take a chance seeking their fortune in the gold fields of California. During this same period, thousands of freighters loaded with commodities were also rumbling through this junction heading to and from the markets at Santa Fe.\"<br /><br />Another sign titled \"Following Their Dreams\" discusses the various types of travelers who followed these trails. A third sign, titled \"Apprehension and Conflict,\" discusses the impact the large numbers of travelers had on the Indian Nations who lived in the Great Plains Region west of the Missouri River. The final sign is titled \"From Prairie Schooners to Locomotives\" and covers the decline of the trails as railroad lines spread and the transcontinental railroad was completed.",

Troops were assigned to the Little Arkansas and the Stone Corral area in April 1865. It was called Station Little Arkansas. Company G, Third Wisconsin Cavalry, were the first troops to be stationed at the Stone Corral. By early May, 93 men were stationed at the post, most of them from the 2nd U. S. Volunteer Infantry. In June 1865, the 13th Missouri Cavalry was present. There were 185 enlisted men and five officers from the 13th Missouri Cavalry and the 2nd U. S. Volunteer Infantry. In June, 1865, four men were killed by American Indians near Station Little Arkansas. A cholera epidemic also claimed eight men at Station Little Arkansas. All were buried near the south end of the breastworks in the Cottonwood Grove Cemetery at Station Little Arkansas. Later the bodies were exhumed and moved to the Fort Leavenworth Cemetery in 1888 or 1889.<br /> <br /> Peace talks and signing of peace treaties with the American Indians occurred in the fall of 1865. It appears troops were withdrawn from the Little Arkansas post late in 1865. This peaceful situation did not last long as soldiers were again stationed at the Stone Corral site in 1867. At this time the camp was called Camp Grierson, to honor Colonel Benjamin Grierson of the 10th Cavalry. In 1867, the camp was occupied from May to November by Company C of black troops of the 10th Cavalry. This company of some seventy troops constructed dugouts for protection from the American Indians and the weather in the riverbanks of the Little Arkansas. They erected breastworks above the dugouts for protection, which are still visible today.<br /> <br /> During the summer of 2005, a stone was found in a nearby foundation of a fire damaged house that was inscribed with the name of Andrew Welsch of Co. E, 13th MO Cavalry.

Just to the south, the Arkansas River formed the border with Mexico. Traders and travelers required accommodations, supplies, and protection. The Ranch at Cimarron Crossing was established in 1866 by William and Frank Hartwell and several other investors to meet those needs. Later, it was operated by Robert Wright, one of the founders of Dodge City, and A.J. Anthony.  At full force there were 12 armed men at the Cimarron Crossing station.<br /> <br /> The ranch sat in the midst of a vast open plain, covered only with cactus on the higher ground and with grass in the river bottoms as high as a man on horseback. Buffalo could be seen in any direction, and for an hour at a time the river might be heard roaring in the night from the crossing of great herds. Wolves could be heard from darkness until dawn.<br /> <br /> Many Native Americans, such as the Cheyenne, viewed settlements such as the ranch as intrusions onto their homelands. Tension between settlers, traders, and the military increased, including an attack on a wagon train crossing here in June 1867. In 1868, the ranch was abandoned due to the continuous threat of attack from Native Americans.</p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p>The Cimarron City Park is one of the most beautiful parks in Southwest Kansas.

Much of the ranch was turf, including the roof. The roof was laid first of poles, then a layer of buffalo hides and gunny sacks and upon this an eight inch course of dirt or sod. <br /> <br /> The Ranch Complex : Every part of the building was not only secure against fire and weather, but also proof against bullets. It included: the kaavl (corral) was 100 steps square, the main building was 40 by 16 feet and joined a two-story round tower, the corner of the kaavl was a stage driver's lobby and similar tower, the remainder of this enclosure furnished stables for mules, enough water in barrels to withstand a siege, walls that were two feet thick.\"</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.kshs.org/p/the-ranch-at-cimarron-crossing/13237\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

The dead man, friendless and unknown, was wrapped in a blanket by the townsmen and buried where he fell with his boots on. So began Boot Hill. For six years Dodge City had no official cemetery. Persons dying who had friends, enough money, or sufficient standing in the community were buried at Fort Dodge. Others, penniless or unknown were buried where it was convenient to dig a hole.<br /> <br /> Boot Hill, now a part of Dodge City, is the most famous burial ground in all Western lore, even though it was only used until 1878. Two schools were built atop Boot Hill before the Spanish-style City Hall was erected in 1929, which still stands today. <br /> <br /> In front of this historic place stands a cowboy statue. It was created by Dr. O.H. Simpson, a pioneer dentist. Joe Sughrue, and early day lawman, was the model. The marker on the base of the statue commemorates the frontier days of the cattle drives: “On the ashes of my campfire this city is built.”</p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

The fort’s main purpose was to protect Santa Fe Trail travelers from hostilities of local Native American tribes, whose historic lands the travelers were crossing. On June 25, 1851, a newly built fort was officially named Fort Atkinson. The fort was built of sod and was soon dubbed by the soldiers quartered there “Fort Sod,” and later “Fort Sodom.” Field mice were reportedly quite a problem for the troops. Lieutenant Henry Heth, commanding officer, requisitioned a dozen cats from Fort Leavenworth to cope with the problem. Fort Atkinson was abandoned permanently on October 2, 1854, due to its inadequate buildings and supply difficulties. </p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

            "audioDescription": "If you continue on the path beyond the Peace Pole, a natural rock formation is about 50 feet ahead. The formation is an outcrop of brown rock about 30 feet tall at the center. The rocks are heavily weathered, and slope down from the highest point. Standing upright and embedded in the rock are three rusted metal symbols, each about three feet tall. One is a six-pointed star, one is a cross, and one is a crescent with a small star. Around the rock formation is a natural landscape of grasses. In the distance are oaks and views of the hills that surround the monument.",

Martin Luther King, Jr., graduated from Morehouse College, and Morehouse students Lonnie King and Julian Bond organized sit-ins, boycotts, and marches throughout the city. Spelman student Ruby Doris Smith helped lead freedom rides, sit-ins, jail-ins, and voter registration drives. Civil rights leaders <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-web-du-bois-boyhood-homesite-great-barrington.htm\">W.E.B. Du Bois</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/kentucky-whitney-m-young-jr-birthplace.htm\">Whitney Young, Jr.</a>, taught and chaired departments at Atlanta University. Rev. Ralph Abernathy pastored West Hunter when he was head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.</p> <p>Student-organized demonstrations in Atlanta began in March 1960 with 80 well-dressed students and eight well-planned, simultaneous protests. Bond's group staged a sit-in at City Hall's municipal cafeteria, in front of which hung a sign, \"PUBLIC IS WELCOME.\" Lonnie King and 35 protestors trooped to Rich's Department Store. There they were joined by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., who shortly was to experience his first night in an Atlanta jail.</p> <p>Later in the Atlanta movement, student protestors launched a publicity campaign to involve black adults on the periphery--black customers with buying power at Rich's. \"Close out your charge account with segregation,\" urged the students. \"Open up your account with freedom.\" Virtually all the black adults in Atlanta heeded the student slogan, and Rich's felt the pinch.</p> <p>In March 1961, black elders worked out a compromise with city merchants. In exchange for an immediate halt to protests, store managers agreed to integrate their lunch counters, though not until court-ordered school desegregation took effect in September.</p> <p>Within the Atlanta University Center, Stone Hall (now known as Fairchild-Stone Hall), was the focal point of university activities.

This launch is located below Buford Dam, which creates Lake Sidney Lanier, and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Due to the cold water released from the lake tubers are not allowed to put-in at this launch.</p> <h4>Water Quality</h4> <p>Be sure to check the <a href=\"https://www2.usgs.gov/water/southatlantic/ga/bacteria/\">Current Estimated E. coli count</a> before starting your trip. If the count at Medlock Bridge is greater than 235 you have an increased risk of getting sick. Contact with the river is NOT recommended.</p> <h4>Water Release Schedule</h4> <p>Water conditions on the Chattahoochee River are influenced on a daily basis by water releases from Buford Dam. The water release schedule can be obtained by calling <strong>(770) 945-1466</strong>, or toll free <strong>1-855-DAM-FLOW (1-855-326-3569)</strong>, or visit their <a href=\"http://spatialdata.sam.usace.army.mil/hydropower/default.aspx\"><strong>Hydropower Generating Schedule</strong></a> website. Besides showing the time for scheduled releases it also shows how many turbines will be operating and the current flow in cubic feet per second (cfs). It takes less than 15 minutes for water released from Buford Dam to begin rising at Lower Pool Park.</p> <h4>River Flow Rates</h4> <p>Water conditions on the Chattahoochee River are also influenced by the weather upstream of Settles Bridge. Regardless of whether the water is coming from a dam release or inclement weather upstream check the <a href=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/02334430/#parameterCode=00060\">discharge/flow rate</a> at the gaging station below Buford Dam. </p> <ul> <li>If Canoeing, Kayaking, or Stand Up Paddleboarding and the flow rate is over 4,000 cfs, <strong>cancel your trip</strong>. </li> <li>If Rafting and the flow rate is over 5,000 cfs, <strong>cancel your trip</strong>.</li> <li>Float tubes are prohibited on this stretch of the river due to cold water temperatures.</li> </ul> <h4>Try These Floating Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Lower Pool Park</strong> to Settles Bridge: 4.5 miles</li> <li><strong>Lower Pool Park</strong> to McGinnis Bridge: 8.3 miles</li> <li><strong>Lower Pool Park</strong> to Roger Bridge <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>(Temporarily Closed)</strong></span>: 11.2 miles</li> <li><strong>Lower Pool Park</strong> to Abbotts Bridge: 12.8 miles</li> </ul>",

            "bodyText": "<p>One of many traders hauling merchandise over the trail, Frank Huning had concerns about conflicts with American Indians. Apprehensive, he requested a military escort as far as Fort Zarah. It wasn’t granted. When Huning caught sight of Plum Buttes, a Santa Fe Trail landmark with 100-foot sand dunes and wild plum bushes, his worst nightmare came true.<br /> <br /> Huning knew that the area between Cow Creek and the Big Bend of the Arkansas River was dangerous. On this particular trip, he had his mother-in-law and her youngest son, Fritz, in the caravan. The attack came from the southeast. Huning shot the leader, dividing them into two parties. One swept through the center of the train driving four wagons, including his mother-in-law and her son, off the road until they stalled in the deep sand about 200 yards away. Both of Huning’s relatives died during the attack.<br /> <br /> As soon as the American Indians left, Huning and the remainder of the party continued to the trail campsite at Big Bend on the Arkansas River. Later, he accurately established the point of attack as being near Plum Buttes: \"about midways between Cow Creek and the Big Bend of the Arkansas and about fifteen miles from Fort Zarah, twenty five miles from Little Arkansas, and about thirty five miles from Fort Harker.” Huning further states that the attacking party appeared to be members of three tribes: Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapaho.<br /> <br /> Huning returned to the site of the ambush and removed the bodies, which were buried temporarily near Fort Zarah. The next spring on his annual trip east, Huning moved their bodies to Ellsworth, Kansas.</p> <h4>A Different Perspective</h4> <p>American Indians were threatened by traders and travelers on the Santa Fe Trail, who were entering their lands and using their resources. This is not the only story of its type on the trail; there was ongoing conflict throughout the trail era.</p> <h4>Plum Buttes</h4> <p>Plum Buttes, was an important landmark for travelers of the Santa Fe Trail, as they could be seen immediately after crossing Cow Creek. Ultimately they were destroyed by the same force that built them, the Kansas wind.</p> <h4>Site Information </h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/Ralphs-Ruts-and-Plum-Buttes-Massacre-Nov2012.pdf\">Read More: Ralph's Ruts & The Plum Buttes Massacre brochure from the Santa Fe Trail Association </a></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

At this point in their journey, many of the passing wagons needed maintenance and repairs to continue, which they could find at Fort Mann. The Plains tribes opposed the construction of Fort Mann on their lands and its occupation by outsiders, and so conflict arose. As a result, in May of 1847 all but ten of the teamsters left the Fort. The rest followed in June after a particularly intense attack. Abandoned, the Fort fell into disrepair, passing travelers stripping it of wood for cooking. The Indian Battalion of Missouri Volunteers were formed in September in part to once again occupy Fort Mann. The battalion’s destructive interactions with the Pawnee and infighting amongst the men at the Fort created significant controversy that led to an investigation. The Fort was again abandoned by the summer of 1848. In 1850 Fort Atkinson was built a few miles east.</p> <h4>Site Information</h4> <p>Fort Mann no longer stands.

The ruts are well-preserved and a silhouette of oxen pulling a wagon along the trail gives the impression of the trail era.  </p> <h4>Site Information </h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Little-Arkansas-Crossing-Brochure-August-2014.pdf\">Santa Fe Trail Association Little Arkansas Crossing Brochure</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3> <br />  ",

The bottom of Water Canyon, as curves up from here, is filled with line of willow trees. A creek flows down from the canyon, ending in a long, narrow lagoon with olive green colored water, that stretches out toward the sandy shoreline. Lining the sides of the lagoon are tall cattails, with upright stalks and narrow green leaves, and, in season, brown cylindrical spikes, shaped like broom handles. On its approach down into the canyon and the lagoon, the road cuts though the surrounding hillsides, exposing alternating horizontal layers of rocks and sandy soils. Clinging to these rocky surfaces are dudleya, a low-growing, fleshy succulent with a waxy coating, and yellow flowers on a tall thin stalk, in season. The rest of the hillsides are covered in grasses and scrubby brush made up of a variety of plants: Sagebrush, with a thin stalk, with feathery leaves, like dill, and a tall spike at the tip, covered with tiny flowers in spring. Toyon, a small tree with dark green, oval leaves with tiny white flowers in summer and clusters of bright red berries in late fall and early winter. Island buckwheat, with soft rounded grey-green leaves and, in season, pink flowers at the end of slender stalks. Coastal prickly pear, a broad cactus with pancake-shaped leaves covered with thorny spines and, in season, broad yellow flowers.",

It is painted red with a white interior and white fence on either side of the entrance. Trails lead off to the right of the entrance. Behind you is the paved path back to the parking lot, passing a picnic table and restrooms along the way. Directly to the left of the panel a small unpaved path leads around a clump of trees to more exhibits. Text on the panel reads, “The reconstructed Everett Covered Bridge stands as a reminder of a common 1800s Ohio scene. While its original date of construction is uncertain, it is patterned on the 1869 Smith Truss design. In the 19th century, Ohio led the nation with over 2,000 covered bridges, the first built in 1809. The roof and sides protected hard-to-replace wooden floors. Their popularity began to fade in the 1880s with the appearance of more durable iron bridges. Everett Covered Bridge is the only remaining covered bridge in Summit County.” The bottom of the panel has a photograph of the bridge after the great flood of 1913, which closed the Ohio and Erie Canal. The picture shows the bridge leaning at a slight angle as a man stands at its entrance. A few boards are missing from the side of the bridge and the access leading up to it is gone. The caption reads, “While the canal provided transportation to and from the valley, it took improvements like the covered bridge to make travel within the valley more feasible. The 1913 damage was repaired, but a spring storm destroyed the bridge in 1975. School children, local citizens, private organizations, and government agencies joined hands to secure funds for the historically accurate reconstruction, completed in 1986.” End of description.",

For Chester County, these were indeed “the times that tried men’s souls”.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{52e4220e-5ba8-4b9c-8785-6a4f28b70298}{239}\" paraid=\"1513046699\">Joseph and Hannah Hoskins had apparently had enough. By the spring of 1778 they left Chester County, Pennsylvania, following the path many others had taken ahead of them down the Great Wagon Road through western Virginia and into the piedmont of North Carolina.  Here, the land was comparatively cheap and the threat of warfare with the Native American tribes like the Cherokee was no longer an immediate concern.  More importantly, they were moving away from the seat of war!  On the 18th of May, 1778, Joseph Hoskins purchased 150 acres of land “on Horsepen Creek and on both sides of the main road” in Guilford County where the Hoskins’ undoubtedly hoped to begin a new life, free from the travails and ravages of war. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9779d3d-61cd-4d18-a564-c9290b260173}{22}\" paraid=\"23427736\"> <br /> The Hoskins’ farm, described as “a considerable plantation” by Lord Cornwallis, included acres of valuable timber. There were also large cultivated fields surrounded by wooden fences like the “worm fence” you see ahead of you to protect the crops. Livestock was commonly allowed to roam freely and forage for food which sometimes led to damaged crops and lawsuits.  In response, the North Carolina Assembly passed an Act requiring that planters construct sufficient fences to protect both crops and animals from damage. A fence deemed “insufficient” by the Court meant the farmer whose crop had been damaged could not collect reparation from his neighbor and might even find himself liable if the neighbor’s animal was injured as it was chased away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9779d3d-61cd-4d18-a564-c9290b260173}{40}\" paraid=\"1248978709\"> <br /> On the day of battle, these fences would serve a new purpose for the militiamen who lined up along them. They weren’t concerned with the fence stopping cows or pigs. They wanted the fence to stop bullets and British soldiers. <br />  <br /> Consider the fact that all farmers within the thirteen colonies had mixed emotions when they saw the soldiers of either side approaching. Armies “foraged” for food from the countryside, and in the best of times this meant you would be paid for any crops or goods that the army wanted. In the worst of times, both sides were known to take food without compensation. There was also the constant fear of stragglers from either army stealing or committing acts of violence as they passed through, turning the countryside into a war zone. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9779d3d-61cd-4d18-a564-c9290b260173}{72}\" paraid=\"784094844\">The Hoskins farm was only a mile to the west of Guilford Court House along the New Garden Road. The Court House was the center of community life in peacetime, especially during quarterly court sessions. Merchants, traders, artisans, and those who had business with the Court would travel past this plantation to reach the Court House. At the time of the battle, Joseph and Hannah Hoskins lived here with two very young children, Elizabeth and John. Between 1784 and 1797, Joseph Hoskins served as constable, patroller, collector, deputy sheriff, and sheriff of Guilford County. <br />  <br /> Explore the site where the British began the battle of Guilford Courthouse, and learn more about life at the Hoskins Farm by using the park’s Cell Phone Guided Tour and interpretive signs at the farm site. </p>",

Prominent Mexican trader Don Antonio José Chávez, who made his fortune raising sheep and investing in mining and freighting, was murdered by Missouri ruffians during a trip on the Trail. <br /> <br /> Don Antonio José Chávez made two mistakes in 1843 as he set out from Santa Fe for Missouri: the caravan left too early in the season and with too few men. The caravan originally numbered 20 men, two wagons and 55 mules. However, after bitter cold caused frostbite and killed most of the mules, 15 men deserted on the plains. These events put them at a disadvantage when they encountered the Missouri marauders who intended to job the caravans from Mexico loaded with goods and money. <br /> <br /> When the Missourians encountered the Chávez caravan, they captured the traders and marched them away from the wagons so the loot could be divided among the criminals. The leader of the gang decided the group should kill Chávez, and afterward, they found his money belt containing 39 gold doubloons. This initiated another search of the wagon, where the thieves found about $3000 of gold dust in a trunk to split between the remaining members of the gang. The body of the unfortunate Chávez was tossed into the gully of Owl Creek. The murderers were eventually caught and punished for the murder.</p> <h4>Site Information </h4> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/JarvisCreek-August-2014.pdf\">Read more: The Chávez Murder brochure by the Santa Fe Trail Association</a></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h3>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Harada House on Lemon Street in Riverside, California was the focus of a landmark court case brought by the State of California against Jukichi Harada, a Japanese immigrant living in Riverside. The case tested the constitutionality of laws preventing immigrants, primarily from Japan, from owning property in California.<br />  </p> <p>Around 1900, Jukichi Harada emigrated from Japan to the U.S. and in 1903, was joined by his wife, Ken, and their son, Masa Atsu. The family settled in Riverside, California, eventually having several more children and leasing and operating a rooming house and a restaurant. After his five year old son Tadao died of diphtheria while they were living in the rooming house, Harada began to look for a single-family home in a nice neighborhood near the children's school and the family's church. In 1915, he bought a house on Lemon Street five blocks from the family restaurant. The purchase of the house paved the way for the landmark court case <em>The People of State of California vs. Jukichi Harada, Mine Harada, Sumi Harada, and Yoshizo Harada</em>.<br />  </p> <p>At the time that Harada bought the house, California's Webb-Haney Act (also known as the Alien Land Law of 1913) barred \"aliens ineligible for [U.S.] citizenship\" from owning property in the state. The Webb-Haney Act drew, in part, on the Naturalization Act of 1870, which had expanded naturalization (the ability to become a citizen) to people of African descent or those originally from Africa, but not to other non-white immigrants. These other immigrants, primarily from Asia, were considered ineligible for U.S. citizenship and could not become U.S. citizens. This meant that Jukichi Harada, a Japanese immigrant, could not legally own the house on Lemon Street.<br />  </p> <p>Knowing that he was barred from owning property, Harada placed ownership of the house in the names of his three American-born children – Mine, Sumi, and Yoshizo – who were all U.S. citizens. He had bought a small piece of land in Mine's name a few months before and there had been no issues with the ownership, so Harada probably felt safe placing the house in his three children's names. In addition, he wanted to ensure that the children would always have a home.<br />  </p> <p>After the purchase, several of Harada's neighbors in the predominantly white community formed a committee to persuade him to sell the house. Harada refused, saying that it was owned by his American-born children and that he had no legal interest in the property. The committee then approached the California Attorney General's office and asked that Harada be charged with violating the Webb-Haney Act. Although the house had been purchased in the names of Harada's three American-born children, the committee argued that the real purchaser was Jukichi Harada, who had provided the money to buy the property.</p> <p><br /> The State's first complaint was filed in Riverside Superior Court in October 1916, and the first hearings in the case were held in December 1916. The case attracted local, national, and international attention. This was due in part to the relationship between the U.S. and Japan, an emerging international power. In 1907, the two countries had entered in to a formal \"Gentleman's Agreement\" which said that Japan would not issue any passports to Japanese laborers trying to enter the U.S., and the U.S. would not restrict other Japanese immigration. The Agreement was a result of rising anti-Japanese laws and sentiments in California and was meant to reduce tensions between the two countries. The immigration provisions in the Agreement were formalized in a 1911 treaty between the U.S. and Japan. Because of the treaty and the fact that the U.S. had entered World War I in 1917, with Japan as one of its allies, the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. followed the trial closely, feeling that it should not be ignored by the Japanese government.<br />  </p> <p>The trial lasted for two years, with numerous hearings, continuances, and postponements. On September 14, 1918, Judge Hugh Craig of the Riverside Superior Court ruled in favor of the Harada children. Judge Craig upheld the Alien Land Law of 1913, reiterating that aliens ineligible for citizenship could not own land, but ruled that American-born children of aliens were entitled to all the constitutional guarantees of citizenship under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, including land ownership. This meant that the Harada children were the legal owners of the house on Lemon Street. In his opinion Judge Craig stated that \"They [Mine, Sumi, and Yoshizo] are American citizens, of somewhat humble station, it may be, but still entitled to equal protection of the laws of our land...The political rights of American citizens are the same, no matter what their heritage.\"<br />  </p> <p>After the conclusion of the court case, the Harada family continued to own and live in the house until May 23, 1942 when, because of their Japanese ancestry, they were evacuated and relocated to three different U.S. government relocation centers - Tule Lake (California), Poston(Arizona), and Central Utah (Topaz) (Utah). The family had six adult children at the time – Masa Atsu, Sumi, Yoshizo, Mine, Harold, Clark, and adopted son Roy Hashimura. While the family members were interned in the relocation centers Jess Stebler, a family friend, lived in the Lemon Street house, cared for the property, and managed all of the Harada's business affairs. In 1943, Harold, Sumi, and Roy successfully petitioned for a transfer to join their parents at the Central Utah Relocation Center. Ken Harada passed away in 1943, a few days after her three children were transferred, and Jukichi Harada passed away in 1944. Also during the war, Harold and Yoshizo served in the U.S. Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team, one of the most decorated units of World War II.<br />  </p> <p>After the war only Sumi, the youngest daughter, returned to the house in Riverside. She opened it to displaced Japanese American families and provided a place for the internees to rebuild their lives. Sumi continued to live in the house until 1998, when she moved to a nursing home. She owned the house until her death in 2000, at the age of 90. After Sumi's death, her brother Harold inherited the house. Following his death, his heirs transferred the Harada House in 2004, to the City of Riverside under the stewardship of the Riverside Metropolitan Museum.<br />  </p> <p>The house that Jukichi Harada bought in 1915 was a single-story \"saltbox\" cottage with a front and back yard. Harada remodeled the house in 1916, adding a second story with four bedrooms, a bathroom, an open front porch, a small garden with vegetables and water plants, and a small concrete fishpond. In the 1940s, the dining room was modified, resulting in a lowered ceiling. Today, the Harada House looks much the same as it did when it was remodeled in 1916. Some of the interior features remain in place including the note Harold Harada wrote on a bedroom wall when the family was forced to leave the house for the relocation centers – \"Evacuated on May 23, 1942 Sat. 7am.\" In addition, artifacts from the house and collections of papers and articles have been inventoried and preserved by the Riverside Metropolitan Museum. The Museum is in the process of preserving the house and plans to open it to the public.<br /> <br /> The Harada House, a National Historic Landmark, is located at 3356 Lemon St. Riverside, CA. For more information on the Harada House, visit the <a href=\"http://www.riversideca.gov/museum/\">Riverside Metropolitan Museum</a> website. In 2020, the City of Riverside received a $500,000 grant from the <a href=\"https://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures program</a> for the rehabilitation of this historic property. This grant program is funded by the Historic Preservation Fund managed by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1623/index.htm\">State, Tribal, Local, Plans & Grants Division </a>of the National Park Service.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "You are standing in the campground, near the wide mouth of a canyon. The campground is in a field of grass, nestled between two hills dotted with scrubby shrubs. At the southern edge of the campground is a creek that runs at the base of the canyon. A distant view of the ocean can be seen beyond the mouth of the canyon. At the lowest part of the campground, if you are facing up-canyon, the restroom building is on your right. A short cement sidewalk leads up toward this single-story wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof. The roof has two solar panels on the roof. One is a solar hot water panel—a grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building’s left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters—three-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side. A wooden plaque with a sign that reads, Please help protect our wildlife. Please do not rinse dishes, brush teeth, or use soap at the water faucets. Please wash dishes at the large sink next to bathroom. Thank you.",

            "audioDescription": "This fourth exhibit in a series of four is titled “Journey of Injustice,” and contains an illustration that depicts the overland journey of the Cherokee from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory. A map shows several routes taken by the Cherokee during the Trail of Tears, but highlights the Bell Route. There are three other exhibits to your left. [Text] In 1835, a small group of Cherokee signed the controversial Treaty of New Echota, leading to the removal of over 15,000 Cherokee from their homelands. A sense of indescribable sadness and foreboding hovered over the Cherokee people as they were removed from their cherished homelands. Due to the raw emotions, illness, and death along the way, the journey became known as the Trail of Tears. Years in the making, the tragic journey began in October 1838. Both state and federal officials wanted the Cherokee removed to the west. The panel shows men, women and children wrapped in long coats and blankets traveling via covered wagon, horseback, but mostly on foot across a barren winter field. A man and woman kneel on the ground next to a baby wrapped in a red blanket. The woman is bent over, her head near the ground, her straw hat next to her. The man removes his hat and reaches toward the deceased infant. Other Cherokee gather round—two men on horseback and a half dozen others watch the kneeling couple. Two women—one an African American—and a child walk away. The Cherokee woman looks down toward the child whose face is sad. Others in the background huddle around fires and wagons covered in canvas. The Cherokee’s clothing varies from simple and unadorned to decorative and multi-colored. A Cherokee man in the foreground looks straight at the viewer. He wears a dark blue turban with red pattern and trim. His hunting frock is blue with pale fringe. He has several silver loop earrings in each ear and a silver nose ring. His lips are pursed, his brow furrowed, his eyes glaring. The panel map highlights the route from Tennessee to Oklahoma followed by John Bell and a group of over 600, including treaty supporters. It shows where Bell crossed the Natchez Trace. The highway near here is the actual Bell Route on the Trail of Tears. Other groups of Cherokee followed different routes over land and water. The Water Route and Benge, Bell, Drane, and Deas-Whiteley routes are marked on the map. All of the panels in this shelter have a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway.",

            "audioDescription": "This exhibit, titled “The Trail Where They Cried,” contains an illustration that depicts the overland journey of Cherokee from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory. A map shows several routes followed by the Cherokee. You are standing at the corner of the parking area looking into a grove of trees toward the Cherokee removal route. The Parkway is to your left. [Text] In 1838, the Cherokee living in the Southeast faced the combined weight of hostile federal and state policies. Forcible removal from their traditional homeland became a fearful, tearful reality. In the aftermath of hardships suffered by Cherokee who had already traveled west, tribal leaders managed their own removal plans. The illustration shows men, women and children wrapped in long coats and blankets traveling via covered wagon, horseback, but mostly on foot across a barren winter field. A man and woman kneel on the ground next to a baby wrapped in a red blanket. The woman is bent over, her head near the ground, her straw hat next to her. The man removes his hat and reaches toward the deceased infant. Other Cherokee gather round—two men on horseback and a half dozen others watch the kneeing couple. Dozens of others in the background huddle around fires and wagons covered in canvas. Four women—one an African American—and a child walk away. One woman is dressed in a long hooded cape over a bonnet with ribbon tied under her chin. An ornamented bag with shoulder strap hangs on her hip. She looks down toward the child whose face is sad. The African American woman carries a large bundle against her chest, her apron is tattered and mud spattered. The two other Cherokee women carry large baskets. Two mounted soldiers watch from the left side of the painting. On the right there is a covered wagon pulled by oxen—their backbones and ribs are clearly visible. A man wearing a slouch hat, a sash with a black, red, and blue geometric design, and an ornamental belt walks ahead of the wagon. A Cherokee man in the foreground looks straight at the viewer. He wears a dark blue turban with red pattern and trim. His hunting frock is blue with pale fringe. He has several silver loop earrings in each ear and a silver nose ring. His lips are pursed, his brow furrowed, his eyes glaring. The panel map shows the routes, over both land and water, taken by Cherokee groups during Indian removal. John Benge led one detachment of about 1,100 fellow Cherokee across the Natchez Trace near here. On September 29, 1838, John Benge and George Lowrey reported conditions among the Cherokee in their group: “ ... [M]any of them, say at least two thirds are in a destitute condition and in want of shoes, clothing and blankets.” The exhibit panel has a black band across the top.

Nearby Fort Deposit was a supply depot for troops clearing the Trace in 1801-1802, and troops were assembled here during the Burr conspiracy allegedly to separate the western states from the Union. The site takes its name from a nearby water mill.<br /> <br /> The half mile-long trail to the left of the wooden sign takes you to the Old Trace and Grindstone Ford. Boatmen, also known as Kaintucks, on foot or horseback crossed here, northbound, after floating cargo down to Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans and Natchez, Mississippi. Soldiers splashed across from the north to protect the Natchez District from British and Spanish threats during the War of 1812. For post riders, American Indians, and preachers, Bayou Pierre was the line between two nations.<br /> <br /> Daniel Burnett's stand stood near here. Burnett was the speaker of the Territorial House of Representatives, a principal negotiator with the Choctaws, and a framer of the state constitution but his stand was unpretentious. His guests supped on mush and milk in a room filled with their own gear and Burnett's supplies. From here you may follow their path along the Old Trace to Grindstone Ford.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional Information.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/war-of-1812-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">War of 1812 on the Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> This site is not accessible to vehicles taller than 11 feet in height.",

Her scholarship and activism are nationally significant in American legal history and the women’s and civil rights movements. She served as a bridge figure between American social movements through her advocacy for both women’s and civil rights.<br /> <br /> Pauli Murray’s efforts were critical to retaining “sex” in Title VII, a fundamental legal protection for women against employment discrimination. Her innovative and imaginative solutions to long-standing disputes within the women’s movement paved the way for the movement to champion all aspects of women’s legal equality. <br /> <br /> She was known as a mother to feminist legal strategy and has been acknowledged as such by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. On the vanguard of Black activists in the 1940s, she advanced the cause of equal rights for African Americans by experimenting and promoting nonviolent types of activism that would become mainstays of the later civil rights crusade. After decades of work for Black civil rights, her vision for a civil rights association for women became the National Organization for Women (NOW). In 1977, she became the first ordained African-American female priest in the Episcopal Church.<br /> <br /> As a young person, Murray struggled with her gender identity and sexual orientation. She later found loving same-gender relationships foundational to her life. Discrimination she faced because of her sexual orientation informed her work in civil rights.<br /> <br /> As she did not maintain a long-term residence or office, this home is the only extant building closely associated with her life. Beginning in 1914, when Murray went to live with her grandparents and her aunts in Durham, until 1948, when her aunts moved to Brooklyn to reside with her, Murray’s time here imbued her with fortitude, resilience, and a propensity for extraordinary achievement. Her writings and personal correspondence indicate her strong emotional connection to the property.<br /> <br /> The Pauli Murray Family Home was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 23, 2016.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/news/LC/fall2016/PauliMurrayFamilyHome.pdf\">Link to file </a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl\">National Historic Landmarks Homepage</a><br /> <br /> A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/civilrightsgrant\">African American Civil Rights Grant Program</a>, which works to document, interpret, and preserve the sites and stories related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights, funded work to restore the Pauli Murray Family Home. The project focused on repairing and replacing materials on the exterior of the building to make the site visitor-ready and highlight Murray's contributions to twentieth-century civil, women’s and LGBTQ rights history.</p>",

Mather was an avid outdoorsman, conservationist, born marketer, and millionaire industrialist with connections in Washington, DC. In 1914 Mather began to campaign for the creation of a park management bureau. When President Woodrow Wilson approved the National Park Act in 1916, the National Park Service was born.<br /> <br /> Mather was appointed the agency’s first director.Stephen T. Mather was one of the first and best advocates of the National Park System. He wanted to not only protect the lands but promote them. He recognized that every visitor was a potential steward.

Orville Wright and Amelia Earhart were among the 3,000 people in attendance.</p> <h3>Determining the Location</h3> <p>Identifying the exact location of the takeoff was problematic because the topography of the site had shifted in the years following the Wrights' experiments. On November 4, 1928, Captain William Tate organized a meeting of three of the four surviving witnesses to determine the point of takeoff.<br /> <br /> Using Orville Wright's account of the flight, Will Dough, Adam Etheridge, and Johnny Moore identified the approximate location of takeoff. Tate described their methods at the marker's dedication ceremony:<br /> <br /> > Dough, Etheridge, Moore and I assembled here and I explained to them the importance of arriving at a definite conclusion with respect to the spot where the Wright brothers' airplane, in making its first successful flight, first began to move along the ground. We located the four corners of the building in which the machine was housed...We took into consideration what Mr. Orville Wright said about it in his article How We Made Our First Flight. We had a compass with us and we were sure of our compass course. After considering all these things and talking it over these three men proceeded by themselves to come out here on this point and select the spot on which this magnificent boulder stands and said that this was the spot where the Wright airplane started its first successful flight...After agreeing upon this exact spot we signed a paper to that effect...</p> <h3>The 25th Anniversary</h3> <p>An important first step in the realization of the Wright Brothers National Memorial occurred on December 17, 1928, when 200 delegates from the International Civil Aeronautics Conference and more than 3,000 visitors dedicated a granite marker placed at the approximate location of the 1903 liftoff, and laid the cornerstone of the monument to be placed on Big Kill Devil Hill. Among those in attendance were Orville Wright and Amelia Earhart.</p> <h3>Launch Rail (Reproduction)</h3> <p>The launching rail is a reproduction of the rail the brothers used to launch their flyer on December 17, 1903.<br /> <br /> The original rail the brothers installed consisted of four 15-foot 2x4s standing on the long edge. The reproduction is the same, with the addition of metal on top to preserve the wooden structure.</p>",

Four years later, they led protests resulting in \"The Orangeburg Massacre,\" which pointed out that passage of the Act was not the end of the struggle. The South Carolina State College Historic District is the core of the historic campus at South Carolina State University. The district consists of ten brick Classical Revival style academic buildings constructed between 1917 and 1969, which housed classrooms, laboratories, the library, offices, and the law school. The district also includes a 1920s landscaped square with a 1969 monument erected and dedicated to the memory of three students who lost their lives in the Orangeburg Massacre of February 8, 1968.</p> <p>Orangeburg, South Carolina, was one of 40 cities that experienced student protests in March 1960. After several weeks of unsuccessful protests at city lunch counters, South Carolina State's Charles McDew led 1,000 marchers downtown. Police, firemen, and state troopers intercepted the students, firing tear gas and full-pressure water hoses into the crowd. Police arrested nearly 400 students.</p> <p><strong>\"The Orangeburg Movement\"</strong> Like the Birmingham Campaign a few months earlier, Orangeburg's mass movement focused on desegregating public facilities. On July 31, 1963, a South Carolina State student launched the movement by refusing to leave a local restaurant. Three weeks later, movement leaders demanded that City Council desegregate public accommodations, comply with court-ordered school desegregation, and expand job opportunities for African Americans. Mass demonstrations, which by now included children, continued until the passage of the Civil Rights Act on June 2, 1964.</p> <p><strong>\"The Orangeburg Massacre\"</strong> On February 8, 1968, two days after police and students clashed in a race riot at segregated <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-carolina-all-star-bowling-lane.htm\">All Star Bowling Lanes</a>, violence broke out again, this time on the campus of South Carolina State. Students set grassfires and tried to burn down a vacant house. A highway patrolman was hit in the face by a bannister from the house, and a number of patrolmen suddenly fired into a crowd of students, killing three and injuring 27. Statues of the students who died--Samuel Hammond, Henry Smith, and Delano Middleton--were later erected on campus. In the first federal trial of police officers for using excessive force at a campus protest, all nine defendants were acquitted.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

            "bodyText": "<h3>A Place of History and Nature</h3> <p>People and animals have a tendency to return to the same place over and over again, generation after generation. Quitobaquito Spring is no different. Some of the artifacts found in the area date back approximately 16,000 years, and Quitobaquito has been occupied ever since by many people and cultures. It is also the home of endangered species and is a place that remains a challenge to manage to preserve and protect the history and habitat that is unique to Quitobaquito.</p> <h3>Getting There</h3> Quitobaquito is located 14 miles west on South Puerto Blanco Drive, which is a two way road that parallels the international border. This is a dirt and gravel road, but is designed for a passenger car. Be aware that road can have some very wash-boarded sections, creating a bumpy ride. Quitobaquito can be reached either from South Puerto Blanco Drive off of Highway 85, or by driving the North Puerto Blanco Drive.  <h3>What's in a Name?</h3> <p>The origin of the name \"Quitobaquito\" has been lost to history. It is thought to be a corruption of the Spanish and O'odham languages. Some possible meanings are <em>small spring</em>, <em>watering place</em>, a reference to the Mexican town of <em>Quitovac</em>, or <em>look out (or get away) little cow. </em>The O'odham people know Quitobaquito Springs as \"A'al Vaipia.\"</p>   <figure><img alt=\"quitobaquito pithouse, circa 1920s\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/images/pithouse2.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"quitobaquito pithouse, circa 1920s\" /> <figcaption>Native American pithouse at Quitobaquito circa 1920s. <p>NPS PHOTO</p> </figcaption> </figure> <h3>The Early People</h3> <p>The area around Quitobaquito is associated with a prehistoric trade route known as the Old Salt Trail. Ancient cultures used this route to obtain salt, obsidian, seashells, and other commodities from the salt beds of Sonora, Mexico.</p> <p>The spring is also part of the historic homeland of American Indians. The Hia C-ed O'odham and the Tohono O'odham both lived at Quitobaquito. Today, the Tohono O'odham have a reservation just east of the Ajo Mountains, approximately 30 miles from Quitobaquito. Their ancestors lived and subsisted here for hundreds and even thousands of years.</p> <p>Prehistoric becomes historic when people start keeping records.</p> <p>In 1698, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino wrote about visiting the spring, which he named San Sergio. After arriving in Mexico in 1683, Father Kino established 24 missions in 24 years, the closest being in present-day Sonoyta, Mexico.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"trading coin from Dorsey's store at quitobaquito\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/images/coin-web.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"trading coin from Dorsey's store at quitobaquito\" /> <figcaption>Trading coin from Dorsey's store at Quitobaquito, circa 1880s. <p>NPS Photo</p> </figcaption> </figure> <h3>Residents of the Oasis</h3> <p>Quitobaquito has had many colorful residents. Andrew Dorsey arrived in the early 1860s, opened a store, dug the pond deeper and built an earthen dam to create a bigger water source. He also dug irrigation ditches to water his pomegranate and fig trees. Dorsey lived in the area until the 1890s. In 1887, a former Texas Ranger named Jefferson Davis Milton was hired to establish a United States customs and immigration station at Quitobaquito.</p> <p>Milton mined for gold and silver in the area and established the Milton Mine that you can visit in the monument today. Around 1903, local rancher Thomas Childs Jr. arrived and rebuilt Dorsey's dam and irrigation ditches. Among other crops, he started to grow watermelons.</p> <p>On April 13, 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the proclamation creating Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Around 1947, the pond at Quitobaquito was approximately 2 feet deep, and covered an area up to a half acre. More than 4,000 feet of irrigation ditches existed, providing water to at least 8 fig trees and 22 pomegranate trees.</p> <p>On July 8, 1957, Jim Orosco sold all remaining private land at Quitobaquito to the National Park Service for $13,000. The Orosco family of Hia C-ed O'odham decent, is believed to be the longest-term resident family at Quitobaquito, living there from 1887 to 1957.</p> <p>In 1961 the National Park Service removed all old structures from the site and drained and deepened the pond. A parking lot and trails were built to accommodate visitors. The area was fenced, and cattle guards were added to discourage livestock grazing.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"researcher holding sonoyta mud turtle\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/images/turtle-1.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"researcher holding sonoyta mud turtle\" /> <figcaption>Researcher holding a baby Sonoyta mud turtle. <p>NPS Photo</p> </figcaption> </figure> <h3>Managing for Today and Beyond</h3> <p>Drought conditions from the mid-1990s to 2006 caused moderate fluctuations in the pond level. In 2007 it was determined that there was also large-scale leakage from the pond. Corrective actions were taken over the next few years including bulrush removal, partial pond and berm renovation. All of these actions were designed to protect and preserve the pond and the habitat of its inhabitants such as the endangered Quitobaquito pupfish.</p> <p>The pond is also the home of the Quitobaquito spring snail, the Sonoyta mud turtle and the desert caper plant. This is the only spot in the United States where these species can be found naturally occurring. The desert caper supports the caper butterfly (<em>ascia Howarthi</em>) that is only found coexisting with the plant. The Quitobaquito spring snails are so small that they are hard to find. You can sometimes spot the snail, about the size of a grain of black pepper, in the spring-fed streams serving the pond. Quitobaquito is also the only place where the Sonoyta mud turtle is found in the United States and has been deemed a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A small, shallow pond, about 50 feet long by 25 feet wide. The pond is lined with reeds and a small dirt trail. Further surrounding the pond is a mix of mesquite, palo verde, iron wood, cottonwood trees and other smaller, thorny shrubs. A large cottonwood grows on the northern edge of the pond. Leading into the pond is a skinny, cement channel that runs from the natural spring about 0.1 miles west of the pond. The surrounding area is hilly desert land, with the border wall rising to the south. In the pond live small, 1 or 2 inch long fish called Quitobaquito pupfish. The males are a bright blue color while the females are a duller gray. Small Sonoyta mudturtles bask on small sticks or stick their noses out of the water. A family of American Coots visits and lives in the pond every spring.",

            "bodyText": "<h4>Hiking Conditions & Precautions</h4> <br /> Catoctin Mountain Park is a fun and exciting place to explore. Chimney Rock is one of the most popular hiking destinations with spectacular views of the valley below. However, please be advised that jumping across the rocks is extremely dangerous. <b>People are seriously injured at Chimney Rock on a frequent basis</b>. The size of the gaps between rocks is very deceptive, so please do not attempt to jump these hazard areas!<br /> <br /> Use caution while hiking. Many of the trails are rocky and uneven. Wear sturdy shoes or hiking boots and watch where you're going to avoid slips, falls, and possible strains and sprains. Dress for the weather. Wear layers of clothing in cold weather and carry water while hiking in all seasons. Pick up a park map at the visitor center before exploring the trails or download one from this website.<br /> <br /> Poison Ivy is a common plant in the park and many people suffer an itchy rash after contact. It has 3 shiny dark leaves and also can be a thick hairy vine.<br />   <h4>Wildlife</h4> <br /> Close encounters with wildlife should be avoided. The speed limit throughout the park is 30 mph. This speed will help you enjoy the scenery and watch wildlife and lessen the chance of a collision with the resident wildlife. Deer in particular often travel in groups so if you see one cross the road, slow down and look for another to soon follow behind. Black bears also inhabit the park, so if you happen to encounter one be sure to maintain a resepctful distance. Slowly back away in the direction you came if you see a bear walking on the trail. When camping be sure to secure your food items properly to avoid attracting wildlife.<br /> <br /> There are two venomous snakes found in the park: the copperhead and the timber rattlesnake. Please remember that all wildlife have a role in the ecosystem and are protected from harassment and harm. These snakes will only strike when threatened and/or provoked.<br /> <br /> Ticks are also found in the park. The small deer tick which can carry Lyme Disease, and the dog tick which can carry Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Long sleeve shirts, long pants, socks, and a hat offer good protection. Check your entire body after a visit to make sure you didn't take home any unwanted travelers! <h3>In case of emergency call Emergency Dispatch at:<br /> 1-866-677-6677 or dial 911</h3> <br /> Do not rely on cellular phones as not all types work in the park. Check your coverage to be sure you are covered!<br /> <br /> If you have any questions or concerns, please just ask a park ranger or call the visitor center at (301) 663-9388.",

In 1879 the town established the first organized school in the country with the title \"School District No. 1.\" Many different structures were used a schoolhouses such as sod dug outs, and the Saint Francis hotel. Due to many first settlers being born into slavery a large importance was put upon education especially reading and writing. Within a few years many settler's were literate with two news papers being printed within the town. The current school house was built in 1918 before closing in the 1960s due low enrollment numbers. The building was purchased by the American Legion in 1983. ",

            "bodyText": "<p>How does this cobble beach compare to Sand Beach, where this hike started? An easy difference to spot is in the names of the beaches: one beach is made of <i>sand</i>, and one beach is made of <i>cobbles</i>. In geology, these words are used to describe the size of pieces of rocks, also known as “grain size.” Grain size, in addition to grain roundness, help tell geologists about what kind of journeys rocks have been on.<br /> <br /> At this cobble beach, we can observe the size and roundness of these cobbles to learn more about the beach. The cobbles are large, meaning that they haven’t moved very far. Because their size makes them heavy, it is difficult for waves to pick them up and take them somewhere else. The cobbles are also round, which tells us that they are being smoothed as waves carry them up and down the beach, rolling the cobbles against each other and knocking off any sharp or broken edges.<br /> <br /> If we took a dump truck of sand from Sand Beach and poured it onto this cobble beach, it would wash away very quickly! This beach is not protected by any landforms and gets hammered with waves all day. Only the cobbles remain because their larger size makes them resistant to these strong waves. Because most of Acadia’s shoreline is exposed to direct waves, there are many other cobble beaches in the park – when you encounter cobble beaches, it’s important to leave the cobbles where you find them. It helps preserve the beach for future visitors to enjoy, lets cobbles stabilize the shoreline, and protects tiny ecosystems that live in the crevices of the rocks.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Delaware’s borders with its neighbors have been the subject of much dispute and confusion, including up into the present era. A disagreement with New Jersey over a planned natural gas terminal on the Jersey side of the Delaware river in 2007 for example, which the First State saw as an encroachment on Delaware’s land, led to the Delaware state legislature (half-jokingly) considering a bill to call up the Delaware National Guard to defend the border.<br /> <br /> The section of the border with Pennsylvania is probably the source of some of the most confounding problems when it came to determining where exactly the First State began. Starting with the establishment of the proprietary colony of Pennsylvania in 1681, disagreements over borders were born. In 1682, to solve part of the dispute, a 12-mile radius from New Castle was to delineate the northern border of Delaware. However, this seemingly simple solution proved to be anything but. The center point of this circle was not clearly set, and it wasn’t until 1750 that the cupola of the Court House in New Castle was designated as the official center. Further, surveying technology in the Colonial era was lacking in sophistication, and the “Twelve-mile circle” as the arc became known was usually more of an approximation during the 1700s than a hard reality. Given that Delaware was administratively a part of the Province of Pennsylvania, albeit with its own colonial legislature, the unclear border did not cause significant problems, for the time being. The biggest snag was the intersection of the Twelve-mile circle with the border of Maryland. With Colonial surveyors not up to the task, this issue was one of the factors that led to the hiring of the English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, who established the famed “Mason-Dixon” line between Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, commonly seen as the line demarcating the North from the South.  <br /> <br /> Following Delaware’s declaration of independence from both the British Empire and Pennsylvania in 1776, the disputed border issue became a hotter topic. Several attempts to definitively survey the Twelve-mile circle took place throughout the 1800s, with the last and most conclusive being that of Captain W. C. Hodgkins of the Office of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1892. Hodgkins’ survey produced the stone boundary marker you are looking at. His surveyed arc has larger terminal markers at the points where the circle intersects the current border with Maryland and at the shore of the Delaware river. Every mile there is a marker with a “P” on the Pennsylvania side, and a “D” on the opposite, with a mile count from the initial point. In addition, there are markers every half-mile, with a “1/2” inscribed on the West facing side. The marker in front of you is one of these ½ mile markers from Hodgkins’ survey.<br /> <br /> Hodgkins’ work firmly established the arc of the Twelve-mile circle and is now the official demarcation for most of the border between the First State and the Keystone State. Delaware’s strange borders continue to be a source of dispute, as well as interesting historical stories. Think about where you live. How where the borders of your hometown, state, or country formed? How might they have been drawn differently? What does this tell us about the nature of human-made borders? These are questions we may not think about very often, but which can have a huge impact on our lives.",

There is evidence the Smedley family constructed a home near this location, however it is unclear whether any portion of that original 17th century structure remains within the 18th century home.</p> <p>Throughout the late 17th and early 18th century the land changed hands several times before the Jones family purchased it in 1724. Over the course of fifty years the Jones family built and maintained a prosperous farm and blacksmith shop on the property. In 1740, Thomas Jones constructed the house on the east side of what is now Monument Street, which stands today. When Thomas Jones died in 1774, the property passed to his son Elisha.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Elisha Jones and the “Bullet Hole House”</h3> <p>Elisha Jones, the fourth son of Thomas and Mary Jones, inherited the land, home, and Blacksmithing business in 1774. While the dark clouds of war gathered on the horizon, the Jones family prospered on the sunny banks of the Concord River. Elisha married Elizabeth Farrar in 1770. Four years later the couple moved into the family house where they would raise their six children.</p> <p>During the pre-revolutionary period, Elisha was an active member of the colonial militia and eventually became a lieutenant in the Concord Light Infantry Company. According to early histories of Concord, Jones helped to hide provincial military supplies from British forces on April 19, 1775. On that fated April morning the Elisha Jones house also made its way into the annals of history. According to local legend, as the British army made its retreat from the fight at the North Bridge, a soldier fired his musket at Elisha Jones, who stood watching the scene unfold from near his home. The shot missed Jones, but a musket ball left its mark in the facade of the western shed, earning the home its famous nickname, “the bullet hole house.”</p> <p>It is not known why Elisha did not muster with the town militia that morning, but he did take up arms for the patriot cause later in the war. Records indicate Elisha enlisted for service with Captain Joseph Hosmer’s company in 1776, and again with Hosmer’s Light Infantry Company in 1778. After the war Jones returned to his family and home, living in Concord until his death on April 10, 1810.</p> <p>Following his father’s death, James Jones took over the beloved home. He continued in Elisha’s footsteps and maintained the family blacksmithing legacy well into the 19th century. When James died in 1838, the majority of the Jones property was sold; however, nephew Nathan Barrett did take over the family farm. By 1863 old age and neglect had ravaged the old house, and despite its history, the Barrett family saw fit to sell the property to U.S. Marshall, John Shepard Keyes.</p> <p> </p> <h3>The Keyes Era:</h3> <p>John Shepard Keyes was born in Concord on September 19, 1821 and grew up in the company of such famous individuals as Henry Thoreau. An ambitious young man Keyes operated a law office at his father’s firm in Concord after graduating Harvard Law school in 1844. Nearly a decade later, in 1853, Keyes was elected sheriff of Middlesex County. He later served as a U.S. Marshal for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from 1860-1867.</p> <p>During his time as a U.S. Marshal, a sectional crisis unfolded and the American Civil War gripped the young nation. A devout republican, Keyes supported the election of Abraham Lincoln and commanded a security detachment tasked with protecting the president at the inauguration in 1860. Keyes’ duties during the Civil War also included, “…investigating all sorts of reports of rebel spies, contraband goods, and letters and communications from southern sympathizers.” In 1863 Keyes escorted the famed Massachusetts’s orator Edward Everett to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At the dedication of the Gettysburg Soldiers National Cemetery on November 19, 1863 Keyes led Everett to the speaker’s platform and later watched from only yards away as Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.</p> <p>Earlier that same year Keyes bought the Elisha Jones House as a birthday gift for his wife Martha, with whom he had six children; four who survived into adulthood. Returning to Concord after the Civil War, Keyes poured his attention into renovating the dilapidated home. During the process, Keyes wrote the first history of the “Bullet hole House”, actively shaping the historical memory of what happened in Concord on April 19, 1775. In his romanticized history of the house, Keyes told of the famed bullet hole and the patriot valor at the North Bridge. Keyes also enthusiastically participated in the nation’s first centennial celebration, serving as the chairman of the Minute Man Monument Committee in 1874. Under his leadership, the committee raised money and commissioned Danial Chester French to sculpt the now iconic Minute Man Statue. On April 19, 1875 Keyes had the pleasure of unveiling the monument to a massive crowd, which included President Ulysses S. Grant. Keyes continued to participate in town politics well into his golden years.</p> <p>Upon his death in 1910, the Elisha Jones house passed to John Shepard Keyes’ daughters Alicia M. Keyes, and Annie Emerson. Unfortunately, the sisters did not hold onto their father’s beloved house for very long. When Alicia Keyes died in 1924, Annie sold the home to World War I veteran Henry Fray. Mr. Fray lived in the home until 1963 at which time the National Park Service purchased the historic structure.</p> <p> </p> <h3>The National Park Era:</h3> <p>In 1963, the National Park Service purchased the Elisha Jones property and began restoring elements of the structure to its 1775 appearance. Today, the Elisha Jones house still stands just yards from the North Bridge. A small piece of glass also protects the famed bullet hole on the home’s western facade.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <p> </p> <ul> <li>James J.

            "bodyText": "<p>Leading from the Beehive towards Sand Beach, a freshwater stream approaches the beach to meet the ocean. Areas like these ones are called estuaries: where freshwater from rivers and streams mix with saltwater as it meets the ocean. When water mixes like this (freshwater + saltwater), it is sometimes known as “brackish” water. Estuarine waters are usually protected from the harsh waves of the ocean by beaches, barrier islands, or even reefs. This one is protected by Sand Beach and Old Soaker beyond it.<br /> <br /> Estuaries are important natural places. They are incredibly productive environments, giving life and habitat to many different animals. Many species of fish rely on estuaries for habitat: where they live, eat, and have offspring. Because so many fish call estuaries home, these locations also become useful areas for birds that eat the fish. Estuaries are especially important to birds during migration season when they need a place to stop, rest, and eat.<br /> <br /> Estuaries are very delicate, so be gentle as you explore this area. Keep your eye out for fish, grasses, and birds – all common to estuarine ecosystems.</p>",

Acadia National Park and Mount Desert Island were not spared during this extremely dry year that saw more than 200,000 acres burn statewide in Maine.<br /> <br /> The local fire departments first received a report of smoke rising from the cranberry bogs nearby the local dump outside Bar Harbor in the afternoon of Friday October 17<sup>th</sup>, 1947. The direct cause of the fire is unknown but by<i> </i>October 21<sup>st</sup>, strong winds fanned the flames and the blaze spread rapidly quickly getting out of control engulfing over 2,000 acres on the eastern side of Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> <i></i>October 23<sup>rd</sup> saw the winds shift the fire’s trajectory towards the communities of Hulls Cove and Bar Harbor.<i> </i>The fire destroyed 67 seasonal estates along Bar Harbor’s famous “Millionaires’ Row” as well as 170 permanent homes and five large hotels in the area around downtown Bar Harbor.<br /> <br /> Local fisherman from nearby communities assisted with a mass evacuation of at least 400 people to safety by boat because all the roads leading out of Bar Harbor blocked by flames.  Eventually a path through Route 3 was bulldozed allowing cars carrying 2,000 people to journey to safety off the island.<br /> <br /> The fire continued to burn until it was declared under control on October 27<sup>th</sup>. Even weeks later, after rain and snow had fallen, the fire still smoldered below ground. The fire was not pronounced completely extinguished until November 14, nearly one month after it began. In the end, 17,188 acres burned on Mount Desert Island—10,000 of those acres in Acadia National Park.<br /> <br /> The majority of the Satterlee Estate was destroyed in the fire of 1947. Eleanor Satterlee came to visit for the summer of 1948. In 1949, the decision was made by the two Satterlee daughters, Eleanor and Mabel to donate the estate, all of Sand Beach and Great Head, to the National Park Service. They did so in honor of their mother Louisa, so this land would be protected in perpetuity for future generations of visitors to explore.<br /> <br /> The lasting effects from the fire are visible today. While the national park did conduct some salvage efforts and selective plantings to prevent soil erosion, most of the island’s restoration was undertaken by nature. Wind carried seeds back to burned areas. As you drive the park loop road notice the change in vegetation types that is especially visible on the sides of the mountains. Spruce and fir that reigned before the fire have given way to sun-loving trees, such as birch and aspen. But these deciduous trees (trees with leaves) are short-lived. As they grow and begin to shade out the forest floor, they provide a nursery for the shade-loving spruce and fir (native conifers or needle bearing tree species) that may eventually reclaim the territory.<br /> <br /> Fire has an important role in nature. It clears away mature growth, opening areas to the sun-loving species that are food for wildlife. The fire of 1947 increased diversity in the composition and age structure of the park's forests. It even enhanced the scenery. Today, instead of one uniform evergreen forest, we are treated to a brilliant mix of red, yellow, and orange supplied by the new diverse deciduous forests.",

            "bodyText": "In 1900, the wealthy financier J.P. (John Pierpont) Morgan purchased 117 acres, including all of Sand Beach and Great Head as a wedding gift for his oldest child and daughter Louisa Peirpont Morgan’s (1866-1946) wedding. Louisa married Herbert Satterlee (1863-1947) in New York City on November 15th, 1900. Louisa and Herbert had two daughters, Mabel born in 1901 and Eleanor born in 1905. The two daughters grew up exploring the landscape and making connections to the rockbound coast of Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> Construction of the Satterlee Estate buildings commenced in 1911. The Satterlees began summering at their summer estate named ‘Satterlee Field’ that very summer. The first summer for the Satterlees was certainly filled with adventure. The estate grounds and buildings provided safe shelter for the displaced crew of the shipwrecked Schooner Tay that wrecked on Old Soaker and was washed ashore onto Sand Beach, as discussed during the second stop on this hike. According to a park conducted interview with one of the estate superintendents children , Dayton Salisbury, the <i>“Staff on the estate included 2 chauffeurs,, 2 cooks, a kitchen girl, a parlor maid, a ladies maid, the housekeeper and 5 local men working on the grounds.”</i><br /> <br /> The Satterlee family usually visited for 6 weeks each summer. The family stayed in “rustic” Adirondack style cottages and the staff stayed in smaller bungalows. The estate also had a barn and cows which provided fresh dairy products, gardens for fresh vegetables, and a nursery to assist in growing assorted plants for the estate gardens designed by renowned landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Farrand designed the estate gardens to have a natural flow that blended the plantings/gardens with the surrounding landscape. Little benches, footpaths, and bridges led the visitor throughout the gardens.<br /> <br /> The family summered at Satterlee Field between 1911 and 1946. After the Fire of ’47, discussed just a few stops ago, the youngest daughter Eleanor summered one last summer in 1948 before the daughters decided to donate the estate land to Acadia National Park, as discussed in the very first stop of this hike.",

Long before automated machines ground grain into flour, humans for millennia turned their grain into flour with stones. You might have seen “stone ground” labels in your local grocery store aisles.<br /> <br /> The local mill would be the location one would take grain to get ground into flour. Within the mill was a built system of wooden wheels, shafts, and gears designed to harness waterpower from a water wheel or wind power from the blades of a windmill. The system of wheels, shafts, and gears were attached to the top stone and provided power to the stone. Mill stones or grinding stones were always in pairs of two. The stationary stone on the bottom was called the <b><i>bed stone</i></b><i> </i>while the stone that moved suspended above or on top of the bed stone was called the <b><i>runner stone</i></b>. There are different ways the stones were oriented depending on the era in history or the location in the world.<br /> <br /> As the runner stone turned over top of the bed stone the grain was slowly dribbled from a spout (or hopper) into the hole in the center of the runner stone. Both the runner stone and the bed stone had grooves (also referred to as furrows) cut into them. The grooves/furrows were cut and angled in a way that acted like a scissor action cutting or grinding the grain into flour. The stone surfaces were angled in a way that allowed the grain to move outward as the stones turned. The flour was caught by a wooden case surrounding the bed stone. The flour would be ground again if a different coarseness or fineness was desired.<br /> <br /> Historically, there was never a gristmill (building where grain is ground) here at the Sand Beach / Great Head area. The Satterlee estate. While we can’t confirm with 100% certainty, we know through historic newspaper articles and personal primary source diary entries that a Schooner named the Abbott wrecked on Baker’s Island in December 1896. The cargo of the Abbott consisted of 160 tons of grindstones. Many of these grindstones eventually were salvaged and brought to Mount Desert Island. Some stones found their way to local mills on the island and others found their way to the gardens and estates of the wealthy summer residents. Through these historically written clues it is a safe bet that one of those “7 foot x 14 inch” grindstones found its way onto the Satterlee estate where it was used as a bench, a flagpole base, and a conversation piece by the Satterlee family.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Gulf of Maine is an extremely productive body of water, and many creatures call it home. Part of the reason why it is so productive is because it’s so cold. Colder water can hold more oxygen, and that oxygen gives life to many marine animals like lobsters, urchins, fish, and many more. Because these waters are filled to the brim with these critters, many marine predators also come to the Gulf of Maine for the abundance of food. Predators like Ospreys, Double-crested Cormorants, seals, porpoises, and even sharks can be found in the waters around Acadia.<br /> <br /> Look out into the ocean here, about halfway across the cove: do you see a rock ledge? This rock is known as Old Soaker, the same ledge that caused the demise of the Schooner Tay. Old Soaker, along with the two headlands that surround it, all help to protect the sand on Sand Beach from the heavy waves of the Atlantic. Without protection from Old Soaker, the sand could be easily carried away from the beach by strong waves.<br /> <br /> Sand Beach is a unique beach in Maine. It is mostly composed of tiny pieces of broken shells. It is unusual to see a shell beach in an area with such cold water – shells are made of calcium carbonate, which dissolves easily in cold water. Beaches like these are much more common in warmer parts of the world like the Carolinas or Florida, where the water isn’t cold enough to rapidly dissolve shells. The shell-fragment sand of Sand Beach is a testament to how productive the waters of Maine are: the cold, oxygen-rich water produces more shelled creatures than it can dissolve, making Sand Beach possible.</p>",

            "bodyText": "Stonington Cemetery, a 19-acre burial ground, alternatively referred to as Evergreen Cemetery, and originally known as the Phelps Burying Ground, is located at the corner of U.S. Route 1 and North Main Street in Stonington, Connecticut. <br /> <br /> Stonington Cemetery’s physical landscape reflects changing burial practices and funerary customs across its more than two hundred and fifty-year history.  The cemetery represents changing local approaches to managing and administrating burials, design of those burial spaces, and memorialization. The cemetery uniquely represents a historical arc of American burial practices from the mideighteenth century to the twentieth century, and modes of administrating interments, within a single property. <br /> <br /> The history of the establishment of the cemetery began during the late eighteenth century. On May 7, 1787, William Chesebrough, descendant of the original founder of Stonington, conveyed a farm, including an already established family burying ground, to Charles Phelps, a prominent local doctor. The burying ground became known as the \"Phelps Buryng Ground.\" At the time the burying ground was only one acre. In 1849, the Stonington Cemetery Association was chartered by those who had friends and relatives buried in the Phelps burying ground (though no Phelps family members were part of the association). By 1850, the burial ground was at capacity, containing more than 500 graves in its single acre.  Following an 1865 purchase of property to the north of the public cemetery, the burial space grew to encompass more than five acres. <br /> <br /> Stonington Cemetery, therefore, was one of the earliest examples of modern cemetery organization within eastern Connecticut. The incorporated-cemetery model was a distinct shift in the ways burial spaces were managed prior to the turn of the century. Incorporated cemeteries reflected political and economic structures of the nineteenth century that contrasted with approaches to the management of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century burial grounds. While families and congregations typically managed earlier burial spaces, incorporated cemeteries functioned as regulator and administrator of burial space and burial practice in the nineteenth century. They also represented a commercialization of death; in incorporated cemeteries, families or individuals purchased lots (at varying prices based on the desirability of location) for future generations. <br /> <br /> The enlarged grounds of the 1849-1865 cemetery quickly were filled with architecturally sophisticated and elaborately ornamented family monuments and associated headstones, necessitating another expansion towards the east following purchase of sixteen acres in 1888. This expansion took place during a period of changing taste in cemetery design. Importantly, however, that design included a greater number of smaller burial plots, suggestive of a move away from multi-generational family burial, and towards smaller family burial tracts. That changing burial practice likely was tied to changing social customs, including the declining importance of family lineages and the rise of the nuclear family unit during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By 1920, the cemetery's design was solidified, except for one relatively minor addition to the grounds northern edge during the 1980s.<br /> <br /> Stonington’s development from a colonial family burial ground to New London County’s first incorporated cemetery represents historically significant changes in local ways of managing death, consistent with historical developments occurring both regionally and nationally during the same period. The site is a rare example of an incorporated town cemetery designed around an existing family burial ground. Within Stonington Cemetery, the burial practices associated with both organizational paradigms are apparent within each landscape: Phelps Burial Ground's scattered internment indicate a lack of formal planning, while the post-1849 and post-1888 grounds reflect a structured, geometric plan. Similarly, organizational structures employed in each burial space reflect burial customs as they relate to periods in social history: the Phelps Burial Ground's earliest internments suggest a community-centric burial landscape, where family members were often interred at a distance from one-another; the 1849-1854 cemetery grounds are structured around large family plots, where multiple generations were buried together, reflecting mid-century values about family lineage; and the post-1888 grounds include burial rows, and larger areas for single graves, reflecting the rise of the nuclear family and the individual interment in burial custom.",

Eventually, visitation exceeded what the current facilities could support.

These trails are referred to as mauka-makai trails and highlight the importance of connecting the resources available from mountain to ocean.<br /> <br /> In ancient Hawaiʻi, the land was divided into long sections called ahupuaʻa that ran from the mountain to the ocean providing the people living in them almost everything they needed to survive. Larger trees for carving from the forest, fertile lands with ample rainfall in the <i>kula</i> (uplands), and abundant ocean resources from the <i>kahakai</i> (coastal area). Resources from each area were meticulously managed and shared throughout the ahupuaʻa along mauka-makai trails.<br /> <br /> While the primary village area for Kiʻilae was concentrated in this coastal area around the 1871 trail, as historian Frances Jackson (1966) states,</p> <blockquote> <p>“to attempt to show Ki‘ilae Village as existing only at the shore would show barely a third of the life of the villagers.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Families also maintained <i>kula</i> gardens with <em>ʻuala</em> (sweet potato), yams, pumpkins, squash, <em>kō</em> (sugar cane), papaya, <em>maiʻa</em> (bananas),<em> pia</em> (arrowroot), <em>ipu </em>(gourds), and <em>ulu</em> (breadfruit). These <i>kula</i> gardens were located far enough upslope to receive regular rain. In addition to kula gardens, many also cared for dryland <em>kalo</em> (taro) fields located even further upslope. A network of trails connected fields to field houses and to a mauka-makai trail that served as the main artery for travel between the <i>mauka</i> gardens and the coastal residences.<br /> <br /> This is no longer a maintained trail. Please make sure to stay on the 1871 Trail and practice Leave No Trace Principles to help protect archeological sites.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Beehive and many of Acadia’s other mountains are examples of a geologic feature called a “roche mountonée.” Roches mountonée always have this distinct shape: a gradual slope leading up to a steep drop-off. This shape was created by glaciers, which covered Acadia from 35,000 to 16,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> As they made their way over mountains like the Beehive, glaciers had to fight against gravity as the mountain pushed them up toward the sky. This created a lot of pressure on the surface of the mountain. Not only were the glaciers working against the force of gravity, but the glaciers here were over a mile thick! That ice adds up to a lot of weight. The pressure from the combined weight of the ice and the gravity pulling it downwards meant that the glacier smoothed the surface of the mountains it traveled over, much like sandpaper. When we look at the Beehive and see the gentle slope leading up to its summit, we are looking at the path that the glaciers created as they passed over the mountain.<br /> <br /> But if glaciers have smoothed one side to a gentle slope, why does the other side look so steep? After the glacier reached the summit, there was a large release in the pressure that we previously talked about. Now, gravity was helping to pull that heavy ice back down the mountain. As the ice moved back down the mountain, changes in pressure meant that some of the ice at the base of the glacier melted – and that water seeped into cracks of the mountain’s surface. Eventually, that water would refreeze, breaking chunks of rock loose from the mountain as it expanded into ice. The glacier continued “plucking” rocks from the surface, making a steeper slope each time. This process happened over and over again as the glacier continued sliding over the mountain; eventually, it created the famously steep path up the Beehive that Acadia visitors know today.</p>",

The crew found refuge in the Satterlee Family’s summer home. A large portion of the “Tay’s” cargo, close to ninety thousand feet of spruce planks, was washed ashore by the waves.

What would the Apostle Islands be without sand? No island is blessed with more spectacular and diverse sandy areas than the 10,054 acre island. The bridge of sand connecting Presque Isle Point to the rest of Stockton Island is an outstanding example of a geologic feature called a “tombolo”. The tombolo is home to a variety of plant communities (bogs, dunes, lagoons, savannahs, and pine forests), the park’s largest campgound, and the “singing sands” of Julian Bay. People everywhere feel the call of the beach, but at Julian Bay, the call of the “singing” sand can actually be heard.</p> <h4>Leave No Trace Outdoor Ethics</h4> <p>Visitors can do their part to help protect park resources by following the seven principles of “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">Leave No Trace</a>” outdoor ethics.</p> <h4>Boating and Camping</h4> <p>Docks are located at Presque Isle Bay and at Quarry Bay. Docking is available on a first-come first-served basis. Please observe all docking signs and regulations. A fee is charged for overnight docking. Some dock space is reserved for excursion and National Park Service boats. Boats can be anchored or beached in Quarry, Presque Isle, and Julian Bays. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">Boaters</a> should monitor marine weather forecasts, since shifting wind conditions and subsequent rough water can pose a significant threat.<br /> <br /> A half-mile long waterfront <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping-permits-reservations.htm\">campground</a> is located among the pines on Presque Isle Bay. Campsite #1 near the Presque Isle docks is accessible to visitors with mobility impairments. Two accessible group campsites are located at Quarry Bay. One individual campsite is located at Quarry Bay and another at Trout Point. Limited camping is also available outside of designated campsites. Camping permits are required for all camping in the national lakeshore. A camping fee is charged. Permits must be picked up at the Bayfield headquarters visitor center before the start of a trip.</p> <h4>Hiking</h4> <p>There are about 14 miles of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking trails</a> on the island. Portions of the Trout Point and Quarry Bay trails may be hard to follow. Off-trail travel can be strenuous. Rock ledges near the lake are slippery. Use caution when walking on them.</p> <h4>Bears</h4> <p>Stockton Island supports a resident population of black bears. A study of Stockton Island bears revealed that the population grew from two animals in 1984 to a high of 31 non-cub bears in 1994. DNA analysis of bear hair samples collected in 2002 determined that there were at least 26 different bears living on Stockton Island that summer. A similar study in 2010 identified only 13 bears on the island. Stockton’s resources can only support so many bears. When the population exploded, the animals naturally regulated their numbers. Some bears swam to other islands, females had fewer and smaller litters, and several smaller bears were killed and eaten.<br /> <br /> Bears occasionally turn to alternative food sources. In summer 2002, a large boar with a scar on his rear end roamed between the camping areas at Presque Isle and Quarry Bay. “Skar’s” campground visits in search of “easy pickings” slowly became more frequent and menacing. After using every available nonlethal tool to discourage Skar’s aggressive behavior, park rangers were forced to shoot him. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/bear-safety.htm\">Visitors must take precautions</a> to help keep this from happening again. Never approach or feed a bear. Keep a distance of at least 50 yards, even for photography. </p> <h4>Footprints</h4> <blockquote> <p><span style=\"color:#333366;\"><em>The natural and undisturbed areas of of the tombolo, Presque Isle, and Julian Bay never cease to amaze, while human history and its imprint are clearly visible at Quarry Bay. The island is a gem and a perfect stop for anyone looking to understand the overall significance and value of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.</em></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">Stockton Island has attracted people for centuries. Archeological evidence indicates that native populations may have fished on the island as much as 5,000 years ago. Over the past 1,000 years native people camped on the island seasonally to hunt, fish, gather berries, and harvest maple sap. By the late 1800s, Stockton Island attracted commercial activities such as fishing camps, lumber camps, and a brownstone quarry to its shores. Today, visitors flock to Stockton Island to anchor in its protected bays, explore its varied landscapes, camp in its lakeside campsites, and walk its white sand beaches.<br /> <br /> The shoreline areas that attract the most visitors also tend to be very fragile. Vegetation in sandy areas is susceptible to trampling. When plants that stabilize the sand are killed, erosion becomes a problem. Informal trails mar the landscape around the Presque Isle campground and at Julian Bay. Visitors can help protect our fragile sandscapes by using sand ladders provided at the campsites, walking on designated trails and boardwalks, and on beaches below the line of vegetation. This will help leave no trace of our passing...except tracks on the beach.</span><br />  </p>",

At the time, Chief Black Kettle of the Cheyenne had been pursuing peace with whites and believed his village to be under US Army protection. Approximately 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children and elderly were killed and horribly mutilated. This attack came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre and resulted in a massive public outcry as well as months of retaliatory raids by Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Lakota warriors.<br /> <br /> In the months and years that followed, treaties and attempts to move the tribes to reservations would fail. Innocents on both sides were killed. Tribal retaliation resulted in a military policy that \"punishment must follow crime\".<br /> <br /> The scene was set for the tragedy that would play out here in the Washita River valley four years later.<br /> <br /> <i>What would you have done to stop the cycle of violence in this conflict?</i></p>",

Under sunny skies, the special event included a naming ceremony, a picnic, speeches and the unveiling of the cultural panel (interpretive wayside). Park Superintendent Rick Obernesser opened the event, saying “I am excited that so many of us are here today as we dedicate the park’s first official campground.” Kendesnii is the Ahtna name of Daisy Nicolai. She and her children had a spring camp in the campground area for many years. In addition to acknowledging the family’s connection to this site, using an Ahtna name for the campground recognizes the important association between Alaska Natives and Wrangell-St. Elias. Park staff worked with local tribes in identifying the campground name, and the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, on behalf of Daisy’s family, partnered with the park in organizing the dedication. Many of the more than 100 guests at the event were members of Daisy’s family. Also among the guests were Nabesna Road residents and park visitors camping at the site. Daisy’s closest surviving relatives – a sister and three daughters – shared memories of Daisy, as did several grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, Tribal Administrator Wilson Justin, who is also one of Daisy’s grandchildren, said “The honor of keeping a promise made a generation ago is privilege not always understood but vital to those who stand in shadows of our Traditions. Thank You to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park for the support in keeping that promise. Cheesh’na extends a welcome to all visitors to the Kendesnii Campground.” The campground is located at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road. It has vault toilets, picnic tables, and ten sites that will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. Currently there is no charge for use of the site. A canoe launch exists at the lake dock and development of a potable water well is being planned. Funding for campground construction came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Recreational Fee Demo Program.<i></i></p>",

A broad archaeological overview. </b>Human habitation in the Brooks River area began around 2400 BC and continued for the next 4,200 years. There were three distinct waves of human habitation in the region, known as “Traditions,” which are characterized by unique types of artifacts. These help us piece together the archaeological record and learn something about the cultures and people who lived here in the past.<br /> <br /> The first known people in the region were from the Paleoarctic Tradition (9,000-7,000 years ago), followed by the Northern Archaic Tradition (5,000 to 3,850 years ago), the Arctic Small Tool Tradition (3,850-3,000 years ago), the Norton Tradition (2,250-900 years ago), and finally the Thule Tradition (900 years ago to historic contact). The people of these ancient societies were the ancestors of today’s Alaska Native people whose families originate from this area, particularly the Alutiiq people. We are able to piece together the stories of the past with the help of oral traditions from Alutiiq communities, as well as evidence from artifacts and ancient housing sites, like those found along Brooks River.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Camp Crowell Hilaka Historic District is a 336-acre tract of land located in the western portion of Richfield Township, Ohio. It served as a Girl Scout Camp from 1937-2011. It is also significant for its association with the Cleveland Girl Scout Council which was an early leader in racial integration and religious inclusion, regardless of the socioeconomic background of its scouts. The Camp Crowell Hilaka property includes: 243 acres accumulated by James B. Kirby and sold to the Cleveland Girl Scout Council in 1937, which became Camp Julia Crowell; and 93 adjoining acres to the north sold by the Neal family to the Cleveland Girl Scout Council in 1957, which became Camp Hilaka. Over time, the combined camps became commonly referred to as Camp Crowell Hilaka. The combined acres reflects the same boundaries of the current public park, <a href=\"https://www.richfieldheritagepreserve.com/\">Richfield Heritage Preserve</a>.<br /> <br /> The Girl Scout Council purchased not only the land, but the collection of buildings of the Kirby and Neal families as well, in turn converting them all to Girl Scout camp functions and adding new facilities to accommodate the thousands of girls who used the camp annually for day, overnight, weekend, or summer resident camping.<br /> <br /> While private camps for boys began to appear sporadically in New England in the 1870s and 1880s, the trend occurred later for private camps for girls. Accepted standards of behavior for Victorian era girls focused on the home, with the expectation that girls would learn to become wives and hostesses and manage a household with children. By the turn of the twentieth century, increasing educational attainment, the opening of employment opportunities in offices and stores, the evolution of women’s clothing to allow more freedom of movement, and the growth of outdoor activities for women such as cycling were all manifestations of the expanding role of women and girls in society.<br /> <br /> At the turn of the 20th century, American Juliette Gordon Low, a descendent of the prominent Kinzie family of Chicago, lived in Great Britain. In 1911, she met retired British army officer Robert Baden-Powell, who had recently founded both the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides in that country. Juliette Low formed and led several Girl Guide troops in Great Britain, and with Baden-Powell’s encouragement, founded the Girl Guides national organization in America when she returned to Savannah, Georgia, in early 1912. News of the organization spread quickly, and also in 1912 the first troop of girls organized in Cuyahoga County in the community of Bay Village. The national organization changed its name to Girl Scouts in 1913, and in 1914 the Pansy Troop organized as the first Girl Scout troop in the City of Cleveland.<br /> <br /> The breadth of organized camping ideals made it possible for persons and organizations to envision organized camping as a component in a march toward a better society. Privileged, educated young women of the early 20th century were expected to contribute to the betterment of society through volunteerism or even in a career such as social service, education, or recreation. Responsibility and leadership, gained through camping, would provide women with key tools to shed the domestic norms of the Victorian period and actively participate in the broader society. This activism often exhibited itself in efforts to advance the reform agenda of the Progressive Movement, including women’s suffrage, improving conditions in poor, overcrowded urban neighborhoods, and the creation of professionalized organizations dedicated to the betterment of girls and young women, such as the Girl Scouts, Camp Fire, and the YWCA Girl Reserves.<br /> <br /> Camp Julia Crowell became the Cleveland Council’s most versatile facility, offering day camping, overnight hikes, weekend camping, one-week camping, two-week summer camping sessions, and functioning as a training center for current and new adult camp leaders. The Girl Scouts also differentiated the camping experiences. One purpose of short camping excursions, such as weekend troop camping, was to have girls work on planning and skill training before the trip. At two-week resident summer camp, the purpose was to have girls learn skills while at camp, not beforehand. During summer resident camp, girls camped in tents only. During spring and fall, troops could stay in cabins or tents. In winter, camping stays were limited to winterized cabins/buildings. The ability to offer outdoor camping for a day, weekend, or two-week session – was integral to the mission of the Girl Scouts since the national organization’s founding in 1912 and the Cleveland Girl Scout Council’s establishment in 1922. Camp Crowell provided countless girls and young women the opportunity to experience the outdoors in an atmosphere of inclusion and positivity.<br /> <br /> Girl Scout founder Juliette Low firmly believed that American girls needed to live active lives outside the home, where they could contribute to society as full citizens. Furthermore, camping provided the pathway to that goal, because it is “more than learning campcraft skills and how to live in the out-of-doors; it is truly a new way of life with new disciplines and new joys; . . . camping stretches a girl’s capacity, enlarges her adaptability to new situations, and challenges her to make Girl Scout ideals a living principle in her life.” For tens of thousands of Ohio girls, that outdoor camping experience happened at Camp Crowell Hilaka.</p>",

            "bodyText": "The attack on the Confederate position was designed to be a heavy frontal assault. Two brigades were to charge up this very hill in order to break through the earthworks at the top. The obstacles for the Union soldiers were immense. The earthworks at the crest stood up to 8 feet tall and were topped with head logs that protected the Rebels behind them. In addition to that, the Confederates had placed a series of formidable field fortifications directly in the Union path. Colonel Alan Fahnestock of the 86<sup>th</sup> Illinois infantry describes the scene: “They had logs with sharp sticks through the log like hay racks (called Chevalle de Frise), the ends bound together with wire”. These defenses, along with cleverly hidden Confederate artillery, causes the Union assault to falter, and then to stop completely. The fighting at the crest of the hill just ahead became some of the bloodiest and violent of the entire battle. Confederate soldier Sam Watkins of the 1<sup>st</sup> Tennessee Infantry writes “Yet still the Yankees came. It seemed impossible to check the onslaught… a solid line of blazing fire right from the muzzles of the Yankee guns being poured right into our very faces, singeing our hair and clothes, the hot blood of our dead and wounded spurting on us, the blinding smoke and stifling atmosphere filling our eyes and mouths, and the awful concussion causing the blood to gush out of our noses and ears, and above all, the roar of battle, made it perfect pandemonium… Hell had broke loose in Georgia sure enough.”",
            "audioDescription": "At this location, you are standing at the base of a large hill. You are on a roughly 5-6ft wide reddish orange dirt path. To the right of the path is a very large field surrounded on all sides by trees. To the left all the way up the path is a dense wooded area. At the top of the hill is a large marble monument, some wooden fencing, and more trails.",

Many of the jobs and rail yard structures soon became obsolete.<br /> <br /> The Thurmond Depot was restored as a visitor center in 1995 and today the National Park owns over 20 structures in the historic district.<br /> <br /> In 2003, the National Park Service began a stabilizing program that included repairs to preserve buildings until they can be rehabilitated or restored. Work included removal of the overgrown vegetation, improvement of drainage around buildings, installation of more permanent metal roofs and gutters, removal of hazardous porches and additions, installation of window louvers to provide adequate interior ventilation, and some exterior restoration work. <br /> <br /> Preservation efforts continue today, as do memories that are made here. Thurmond remains a flag stop for Amtrak and the town is still incorporated, hosting a reunion every year where former residents recall days of their youth in a town once the center of activity in the New River Gorge. ",

It’s been part of my life since childhood, and part of my identity, like being a southerner or a Baptist.”</i><i>I could add that, during the proper seasons, the urge within me to be in the woods and fields or along a stream is such a strong and pleasant desire that I have no inclination to withstand it.\"</i><br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter 1994, <i>An Outdoor Journal</i><br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Carter heard the doctrine of stewardship – how to care for God’s gifts – from his father, in his church, and at school in the Future Farmers of America. During the 1930s, he saw Earl Carter terrace his eroded fields, preserve wildlife, and plant pine trees on marginal land. The boy who loved to be outdoors became a governor and a president known for his strong environmental stands. When he signed the Alaska Lands Bill in 1980, Jimmy Carter placed more acres into conservation than had any other president.<br /> <br /> Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter promoted tree farming in the 1980s. Farmers like the Carters have planted so many trees that today more pines grow in Georgia than 100 years ago. With more acres of commercial forests than any other state, timber is one of Georgia’s most profitable agricultural crops.<br /> <br /> Photo: Rosalynn Carter holds a small pine tree as she and Jimmy Carter stand in a field.",

Here Jimmy Carter mastered the rules and the roles he would carry all the way to world leadership. In these sun-baked fields and weathered buildings, a young boy worked hard, played fair, and shouldered responsibility. His parents, “Mr. Earl” and “Miss Lillian,” raised four children to value education, community service, their Christian faith, and each other.<br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter left his parents’ farm after high school, intending to spend his life as a naval officer. When his father died of cancer in 1953, Jimmy Carter came back to his Georgia roots – but not to this home of his boyhood.<br /> <br /> Small Photo: Ensign Carter married Rosalynn Smith, his sister Ruth’s close friend, just after his graduation.

Aligned to the left is \"Scotts Bluff National Monument\". Aligned to the right is the text \"National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior,\" and finally the National Park Service arrowhead. The title of the wayside is below the black banner in large black font. The panel has a cream-colored background. Black text is arranged in one column on the left side of the wayside. To the right of the text is a large map marking the routes of the Oregon Trail, California Trail, Mormon Pioneer Trail, and Pony Express. Below the map are three columns of black text. The text in the left column is a caption about the map. The text in the other two columns are quotations from emigrants who traveled these trails.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: Portal to the West<br /> <br /> <strong>Text:</strong> A welcome landmark.<br /> <br /> Scotts Bluff was a marvel to many people from the eastern part of the continent. Rising abruptly from the plains, it inspired some to write poetic descriptions in their diaries. It was a relief to people on their westward journey to Oregon and California to see the bluffs rise from the prairie. They were a milepost that meant a third of the trip was accomplished. They were also a sign that the plains were almost behind them and the mountains were about to begin. The easy portion was over and the difficult part was ahead.<br /> <br /> Emigrants were not the only ones to travel through the pass ahead. Riders for the short-lived Pony Express galloped east and west along the same path. Stagecoaches and the first transcontinental telegraph also followed the trail used by thousands.  Although the first railroad route across the nation ran a few miles south of Mitchell Pass, its impact was felt. Starting in 1869, travelers preferred the faster, safer transportation of the \"Iron Horse\" over the wagon trains. <br /> <br /> Discover more about the travelers of the past while exploring the exhibits at the Visitor Center and walking the trails. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A map of the central and western United States showing the routes of the Oregon Trail, California Trail, Mormon Pioneer Trail and the Pony Express. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Northern overland routes to the west followed the Platte River towards the Rocky Mountains. South Pass was the best place for wagons to cross the Continental Divide and marks where the trails diverge.

It compresses centuries of history into 20 feet of yellow cedar, depicting the Huna Tlingit’s tragic migration from Glacier Bay Homeland, the painful period of alienation, and the more recent collaborative efforts between partners. Capped by two human figures symbolically holding Xunaa Shuká Hít, Huna Ancestors’ House - one wearing a woven cedar hat, one wearing the iconic ranger hat - the totem is a focal point for conversations about true partnerships. <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/historyculture/healing-totem-pole.htm\">See more details and photos of the Healing Totem Pole.</a></h4>",

            "bodyText": "<p>This trailhead leads out to the top of Mammoth Hot Springs, with close-up views of Dryad Spring, Canary Spring, Grassy Spring, and Cupid Spring along boardwalks. The boardwalks near Cupid Spring begin descending down through the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, connecting to the Lower Terraces.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Transitions from asphalt walkways to boardwalks may require assistance. Some sections of boardwalk are wheelchair-accessible. The rest of the area has stairs or steep grades due to terrain. Distance from parking in front of Liberty Cap to the end of the boardwalk at Palette Spring is approximately 135 yards.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p> <h2>Upper Terrace Loop Ski and Snowshoe Trail</h2> <p>The Upper Terrace Loop Ski Trail is a groomed 1.5-mile (2.4-km) loop that ranges from easy to more difficult due to a steep downhill section if traveled to the right (counter-clockwise) from the trailhead.</p> <p>This loop begins at the Upper Terrace parking area. It is easiest if skied beginning to the left (clockwise). A moderate climb leads to views of hot springs, terraces, the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District, and the surrounding mountains. At the top of the climb, a trail veers off to the southwest, which connects with the Snow Pass Trail. The Terrace Loop Trail descends past more hot springs before completing the circuit. Since snow depths here are less than in the mountains above, wintering elk and deer are occasionally sighted.</p> <p><b>Notes:</b></p> <ul> <li>Bison and elk frequent this trail. Federal regulations require you to stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 m) away from bison and all other wild animals.</li> <li>There are thermal areas along this trail and some areas do not hold snow. Stay on boardwalks and designated ski trails. The ground is unstable in hydrothermal areas.</li> </ul>",

It sits on a high bluff above the Columbia River, overlooking the remains of the two Fort Okanogans (1811, c.1830) as well as the river delta. The Fort Okanogan Interpretive Center was dedicated on August 27, 1960, and interprets the history of the Fort Okanogan Trading post, wich operated from 1811-1860.  <br /> <br /> Fort Okanogan was the first official Euro American trading post in the north central Washington area and was the first site in the future state that would raise the American flag. For thousands of years the site at the mouth of the Okanogan River was a large fishery were native people had gathered to fish, trade, and socialize. In 1811, Alexander Ross and David Stuart, employees with John Jacob Astor’s Pacific Fur Company, decided to capitalize on this important location and built a trading post on the banks of the river; naming it Fort Okanogan. Around 1830 the Northwest Company (later managed by the Hudson’s Bay Company) built a new fort about 1 mile south of the original fort. These fur companies relied heavily upon local Native people to facilitate trade and operate the trading post. Interest in Fort Okanogan as an important historical site dated back to 1911 when the two fort sites had been marked by a flagpoles by community members. The following year the Washington State Historical Society, with the help of the superintendent of the Colville Indian Reservation, acquired ownership of the sites through a petition to Congress. <br /> <br /> While interest in the sites remained throughout the 1920s and 30s, little was done towards long term preservation, documentation and/or interpretation efforts. With National Park Service support, the first detailed scientific study of the Fort Okanogan sites began in 1952. Facilitating the excavation of the Fort Okanogan sites was the Triangle Club of Brewster, a women’s civic club, who eight years prior had took over preservation of the sites as a club project. Finally in 1958 it was announced that the Washington State Parks Commission had acquired a 40 acre site and would build a new historical museum dedicated to the history of Fort Okanogan. The interpretive center was part of a massive building campaign which created 13 new state parks within a short two-year period at the closing of the 1950s. When it was dedicated in 1960, the center was the culmination of nearly twenty years of effort by a variety of groups including local residences, the Triangle Club, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Washington State Parks & Recreation Commission. <br /> <br /> Partial success for the Fort Okanogan Interpretive Center was given to the architectural firm of Durham, Anderson & Freed, who created a unique, one-of-a-kind structure that captured the imagination of the public. Principle Robert Durham designed a triangular structure which would house a mural of the only known historical drawing of the original fort in its lobby. His goal was to “create a structure so different from anything else in the area that it will attract tourists” from the highway nearby.To construct the new museum for the State, the Soap Lake firm of Hansen & Herman where hired. Thor Albert Herman, better known as T.A., and his son Joe were the principle builders for the project. The landscape architect was Dwayne Nelson. By November of 1959, they had the basic shape of the building complete, which was already creating a buzz in the local community due to its unusual architecture. The forty foot tall roof was visible from the nearby community of Brewster. <br /> <br /> With much excitement a formal dedication ceremony was held on August 27, 1960. The local newspaper, the Herald-Reporter featured a special newspaper insert dedicated to the event. Dignitaries from Great Britain, Canada and Washington State Governor Albert Rosellini attended the event. Archaeological investigations at the two fort sites and nearby Indian villages continued after the interpretive center opened. For over four summers, archaeological teams from the University of Washington discovered over 3,500 artifacts relating to the fort. <br /> <br /> The Fort Okanogan Interpretive Center is one of the best representations of the post war expansion program of the Washington State Park & Recreation system. It shows how groups of individual came together to protect, document and celebrate one of the States most important historical resources. Architecturally it demonstrates the exploratory nature of the architecture of that period and shows how it was adapted in the north central Washington State.   <br /> <br /> On January 21, 2011, the Center was gifted to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville (CCT) Reservation by the State of Washington with a signed Governor’s deed. The transfer was part of a state wide closure plan of several parks in 2008. In 2013, the exhibits and storyline were updated to tell a more comprehensive history of the CCT and interpret the fur trade through a Native perspective.",

Later, stone walls were modified to accommodate ranching operations in the area.<br /> <br /> Within the walls would be a house platform upon which a house would be built. In Kiʻilae village, the majority of the houses were the old-style thatched grass houses. However, the more “well-to-do” houses were constructed with modern lumber and had tin roofs, like the John Ahu house. Showing the transitional nature of these times, some houses met halfway with thatched walls and a tin roof. Houses typically were just one large room for the entire family.<br /> <br /> One of the things that all of these house site had in common was the lack of a bathroom or even a pit outhouse. Bathing was done in the ocean and other activities were just done outside or in the tidal areas. The village also did not have electricity. In the evenings, light was provided by kerosene lanterns or kukui nut lights in which sundried kukui nuts were strung onto coconut midribs and lit. According to residents, one string of kukui nuts would last half the night.<br /> <br /> In the “yard” of the pā hale, families would grow any useful or decorative plant that could survive in the dry coastal environment, but most of the food was grown in the kula gardens upslope. “Yards” would also have a designated area for garbage, sometimes walled off from the rest of the area.<br /> <br /> <em>How are these traditional pā hale different or similar to the home you live in today?</em></p>",

In ancient times, lava tubes were important for shelter from the elements and for refuge during times of war. In some lava tubes, water drips from the ceiling, filtered through porous lava rock and would serve as an important source of fresh water and collected in <em>ipu</em> (gourds). Lava tubes were also used as burial caves and many of these sacred burial caves are <em>kapu</em> (forbidden) and protected today.</p>",

Please check our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm\">visitor centers web page</a> for details.<br /> <br /> To obtain a wilderness permit, use the self-registration station outside of the visitor center.<br /> <br /> Begin your explorations of Kings Canyon National Park here. The visitor center sells books, maps, t-shirts, and educational materials, and offers access to restrooms, payphones, and wilderness permits.<br /> <br /> By far, however, the most valuable resources here are the employees and volunteers who can help you navigate your way through the parks. Do you want to see the world's oldest and biggest trees? Learn where John Muir spoke about the idea of national parks? The rangers at the visitor center can help you plan an afternoon or a week here.<br /> <br /> The Grant Grove area includes pristine sequoia groves as well as those affected by logging. It has picnic areas, campsites, a restaurant, market, gift shop, post office, and a lodge.<br /> <br /> This park encompasses a vast wild area. If you are planning an overnight trip into the wilderness, you must first get a permit, along with information about the trails, the landscape, and the weather (the High Sierra is prone to sudden summer storms and other varying conditions). The terrain is wild and extreme, and the visitor center staff can give you tips and inside knowledge. You can also rent food storage canisters here to keep food safe from bears during your wilderness trip.</p> <h3>Services</h3> <p>Find restrooms, water, a pay telephone, and parking here. This is where you get wilderness permits, as well as fire permits if you are camping in the neighboring national forest. Food service, lodging, camping, a market, post office, and gift shop are all available in this area.</p> <h3>Mission 66</h3> <p>In 1966, the National Park Service celebrated their 50th anniversary. In preparation for this anniversary, parks received special funding to modernize their rustic facilities, including visitor centers, employee housing, and maintenance buildings. Kings Canyon Visitor Center is an example of the \"Mission 66\" architecture that had a huge impact on these parks.<br /> <br /> For more examples of buildings that were built during this time, check out the Lodgepole and Foothills visitor centers. And as you travel to other parks, look for other buildings whose style hints at an origin in the 1960s.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>The Kings Canyon Visitor Center has paved, flat paths leading from parking areas to the information desk, exhibits, a bookstore, and restrooms. Wheelchairs may be available for loan, as long as they're returned by the end of the day. Films shown in this visitor center are captioned and audio-described. Assistive listening devices are also available-ask at the information desk to borrow a free receiver. If you have a T-coil hearing aid, no receiver is needed for assistive listening in the theater.</p> <h3>Visiting in Winter</h3> <p>The visitor center is open year-round. When weather is stormy, warm up as you watch the park film and browse exhibits.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Kings Canyon Visitor Center is a single story wooden building with a peaked roof, made of corrugated metal. The building has brown, planked wood siding with bulletin boards and windows. The roof extends over the entrance door, supported by thick wooden beams and posts. The lobby and double entrance doors are glass and open outward. <br />On the wall, adjacent to the entrance, metal lettering mounted on the building reads, \"Visitor Center\". Below it is the National Park Service logo, in the shape of an orange arrowhead, pointed downward. Inside the arrowhead are the words in white lettering, \"National Park Service\" with a green sequoia tree shape to its left. Near the bottom of the arrowhead is a white buffalo silhouette set against a green meadow, with a white lake and snowcapped mountain behind it. A tall flagpole is on the right side of the visitor center.<br />Along the building, to the left of the entrance, is a walkway under the eaves, where the restrooms, water fountain, and bulletin boards are located. A square framed wooden planter in front of the restrooms provides low seating around the native shrubs planted inside.<br />",

In addition to the storefront, the establishment had a bar, billiards room, and officer's club. DeLong left the fort when the army purchased the store and turned the building into a post canteen. Just a couple of years later, in 1893, the post canteen caught on fire.  <br /> <br /> Photos from the fire show that it originated in the dining room, engulfing both that room and the adjoining bar.

            "bodyText": "<p>One reason Lava Beds is such a special place to contemplate cultural history is that it contains two types of rock art, or rock imagery— carved petroglyphs and painted pictographs. All of the monument’s rock imagery is located in the traditional territory of the Modoc people and their ancestors or predecessors.</p> <p>It is hard to determine the age of rock art. This is especially true of petroglyphs, since material was removed in their creation, not added. It is possible that some of these images at Lava Beds were made more that 6,000 years ago. Estimating the age of an individual petroglyph based on weathering is complicated by the number of times it may have been inundated in water as Tule Lake rose and fell around the island that later became known as Petroglyph Point. Interestingly, some of the geometric patterns found in the rock imagery here appear on household items up to 5,000 years old from nearby Nightfire Island. Could some of the same people have carved those same patterns into the rocks at Petroglyph Point? With over 5,000 individual carvings, this site is one of the most extensive representations of American Indian rock art in California—it is possible that dozens or even hundreds of generations of artists paddled out in canoes, sharp sticks or stones in hand, to leave their mark here in the soft volcanic tuff.</p> <p><strong>What Do They Mean?</strong></p> <p>Unlike rock art in other areas of the West, images here seem to be dominated by geometric patterns instead of depictions of people and animals. Looking at the images at Lava Beds, most visitors can’t help but imagine what such patterns might mean. Unfortunately, historic events in this area have made gathering information difficult. Before the Modoc War caused tribal fracturing and the removal of the Lava Beds’ band of Modocs to Oklahoma, no ethnographic study was ever done with Modoc peoples to record their stories about images they may have been familiar with or their beliefs about images left behind by even earlier peoples. Today, it is probable that some knowledge surrounding the rock imagery of the lava beds is not shared with those on the outside.</p> <p>Still, many visitors to rock art sites come away feeling they are very special places, places that perhaps even reach across time and culture to speak to universal human experiences. Petroglyph Point is the center of a Modoc creation story, while other sites with pictographs hold traditional significance for some modern Modoc and Klamath people. Were only individuals holding important positions in the tribe permitted to create rock art at some places on certain occasions? Were other images created in association with special activities to mark important points in a a person’s life? Though each observer can imagine in his or her own mind what circumstances and meaning might have led to the creation of each image, only each original artist, long gone, knows for sure.</p> <p><strong>Help Protect Rock Art!</strong></p> <p>Visitors to the rock art sites of Lava Beds may notice that these places have not always been respected in modern times. Vandalism significantly mars some sites, especially Petroglyph Point. This type of activity unfortunately reflects the disrespect of a few for a cultural history that belongs to us all— a history that the National Park Service is mandated to protect.</p> <p>Though a chain-link fence was installed in the 1930s at Petroglyph Point to provide some protection to the images, pictographs at other sites depend upon the personal responsibility of each visitor to look but not touch. The oil on our hands can cause damage to the delicate images. You can help protect these treasures by reporting any inappropriate activity you see at rock art sites to a ranger or other law enforcement officer as soon as possible.</p> <p>You may also notice painted markings left in lava tube caves by early explorers and even a few Japanese characters carved into the boulders at Petroglyph Point by interned Japanese-Americans during World War II. Though visitors may wonder why some markings are protected and others are considered graffiti, consider that hundreds of thousands of people now visit here annually! What would Lava Beds look like if each person left their mark— and what would remain of ancient rock art? Though someday nature will reclaim each image left behind by the Modoc and earlier peoples, each of us has the opportunity not only to open our minds to their wonder and mystery, but also to do our part to protect this heritage for future generations. We thank you for appreciating and respecting these very special places and for helping others do the same.</p> <p><strong>A Haven For Raptors</strong></p> <p>High out of reach of predators and humans, the pocketed cliff face of Petroglyph Point provides an ideal perch for raptors and other birds. From early spring through early fall, look for large nests and droppings that indicate the presence of young falcons, hawks, and owls. You can also spot cliff swallow chicks peering from clusters of small, round mud nests.</p> <p>From the wetlands of Tule Lake to Ponderosa pine forests along Lava Beds’ southern boundary, the area’s diverse range of habitats offer excellent hunting opportunities for highly adapted birds of prey. A prairie falcon might fly ten miles per day on streamlined wings to hunt smaller upland birds, while a barn owl uses offset ears and silent feathers to locate and catch grassland rodents at night.</p> <p>Protected lands in this area provide both temporary and year- round homes for rare and threatened raptors. Hundreds of bald eagles winter here, and an occasional peregrine falcon stops to rest along its epic migration between North and South America.</p>",

He writes “Our brave Colonel urging his men on, was struck as he said ‘Come on boys, the day is won,’ as he reached the earthwork. He was shot about 4 inches below the collar bone, in the right breast, falling outside of the fortifications.” McCook was believed to have been wounded in close vicinity to this location. After his wound, he would be carried to the rear of the action. He was then transported back to his home in Ohio, where he died on July 17<sup>th</sup>, 1864. Just days before his death, he was promoted to Brigadier General.",

            "bodyText": "<p>Fort Stevens, now partially restored, was built to defend the approaches to Washington from the 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) which was then the main thoroughfare from the north into Washington. Originally called Fort Massachusetts by the soldiers from that state who constructed the fort, it was later named after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill), Virginia, September 1, 1862.<br /> <br /> By the summer of 1864, the great bulk of Union troops in the east were engaged in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/index.htm\">siege operations around Petersburg, Virginia</a>. In fact, when Ulysses S. Grant moved south in the Spring of 1864, he stripped Washington, DC, of many well trained troops to add weight to his offensive. As a result, in July of 1864, there were only 9,000 troops to defend the city, down from over 23,000 the year before. Those that were left were primarily poorly trained reserves. Robert E. Lee was desperate to reduce the pressure on his forces around Petersburg, and so decided to send General Jubal A. Early and about 20,000 troops to strike at Washington which spies had reported was poorly defended.<br /> <br /> On June 12, Early began his march north from Petersburg and by July 9, was at Frederick, Maryland, where he demanded and received $200,000 to spare the city. On the same day, Early <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/index.htm\">defeated Union Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy River</a>. In the light of later events, Wallace's defeat after a stubborn fight became a victory for the Union because he was able to delay Early's advance for a day. On July 10, Early encamped at Rockville, Maryland, only 10 miles from Fort Stevens.<br /> <br /> Reacting to this threat to Washington, Grant ordering the 1st and d 2nd Divisions of the 6th Corps and part of 19th Corps to the capital on July 7. The veteran units reached Fort Stevens arrived off the Potomac River around noon on July 11 as Jubal Early's lead elements advanced toward the capital.<br /> <br /> Over the following several days, Early probed Fort Stevens and its environs but never mounted a full-scale attack. Union reinforcements had reached Washington and Fort Stevens just in time.<br /> <br /> Located atop the parapet of Fort Stevens is a commemorative stone dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. On July 12, 1864, the President stood atop the parapet to observe the fighting and came under fire from Confederate sharpshooters. It is the only time in American history in which a sitting president came under direct fire from an enemy combatant.<br /> <br /> In the years to come, many individuals would claim the honor of advising the President Lincoln to come down from the parapet. The most notable was a young officer named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His remarks to the president were short and straightforward: \"Get down, you damn fool!\" Holmes would eventually serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902-1932.<br /> <br /> Each year, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cwdw/planyourvisit/anniversary-of-the-battle-of-fort-stevens.htm\">anniversary of the Battle of Fort Stevens</a> is commemorated with special programs, living history, and more.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "(632 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north, and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at the northwest corner of 13th and Rittenhouse streets to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location. Lined in front to the north are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One six-foot tall hill to the west of the flagpole has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />About thirty feet behind and six feet to the right of the right cannon sits a two by three-foot wayside. The sign is titled in black letters in the upper left corner: Fort Stevens.<br />The left two thirds of the sign feature a color painting of a battle scene. Men in blue military uniforms stand in a fort on a hilltop around a cannon set on a wheeled turret. A man standing above in the top left corner wears a long black suit coat and black top hat. Below him a man holds an American flag. Two men carry a wounded soldier below, a man runs with a raised right arm and hand, and a man to the right stands while holding a white flag with a red and blue cross. A quote above the image reads: \"We haven't taken Washington, but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell!\" The quote is attributed to General Jubal Early.<br />Text in the bottom right reads:<br />Illustration of President Lincoln on the parapet of Fort Stevens<br />Text below describes the battle that took place at Fort Stevens:<br />Built between 1861-1863 this structure was originally called Fort Massachusetts and guarded the northern defenses of the nation's capital during the Civil War. On July 11-12, 1864 Fort Stevens defended the city from a Confederate attack under the command of General Jubal Anderson Early. During the battle, President Abraham Lincoln came under direct fire from Confederate sharpshooters while he witnessed the battle from the parapet of the fort. The Battle of Fort Stevens marks the only time in American history that a seated President came under fire from an enemy combatant during a time of war.<br />Fort Stevens was named after General Isaac Ingalls Stevens. General Stevens was killed on September 2, 1862 during the Battle of Chantilly, Virginia.<br />You can download a podcast of Fort Stevens at www.nps.com/rocr<br />The right third of the sign is a white panel. In the top left is a sketch of an older African American woman, sitting with a slight smile and hands clasped. Text to her right reads:<br />In order to construct Fort Stevens, the home of the original property owner, Elizabeth Thomas, was destroyed.<br />To the right is a QR code to scan for additional information about the Battle of Fort Stevens.<br />Below is a black and white image of about forty military soldiers posing in a fort for the camera To the right men stand among two cannons, and another four cannons line the fort behind them from a raised platform, pointed out over the tops of the forts walls. About twenty more soldiers stand and kneel on the left by a flagpole and amongst piles of cannonballs. Text beneath them reads:<br />3rd Massachusetts Heavy Artillery at Fort Stevens 1865<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Hunters would bring their dogs to the mountain here and release them to hunt. The topography of the surrounding mountains and valleys allowed hunters to relax by the camp fire, while still following the sounds of their dogs. The high hills echoed back the distinct voices of each hound, signaling to their owners who was closest to the catch!<br /> <br /> Families have also frequented the area simply to view the wonderful scenery. On a clear day you can see up to 50 miles. Sitting at 2,805 feet, this overlook offers views of<em> (from left to the right) </em>Fisher Peak, Slate Mountain, Round Peak, Sauratown Mountains (Hanging Rock & Pilot Mountain), Skull Camp Mountain, and Raccoon Mountain. During late spring the mountain tops come alive in a sea of green, and in fall burst with bright yellows and reds. On foggy days During late spring the mountain tops come alive in a sea of green, and in fall burst with bright yellows and reds. On foggy days, the mountain peaks rise like islands in a sea of clouds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a wonderful place to view a sunrise, or just to stop and rest, Fox Hunter’s Paradise will not disappoint!<br /> <br /> <em>Note:</em> This overlook has two different parking areas. If you pull into the overlook going south on the parkway. A road to the right (inside the overlook) will take you to more parking as well as to a short walway leading to an observation deck. The walkway to the stone overlook is 0.2 miles long and is wheelchair accessible.",
            "audioDescription": "A grassy median separates the overlook from the parkway road. The terrain slopes down from a low, wooden guardrail at the edge of the pavement. Low vegetation covers the slope in the center of the overlook, while trees stand at the edges on either side. In the valley below, there's a patchwork of fields and woods, while in the distance, mountains rise. To the right in the overlook, another road leads to the top of a hill, where there is more paved parking, as well as spaces for RVs. A small path leads to another slightly hidden overlook. This stone viewing point offers some of the same views as the lower overlook. The small 0.2-mile path is wheelchair accessible.",

The monument was dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge on October 4, 1924. Additions to the memorial were made in 1957 to honor the dead from World War II and in 1977 to honor those who died in the Vietnam War. The most recent addition, dedicated in 1995, commemorates those who died during Desert Storm in 1991. The symbol of the First Division is \"the Big Red One.\" A bed of red flowers in front of the memorial spells out a huge numeral one from spring to fall. The symbol is modeled after the \"big red one\" in the center of the division's patch. This pink Milford granite column from Massachusetts is one of the largest pieces ever taken from a quarry in the United States. Standing atop the sphere is a 15-foot-tall, gilded bronze figure of Victory. She is supported by wings, suggesting the perfection of body and soul. In her right hand she carries a flag, while her left extends in a blessing of the dead.<br /> <br /> General John Pershing, commander of U.S. troops in WWI, was particularly proud of the First Division, which came to be known as \"Pershing's Own.\"The soldiers of the First Division were the first American troops to arrive in France in 1917 and the last to leave Europe in September 1919. When the war was over, many wanted to honor the service and sacrifice of these men with the First Division Monument, an impressive pedestal listing the names of 5,516 First Division soldiers who gave their lives. Pershing said of the division that it had \"a special pride of service and a high state of morale never broken by hardship nor battle,\" a quote inscribed on the pedestal of the monument.<br /> <br /> More than 6,000 veterans and guests gathered to dedicate the First Division Monument on October 4, 1924. Major General Summerall served as grand marshal and spoke movingly of the spirit of the First Division. President Coolidge gave the dedication address and the ceremonies concluded with a benediction followed by the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" played by the massed bands of the First Division.<br /> <br /> The First Division Monument was highly praised for both its design and its mission. For many years it was the only memorial in Washington dedicated to the soldiers of World War I. The Commission of Fine Arts described it as \"the chief symbol of American valor in that war, a position borne out by the universal character of its design and location.”<br /> <br /> Located adjacent to the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the First Division Monument is auspiciously located.

            "audioDescription": "(538 words) <br />The First Division Monument sits on an elevated plaza in President's Park, west of the White House and south of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the corner of 17th street NW and State Place, NW. 17th street is to the west and E street NW is to the south. <br />Facing north from the sidewalk on E street, a grass lawn of about two hundred sixty feet runs up to the base of the monument. Red tulips are planted in the shape of a huge number one, about fifty feet wide at its base and two hundred feet long, south to north from the sidewalk to the memorial. <br />Three-foot tall black metal posts joined by chain links line the sidewalk. Access to the monument is very limited, beyond viewing from the sidewalk. A stone walkway leads from the right side of the lawn and bends around to the front of the memorial. <br />Thirty feet of lawn separates the walkway from ten, fifty-foot wide steps that lead up to the memorial plaza area. <br />At the top of the stairs, a thirty-five-foot tall round pink granite column sits atop a three-foot high square base of white granite in the center of the plaza. Three feet of cobblestone walkway surrounds the base of the memorial. <br />A fifteen-foot tall, gilded bronze, winged goddess in helmet and chest plate stands on a gold sphere atop the memorial column. She holds a flag above her head in her right hand. Her left arm is extended outward with palm open and facing downward. The monument's height from ground to top is seventy-eight feet. <br />Engravings of a saber and wreath surround the base of the column, along with text that reads:<br />Erected by the Memorial Association of the First Division and patriotic friends to the memory of the dead of the division who gave their lives in the World War that the liberty and the ideals of our country might endure. <br />Campaign names and dates follow this text.<br />A ring round the bottom of the column is engraved to read: <br />First Division United States Army American Expeditionary Forces June 1917 September 1919 <br />Atop a two-foot high and three-foot deep ledge along each side of the memorial base is an eight by three-foot bronze plaque featuring hundreds of names. The top of front plaque, on the south side of the column, reads: <br />The Names of Our Immortal Dead are Here Enshrined <br />Six other similar-sized bronze plaques lay atop a three-foot high granite border that surrounds the plaza area. <br />Inscriptions are also carved into the two-foot wide granite plaza floor around the memorial base, which list division names and train companies. <br />A four by three-foot bronze plaque laid into the plaza floor at the base of the memorial reads:<br />First-Infantry Division - United States Army<br />World War Two<br />A list of the organic units follows this text.<br />Along the eastern side of the memorial column is a one hundred-foot long, fifty-foot wide garden of red tulips. A bronze plaque at the far east end of the garden reads:<br />To the Soldiers of the First Infantry Division (MECH)<br />Who Made the Supreme Sacrifice in<br />Desert Storm (Iraq and Saudi Arabia) 1991 <br />A list of names follows this text.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

            "bodyText": "<p>A pale mountain of sand rises from the flat valley floor, framed by rugged hills striped with pink, tan, and black.</p> <p><strong>Highest Dunes</strong><br /> The Eureka Dunes lie in the remote Eureka Valley, an enclosed basin at 3000 foot elevation located northwest of Death Valley. The dunes cover an area only 3 miles long and 1 mile wide, yet they are the tallest sand dunes in California, possibly the tallest in all of North America. They rise suddenly more than 680 feet above the dry lakebed at their western base. As tall as these dunes are, they are dwarfed by the impressive limestone wall of the Last Chance Mountains which rises another 4000 feet above the valley floor.</p> <p><strong>Singing Sand</strong><br /> The climb to the summit of the dunes is not an easy walk. All the slopes are steep and the loose sand gives way beneath your feet. At the top, the sweeping view seems reward enough for your efforts, yet if the sand is completely dry you may experience one of the strangest phenomena to be found in the desert: singing sand. When the sand avalanches down the steepest face of the highest dune, a sound like a bass note of a pipe organ or the distant drone of an airplane can be heard eminating from the sand. If the dune is at all damp (even though it may not feel so to the touch) no sound will be made. Why this occurs is not fully understood, but may have something to do with the smooth texture of the sand grains and the friction of those grains sliding against each other.</p> <p><strong>Island in the Desert</strong><br /> At first glance the Eureka Dunes appear desolate. What could possibly survive the hardships of this area? Plants and animals must endure the shifting sands, as a windstorm could bury them alive or expose them to the drying sun. The dry surface is deceptive, for dunes can hold water like a sponge. The Eureka Dunes receive more rainfall than others in the Death Valley area because their location at the western base of a mountain range that captures precipitation from passing storms. For perhaps 10,000 years these dunes have existed, providing a unique habitat for specialized lifeforms to evolve. The isolation of Eureka Dunes from other dune fields has led to the development of endemic species of plants and animals that are found nowhere else in the world. Besides 5 species of endemic beetles, 3 special plants have their entire range limited to this island of sand.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eureka Dunegrass</strong> <em>Swallenia alexandrae</em><br /> is often the only plant found on the higher slopes of the dunes. Its dense root system catches and holds drifting sand, forming stable hummocks. Stiff, spiny leaftips protect the plant from being disturbed by herbivores and careless hikers. Federally listed as an endangered species.</li> <li><strong>Eureka Dunes Evening Primrose</strong> <em>Oenothera avita eurekensis</em><br /> has large, white, night-blooming flowers to take advantage of pollenators such as moths that avoid the heat of day. When the leafy flower shoot is covered by windblown sand, roots sprout from the sides and a new rosette of leaves forms at the tip. Federally listed as an endangered species.</li> <li><strong>Shining Milkvetch</strong> <em>Astragalus lentiginosus micans</em><br /> reflects excess light and heat with a covering of silvery hairs to conserve moisture. This is a hummock -forming plant like the dune grass. Nodules on the roots gather nitrogen from the air, an important nutrient not available in the sand. Candidate for the Endangered Species List.</li> </ul> <p><strong>A Special Place</strong><br /> Eureka Dunes are clearly a special place. Please have respect when you visit. Lifeforms here may not be able to survive our carelessness. Try to choose activities that have the least impact on the land. Recreational activities such as sandboarding are not allowed on these delicate dunes. Camp away from the base of the dunes where most of the endemic plants and animals live. Most importantly, OFF ROAD VEHICLE TRAVEL IS NOT PERMITTED ON THE DUNES, or any where else in Death Valley National Park for that matter. Please keep your vehicle on established roadways.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Emma and Neil Erickson started the Faraway Ranch in the late nineteenth century. Emma initiated the purchase of the original cabin and property. Her daughter Hildegard started the guest ranching business in 1917. Emma's eldest daughter <a href=\"../people/lillian-riggs.htm\">Lillian Erickson Riggs</a> oversaw the expansion of the business with her husband Ed Riggs, and continued to manage the ranch by herself after her husband’s death. Faraway Ranch thus preserves a story important to women’s history, one that complicates traditional narratives of women’s lives in the West. The history of Faraway Ranch also is germane to the history of Chiricahua National Monument. Lillian and Ed Riggs built the first trails into the area that became the national monument, and supported the legislative effort to create the monument. As the only lodging for guests in the immediate vicinity, Faraway Ranch had a monopoly on the tourist trade that steadily increased after the monument’s creation in 1924. For many visitors, the ranch figured as an indelible part of their experience at Chiricahua National Monument. Faraway also remained a working cattle ranch until the early 1970s. Many facets of Western history—ranching, tourism, preservation—are part of <a href=\"../articles/series.htm?id=A754298B-1DD8-B71B-0BEFF6803B536300\">the Faraway story</a>.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Perhaps you’ve wondered how the Parkway manages its scenic vistas and overlooks—or, perhaps you’ve never wondered at all, and have simply assumed that the land has always been under protection. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. While much of the southern end of the Parkway is adjacent to Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests, the National Park Service also relies on a patchwork of partnerships, private citizens, and nonprofit groups to make the views possible.<br /> <br /> With its long-range views towards the distant mountain ranges and valley below, Fork Ridge Overlook is a great example of what we can achieve when we work together. This area is close to a housing subdivision and was at risk of development. Thankfully, the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, with the help of private landowners and philanthropists, was able to purchase and protect 81 acres adjacent to the Parkway that can be seen from this overlook. <br /> <br /> Without the purchase, “the land might have become a blight of development amid the forested views from the Parkway,” according to Executive Director Reid Wilson. Now it is part of a growing stretch of protected land that extends across the Plott Balsam Range toward Waterrock Knob.<br /> <br /> So, the next time you’re traveling along the Parkway, take a moment to appreciate the views and the people who help protect them.<br /> <br /> The Mountains-to-Sea Trail can be accessed across the Parkway from this overlook.</p>",

Across the street, the Mountains-to-Sea Trail travels approximately 5 miles to Waterrock Knob. The Plott Balsam Range can be seen from the overlook, as well as sweeping views into the valley below.",

DeRussy. Fort DeRussy was sited upon high ground on the west bank of Rock Creek to control movement along and across the valley. The fort coordinated its fire with Fort Stevens on the east and Fort Kearny on the west. It was built originally in the shape of a trapezium, armed with 7 guns, and afterwards expanded to mount 11 guns and mortars, including a massive 100-pounder Parrott rifle located at reshaped northeastern angle</p> <p>The fort was heavily engaged during the Battle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-stevens.htm\">Fort Stevens</a> on July 11-12, 1864. Fort DeRussy's provided battery support to Fort Stevens to the northeast and also engaged rebel infantry north of the Defenses of Washington.. Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates' advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.</p> <p>Fort DeRussy is in a good state of preservation. The parapet which consists of high earth mounds with openings where guns were mounted, and the deep ditch (dry moat) around the parapet, remain in clear and distinct outline. Also, there is visible evidence of where the powder magazines were located inside the fort. Near the fort, on the outside, well-defined rifle trenches extend in each direction.<br />  </p>",

Here you can experience three of our six ecosystems and can stand at the rivers banks too.<br /> <br /> The Fort Falls showcase the unique geology of the Niobrara River, standing over 30 feet tall over exposed canyon walls. The fort falls are spring fed and flow all four seasons of the year. The trail to the Fort Falls is short and allows visitors to walk down steel catwalks over the falls before they tumble over the ledge and down stairs through every layer of the forest's canopy.<br /> <br /> Cradled in a cool canyon, the Eastern deciduous forest ecosystem surrounds the Fort Falls with Aspen and along the stream-banks, visitors can observe a variety of riparian (stream-side) flora as well. ",
            "audioDescription": "A slightly sloped dirt landing area approximately 12 feet long and 10 feet wide - tapering at the downstream end into a 2 foot wide dirt path. The sound of the fort falls is loud and the rustling of the trees in the wind can be heard. The water drops over 30 feet over a ledge and curves down the canyon wall, trees encroaching on both sides of the wet stone. The water lands in a wide pool and gathers into a stream about 4 feet wind and flowing past the landing adjacent to the trail, leading eventually to the river's banks. The canyon is cool and shaded by the tree canopy overhead.",

It is one of the few rivers that flows north. The Cherokee called it Agiqua or \"Long Man”, an apt name as the entire watershed contains over 4,000 miles of rivers and streams. Its modern name came from early European settlers. Of the two broad (wide) rivers in this area, this one flowed into French territory in Tennessee. Hence the French Broad River was named!<br /> <br /> This overlook is on the south side of Asheville, close to the North Carolina Arboretum and NC 191. It is located on the east side of the Blue Ridge Parkway (Milepost 393.8) and provides views of the French Broad River. An interpretive sign provides an overview of area’s history in the 1800’s. This large parking area is perfect if you are thinking about hiking the section of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail called the Shut-In Trail. You can pick up the trail on the nearby Parkway on-ramp. The French Broad Overlook is also a great spot for bicyclists heading south towards Mount Pisgah to start their ride.<br /> <br /> Whether you spend a few minutes or a few hours, the French Broad Overlook provides an interesting glimpse into the rich history of this area.</p>",

Their famous son who changed his name to Greenwood Leflore, became a Choctaw chief and a Mississippi State Senator. For him are named the city of Greenwood and the county of Leflore.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchz Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> Just off the Natchez Trace Parkway you can visit our friends at the <a href=\"https://www.frenchcamphistoricvillage.com/\">French Camp Historic Village</a> and discover how early American life used to be in this quaint log cabin village.",

To support a minefield, the US Army built several structures, including a torpedo storehouse. Additional structures included a mining casemate, magazine, cable tank storehouse, a mine wharf, and a tramway connecting all the structures. Most of the structures have been removed with the exception of the torpedo storehouse. <br /> <br /> Built in 1902, the torpedo storehouse was used to store equipment and empty mines. It stands as a reminder of Charleston Harbor's minefield. Today, the Fort Moultrie Torpedo Storehouse serves as the administrative headquarters for Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park and Charles Pinckney National Historic Site. It is open to the public by appointment. <br /> <br /> In 1918, the US Army Mine Planter Service was established and placed under the Coast Artillery Corps. Their mission was to install and maintain the minefields that were an integral part of coastal fortifications. Once the mines were placed, soldiers in mining casemates could electronically detonate them if enemy vessels approached. In Charleston Harbor, there were mining casemates located at Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter. ",

The brick front-gabled building is one story. There are entrances on the north and south facades. The NPS added a front-gabled portico to the south facade. The adjacent Visitor Center is constructed on an elevated terrace that slopes down to the east facade of this building.",

At that time, Marblehead was the most successful fishing port in Massachusetts, and the codfish that were caught and dried on the flakes, or drying racks, on shore were shipped from Marblehead and Salem throughout the British empire to be traded for molasses and sugar in the Caribbean Islands, wine in Madeira, and finished goods like cloth, Chinese porcelain, books, and furniture in England.<br /> <br /> A warehouse was an important part of a merchant’s property, as it was where goods and equipment for the vessels were stored, repair work could be done for vessels, and the merchant often had his “counting house” or business office. During the Revolution, Pedrick commissioned <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/privateers-in-the-american-revolution.htm\">privateers </a>to capture British merchant vessels, and probably stored captured cargo in his store house. After the war was over, Pedrick, like most of the merchants in Marblehead and Salem, began participating in international trade until his death in 1802.<br /> <br /> In 1809, the warehouse was purchased by Captain William Story, a relative of Thomas Pedrick. Story had been the captain of <em>Friendship of Salem</em> for four years, and his purchase of the warehouse was part of his entry into the ranks of the merchant community. Story replaced the wooden dock in front of the warehouse with a more durable granite and earth wharf. Unfortunately, he was not as successful in his mercantile efforts as Pedrick had been, and was forced to sell the warehouse and wharf in 1820. Story returned to sea, and in 1827 became a Weigher and Gauger at the Salem Custom House until 1853, when he turned 80.<br /> <br /> After its purchase, the second floor of the Pedrick Store House continued to be used as a sail loft until 1904, operated from 1852 by the Graves Family, while the first floor was an office for the local ferry by the end of the 19th century.<br /> <br /> In 1904, the building was purchased by the Marblehead Transportation Company, who altered the building to support their inn and ferry business. In 1993, the building and wharf, then known as Tucker’s wharf, were purchased by the town of Marblehead. After plans for restoration of the building in place were unsuccessful, the National Park Service accepted the building in 2003, and began several years of conservation on the original 18th century timbers.",

For the National Park Service, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frank-pinkley.htm\">Frank Pinkley </a>was just that. He was a farm boy from Missouri whose doctor ordered him to go to Arizona for six months in 1900 to recuperate from a mild case of tuberculosis. A year later he accepted a government job as caretaker of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cagr/index.htm\">Casa Grande Ruins National Monument</a>, where he lived in a tent and dug his own well.<br /> <br /> He went on to become the superintendent of the Southwestern National Monuments. Pinkley administered 27 national monuments across Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. He was excitedly planning the development of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument at the time of his death in 1940. \"The Boss,\" as Pinkley was affectionately known, left an extraordinary legacy. Pinkley wrote monthly essays and articles to his staff, which were compiled into the collection, <em>Ruminations from the Boss.</em> The interesting, often humorous essays written by Pinkley revealed his uncanny ability to explain, instruct, and entice his fellow Park Rangers in a fatherly way.<br /> <br />  ",

At the eastern base of the peak, about half a mile from the base, is the picnic area. The picnic area has several light colored ramadas (square shaped shade structures) with picnic tables. The picnic area has a vault restroom. To the east there are views of the Ajo Mountain Range, a small, flat, red-tinged mountain range. To the south are views of a double crested peak (Twin-peaks). Surrounding the area are vast swaths of desert plains and washes, dotted with creosote, palo verde, saguaros, organ pipe cacti, and ocotillos.",

            "bodyText": "<p>At the end of the Scenic Drive, take an easy stroll down Capitol Gorge, and about half a mile (0.8 km) from the trailhead, look at the north side of the canyon wall (left). Notice the many names, dates, and places carved, painted, and in one case, shot, into the sandstone. Prospectors, explorers, surveyors, cowboys, area settlers, and early visitors would often stand on their wagons to carve their names into the canyon wall. They were leaving their mark above flash flood danger, likely hoping their names would survive for centuries.<br /> <br /> These inscriptions provide an important log of those who passed through the region, and they offer insight into the men and women who left their names behind. The earliest inscriptions belong to two mineral prospectors, J.A. Call and Wal. Bateman. These men were probably in search of economic wealth from mining and travelled through Capitol Gorge September 20, 1871. Aside from their names, the date, and “PROSSPECTER,” very little is known about these two men. If they hadn’t left their mark, no one would know they were likely the earliest Euro-American presence in the Capitol Reef region. They were not part of a large, government-sponsored expedition, like the 1872 trip through Capitol Reef lead by Almon Thompson, under the larger J.W. Powell Expedition. <i>It is now illegal to carve, paint, scratch, or otherwise deface any canyon wall, historic, or archeological site. </i><br /> <br /> <i></i>The names of many early Fruita and Wayne County residents can be found on the register: E.P. Pectol, Aaron Holt, Walter and E.J. Hanks as well as members of the Oyler, Smith, Carrell, and Cook families.  <br /> <br /> Other notable local people include Hanksville shop owner C.A. Gibbons who supposedly furnished Zane Gray with the story of <em>Wildfire</em>, his 1915 novel. A group of French archeologists looking at ruins in the area also left their names behind: G. Guiraud, A. Pillaud, P. Brossard, and T. Breard on January 30, 1893. <br /> <br /> As you return to the parking lot, look for four inscriptions towards the top of the cliff, on the south side of the canyon walls. These names belong to surveyors. One of their descendants, Pam Stewart, provides the story behind them. Her great-uncle, John R. Stewart, and his half-brother Quinby, worked for the state of Utah as land surveyors in 1912. They had contracted a crew of University of Utah geology students to help them over the summer.  <br /> <br /> According to Pam and her family, “It is said that Quinby got the idea of fooling the new bunch, commenting on the speed of erosion in the Reef. One evening, leaning on the buck board, he said to his youthful and unexperienced crew, \"My how it erodes down here.\" After a pause he consulted John R., \"Isn't this the place we were at this time last year?\" Later, after dark, when the rest of the camp were asleep, Quinby and John R. took some ropes, hammers, and chisels and snuck off down the draw to where canyon wall was a sheer rock face about 50 feet high. There, they climbed to the top where Quinby was lowered over the edge and down the face. There he dangled in a rope chair, while he chiseled their names and last year's date in good engineering letters two feet high on the rock face.<br /> <br /> The next day as they were working in the canyon, Quinby remarked, \"I think we were standing about here when we carved our names in some rock face...\" He then pointed out the names and date to his hapless audience, with the comment that he had stood on the bed of a wagon to do the inscribing. This would have required about 40 feet of erosion in one year.<br /> <br /> The tale stops there, leaving it to the reader to imagine the amazement of the University crew, and the ensuing confusion when they confidently informed their professors of the rapid erosion in the southern deserts. One can only hope that some kind mentor set them straight before the joke went too far.”<br /> <br /> As you continue to explore, help protect Capitol Reef National Park by not leaving your mark. Make memories, take photos & leave no trace.The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/Laws/ARPA.htm\"><b>Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979</b></a> (ARPA) states that all acts of vandalism are illegal and are punishable by up to 2 years in prison and/or a $20,000 fine. Help spread the word and let others know that these activities are illegal.<br /> <br /> Anyone with information concerning vandalism within Capitol Reef National Park should immediately contact the National Park Service.

Now two blocks from its original location, the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation relocated and restored this meetinghouse in 1964.</p> <h2>Silent Waiting</h2> <p>Quakers held two meetings for worship each week. Men sat to the right of the partition, women to the left. The Quakers did not have a paid minister. They did not use music, symbols, or sacraments in their worship. Instead, they practiced \"silent waiting,\" or worshipping in silence as they sat on the rows of long wooden benches.</p> <h2>Moved by the Inward Light</h2> <p>If moved by the \"inward light\", a man or woman could stand and share their insights or prayers. Those known for their inspired messages, like Herbert's mother Hulda, became \"recorded ministers\" and sat on the facing benches with the elders.</p> <h2>Equality Before God</h2> <p>The Quakers strongly believed all people were equal before God. During monthly business meetings the partitions were closed, allowing women a chance at leadership independent of men. Hulda, active in the West Branch meeting, helped conduct revivals, founded and led a young people's prayer meeting, and took an active role in temperance campaigns that aimed to discourage alcohol consumption.</p> <h2>\"Long Hours of Meeting\"</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover described the meetings in his memoirs, \"Those acquainted with the Quaker faith, and who know the primitive furnishings of the Quaker meeting-house, the solemnity of the long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone, will know the intense repression upon a ten-year-old boy who might not even count his toes. All this may not have been in recreation, but it was strong training in patience.\"</p> <h2>Career of Conscience</h2> <p>Like his mother, Herbert Hoover, learned to put his beliefs into practice, as he demonstrated during decades of leadership. The Quakers' stress on the equal worth of all persons is evident in Hoover's global humanitarian work, his dedication to public service, and his faith in the opportunities afforded by American life.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Friends Meetinghouse 192 words Friends Meetinghouse. 1 ¼ minute. First of two descriptions at this location. The Friends Meetinghouse sits on the east side of Downey Street. The one-story structure is made of wood and painted eggshell white. A pitched roof of grey shingles slopes up from atop the west-facing façade. Two stout brick chimneys emerge from the peak—one on each side of the building. Four tall rectangular windows and two narrow double doors face out onto Downey Street. The meetinghouse is 40 feet wide, with an open-air porch on the left side. A level wooden walkway about 40 feet long extends from the boardwalk on Downey Street to the front of the building. At the intersection of Downey Street and this boardwalk an exhibit panel titled “Raised with Quaker Values” stands next to the board walk in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. Once you reach the building, you can turn left or right and enter through either doorway. Watch your step as you enter; there’s a small step at the threshold. The interior furnishings of the meetinghouse is described at another stop. End of message. Raised with Quaker Values 345 words Panel: “Raised with Quaker Values.” 2 minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. This panel features an illustration of a Quaker meetinghouse, rendered with a cutaway view of the interior. At the intersection of Downey Street with the boardwalk leading to Friends Meetinghouse, the panel titled “Raised with Quaker Values” stands in the grass. The angled panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. Text below the title reads: “In this meetinghouse, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, practiced principles of simplicity, honesty, equality, peace, and service to others. These values shaped young Hoover's character and were evident in his humanitarian endeavors and interest in public service. The Quakers worshiped in silence until the 'spirit' moved someone to speak. To encourage individual worship and female participation, men sat on one side of the partition and women and children on the other. Herbert's mother, Hulda, was an inspired speaker who sat with the elders in the front on raised benches. The congregation sat opposite. She conducted revivals, young people's prayer meetings, and temperance campaigns.” A quote from Herbert Hoover reads: “...the primitive furnishing of the Quaker meetinghouse, the solemnity of the long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone ... was strong training in patience.” In the illustration, a peaked gray roof stands atop the white, one-story meetinghouse. Through the cutaway section of the roof, we can see the layout of the unadorned rooms inside. The men's side is on the right, the women's side is on the left. In each partitioned room, members of the congregation sit in plain wooden pews, facing the elders and ministers. A door on the left leads from the women's side to a porch and a cry room, furnished with a few rocking chairs and cribs. In the illustration, several mothers hold their infants. A caption states: “The simple architecture and plain furnishings reflect Quaker values.” Another caption notes: “The meetinghouse, built in 1857 two blocks to your left, was moved here in 1964 and restored.” End of message.",

Hard work was a core value of the Quaker townsfolk, but so too was education-for both boys and girls. Herbert Hoover's own mother, Hulda had been a teacher in neighboring Muscatine County before she married. Because the Society of Friends raised much of the money for the construction of this one-room schoolhouse, it was also used as the town's first Quaker meetinghouse.</p> <h2>The Growing School</h2> <p>In 1869, after the town built a larger schoolhouse, this building was used as a classroom for the primary department, or youngest grades. Herbert Hoover entered public school in 1880 at age 5 and spent three years in the primary department. It is unknown if Hoover's class met in this building.</p> <h2>Pursuit of Higher Education</h2> <p>The value the Hoovers' placed on education paid off in 1891. 17-year old Bert Hoover enrolled at Stanford University, determined to become a mining engineer.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Schoolhouse 240 words Schoolhouse. 2 ½ minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. The schoolhouse is located about 50 feet to the northwest of the blacksmith shop off Penn Street. The small wooden building is painted a creamy off-white. The façade is 18 feet wide, with two rectangular windows on either side of a central doorway. The grey shingled roof rises to a peak above the doorway, and a brick chimney pokes up from the back of the modest structure. Two wooden walkways provide access from the main boardwalk that runs along the north side of Penn Street. The first intersects with the Penn Street boardwalk from directly in front of the schoolhouse. At this intersection an exhibit panel titled “Learning their A, B, Cs” stands next to the board walk in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. If you take this walkway you will need to climb four steps up to the building’s entrance. A second walkway about 20 feet to the right of that one provides access via ramp. The ramp heads north for about 30 feet and then turns west for another 20 feet along the front of the building. A metal railing lines the second half of the ramp. Watch your step on all walkways, especially during inclement weather, as the wood can be slippery when wet. The interior of the schoolhouse is described in a separate stop. End of message. Learning Their A, B, Cs. 380 words. Panel: “Learning their A, B, Cs.” 2 minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. The panel identifies the historic schoolhouse. The angled panel titled “Learning their A, B, Cs” stands next to the sidewalk that crosses the lawn to the Hoover Schoolhouse. Steps and a ramp lead up to the entrance of the white frame structure, topped with a peaked roof. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The title appears at the top of the panel above introductory text. The text reads: “Quakers, including the Hoovers, believed strongly in educating both boys and girls equally, and by 1853 West Branch's population was large enough to build this one-room schoolhouse. Because the Quakers had raised much of the funds, they also used it as their first meetinghouse. Herbert Hoover started school in 1879 at age five, but it is not known if he attended classes in this building even though his father and brother had. Orphaned at age nine, Herbert moved two years later to an uncle's home in Oregon, where he studied at a Quaker academy before joining Stanford University's first class in 1891.” A quote from Herbert Hoover states: “Iowa … was filled with days of school — and who does not remember with a glow some gentle woman, who with infinite patience and kindness drilled into us those foundations of all we know today.” The main image, a black and white photograph of a schoolroom, shows boys and girls sitting at wooden desks arranged in rows, some seated two to a bench. As the children face us, the teacher, a woman wearing a high-collared blouse, stands behind them at the chalkboard. A caption reads: “A West Branch schoolroom in the late 1800s.” The inset photograph shows four young men wearing hats and suits as they pose with surveying equipment, including a tripod and scope, and several measuring poles. A caption reads: “Hoover served on a geological surveying squad at Stanford in 1893. After graduating he became a successful mining engineer.” Text in the bottom right corner of the panel reads: “This schoolhouse originally stood two blocks away at Downey and Main streets. The National Park Service moved the schoolhouse here in 1968 for restoration.” End of message.",

It wasn’t until 1768 that Tumacácori became a cabecera – a mission that housed a resident priest. This likely caused a significant disturbance for the O’odham of Tumacácori. With only occasional visits from the priest, they could openly continue their traditional religious and social practices. Now, under the watchful eye of a resident priest, they had to conceal those practices in order to model Spanish and Catholic values.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff2d1174-089a-4e83-b380-b7a346cec46d}{72}\" paraid=\"1213708685\">This structure continued to serve the Tumacácori community long after the mission era. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, this remaining section of the convento served as a residence, a school, and later housed the museum of the fledgling Tumacácori National Monument. A herringbone-pattern floor currently duplicates and protects the original floor beneath one room. More than any other structure here it has seen many preservation techniques tried to protect it. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "This is a rectangular, walled, roofless ruin of this structure made of adobe brick and covered with a smooth brown plaster. The outside corners of the convento fragment are rounded, and on the western side of the structure there is a wooden-framed doorway extending about 1 foot above the surrounding plaster walls. Entrance via this doorway is blocked by a railing; however, one of the interior rooms is visible from the outside of this doorway and appears empty with floor of sandy, gravel ground sparsely covered with vegetation. Veined with cracks, the roofless adobe walls are quite uneven at the top and covered by a flat row of thin, red paving-type bricks. The structure's southern facing wall is held in place by four bulky, tapezoidal-shaped buttresses also covered with light brown adobe plaster. There is a horizontally rectangular, weathered wood-framed, double window opening to the right side of the four buttresses, and a single window opening to the left of the buttresses. In the center two buttresses is a worn, gray wooden doorway. Viewed from the inside, the structure is divided into two rectangular rooms separated by a worn wooden door frame. In the room in front of and to the east of the entrance door, one of the primary visible features is the rust-colored, dusty remains of a herringbone brick floor. The other notable feature is the rounded-cornered, traditional adobe fireplace with a conical chimney built into the corner of the room. A horizontally rectangular, double window opening made of weather-worn wood is located on the north side of the room near the fireplace, and it offers a view of the Franciscan church to the northwest, and the spacious church grounds to the north marked with the low-walled outline of the remains of the Jesuit church. The view is framed distantly to the north by a low berm of grass-covered earth that contains the buried remains of the north side of the convento structure.",

            "audioDescription": "The storeroom building is a roughly rectangular, roofless adobe structure located slightly northeast of the Franciscan church. Approaching the structure from the outside, it appears as a simple brown, plastered adobe structure with wavy, jagged walls of uneven heights. The front wall disappears to the right into a mound of grass-covered ground. Visible through the doorway is a steep plaster-coated staircase. Some light shines down into the open, roofless structure. As you enter the storeroom, the wide bank of 8 very steep stairs faces the doorway and rises all the way to the top of the wall. A nearby sign asks visitors to refrain from walking on the stairs. Attached to the stairs on both the left and right, sits a tall, rectangular, chest-high, plaster-covered adobe structure that appears much like an ancient counter or shelf. To the right, on the eastern side of the room, the wall is formed into a low adobe bench running the length of this side, with circular indentations on the top of the bench, many holding large, red clay pots. High above the pots near the top of this wall, a circular dark, wooden beam stretches the length of the wall resting on two square adobe pillars that are part of the wall structure. Perpendicular to this beam another beam emerges from the adobe wall stretching across the width of the structure. Another identical beam structure on the other side of the doorway is visible, although there are no pots on the other side of the room. High on the east and west walls, multiple holes are visible in a horizontal line, suggesting where other wooden beams may have previously pierced the adobe walls. On the north and south walls, the main notable features are another chest-high counter or shelf-like adobe square column which sits under a circular indentation or opening in the wall.",

For the best view, hike the one-mile roundtrip (1.5 km) trail to the first overlook (climbing 100 feet/30 meters).</p> <h4>What Happened Here?</h4> <p>Canyonlands is a place of relative geologic order, with rock layers that have not been altered, tilted or folded significantly in the millions of years since they were laid down by ancient seas, rivers or winds.</p> <p>In the area of Upheaval Dome, approximately three miles (5 km) across, rock layers are dramatically deformed. In the center, the rocks are pushed up into a circular structure called a dome, or an anticline. Surrounding this dome is a downwarp in the rock layers called a syncline. What caused these folds at Upheaval Dome? Geologists do not know for sure, but there are two main theories which are hotly debated.</p> <h4><strong>Salt Dome Hypothesis</strong></h4> <p>A thick layer of salt, formed by the evaporation of ancient landlocked seas, underlies much of southeastern Utah and Canyonlands National Park. When under pressure from thousands of feet of overlying rock, the salt can flow plastically, like ice moving at the bottom of a glacier. In addition, salt is less dense than sandstone. As a result, over millions of years salt can flow up through rock layers as a \"salt bubble\", rising to the surface and creating salt domes that deform the surrounding rock.</p> <p>When geologists first suggested that Upheaval Dome was the result of a salt dome, they believed the land form resulted from erosion of the rock layers above the dome itself. Recent research suggests that a salt bubble as well as the overlying rock have been entirely removed by erosion and the present surface of Upheaval Dome is the pinched off stem below the missing bubble. If true, Upheaval Dome would earn the distinction of being the most deeply eroded salt structure on earth.</p> <h4><strong>Impact Crater Hypothesis</strong></h4> <p>When meteorites collide with the earth, they leave impact craters like the well-known one in Arizona. Some geologists estimate that roughly 60 million years ago, a meteorite with a diameter of approximately one-third of a mile hit at what is now the Upheaval Dome. The impact created a large explosion, sending dust and debris high into the atmosphere. The impact initially created an unstable crater that partially collapsed. As the area around Upheaval Dome reached an equilibrium, the rocks underground heaved upward to fill the void left by the impact. Erosion since the impact has washed away any meteorite debris, and now provides a glimpse into the interior of the impact crater, exposing rock layers once buried thousands of feet underground.</p> <h4><strong>Upheaval Dome Today</strong></h4> <p><a href=\"http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/36/3/227.abstract\">Recent research findings</a> support the meteorite hypothesis, but questions still remain. Within Canyonlands National Park, Upheaval Dome serves as a protected geologic laboratory where all can learn about, and be inspired by, the mysteries of nature. Perhaps, with time, we may solve the mystery of this crater and others on our planet.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "This pull off is located on the west side of the Natchez Trace Parkway. There is a paved parking lot with space for 4 or 5 cars. Near the parking lot there is two interpretative wayside exhibits. One wayside exhibit is about Choctaw Indian removal and has audio so you can hear from modern Choctaw people. This exhibit, titled “Broken Promises,” features an illustration of a group of Choctaw walking in the snow, away from their Eastern homeland. A map shows the lands ceded by treaties, and a photograph of a commemoration of Choctaw removal. The route the Choctaw took is in the distance, beyond the panel. The landscape is now mixed forest and fields. [Text] After 1800, treaties between the Choctaw and the US government whittled away tribal rights and lands. Finally, in 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was negotiated at a council house near this spot. All the remaining Choctaw homeland— nearly 10.5 million acres—was taken. From 1831 through 1834, thousands of Choctaw trekked over 500 miles to “Indian Territory.” The US War Department had promised in 1830 to “be kind and brotherly to them…to furnish them with ample corn and beef, or pork for themselves and their families.” Instead, the Choctaw had inadequate clothing and supplies. Heavy rain, blizzard-like snowfall, and a shortage of wagons turned the forced removal deadly. On the map, Choctaw land is flanked by the Mississippi River on the west and extends into portions of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Natchez Trace runs northeast to southwest across the Choctaw homeland to the port of Natchez on the Mississippi River. Treaties in 1801, 1802, 1805, 1816, and 1820 took two thirds of the Choctaw homeland. The 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek took the remainder. You are standing along the Natchez Trace in the Choctaw’s land ceded in 1820. [Text] Choctaw artist Gwen Coleman Lester captures the harsh conditions and tribal determination to survive at the core of Choctaw removal. In her painting, the Choctaw, most staring ahead, walk forward on snow-covered ground. They are wrapped in blankets, and wear moccasins. Leafless trees surround them. A man in front uses a walking stick. To the left of the man, a child carries a bundle on its back. To the right, a woman with down turned eyes holds a baby in a blanket. Two uniformed soldiers on horseback watch the Choctaw pass by. The group stretches across a creek in the distance. At the back, livestock pull wagons. A photo shows a uniformed honor guard leading a crowd down a paved road. The honor guards wear red berets. Two carry flags and two have shouldered rifles. The day is bright and sunny. The trees are in full leaf. [Text] Tribal members from the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma walk each year to memorialize their ancestors who survived and perished on the Trail of Tears. The exhibit panel has a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway. Several yards to your right, there is a group of three, routed wood signs with more information about the Choctaw homeland and treaties.",

Being close to such a large village, like Big Hidatsa, would have helped provide protection from the Sioux. They lived in Taylor Bluff Village from 1834 until 1845. In 1845, all the Hidatsa vacated the Knife River area to settle, north, at Like-A-Fishhook Village. Like-A-Fishhook Village was inundated when the Garrison Dam was completed in 1950. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b1c75d2c-7fcb-4f85-8308-eac53f947e63}{118}\" paraid=\"2039614745\">In 1837 another smallpox epidemic came to the villages on the upper Missouri River.

            "audioDescription": "What Happened to the Earthlodge Builders?  \"In the spring of 1834, ...the Sioux launched a massive attack on the villages at the month of the Knife River and burned Sakakawea and Amahami to the ground.\" (Stewart 1974:296)   The Amahami Village was where the city of Stanton now stands.     The Awatixa Hidatsa started another village known as Taylor Bluff south of Big Hidatsa. Being close to such a  large village, like Big Hidatsa, would have helped provide protection from the Sioux. They lived in Taylor Bluff Village from 1834 until 1845. In 1845 all the Hidatsa vacated the Knife River area to settle, north, at Like-A-Fishhook Village. Like-A-Fishhook Village was inundated when the Garrison Dam was completed in 1950.  In 1837 another smallpox epidemic came to the villages on the upper Missouri River. Again the loss of life was devastating to the tribes. Over 50% of the Hidatsa and Arikara surcumbed to smallpox. Over 90% of the Mandan population died leaving only 138 Mandan. Before they encountered Europeans, the Mandan population was estimated to have been 10,000 to 15,000 strong.  Resilient, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara have joined together to establish the Three Affiliated Tribes (MHA Nation) in Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Their membership is 16,900 strong.  To find out more, please, follow the links below.  Why weren't they vaccinated?  Four Bears Last Words  History of Hidatsa: Post-1845 River-Centered Built so close to the river, Awatixa Village and other nearby sites suggest a pattern – a vital link between Hidatsa culture and the riverine environment. The Missouri River and its tributaries provided fish, fertile soil for crops, and a green world of berries and wild game below the semi-arid prairie. While the river made permanent settlement possible, it also brought inexorable change. Europeans and Americans used the Missouri River as their primary trade route. Mandans and Hidatsas began to be absorbed into the Euro-American economy, and were exposed to diseases from which they had no immunity. Below the text is a map of trade routes captioned as: Routes and centers of intertribal trade in 1805. Intertribal trade predated contact with Europeans. The map shows Mandan and Hidatsa traded with a Shoshoni trade center in Wyoming, Arikara trade center in South Dakota, a Dakota trade center and the Cheyanne, Arapahoe Comanche and Apache and Kiowa trade route. Painting of the Steamboat Yellow Stone on the Missouri River, from a painting by Karl Bodmer “People of the Willows” A bullboat was made from a freshly shinned buffalo hide stretched over a frame of willow branches. The craft could transport several hundred pounds of passengers or cargo, yet was light enough for one person to carry. Built and primarily navigated by the women of the village, bullboats floated dried meat downriver from buffalo hunts far to the west. Sketch of two women make a bullboat.",

Eventually, the trail takes you above tree line and through a talus (look rock) slope. Watch your footing. Stacked and worn rocks will show you the way. The majority of the elevation gain will be towards the end of the trail. At times, you will get a view of Stella Lake glistening below. There is no protection along the way, so exposure level to wind and weather is high. Reserve 6-8 roundtrip to complete this hike. Bring plenty of water and gear. ",

SMITH<br /> <br /> <strong>Battle Summary:</strong><br /> On the morning of July 14, the Battle of Tupelo began at 7:30 a.m. when the Confederates began a series of uncoordinated charges against the Federal position. These attacks were beaten back with heavy losses to the Confederates. Failing to break the Federal center, the Confederates attacked the Federal right again without success. After dark, the Confederates made another attack from the south without significant effect. Although his troops had repulsed several Confederate attacks, Federal General Andrew Jackson Smith ordered his men back towards Memphis. His army would engage the Confederate forces several miles outside of town on July 15, 1864 at what is called the Battle of Old Town Creek.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tupe/index.htm\">Battle of Tupelo National Battlefield</a> for additional Information.<br /> <br />  ",

Use your imagination to replace some of the fields with forests and swamps. Imagine what it would be like to traverse the area in 1812, on a horse. It sounds like the reverend had a soggy time.<br /> <br /> Water was always a critical survival factor for early travelers. In the west, it was frequently lack of water. In the southeast, it was sometimes too much water. This area averages about 55 inches of rain per year, but yearly totals of rainforest proportion, over 80 inches, have been recorded.<br /> <br /> Take a moment and contemplate being exposed to so much water during all seasons of the year, over weeks or months with no indoor shelter. This was the plight of early travelers on the Old Trace. <br /> <br /> Please note that this is not a circular drive and large RVs will have trouble negotiating the parking area. ",

It was Broughton who gave Baker Bay its moniker, naming it after a British merchant, Captain James Baker, whose ship happened to be anchored just inside the Columbia’s mouth when Broughton passed through.<br /> <br /> Years later, on November 15, 1805, Baker Bay, a popular spot for ships to shelter, would receive a new name. Lewis and Clark had just rounded “Point Distress” and established Station Camp on the sandy shore of the bay. They chose to call it Haley’s Bay in honor of a European trader that the local natives said to be their favorite. Clark mentions this in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“This Bay we call Haleys bay from a favourate Trader with the Indians which they Say comes into this Bay and trades with them.”</p> </blockquote> Today, visitors can access or view Baker Bay from a variety of locations. The town of Ilwaco, Washington, for example, is located inside the bay, as are Chinook Point and Cape Disappointment State Park.   ",

The terrible weather had made it impossible to stay at their current camp and had left them all wet and miserable, to the point that even their clothing was beginning to rot away.<br /> <br /> When the weather worsened a few days later, the expedition was forced to relocate once more on November 12 in the hopes of finding a drier campsite. Clark describes the dire weather and the new camp in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“A Tremendious wind from the S. W. about 3 oClock this morning with Lightineng and hard claps of Thunder, and Hail which Continued untill 6 oClock a. m. when it became light for a Short time, then the heavens became Sudenly darkened by a black Cloud from the S. W. and rained with great violence untill 12 oClock, the waves tremendious brakeing with great fury against the rocks and trees on which we were encamped. our Situation is dangerous. we took the advantage of a low <em>tide</em> and moved our camp around a point to a Small wet bottom at the mouth of a Brook, which we had not observed when we Came to this cove; from it being verry thick and obscured by drift trees and thick bushes…” </p> </blockquote> The point of land that Clark describes is located at the upstream end of Hungry Harbor and is known as Cliff Point. Unfortunately, this meant that the crew was separated from their cargo by half a mile, as they were unable to carry it with them. The canoes were left to “the mercy of the waves,” having been secured to the best of their ability by using stones to sink them and keep them from being dashed to pieces against the rocks.  <br /> <br /> The weather finally let up on November 15, and the expedition hurriedly loaded their gear into the canoes. They made it around Point Distress (modern-day Point Ellice) where they established Station Camp, which would serve as their base of operations until November 24.<br /> <br /> Today, Cliff Point can be viewed from the Lewis and Clark Trail Highway (WA-401), approximately two miles southwest of Knappton, Washington. There is no marker at this location, but there is a pullout for vehicles on the harbor side of the road.",

It stretches for miles along the Oregon coast. Among the many species that make their home here are the Tufted Puffins, Common Murres, Black Oystercatchers, sea lions, and seals.<br /> <br /> Within the refuge are 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands, all of which have been designated National Wilderness Areas. One of the most iconic and recognizable of these is Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach, Oregon. On January 8, 1806, William Clark and a few other men of the Lewis and Clark Expedition had arrived in the area searching for a blue whale that the local tribes had reported to them. They were hoping to harvest a bit of meat from the carcass to bolster their dwindling supplies, but it was not to be. When they found the animal, the 105-foot-long behemoth was indeed laying net to Haystack Rock, but it was little more than a skeleton. A few days later, when the men returned to Fort Clatsop, another expedition member who had remained behind with Meriwether Lewis and the rest of the party, Joseph Whitehouse, recorded their report in his journal on January 10, 1806, saying: <blockquote> <p>“…In the evening late <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Captain Clark</a> & some of the party returned to the Fort. they informed us that they had been about 25 Miles along the Sea Coast, nearly a South course to see the Whale, <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-10#n27011016\"><sup>[16]</sup></a> expecting to get some of the Meat of it, and that they had to pass over rough <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rockey mountains</a>, <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-10#n27011017\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> to get to the place where the whale lay, & that the Indians had showed them, to where a whale lay; which had been a long time Dead, which was on a very large Rock.

The party got some of the Jaw bones &ca…”</p> </blockquote> Rising 235 feet above the shoreline, Haystack Rock is an irregular basalt formation that was first created some 17 million years ago as lava flowed through the old Columbia River drainage system and intruded into soft marine sediments. Erosion and geologic uplift eventually revealed it and the many other large stone formations along the coast.<br /> <br /> Today, Haystack Rock is protected as one of Oregon’s seven Marine Gardens. It’s a popular location for tidepooling and, at low tide, visitors can walk right up to the enormous rock. A wide variety of birds can also be seen year-round. Gray Whales, Humpback Whales, Orcas, and Sperm Whales are often spotted from December to March. Visitors are encouraged to bring binoculars, spotting scopes, and cameras if they want to spot some of the giant creatures out in the water.<br /> <br /> The Haystack Rock Awareness Program presents interpretive programs from February to late October. Program schedules are available from City Hall, local businesses, and the Chamber of Commerce Information Center. For more information on visiting, see the city’s website at <a href=\"https://www.cannonbeach.org/things-to-do/beaches-and-parks/haystack-rock/\">Oregon Coast Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach Oregon</a>.",

The chapel is an irregular-shaped one-story masonry building that was constructed in 1941. Designed by the prominent African-American architect Albert Irvin Cassell, FAIA (1985-1969), the building embodies a modem interpretation of the Collegiate Gothic style.  It was intended to serve both as worship space and as a social center for students. The building is faced with roughly cut local stone, with cast-stone decorative detailing and a slate roof; buttresses, decorative ironwork, and a complex roofline with low parapets are its defining architectural characteristics.<br /> <br /> In 1867 a group of ministers met at Sharp Street Church in Baltimore to establish the Centenary Biblical Institute. That institution grew, and in time the curriculum was broadened and the name was changed to Morgan College in honor of a generous benefactor. In the 1920s the school was moved to its present site. The economic depression of the 1930s put the school's future in jeopardy, and in 1939, the trustees decided to sell the college to the State of Maryland. The proceeds from that transaction were earmarked for the construction of a center for religious and student activities (the present chapel), a parsonage (demolished), and an endowment. The buildings were erected on a plot of land adjacent to the campus, and were dedicated December 16, 1941.<br /> <br /> The Chapel was originally named after Susie Carr Love, the first African American female graduate in 1878 of the Centenary Biblical Institute and mother of the prominent educator and Methodist Bishop Edgar Amos Love, founder of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. The name, Morgan State University Memorial Chapel, recognizes that although founded by and receiving support from the United Methodist Church, it is primarily an ecumenical institution. It is a place for cooperation and activities of representatives of all religious faiths. The chapel provides a place for regular formal worship, for informal religious meetings or conferences, and for weddings and funerals, primarily but not exclusively, for persons associated with the University. Its facilities provide space for a variety of activities by various organization and individuals in the Baltimore area.<br /> <br /> <strong>Albert I. Cassell, F AJA, architect:</strong><br /> <br /> Records of the American Institute of Architects indicate that Cassell was the eighth registered African American architect in the nation. In addition to several projects on Morgan's campus, Cassell is noted for having designed buildings for several Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). He was also responsible for planning complete community projects in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia. Albert I. Cassell was a prominent mid-twentieth-century visionary architect who excelled in a field that was scarcely ready to accept African Americans early on. The structures that he designed, constructed, or altered were scattered from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, Maryland, and were located as far away as Tuskegee, Alabama, where his career began. An educator as well, he set the tone for architectural training at Howard University, providing the structure for educating black youth in the field.<br /> <br /> After receiving his degree from Cornell, Cassell joined William Augustus Hazel at Tuskegee Institute (subsequently Tuskegee University) in Alabama in designing five trade buildings. In 1920 he became chief draftsman for architect Howard J. Wiegner in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, designing silk mills and industrial plants. Two years later the men collaborated as architects for the Home Economics Building at Howard University, Washington, D.C.<br /> <br /> Cassell joined the Howard architectural faculty, under Hazel's leadership, in 1920, and then succeeded him in 1922 as assistant professor and head of the department. He was also named university architect. He put in place a firm foundation for developing the Department of Architecture in the School of Applied Science. By 1934, he developed the School of Applied Science into the College of Engineering and Architecture. Cassell is largely responsible for developing Howard's campus, as he created in 1920 the university's \"Twenty Year Plan\" ( or Master Plan) for expansion and designed most of the buildings around the quadrangle.<br />  ",

This small public park was once the site of a prosperous native village, known as NeCus’ to the local tribes, prior to colonization.<br /> <br /> It was here, in January 1806, that William Clark and a few members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, while searching for a 105-foot beached whale, met with members of the local tribes from whom they bought whale oil and blubber. Expedition member Hugh McNeal also nearly met his end here because of a plot to steal his clothes and blanket by a man visiting from a distant village. McNeal was saved by a Tillamook woman who, upon realizing she couldn’t stop him from going with the man, alerted the other men of the village to the danger.  <br /> Today, Necus’ Park is incredibly important to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes. In 2016, a 10-foot cedar statue of a young Clatsop man, called a welcoming pole, was erected along the bank of Ecola Creek at the park’s edge. Carved by native artist, Guy Capoeman, the welcoming pole commemorates a time, prior to the arrival of Europeans, when the tribes traveling to the Columbia River or Nehalem Bay would visit one another and attend celebrations and potlatches (gift-giving events to celebrate friendship between members).<br /> <br /> The statue is one of the highlights on the Cannon Beach Public Art Walking Tour, a 1.5-mile self-guided tour through the city.

Before the arrival of Europeans, Chinook villages stretched along the numerous waterways that fed into the Columbia River, including the area at Tansy Point. It was here, on November 24, 1805, that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark’s Corps of Discovery paused to take a vote on their next campsite. While here, they also met with members of the local Chinook tribes.<br /> <br /> Clark recorded the visit in his journal, stating: <blockquote> <p>“A fair morning Sent out 6 hunters, and we proceeded to make the following observations <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1805-11-24#n26112407\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> a Chief and Several men of the <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Chinook%20Indians\">Chin nook</a> </em>nation Came to Smoke with us this evening one of the men brought a Small Sea otter Skin for which we gave Some blue beads— this day proved fair which gave us an oppertunity of drying our wet articles, bedding &c. &c. nothing killed to day except one Brant. the variation of the Compass is 16° East.”</p> </blockquote> The vote itself was recorded by John Ordway, an expedition member, who wrote: <blockquote> <p>“clear pleasant morning. a white frost Several men went out a hunting we put out our baggage to air. The Calumbian River at this place is three miles 660 yards wide. Some of two nations of Indians came to our Encampment the Clatsop and Chinuck nations they behave very well as yet. our officers conclude with the oppinion of the party to cross the River and look out a place for winters quarter<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px;\">  </span> Some where as near the ocean as possable on the account of makeing Salt.”</p> </blockquote> The vote regarding the expedition’s winter quarters is thought to be a rather momentous event in early U.S. history as the first vote in the Pacific Northwest. It’s considered especially noteworthy because Clark’s slave, York, and Sacagawea also voted.<br /> <br /> Several years later, in 1851, Tansy Point served as the meeting point between the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Oregon Territory, Anson Dart, and representatives from several Chinook nations. The results of these meetings are collectively known as the Tansy Point Treaties. Sadly, the treaties were never ratified by the U.S. government, and the participating tribes lost their land without receiving any of the promised rights outlined in the treaties. They still struggle for federal recognition to this day.  <br /> <br /> Visitors to the Tansy Point will find spectacular views of the Columbia River and the town of Astoria, located three miles away. A scenic overlook with interpretive panels known as the Lewis and Clark Observation Platform marks the historical location of Lewis and Clark’s stay.<br /> <br /> The observation platform can be found by following the Warrenton Waterfront Trail. The trail runs for 4.7 miles through the city of Warrenton. Parking for the trail can be found at both its northern end at Seafarer’s Park and its southern end at Skipanon River Park, with an additional parking area located near the trail’s middle at Eben H. Carruther’s Memorial Park on Fort Stevens Highway. The trailhead at Eben H. Carruther’s Memorial Park is the closest one to Tansy Point.<br /> <br /> For more information on the Warrenton Waterfront Trail, visit <a href=\"https://www.traillink.com/trail/warrenton-waterfront-trail/#trail-detail-parking\">Warrenton Waterfront Trail</a>.

            "audioDescription": "Tansy Point overlooks the Columbia River. From the overlook, one can see the town of Astoria, some three miles away, and Tongue Point across the water. The Lewis and Clark Observation Platform located at Tansy Point is surrouned by a raised wooden platform and railing. Two interpretive panels are installed here which tell the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition's travels, as well as the first vote in the Pacific Northwest.",

Follow Lake Street to the town’s City Park, and park alongside it on the river side of the playground. From there, it’s a short walk to the Columbia River.

There is a large river that flows into the southeast part of <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Baker%20%28Haley%27s%29%20Bay\">Hayley's Bay</a>; upon which, about 20 miles from its mouth, our hunters discovered falls, which had about 60 feet of a perpendicular pitch.”</p> </blockquote> Located just ten miles south of the city of Astoria, Oregon, Youngs River Falls is a popular summer recreation spot for swimming. Here, the warm waters of the Youngs River tumble over a rocky 54-foot drop to a pool below, the deepest point of which is between five to seven feet and surrounded by dense forest. From the parking lot, a short 0.25-mile trail leads downhill from the parking lot to the base of the waterfall. The waterfall can also be seen from the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Admission to the site is free and is open year-round for day-use only. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a leash. Climbing and cliff jumping are not permitted. For more information, visit https://oregondiscovery.com/youngs-river-falls.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The beauty of Amalik is the ability to see a dynamic natural and cultural landscape, more or less as it has been, for hundreds, thousands of years. Most archeological sites are impacted by time and development, but Amalik allows you to see the land as people saw it coming in on their kayaks.The archeological district is a National Historic Landmark and thus afforded the highest degree of protection for historic properties.</p> <h4><br /> Ancient Villages</h4> <p>Over 7,000 years ago, early settlers in the Gulf of Alaska built homes on tiny islands at Amalik Bay in Katmai National Park and Preserve. For thousands of years after, Amalik Bay was home to families dependent upon the natural wealth of the Katmai coast. They left behind a variety of hunting, fishing, and household artifacts. Archeologists have found over two dozen archaeological sites in Amalik Bay.</p> <p>Where these people came from, how they connected with other groups, and the lifeways of their communities are important parts of Alaska's history.</p> <h4><br /> A Gathering Place</h4> <p>Some of the artifacts found in Amalik Bay are similar to those found in the Aleutian Islands, the Kodiak Islands, and other places around the Gulf of Alaska. This could mean that people in Amalik Bay were related somehow to other groups in the region, trading information and resources with them. The Amalik Bay settlers positioned themselves at a natural gateway between the Kodiak Islands to the east and Bristol Bay on the west.</p> <p>Amalik Bay served as a gathering place where communities captured fish, migratory birds, sea mammals, and shellfish. The types of animals captured and their ranges in size and age, indicate that people usually lived in Amalik Bay during the spring and summer months.</p> <h4><br /> Enduring Environmental Change</h4> <p>As time went by, the local environment was altered by sea-level changes, volcanic eruptions, and shifting climate. Adapting to changes in the environment required changes in technology and increasing interactions with other groups in the region. This is apparent in the gradual growth in diversity of tool types, a broadening of the variety of animals hunted, and eventually the manufacture of pottery.</p> <p>Between 2800 and 1800 years ago, there seems to be a gap in human occupation in Amalik Bay. Researchers are uncertain if this is because people were, for social or environmental reasons, compelled to abandon the area. Another possibility is that archaeological remains from this period were demolished by changes in the physical environment of the bay, for instance because of sea-level rise or earthquakes.</p> <h4><br /> Stone Tools and Cultural Phases</h4> <p>There are six archaeological cultural phases found in Amalik Bay. These phases are based on the types of stone tools found in the bay and the radiocarbon dates of the deposits they're found in.</p> <p>The first phase, found throughout the region, is the Paleoarctic cultural tradition. There's evidence that the Gulf of Alaska was settled sometime around 10,000 years ago but the rarity of these Paleoarctic sites makes it hard to understand what people were doing then. From what's known so far, Paleoarctic settlers in the region were more familiar with inland resources, like caribou. The people that came after were well versed in maritime traditions, such as fishing and hunting sea mammals.</p> <p>In Amalik Bay, the Pacific Period of the Alder Phase lasted from 6000 - 4500 years ago. The Takli Period-Birch Phase followed from 4500 - 2800 years ago. Then there was the Kukak Period-Cottonwood Phase from 1800 - 1500 years ago. The Kukak Period-Beach Phase (1500 - 1000 years ago), and the Katmai Period-Mound Phase (1000 - 500 years ago) were the last settlements in Amalik Bay.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.adn.com/article/20150301/ancient-cod-bones-carry-modern-warning-about-mercury-climate-change\">Ancient Cod Bones Carry Modern Warning about Mercury and Climate Change, Anchorage Daily News, 2015</a></p> <p>The \"Mink Island, Amalik Bay\" chapter of <em>Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia</em>, Vol. 4 West Coast and Arctic/Subarctic, published by Greenwood Press in 2009.

            "bodyText": "Located in Astoria, Oregon, the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column serves as a monument to the history Pacific Northwest. The idea for the column first came about in 1898 when the city thought to build an electrified tower that would rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. In 1914, the project began to take its first tentative steps toward becoming a reality when the City of Astoria bought 30 acres of land on Coxcomb Hill. By 1917, a flagpole was erected on the site, and Astor Park was officially created just in time for the town’s 4<sup>th</sup> of July celebration.<br /> <br /> From 1917 to 1925, little progress was made on the tower project. Then, in 1925, Ralph Budd, president of the Great Northern Railway, approached New York architect, Electus Litchfield, with the renewed interest. Together with artist Attilio Pusterla, they formulated a plan to erect a column decorated with a sgraffito-style painted histogram recounting the region’s history spanning from the discovery of the Columbia River to the arrival of the railroad. Construction began in March of 1926, and the Astoria Column was officially dedicated during a celebration attended by 8,000 people on July 22, 1926.<br /> <br /> Today, the Astoria Column attracts visitors from around the world. Pusterla’s sgraffito artwork, an ancient technique in which images are engraved into wet plaster and then colored powders are hand-blown into the outlines, is a source of wonder for many. The lower bands begin with Captain Gray’s arrival to the Columbia River in May 1792, and his first contact with the Chinook and Clatsop tribes. As it winds up to the top of the column, the histogram continues with the Lewis and Clark Expedition’s arrival in the area, the arrival of the first European settlers, and ends with the arrival of the railroad to Astoria in 1893.<br /> <br /> Admission to the park is free, but visitors are required to purchase a 1-year parking pass for $5 per vehicle. Visitors may climb the inside of the tower to the observation deck at the top, which provides a spectacular view of Astoria and the Columbia River. The gift shop’s hours of operation vary, and visitors are encouraged to call the monument at (503) 325-2963 for current hours. More information can also be found at the Astoria Column’s website at <a href=\"https://astoriacolumn.org/\">The Astoria Column</a>.",

A door opens into the base of the tower, allowing visitors access to the sprial staircase that leads up to the observation deck at the top of the tower. Outside the tower, a histogram winds around the tower, providing a pictographic history of the area, starting with the discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 and ending with the arrival of the railroad to Astoria in 1893.",

            "bodyText": "Located in Astoria, Oregon, the Astoria Riverwalk trail stretches along the city’s waterfront, following a portion of the Astoria & Columbia River Railroad. This 12.8 mile walk provides visitors with a walking tour of the area, with plenty of opportunity to indulge in spectacular views of Youngs Bay and the Astoria-Megler Bridge, a variety of shopping and dining options, and locations of historical significance, such as the Maritime Memorial and the Columbia River Maritime Museum.<br /> <br /> Tongue Point, visible near the end of the trail near the lagoons, is significant to the Lewis & Clark Expedition. The men camped here on March 23, 1806, after wintering at Fort Clatsop. An interpretive panel is installed on the Astoria Riverwalk that commemorates their stay. A bench commemorating Keith Hay, author of <i>The Lewis & Clark Columbia River Water Trail</i> guidebook, is situated next to the panel. Additional interpretive exhibits can be found along the trail, providing historical information.<br /> <br /> The trailhead can be accessed from Lagoon Road. The gravel parking lot is well-marked, and the trail itself is wheelchair accessible, being either paved with asphalt or comprised of a wooden boardwalk, depending on the section one happens to be on. Those who don’t want to make the return trip on foot can catch the Astoria Trolley at the East Mooring Basin back to the trailhead for a small $1 per person fare.<br /> <br /> For more information on the trail, visit TrailLink’s website at <a href=\"https://www.traillink.com/trail/astoria-riverwalk/\">Astoria Riverwalk</a>. For information on what Astoria has to offer, visit the city's website at <a href=\"http://www.astoriaoregon.com/\">Astoria Oregon</a>.",

            "bodyText": "The Wire Road, which runs through Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield, has a colorful history. Thousands of years ago, buffalo and other wildlife created natural paths across the Ozarks. Native Americans established migratory routes on these trails including the current Wire Road. French trappers, Spanish explorers and settlers from Tennessee and Kentucky used the route to access new areas and resources like iron, zinc, lead, timber, and stone. A portion of another Native American route, the Trail of Tears, lies just outside Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield, a remnant of the tragic era of forced removal of tribes including the Cherokee.<br /> <br /> By 1836, the young Missouri state government had established a formal road between Springfield and Fayetteville, Arkansas. Emigrants of European descent soon settled in the Wilson’s Creek area on the rich bottomlands near this main thoroughfare.In 1846, Joseph Burdin began carrying mail on a route from Springfield, Missouri, to Fayetteville, Arkansas, using a two-horse stage. One of the stops was the home of postmaster and farmer John A. Ray, who lived near Wilson’s Creek. The Ray farmhouse, which stands in the national park today, continued as a mail stop when John Butterfield founded the county’s first transcontinental mail service – the famed Butterfield Overland Mail Co. Between 1858 and 1861, Butterfield stagecoaches spirited mail and passengers from St. Louis down to Arkansas and on to California on a 2800-mile journey lasting 25 days (traveling day and night). John Ray’s home was the first unscheduled stop for Butterfield coaches after leaving Springfield. But the coming of railroad and telegraph ended the overland stages.<br /> <br /> Telegraph revolutionized communications during the Civil War. The U.S. military installed telegraph wire along the road from Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis to Fort Smith, Arkansas. The Union depended on telegraph communications, and when Southern troops or sympathizers cut telegraph lines, Federal troops often responded by burning homes near damaged lines. On August 10, 1861, John Ray sat on the front porch of his home on the Wire Road and watched smoke rise from fighting in his cornfield during the battle of Wilson’s Creek. His wife and children hid in the cellar during the fighting. Though the home survived and none of family was injured, their life changed dramatically, as the home became a field hospital and they lost much of their produce and livestock to soldiers. Over the next four years of the conflict, the Wire Road, also known as the Military Road, served as a major corridor for supplies and troops between Arkansas and Missouri. The road remained a mail route and Ray continued as postmaster until 1866.<br /> <br /> Today, the “Old Wire Road” no longer connects one point to another, but traces may be found on farmland, in conservation areas and at Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield. You can step onto the Wire Road in front of the John Ray Home at Tour Stop 2, and also may walk down the tour road a short distance west, where a marked walking trail continues along the old Wire Road route. The Wire Road trail also crosses the tour road near Tour Stop 5.",
            "audioDescription": "A narrow unpaved road crosses through several areas of the park including where it runs directly in front of a historic farm house and then runs down a slope between overhanging trees and through other scenic areas and on beyond the park boundaries.",

The national park and this section of Route 66 are not to be missed, and one of the most special places to visit in the park is the Painted Desert Inn.<br /> <br /> The inn is situated on a mesa overlooking the vast and colorful Painted Desert. It is rooted in a lodge that entrepreneur Herbert David Lore completed around 1920. In 1935, the National Park Service purchased the inn and its surroundings, and immediately began planning to overhaul the building using the rustic aesthetic so popular in park architecture of the time. The National Park Service commissioned Lyle Bennett, one of its most sought-after architects, for the remodeling. Young men employed in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), one of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration’s back-to-work programs, supplied the labor.<br /> <br /> The inn is of wood and native stone in the Pueblo Revival style. Outside, flagstone terraces surrounded by low walls overlook the desert. The building’s stone walls are more than two feet thick and finished with textured earth-toned stucco. Multiple flat roofs with parapets give the inn its varied massing, and Ponderosa Pine logs pierce the walls, adding play between light and shadow.<br /> <br /> One construction foreman noted the importance of the building’s details. Its openings, for instance, had semi-oval shapes rather than right-angled edges. He commented that: \"This shape was produced in the rock and plaster to resemble the openings in old pueblo buildings where the wet adobe was shaped by the sweeping motions of the women's arms that shortened the horizontal width of the opening at the top and bottom. Consider the difficulty of teaching a journeyman mason to understand…After much arm waving they got the message and were able to proceed.” That same foreman recalled how the concrete floors, walls, and furniture made the whole interior glow with soft, blended coloring. The CCC used ponderosa pine and aspen poles from Arizona forests for the <em>vigas</em> or roof beams and crafted handmade light fixtures from tin and wooden tables and chairs with American Indian designs. The concrete floors in the dining room and viewing porch had etched and painted patterns from Navajo blanket designs.<br /> <br /> The inn opened in 1940 under the management of the Fred Harvey Company, which was famous in the Southwest for providing hospitality services to tourists and travelers on the Santa Fe Railroad. For two years, the inn offered Route 66 travelers food, souvenirs, and lodging, and local people with event and meeting space. It closed in 1942, as American involvement with World War II shifted resources away from domestic programs.<br /> <br /> In 1947, the Harvey Company’s noted architect and interior designer, Mary Jane Colter, was given responsibility for renovations of the facility. Along with overseeing repair work, Colter created a new interior color scheme and made other changes. New plate glass windows to capitalize on the magnificent surrounding landscape were an important addition. At Colter’s behest, Hopi artist Fred Kabotie painted murals on the dining room and lunchroom walls that are reflections of Hopi culture. The Harvey Girls provided their legendary service to the public at the Painted Desert Inn.<br /> <br /> Even so, over the next decade, the inn declined and suffered from structural damage. In 1963, the inn closed and a new facility opened to house the park visitor center and the Fred Harvey operations. The park scheduled the building’s demolition in 1975, but a public campaign helped save the building, which the National Park Service listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Secretary of the Interior recognized the historic significance of the inn by designating it a National Historic Landmark in 1987.<br /> <br /> In 2006, the Painted Desert Inn reopened following its restoration. The inn now appears as it would have in 1949. Today, visitors again are able to experience the exquisite architectural details and richly colored walls of the Painted Desert Inn. Some highlights include the Trading Post Room, a magnificent architectural space with six hammered-tin, Mexican-style chandeliers, an enormous skylight, and windows overlooking the desert. The skylight has multiple panes of translucent glass painted in Indian pottery designs. The posts supporting the corbels and <em>vigas</em> are painted in muted colors. The inn still has the original Fred Kabotie murals. A large and stunning mountain lion petroglyph is on display inside the inn. Discovered in the 1930’s, the petroglyph is considered one of the finest, most vividly animated and lifelike depictions of mountain lions in the region.<br /> <br /> The Painted Desert Inn is located in the northern section of Petrified Forest National Park in Petrified Forest, AZ. The inn is now a museum open to the public. The park has an entrance fee but no additional fee is charged to visit the inn.<br /> <br /> For more information on visiting the the Painted Desert Inn, call 928-524-3522 or visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pefo/learn/historyculture/pdi.htm\">Painted Desert Inn web page.</a><br /> <br /> For more information on visiting Petrified Forest National Park, call 928-524-6228 or visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm\">Petrified Forest National Park website.</a><br /> <br /> Find the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/database-research.htm\">Painted Desert Inn National Register nomination form.</a><br /> <br /> The Painted Desert Inn has been documented by the National Park Service’s <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.az0292\">Historic American Buildings Survey</a>.</p>",

Occasionally they would climb the tall bluffs where the height allowed them to see far across the plains.<br /> <br /> It was not too long ago that new men started to use the river as a guide. These men looked for wealth. Fur traders traveled to and from the fur rich mountains to the west. Beaver and other furs were in demand for the fashonable people in the east. Soon buffalo robes were also popular. <br /> <br /> The traders tended to be loners who left little mark on the land since they rarely had more than a couple of horses or mules to carry their furs.<br /> <br /> Once South Pass was discovered and wagons could travel through the Rocky Mountains, the impacts on the land increased. Farmers coveted the fertile land in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. They brought families and friends to settle with them. When word of gold reached the eastern states in 1848, thousands traveled west. Few families crossed the plains as men flooded the trail expecting to become rich quickly in California, then return home.  <br /> <br /> Many emigrants moved west for religious reasons. The earliest wagons belonged to missionaries; the Marcus Whitman party was the first. Later, Mormons fled persecution in the east using the lesser traveled trail on the north side of the Platte River.<br /> <br /> The bluffs now watch over people who have chosen to live here as well as those who travel by. Modes of travel have changed, but the bluffs still serve as a landmark to those following the river. <br /> <br /> What events has a landmark near your home seen? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting that serves as a timeline for different groups and methods of travel along the Oregon Trail. Starting from left to right, here is what is depicted:<br /> <br /> Wild Animals; a cluster of evergreen trees are seen with elk.<br /> <br /> Native Americans ??? - 1900; Groups of people dressed in traditional native clothing are seen along with dogs and horses dragging travois.<br /> <br /> Fur Traders 1812 - 1850; Three men ride horses. Other horses are loaded with packs. In the background is a cluster of trees and a snow-capped mountain.<br /> <br /> Euro-American Emigrants 1836 - 1869; A man and woman stand on the tall promontory facing west. Behind them are men with mules carrying tools and packs of gear. Behind the mules is a horse-drawn wagon. Behind the horse-drawn wagon is a covered wagon being drawn by oxen. <br /> <br /> Pony Express 1860 - 1861; In the lower right hoand corner of the painting is a man on horseback, waving his hat in the air.  <br /> <br /> Stagecoach 1861 - 1869; On the far right side of the painting is a stagecoach being drawn by three pairs of horses. <br /> <br /> Railroad 1869 - present; In the distance, behind the stagecoach is a steam-powered train.<br /> <br /> Automobile 1886 - present; Behind the sagecoach, but forward of the train, a car is seen. <br /> <br /> Airplane 1914 -present; An airplane is seen flying above the stagecoach on the far right side of the painting. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> William Henry Jackson lived almost 100 years and witnessed a wide range of people and modes of transportation as they traveled across the plains. His watercolor painting, \"Westward America,\" is a tribute to those people. Credit: \"Westward America\" watercolor by William Henry Jackson; Scotts Bluff National Monument Collection. <br />  ",

The river has gradually changed course. Different tree species have dominated the ecosystem at various times—for instance, spruce trees had not encroached on Brooks River by 1300 AD. But oral traditions and cultural practices passed down to the descendants of Katmai’s first peoples give us more clues to the past. Alutiiq people indigenous to this region continue to use many of the local plants for food and medicine.<br /> <br /> Food:<b> </b> Wild berries such as watermelon berry, nagoonberry, cranberries, currants, blueberries, crowberries, and salmonberries are commonly harvested as a local food source in the late summer and fall. People also harvest fiddlehead ferns, Arctic dock, fireweed, and horsetail in the springtime to eat. Many of these are traditionally preserved in oil to last through the winter.<br /> <br /> Medicine: Plants including yarrow, Labrador tea, large-leaf avens, willow, Arctic dock, cow parsnip, cranberries, birch bark, and mosses were all used to treat a variety of ailments from colds and infections, to rashes and sores, to aches and pains.<br /> <br /> Material: In addition to food and medicine, the local plants have been used historically for building materials, tools, and toys. Cottonwood was commonly harvested for building homes, making plates, and building fires for smoking fish, while birch wood was carved into bowls, tool handles, hats, and whistles.",

In fact, over 330,000 artifacts have been found in Katmai, including projectile points, harpoons, blades, oil lamps, vessels, and somewhat mysteriously incised pebbles.<br /> <br /> Thirty-eight of these marked pebbles were found during archaeological excavations, stylized with intricate anthropomorphic designs carved onto them. These decorated pebbles suggest to us is that the people who made them had leisure time—they had a comfortable enough lifestyle that they had time to create art.  Many of them are carved with lines, dots, triangles, and tree-like patterns that may represent facial features or personal adornments such as headgear, necklaces, or jewelry. Archaeologists don’t really know what these pebbles were used for: They may have been part of a counting or tallying system, or may represent mythical figures. They do not appear to be tools, so perhaps they were either used for ceremonial function or game pieces. Interestingly, the designs are very similar to artifacts found on Kodiak Island, and other similar designs found in Aniakchak National Monument.<br /> <br /> What do you think these pebbles might represent? What could the similarities mean? How do you think they were used?",

They were fisherman.<br /> <br /> Like many Kiʻilae residents, fishing was essential for survival, but it was hard work. Most fishing gear was handmade, including the wooden canoes used to access the coastal waters. Fisherman, like the Kahikinas, would fish for <i>ʻōpelu</i> (mackerel scad) as well as <em>ahi</em> (tuna) if two people were available to haul the large fish aboard. Fisherman would often feed the fish, banging on the outside of their canoe beforehand to alert the fish. The fish would then gather, and a large catch could easily be achieved. These fish were a major source of income for members of the community. Fresh fish were sold by girls door-to-door before school and any fish leftover could be dried and sold to stores.<br /> <br /> John Kahikina, one of the last to leave Kiʻilae, was an expert octopus fisherman. To see below the surface of the water when he was fishing, he would chew kukui nuts and then spit them in the water. The oil from the kukui nuts would create a make-shift window to the depths, allowing him to drop his lure on top of the octopus and quickly pull it up.<br /> <br /> However, as times begain to change, the traditional way of living could no longer sustain the remaining Kahikinas and as Frances Jackson states in his report on Kiʻilae Village,</p> <blockquote> <p>“John Kahikina explained, there was “<em>Nothing to do, no work.</em>” The coastal waters still could be fished, the kula gardens were there, but the economy had changed; a money-making job was almost a necessity.”</p> </blockquote>",

In 1796, negotiators ran a \"monument line\" due north from the St. Croix River's headwaters to what was described in the treaty as the \"highlands\" separating rivers draining into the St. Lawrence from those entering the Atlantic - the agreed-upon northern boundary.<br /> <br /> Upon Maine's 1820 separation from Massachusetts, Joseph Norris was hired to lay out the boundaries of these unallocated lands between the two states by blazing the trees with markers. In 1825 Maine formed the Maine Boundary Commission authorizing a survey to establish an east to west line for laying out townships: The Monument Line.<br /> <br /> This survey allowed an equitable distribution of lands not already incorporated or otherwise conveyed by Massachusetts. Starting from a point where the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick ceases to be the St. Croix River and heads due north (the 1796 boundary), Joseph C. Norris, Sr., and his son ran the line to the west in the summer of 1825. By September, they had reached the Seboeis River, at which point they had to leave the woods for other survey work. Returning in November Norris built a raft to cross the Seboeis, and continued the line west in the face of approaching winter, crossing the East Branch, the Wassataquoik, and on to Katahdin, where on November 10th, in \"intensely cold\" weather, he reached an enormous drop-off into Northwest Basin, which forced him to abandon the survey for the year. This line allowed for the formation of townships bringing in people like William Hunt, of the notable Hunt Farm, into the area for logging.<br /> <br /> Tensions were already running high as lumber operators from Maine and New Brunswick competed for timber in northern Maine. This would eventually lead to the Aroostook War in 1838.",

Prior to the battle, Sherman issues 'Special Field Orders No. 28'. In it, he states that 'Maj. Gen. Thomas will assault the enemy at any point near his center, to be selected by himself...\" <br /> After doing reconnaissance with Maj. Gen. Thomas, Captain Henry Stone writes that what is today known as Cheatham Hill was finally selected 'more because the lines were nearer each other than beacause the enemy's lines seemed vulnerable' They were roughly 600 yards away from the Confederate line here. The attack would begin at roughly 9:00 am and would be the largest Union assault of the day. ",

            "audioDescription": "This trail begins at a large parking area on the side of the road. Both the road and the parking are hard-packed sand. Near the start of the trail the parking area is edged with a split-rail fence. Just past the fence is a tall, three-sided kiosk with three graphic panels that discuss safety and describe the trail. As you face the fence a restroom building is located at the end of the parking area to your right. The trail is marked by flat, four inch wide, red posts with a diamond symbol. From the kiosk, it leads across a flat basin with scattered tufts of tall grass into the dunes themselves. The trail proceeds up and down the dune slopes, pure white sand on all sides. In many places, the surface is covered with small ripples of sand, which glitters under the bright sun. The footing varies from a firm hard pack to deep, soft sand on some of the slopes. Once out of sight of the parking area, you are in a sea of sand stretching out on all sides, with the distant mountains on the western horizon just visible.",

The Predators- Until recently predatory birds and mammals, those which preyed on other animals or were in conflict with humans were termed “varmints” and killed on sight. Fortunately, modern ecology proves the vital interdependency of all wild plants and animals. Today hawks and owls, black bears, bobcats, foxes and snakes continue to roam parklands like this and help preserve the delicate balance of nature.",

It’s a narrow two-story home, 15 feet wide, with a small one-story extension on the right-hand side. The Garvin Cottage is not open to the public. The building is painted eggshell white with reddish-brown trim around the windows and doors. A single brick chimney juts up from the center of the steeply pitched roof. An open porch stretches across the front of the main structure, with four thin, square columns holding up the porch’s moss-covered roof. Between the columns, the porch is adorned with three delicate wooden arches painted to match the eggshell hue of the house. Ornately carved brackets, also painted to match, trim the top of the brown-painted columns. In the yard on the left is an antique metal water pump with a long, curved handle. Two tall trees stand at the front corners of the building’s grassy lot. A white picket fence 3 ½ feet tall surrounds the property, separating it from the wooden boardwalk that runs along the west side of Downey Street. A sign 12 inches wide by five inches tall hangs on the gatepost. Beneath the title \"Garvin House “, a black and white photograph shows a two-story frame house with decorative trim along the eaves and a covered porch. A caption notes: \"Garvin House circa 1930.\" Beneath the photograph, text reads: \"Amanda Garvin was single and 35 when she bought this lot for $90 in 1870 and had the cottage built. She was renting the house by 1878 but lost it to foreclosure in 1885.

This bedrock dates from the birth of North America. Some 2.8 billion years ago, massive volcanoes erupted through this area and deposited layer after layer of ash and lava, building up the island landmasses. These island arc volcanoes collided forming still larger landmasses. Subsequent uplifting, folding, superheating along with tremendous pressure created igneous and metamorphic rock to form the present day granite and schist of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Eons of erosion then wore down these volcanic mountain ranges to the landscape you see today. </p> <h4>Visiting Anderson Bay </h4>   <p>Anderson Bay exemplifies the outstanding scenery for which Voyageurs was established. The exposed white granite cliffs of Anderson Bay rise 80 feet from the water and provide spectacular views of the bay and Rainy Lake. It is one of the most photographed areas of the park. There are picnic tables, fire ring, and privy at this Visitor Destination and Day Use site. Visitors can also hike the 1.75-mile loop trail to see the bluffs from the top. In addition, this is the northern trailhead for the 9.5 mile, one way, Cruiser Lake Trail system that crosses the Kabetogama Peninsula to connect with Lost Bay on Kabetogama Lake. </p>",

Toombs held the bridge and defended it most gallantly, driving back repeated attacks, and only yielded it after the force brought against him became overwhelming and threatened his flank and rear.\"</p> <p>About 1:00 p.m., with Union soldiers crossing downstream and another attack made on the bridge, Toombs and his men had to retreat.

In 1890, congressional legislation gave the War Department oversight of the Antietam Battlefield Commission to preserve and maintain the battle lines from the September 17, 1862 Battle of Antietam. Until 1933, when administration of the battlefield transferred to the National Park Service, the War Department was the steward of Antietam and many other Civil War battlefield sites for commemorative and educational purposes. The preserved landscapes were meant to honor the dead and serve as open- air classrooms for military study<br /> <br /> Built to provide a commanding view of the Antietam Battlefield, this structure was constructed by local workers using primarily local resources and materials such as native limestone. Rising nearly sixty feet, the tower enabled visitors to have a better view of the Antietam battlefield. The surrounding topography lacked elevated natural land features, making it difficult at times to envision the battlefield landscape as a whole. As part of a new preservation plan developed between 1890 and 1895, the tower also allowed visitors to view battlefield land still held in private ownership by local Sharpsburg residents. The \"Antietam Plan\" preserved narrow strips of land, maintaining the rural agricultural landscape while simultaneously providing access to key battle locations. With limited access to most of the battlefield, the Tower provided a commanding 360 degree view. While a fair portion of returning war veterans made use of the Observation Tower, its construction also reflected an increase in tourism at the turn of the century. Whether utilized by veterans or the larger tourist population, the Tower demonstrates the War Department's physical impact on the landscape of the Antietam Battlefield.</p>",

You are about to embark on a drive down Fayette Station Road, a small, winding road that takes you to a bridge at the bottom of the New River Gorge. For about 100 years, this route was the only way to cross the New River in this immediate area without getting wet. In 1977 the arching, modern, New River Gorge Bridge was built up on Route 19, and Fayette Station Road lost its importance as a vital link in the area. Before starting your drive and beginning your adventure…please take a moment to listen to a few tips that will make your experience safer and more enjoyable along the way.</p> <ul> <li> <p>First, to keep in sync with the interpretive story, please maintain a speed between 15 and 25 mph after you get on Fayette Station Road.</p> </li> <li> <p>*REMOVE* The second tip is for those listening to a CD instead of an audio tape. Whenever the program says to stop the recording, just turn off your CD player. When you turn it back on, the CD will resume playing at the correct point.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you take this route without stopping along the way, this trip will take you about 30 minutes—a far cry from the 30 seconds or less it takes to cross the river on the highway today. If, however, you stop along the way to read the interpretive exhibits at each pull-off, plan on taking an hour to enjoy the tour.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Before leaving the parking lot of Canyon Rim Visitor Center, you may want to set your car’s trip meter to zero. This will help you find your way on the map that accompanies this program. [pause here before giving out directions]</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now let’s begin the journey… As you leave the parking lot, [pause…] turn left to get back on to Route 19. [pause..] Take a right on Route 19 and go north, approximately three tenths of a mile, [pause…] to the first road on the right. Take this right, onto Lansing-Edmond Road. You will see signs that point out the route as you drive along. [music begins by fading in] Stop the recording now until you turn onto Lansing-Edmond Road. [music fades out quickly] [after a pause, music starts, and fades out slowly]</p> <p> </p>",

A variety of tall shrubs, vines, and small trees are growing down the hillside, including mountain laurel, blueberry, blackberry, sassafras, sumac, wildflowers, and hardwood sprouts (including American chestnut).<br /> <br /> This rich mix of vegetative cover makes it great wildlife habitat, especially for birds. Look and listen for eastern towhee, black-throated green warblers, indigo buntings, tufted titmouse, red-eyed vireo, and Carolina chickadee. A large variety of birds can be evident at this overlook (especially in summer) due to the mature trees, the mixed shrub layer, and the edge where the two habitats come together. Berries, nuts, and fruits from these plants are also valuable to small and large mammals.<br /> <br /> The view is east across the French Broad River Valley. Ball Mountain can be seen in the foreground with Little Pisgah, Bearwallow, Bank, High Top, and Couch Mountains visible in the distance on a clear day.<br /> <br /> Access to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail is across the Parkway from the overlook.</p>",

For three days in September 1863, more than 125,000 Union and Confederate soldiers struggled here to determine the future of our nation. Less than thirty years later, they gathered here once again as reunited citizens of the United States of America. In August of 1890, Congress established Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, setting aside this land so that future generations could learn about what took place here. <br /> <br /> There are eight stops along this tour route. Follow the route highlighted in your park brochure, or follow the arrows on the tour route signs around the battlefield.</p>",

An eight-foot tall wooden information bulletin board and kiosk stands outside at the side of the building near the front. <br />At the far end of the cabin, a set of five, five-foot (1.5 m) wide wooden stairs with wooden handrails on either side lead up to a five-foot (1.5 m) wooden platform and the front screen door of the station. The screen door opens out and the inside wooden door opens in. To the right of the door, note a narrow wooden box with a hinged lid hanging on the side of the building with brochures and other park information.<br />Inside, the log cabin station is decorated with historic photographs featuring the town of Chitina as a transportation hub, \"\"where the rails meet the trails.\"\" Trains, stagecoaches, dog sleds, and steamboats all passed through Chitina on their way to the mining and commerce centers of Alaska during Chitina's boom years, 1910-1938. You can watch the 22-minute park movie \"\"Crown of the Continent\"\", and view the many photos that depict early life in Chitina.

Mead settled here and assumed the duties of Territorial Secretary of the Mississippi Territory January 20, 1806, appointed by President Thomas Jefferson. In the absence of Territorial Governor Robert Williams, Mead served a brief tenure as acting Territorial Governor. During this tenure, Aaron Burr came to the Mississippi Territory on January 10, 1807. Burr had recently been involved in the duel in which he killed Alexander Hamilton. When Cowles Mead learned of Burr's presence in the territory, he made plans to capture him. In order to avoid extradition, Burr surrendered to Mississippi officials in exchange for a guaranteed trial in the territory. Burr’s bound was established at $10,000, and Mead ordered the arrest of anyone that appeared hostile toward the Government's views or favorable to Aaron Burr <br /> <br /> Cowles Mead’s home, called “Greenwood,” was located here, a mile northwest of Clinton in Hinds County, set in a lawn of fifty acres of Bermuda grass, which he is believed to have introduced into the United States.  He was an enthusiastic gardener, and proudly entertained distinguished guests amongst the well landscaped grounds. After his death, the home was destroyed in a fire in 1863.<br />  ",

The name Craggy comes from jagged rock outcroppings or “crags” found here and the shrubs and grasses of the summit balds give the area a “garden” feel. And while colorful wildflowers can be seen from April through October, the highlight comes in June when the spectacular purple and pink blooms of the Catawba rhododendron are at their peak.<br /> <br /> A visitor center, picnic area, and hiking trails provide plenty to do for a short stop or an all day visit.

            "audioDescription": "Craggy Gardens is a high elevation area that encompasses a three-mile section of the Blue Ridge Parkway. At 5,500 feet in elevation, there are long range, expansive views of the surrounding valleys and distant mountain ranges in all directions from various vantage points. Strong winds, fog, and harsh weather can be commonly encountered at Craggy Gardens. These extreme conditions cause the trees here to be smaller in size and stunted, twisted, and wind-swept in appearance. In addition to the high elevation deciduous trees, native rhododendron bushes and colorful wildflowers are common. When the rhododendron bloom in early to mid-June, their large purple and pink blossoms dominate the landscape.",

Summer wildflower season brings a wave of spectacular color which includes a showstopping display of flowers right up into the picnic area and parking lot. The picnic area is ringed by mature hardwood trees including buckeyes, birch, and mountain ash. Rhododendrons dot the hillside. The woods edge features an abundance of wildflowers in summer.<br /> <br /> This picnic area is open daily until sunset, mid-spring through fall. A variety of picnic sites in full shade, partial shade, or in a grassy open area allows for the selection of a perfect lunch location. Some of the tables have benches only on one side because of the steep hillsides. Over the years, visitors have learned to bring their own camp chairs when they need to accommodate a larger group. Grills are located throughout the picnic area to be shared by all.<br /> <br /> Ample parking is available in the level, asphalt parking lot. Access to the Craggy Gardens Trail is in the far corner of the parking lot up the steps. At .2 miles you will encounter a side trail on the left to a pretty little gazebo. A trail shelter built by the CCC and views from a meadow bald are found at .5 miles. At the end of the trail you will see the Craggy Gardens Visitor Center.

            "bodyText": "<h3>“I don’t pay much attention to scenery, but I know one view that made me stop and look.”</h3> <br /> These words were spoken in 1926 by Charles Brown, a local man from Shoshone, when asked by the governor of Nevada for his opinion of the best view of Death Valley. As true today as it was then, Dantes View affords visitors an unparalleled view of the swirling white salt flats of Death Valley below (or if you’re a Star Wars fan, Mos Eisley), and the Panamint Range to the west. <br /> <br /> Towering 5,575 ft (1,699 m) above Badwater Basin, on the ridge of the Black Mountains, Dantes View is a favorite spot for photographers. Sunrise and sunset are especially magnificent here, and although this area is popular, it is easy to find solitude and set up the perfect shot with a short hike along the ridge to the north. More adventurous hikers can continue along the ridge to Mt. Perry, an 8 mile round-trip journey with approximately 1,200 ft (366 m) of elevation gain.  <br /> <br /> Not only is Dantes View incredible during the day, it is absolutely breathtaking at night. Death Valley National Park is an <a href=\"https://www.darksky.org/our-work/conservation/idsp/parks/deathvalley/\">International Dark Sky Park</a>, so don’t forget to bring your telescope (or just use your naked eyes), because a visit during a new moon will provide a humbling glimpse of the Milky Way and stars above. A visit during a full moon is equally as grand, as the salt flats below glow a ghostly white.<br /> <br /> A 45 minute drive from Furnace Creek, Dantes View is well worth the detour off the main Highway 190 route.<br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "A raised curb separates the viewing area from the parking lot. A 4 foot (1.2 meter) metal fence separates the viewing area from a near-vertical drop of over 5,000 feet (1,525 meters) to the valley floor. The valley floor below is swirling white salt flats. A mountain range rises on the west side of the valley, parallel to the view point. The tallest peak in this range is Telescope Peak, with an elevation of 11,049 feet (3,368 meters).",

            "bodyText": "<p>Castle Williams is a circular defensive work of red sandstone on the west point of Governors Island in New York Harbor. It was designed and erected between 1807 and 1811. Named after its designer, Chief Engineer of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lt. Col. Jonathan Williams, it is considered a prototype for new forms of coastal fortification. <br> <br> The castle was one component of a larger defensive system for the inner harbor that included Fort Jay and the South Battery on Governors Island, Castle Clinton at the tip of Manhattan, Fort Gibson at Ellis Island (then Oyster Island), and Fort Wood, which is now the base of Liberty Enlightening the World at Liberty Island (then Bedloe's Island). This system of forts came to be known as the Second American System of coastal defense and existed to protect harbors like the one in New York from British interference with American shipping. <br> <br> The usefulness of Castle Williams as a fort began to wane in the 1830s, so it subsequently served as barracks for the island's garrison and new and transient troops. Thereafter, the castle was remodeled by the U.S. Army for use as a prison in various forms during the Civil War and through the first half of the 20th century.<br> <br> By 1903, the castle was fitted up as a state-of-the-art prison facility. Castle Williams ceased operations as a military prison in 1965 just before the U.S. Army left Governors Island.<br> <br> The castle again faced a demolition challenge as Coast Guard officials in Washington, D.C., who took control of Governors Island in 1966, wanted to demolish it. Instead, the castle was remodeled as a youth community center with a nursery, meeting rooms for Scouts and clubs, a woodworking shop, art studios, a photography laboratory, and a museum. By the late 1970s the community center moved to another location and the fort became the groundskeeping shop for the Coast Guard base.<br> <br> Over time, the roof failed and broken windows allowed serious water damage to occur inside the castle. In the mid-1990s, the roof was replaced and new windows stopped further water damage to the structure, but the interior remains closed until it can be made safe for public access. The National Park Service proposes to stabilize and restore the castle and eventually provide access to the roof, allowing the public to admire the harbor and the modern skyline of the great city this fortress once protected.</p>",

There is a small pullout on either side of the bridge over the falls. The best way to view this waterfall is to park and walk down the short path to the overlook below the stone bridge. Christine Falls bridge is very narrow and busy, use caution and watch for vehicles when crossing or viewing the waterfall from the bridge. The path can be very icy and hazardous during winter.<br /> <br /> Christine Falls is a 60-foot plunging waterfall framed by a historic arched bridge. The Christine Falls bridge spans the narrow Van Trump Creek canyon between Rampart Ridge on the west, and Cushman Crest to the east. The falls are formed by Van Trump Creek, which passes north to south through the site, eventually flowing into the Nisqually River. To help preserve the outstanding scenery of the falls, this site was designed utilizing natural principles, intended to harmonize a man-made bridge in a natural environment. The waterfall is named for Christine Van Trump, daughter of P.B. Van Trump, one of the first climbers of Mount Rainier. </p>",

The upper level of the waterfall comes into view as you cross the gray, stone-faced Christine Falls bridge. Just past the bridge is the parking area where the path begins on the southside of the road, just at the edge of the stone wall. A short walk down a dirt path, with visible tree roots, leads to a unique, framed view of Christine Falls as the water cascades down below the bridge above.",

The secret lies in the large butte located nearby.<br /> <br /> When mineral rich water seeps down through the porous layers that make up the badlands, it can deposit those minerals in spaces or gaps in the sediments. The minerals act as a kind of glue, holding these sediments together, often forming around a core. As more and more layers are deposited, the concretion builds outward like a pearl, before being exposed by erosion.<br /> <br /> Who knows how many concretions are still waiting to be exposed, deep inside the butte?<br /> <br /> It is illegal to remove any resource from a national park. Leave any flower, stone, or other object where you find it so that other visitors can enjoy it as well. <br /> <br /> It is illegal to carve, paint, or otherwise alter anything in a national park. ",
            "audioDescription": "Cannonball Concretions. 429 words. The cannonball concretion pullout is a natural area located on the north side of the North Unit scenic drive. A sidewalk runs approximately 100 feet along the parking area, with an interpretive wayside, a trash can, and a trailhead sign for the Buckhorn Trail spaced along its length. A large butte stands to the northeast, nearly reaching the parking area, with a large prairie containing grasses and sagebrush to its west. The butte, named Battleship Butte, resembles the prow of a ship. Scattered along the base of the butte, with a few among the sagebrush, are large, round, rock formations. To the east of the butte, more of these round formations are scattered in an eroded and washed out area. Others are visible just beginning to appear from the surface of the butte. The wayside has a large photo of one of the cannonball concretions, under a black band with the National Park Service arrowhead, and is titled Cannonball Mystery. Under this the text reads: The large, round rocks littering the ground and protruding from the butte are bizarre. They don’t seem to fit with the rest of the landscape. Where did they come from? These “cannonballs” were not carried here by flowing water or glaciers. Instead, they formed within the sediment layers of the badlands. Now, erosion is slowly exposing these buried treasures. Notice how some cannonballs have completely eroded out of the butte while others are just being exposed. Even more lie deep within the rock layers, yet to be revealed. Under this, next to the image of the cannonball more text reads: There are small pockets of cannonball concretions throughout the park and the Little Missouri Badlands. Those seen here are some of the largest and most impressive yet discovered. To the right of this main image, a second image of several cannonballs in a wash. Under this, there is title text reading: How Do They Form? Under this is written: Mineral-rich water deposits minerals as it seeps through porous sediment layers. The minerals act like glue, binding the sediments together and forming concretions. Concretions form in many different shapes and sizes. Those that are spherical are called “cannonballs.” For now, scientists can only guess why some concretions take on such spherical shapes. Under this, one final title reads: Save the Cannonballs. Under this is written: These cannonball concretions have been a popular attraction for decades Help make sure they are here for future generations to enjoy by leaving them as you find them. If you see someone defacing the cannonballs, report the illegal activity immediately. End of description.",

This Custom House was built in 1819 and housed offices for the officers of the U.S. Customs Service, as well as an attached warehouse, the Public Stores, used for the storage of bonded and impounded cargo.<br /> <br /> The Custom House symbolized the Federal Government's presence in Salem, requiring the architects to design an impressive building. High ceilings, a sweeping staircase, and beautifully carved woodwork all contribute to a feeling of strength and stability. The Salem Custom House was used by the U. S. Customs Service into the 1930s and the furnishings reflect the long use of the building.<br /> <br /> In 1826, a wooden eagle was placed on the roof. It was carved by Salem craftsman Joseph True, and its original cost was $50.00. In 2004, the original wooden eagle was replaced with a fiberglass replica. After undergoing several years of conservation work, the original wooden eagle is on display inside the Custom House.<br /> <br /> Today, the U.S. Custom House in Salem contains exhibits on the tools of the Custom Service, the work of the Customs inspectors, and the office of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the famous American author whose three-year-long stint in the Salem Custom House inspired his classic novel, <em>The Scarlet Letter.</em>",

Today, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery continues to narrate the multi-faceted and ever-changing story of America through the individuals who have shaped its culture. Through the visual arts, performing arts, and new media, the Portrait Gallery presents poets and presidents, visionaries and villains, actors and activists whose lives form our national identity.</p> <p>As the nation's only complete collection of presidential portraits outside the White House, the \"America's Presidents\" exhibition lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the country's history through the individuals who have shaped it. Gilbert Stuart's \"Lansdowne\" painting of George Washington is the grand introductory image to this exhibition. In 2000, the Portrait Gallery was in danger of losing this painting—which had been on loan since the museum's opening in 1968—when its owner decided to sell it. A generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation allowed the \"Lansdowne\" painting to be purchased as a gift to the nation. \"America's Presidents\" continues to acquire portraits—including paintings, sculpture, photographs, caricatures, video, and time-based media—of each succeeding president. </p> <p>Over the years the collections, which were initially restricted to paintings, prints, drawings, and engravings, have grown to over 23,000 items in all media, from daguerreotypes to digital. In the late 1990s, the Portrait Gallery began commissioning portraits of presidents, beginning with George H. W. Bush. In 2006, the Portrait Gallery hosted the first Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, now a prestigious triennial event, which also brings commissioned works into the collection. The 2013 winner was Bo Gehring, whose close-up video and sound portrait of jazz musician Esperanza Spalding draws delight and praise from visitors.</p>",

There is a ramp to access the trails in the upper parking lot. Some trails do have steep sections, but most of the Nisqually Vista Trail has a medium-to-gentle slope. The trail is surrounded by patches of lush subalpine meadow, filled with blooming wildflowers during the summer months, and interspersed with patches of subalpine firs and mountain hemlock trees. There are several viewpoints along the trail framed by log fences. The viewpoints overlook a large rocky valley on the slopes of Mount Rainier.

Before the arrival of adobe construction from Spain, the O’odham built rounded homes using mud applied over a wood and brush framework.

            "audioDescription": "In front of you is a rectangular, nearly square shaped building about 12 feet in width, 10 feet in depth and 6 feet tall. Made from daubed mud, the outside wall surface of the building is the brown-grey color of the surrounding earth, and is roughly textured. The roof is constructed of support beams made from mesquite branches about 5 inches in diameter. These can be seen protruding at the top of the mud walls at the roof line. The roof also contains sticks of ocotillo, a common desert shrub with long, straight, thorned branches about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thick and up to 12 feet long. The ocotillo sticks are laid side by side and sealed together by mud, forming the roof and creating an almost flat, somewhat wavy roof shape which hangs a few inches over the perimeter of the building on each side. There are no windows, but there is a doorless entrance about 2 feet wide and 5 feet high located slightly right of center as you look at the front of the building. An open-air, flat-roofed portico stands a few feet in front of the mud house. Its structure is comprised of mesquite branches overlaid with ocotillo branches. The ramada roof is supported by 9 rustic mesquite branches stripped of bark and about 3 to 5 inches in diameter. These are evenly spaced, creating a covered walkway leading to the entrance of the of the ki and providing shade to a broad area in front of it. On the ground below are four grinding stones. Inside the dwelling is a concrete floor with a thick layer of dirt over the top. It is dark except for the rectangle of light from the small entrance. The mesquite branches and ocotillo sticks that provide the building's structure are visible, and the mud walls appear similar to the outside walls.",

The first-floor functions included a laundry and a dairy.</p> <p>Laundry days at Melrose were difficult for the slaves and filled with hard tasks. These were backbreaking jobs that involved dangerous materials. People had to heat water in iron pots in the large fireplace. Then they poured the hot water into large washtubs where they scrubbed clothes, bedsheets, and table linens for the estate. They used caustic lye soap for cleaning and acidic lemon juice for deep stains. They had to rinse each item and wring it out. Afterward, they hung it on a clothesline to dry. Then they repeated the entire process for the next batch. They heated small irons in the fireplace for ironing all the cotton and linen items.</p> <p>Melrose had a small herd of dairy cows to provide fresh milk and butter for the estate. It was stored and processed in this building. The dairy room contains a series of built-in cement fixtures along one side. The lower part was closed behind wooden doors. It served as an early refrigerator holding blocks of ice to keep food cold. Water filled open troughs of the upper part where enslaved servants placed dairy products to cool that would be processed into butter and cheese. The water also served to keep ants out of the food.</p> <p>The upstairs rooms housed enslaved household servants. They had to respond to the ringing of the series of bells across the back porch of the big house. William and Eliza Jones served as a valet and a maid to the McMurrans. They likely lived in one of these upstairs spaces. William traveled with the McMurrans to northern resorts such as Niagara Falls in the summers. He also went with them to Europe when they made their Grand Tour with their children in 1854. Estate slaves were not like plantation slaves whose lives were ordered by the cycle of planting and picking cotton. Slaves who worked in the McMurran household lived their lives according to the routines and whims of the masters.  </p> <p>Alice Sims came with the Davises to Melrose in 1866, along with her family. She had previously been enslaved by the Davis family at their Vaucluse Plantation in Louisiana. The Sims lived upstairs in the dairy building.</p>",

Its nearness to the servant hall entrance into the back of the mansion aided the swift service of hot food to the mansion dining room.</p> <p>The Melrose kitchen featured three rooms upstairs and three rooms downstairs. The first floor contained the cooking kitchen. The first floor also held a pantry and a possible dining room for the Melrose slaves. The cooks and some of the other household servants lived in the three upstairs rooms. An enslaved woman, Rachel, was the primary cook in 1850 and probably lived above the kitchen until 1864. Family letters mention another cook, “Dicey,” who was a slave on the nearby Quitman family estate, Monmouth.  “Mammy” Helen sometimes cooked, and she too likely lived in an upstairs room in the kitchen or dairy building. Mammy Helen was initially a nurse to the McMurran children. As they grew older, she probably played a role in nursing the children of other slaves.

He was known in Oregon City as the \"Doctor\" - a trained physician who once presided over British fur trade interests in a vast area stretching from California to Alaska. He made money for the Hudson's Bay Company, but also assisted exhausted, starving American emigrants arriving into the region via the Oregon Trail. All his actions were set against the international stage of American and British politics and determination of national boundaries.<br /> <br /> Forced into retirement, he and his family settled into this home by the Willamette Falls in Oregon City in 1846. McLoughlin built himself a new career promoting the economic prosperity of the Oregon Territory. He became an American citizen in 1851, and served as the mayor of Oregon City. He and his wife Marguerite were known for their hospitality and generous support of those in the community. McLoughlin loaned money to emigrants to help them establish commercial ventures. He owned sawmills, a gristmill, a granary, a general store, and a shipping concern. He also donated land for schools and churches.<br /> <br /> The McLoughlin House is also on the Oregon National Historic Trail, which is part of the National Trail System. This system of national scenic, historic, and recreational trails promote the enjoyment of outdoor recreation, and the appreciation, and preservation of historic resources.<br /> <br /> The graves of McLoughlin and his wife Marguerite are next to the house, as is the home of Dr. Forbes Barclay, a Hudson's Bay Company associate.<br /> <br /> Visitors the McLoughlin House Unit should start their visit at the neighboring <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/xx-barclay-house.htm\">Barclay House</a>.

Passable only in the warmer months and only with high-clearance 4-wheel-drive vehicles, it gives access to Medano Pass (elevation 10,040’) and Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. This road crosses areas of deep sand, traverses Medano Creek nine times, and passes through excellent habitat for bighorn sheep. Average driving time for the entire primitive road is about 2.5 - 3 hours. Reduce tire pressure to about 20 psi if the sand is dry and soft. A free air station is available near the south entrance to the road in warmer months between the hours of 7AM and 9PM. If you reduce pressure, you will need to reinflate using your own air compressor before driving over rocks in Medano Canyon. Drive through creek crossings slowly to avoid drowning your engine.</p> <h3>Mileage Chart</h3> <p><strong>Set your odometer to zero at the western entrance of the primitive road to follow along with this guide.</strong><br /> <strong>0.0</strong> End of Paved Road: start of Medano Pass Primitive Road.<br /> <strong>0.2</strong> Garden Creek: flows until mid-summer<br /> <strong>0.5</strong> Buck Creek: intermittent stream<br /> <strong>1.0</strong> Sawmill Creek: flows until mid-summer.<br /> <strong>1.1</strong> Point of No Return: 4WD vehicles ONLY past this point.

These sites are indicated with a brown post and camping symbol, and are numbered by approximate road mileage from the Park/Preserve boundary to Medano Pass. Numbers in parentheses are approximate road mileage from Medano Pass down to the Preserve/Park boundary. <em>Roadside car camping is only permitted in designated sites in the national preserve. Vehicle access to these sites is only available late spring through fall, depending on snow, creek, and road conditions.</em>These designated sites are free of charge and first-come, first-served. All 21 sites fill on summer weekends.</p> <h3>Camping Regulations for Medano Road Campsites</h3> <ul> <li>Camping is permitted in designated, marked sites only in the national preserve. No permits are necessary.</li> <li>Tents must be located within 40 feet of the front of the bear box at each site.</li> <li>Pets must be leashed or restrained at all times.</li> <li>Fires only in existing fire rings; put out completely with water. Gather dead and down firewood 4” or less diameter.</li> <li>No off-road driving. Vehicles must be highway-legal in Colorado. Park only in designated campsites or parking areas.</li> <li>Secure food, coolers, toiletries, and trash from black bears. Lock them in the bear boxes provided at most sites.</li> <li>All trash, including orange peels, egg shells and toilet paper, must be removed. Bury human waste 6” deep.</li> </ul> <h3>Mountain Bikes and Fat Bikes</h3> <p>Standard mountain bikes can ride on the Medano Pass Road from its southern entrance to Point of No Return, a 1 mile trek. Beyond that, soft sand conditions require <strong>fat bikes</strong> (mountain bikes with extra wide tires for sand). Fat bikes are permitted on the Medano Pass Primitive Road, both for day use and for overnight camping in Medano Canyon. Check current sand conditions before riding; if sand gets too soft and dry, travel may not be possible. <em>Bikes are not permitted off-road. </em>You will be sharing the road with vehicles, some traveling at higher speeds in order to make it through sandy sections. For your safety, listen and watch carefully for vehicles as you ride.<br /> <br /> There are no bike racks along the road, but you may secure your bike onto fire grates provided at campsites, or to signs at parking areas.</p>",

The deep red Chugwater outcrops are a sharp contrast to the surrounding geologic colors of Bighorn Canyon. To explore the colors and contrasting scenery Horseshoe Bend has to offer, begin hiking at the service road on the north end of loop B in Horseshoe Bend Campground near campsite number B-15. Just before reaching the water storage tank, veer right onto an abandoned two-track. Follow the two-track up and around the hills toward the canyon. When the road disappears, follow the trail markers along the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range boundary fence. From this vantage point, you can see the mouth of the canyon and its union with Crooked Creek. This colorful setting invites one to rest and watch the horses graze below and the birds soar above. You may either go back the way you came along the abandoned two-track road or follow the trail through a juniper-lined draw to the top of the ridge and back to the road. Please stay on the trail to help preserve the cryptobiotic soil.",

Two trails approach the lake from either end of the parking area. At the far end of the parking area, a bulletin board sign provides information about the area and the campground. A pit toilet restroom with bear-proof trash canisters is located to the right of the sign. Beyond the sign is a single loop walk-in campground with several tent platforms. Another trail descends to the lake on the left side of the campground, which is bordered by a split-rail fence. The large deep blue lake is surrounded by forested mountain slopes. A trail skirts the southwest edge of the lake (nearest to the campground and parking area), terminating on the right at the Mowich Lake Ranger Cabin, a small log cabin with a food locker on the porch for hikers. Continue following the lake trail to the left and it eventually leaves the lake and becomes the trail heading to the Tolmie Peak Fire Lookout.",

Views on both sides of the Parkway make Mills River a popular overlook for both sunrise and sunset. And since this overlook has very little canopy cover, it’s an excellent place to observe the autumn hawk migration. As a bonus, hikers can pick up the Mountains-to-Sea Trail, traveling a rocky trail as far as they want in either direction. Just remember to wear sturdy shoes and bring plenty of water!<br /> <br /> Depending on weather and road conditions, the average driving time to the Mills River Overlook is approximately 35-40 minutes from Asheville or 2 hours 20 minutes from the end of the Parkway near Cherokee.</p>",

Here, hikers are greeted almost immediately by slick, winding narrows. Mosaic Canyon is the site of frequent flash floods (do not enter if there is a chance of rain!), and these narrows have been polished smooth by the scouring of debris-laden flood water. <br /> <br /> As you proceed up the canyon, keep an eye out for the incredible mosaic breccia for which the canyon is named. Breccia is the scientific term for rock created by the natural cementing together of older smaller pieces of rock, and many examples of this can be viewed along the hike.<br /> <br /> The route varies in length depending on how much scrambling hikers want to do. Many people stop at the boulder jam approximately 1.3 miles (2 km) up the canyon, but it is possible to continue past this obstacle and continue through more narrows and open canyon, until the way is ultimately blocked by an impassable 25 ft (7.6 m) dryfall.  <br /> <br /> Located just west of Stovepipe Wells Village off CA-190, the trailhead for this hike is at the end of an unpaved access road typically passable by sedans.  </span></p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10 AM IN THE SUMMER</strong></span><br /> <br /> <strong>Round Trip Length:</strong> 4 miles (6.4 km) <br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 2.5-3 hours<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,200 ft (366 m)<br /> <strong>Trail Type: </strong>Out and back route<br /> <strong>Location: </strong>The end of the 2.3 mile (3.7km) unpaved Mosaic Canyon Road located near Stovepipe Wells Village across from Stovepipe Wells Campground<strong> </strong><br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Large gravel parking area.

A 25ft (7.6m) vertical dryfall in a dramatic amphitheater marks the turn-around point.  <br /> <br /> Note: pets are not allowed on any trail in Death Valley National Park, even if carried. Do not leave your animal in your vehicle. Speak with a ranger about one of the incredible dirt roads where you may walk your pet.</p>",

The canyon quickly narrows to several feet wide and hikers wind through polished striated and mosaiced brown and white rock walls.

            "bodyText": "<p>The Narbonne House was built in 1675 for butcher Thomas Ives. It is a remarkable example of a middle-class family home of the 17th and 18th centuries. The taller section of the building is the original house. It still has its original pointed, or peaked, roof and its original brick chimney. When the house was first built, it only had a single room on the first floor, called the hall, a single room on the second floor (the hall chamber), an attic, and a shallow root cellar. Later owners added a kitchen on the back of the house, and a smaller addition on the side that has a parlor on the first floor and a chamber on the second.<br /> <br /> The house is named after Sarah Narbonne, whose grandfather Jonathan Andrews purchased the house in 1780. Sarah was born in the Narbonne house, and lived there for her entire life, which stretched nearly the length of the 19th century. She died in 1895 at the age of 101, and her unmarried daughter Mary continued to live in the house until her death in 1905.<br /> <br /> In 1963, the National Park Service purchased the historic building from the family of Mary Narbonne’s nephew Frank Hale. One of the things that makes this building so special is its history of nearly 300 years of continued occupation, 200 years of which are members of one family. In keeping with modern preservation practices, the Narbonne House has not been restored to one time period. Instead, Salem Maritime is preserving it as an architectural study house to show how the structure changed over the nearly 330 years of its existence.</p>",

The “boulevard” was named for the smooth floor created by a lava cascade.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>759 feet.<br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> <strong>You must hike out to cave: </strong>~0.2 miles. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>2.8 mile drive.<br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

The downstream portion of this cave (heading north) requires some stooping. The back section where the “Golden Dome” is located is a figure-8; take note of your location so you don’t go around in circles. The golden ceiling in this and many other caves here is the result of light reflecting off water droplets that bead up on a coating of hydrophobic bacteria. The bacteria are not harmful to humans but are easily damaged, so please do not touch. The upstream portions of this cave require more stooping and some crawling.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>2,229 feet. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must crawl in some places if you go through the whole cave. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>Cave Loop. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own.

At last, the restless troops were moved to <strong>Hospital Rock</strong> and <strong>Gillem’s Camp</strong>, much closer to the Modocs.</p> <p>At midday, soldiers spotted three Modocs crossing the lava beds, waving a white flag. When two officers approached them, the Modocs opened fire. Moving the camps had driven the Modocs to act. This offensive would spark the second battle at <strong>Captain’s Jacks Stronghold</strong>.</p> <p>At the time of the attack, the Modocs had been living for months in the Stronghold caves instead of their usual warm winter dwellings. In spring when they saw the Army camps moving closer, some became concerned. They called for an end to negotiations. It seemed apparent that the Modocs would never be granted their wish to be left alone in their homeland.</p> <p>Lieutenant William Sherwood was mortally wounded; he died several days later at the crude field hospital that gave Hospital Rock its name. An urgent message warning of treachery was sent to the peace commissioners meeting nearby. Unfortunately, it arrived too late —they too had been attacked.</p>",

As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Big Painted Cave</strong> ( 266 ft / 81 m) One of the <strong><span style=\"color:#008000;\">\"Least Challenging Caves\"</span></strong> Irreplaceable historic Native American pictographs adorn the entrance areas of this short caves. Look closely to find the pictographs as they blend in with the rock. An easy 0.75 mi (1.21 km) hike is required to reach it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>266 feet.<br /> You can walk completely upright on main path. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Cave has a relatively \"smooth\" path. <br /> <strong>You must hike out to cave: </strong>~0.5 miles. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>2.3 mile drive.<br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

This Devils Homestead flow, which erupted from Fleener Chimneys more than a mile south of here, provides an excellent  example of rough a’a lava.</p> <p>More fluid pahoehoe lava leaves behind a smoother surface and can be seen at Black Crater.  The wide variety of eruptions here at Lava Beds and the abundant features they left behind, makes this area an exceptional place to explore volcanic geology.</p>",

Imagine the sights and sounds of up to six million birds here before the early 1900’s when lake drainage for agriculture began. You may encounter many other species of mammals, terrestrial birds, and reptiles throughout the Monument, especially if you journey away from roads and developed areas early or late in the day. Drive the nearby the <strong>Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge’s Wildlife Tour Route</strong> along the edge of modern-day Tule Lake for a more in-depth birding experience.</p> <p><strong>A Haven For Waterfowl</strong></p> <p>Up to a million migratory birds find shelter each year at Tule Lake and other wetlands within the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges. Situated in the middle of the Pacific Flyway, these protected areas are critical resting and feeding grounds for migrating ducks, geese, and shorebirds.</p> <p>In millenia past, the vast lowlands you see before you were covered with water and marshes­. Imagine the sights and sounds of over six million birds here, where Modoc Indians once hunted from tule reed boats. By the early 1900s, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had drained thousands of wetland acres for farming, and hunters had killed massive numbers of birds. Although crops grown on refuge lands are a source of food for waterfowl, less than 25 percent of historic wetlands exist today. Migratory waterfowl and year-round Klamath Basin residents depend on these remaining wetlands for their survival.</p> <p><strong>To Learn More About Waterfowl</strong><br /> • Visit the Klamath Basin Refuges Visitor Center on Hill Road  for information about Basin waterfowl.  <br /> • Visit the Lava Beds Visitor Center to obtain a bird list and  explore other protected upland habitats that host a variety  of raptors, ground-dwelling birds, and songbirds. <br />  </p>",

Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough.

Named in honor of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/christian-brevoort-zabriskie.htm\">Christian Zabriskie</a>, a prominent figure in the heyday of the Pacific Coast Borax Company, Zabriskie Point affords an elevated vista from which to marvel at the badlands below. These yellow and brown stripped hills have been shaped by the powerful force of water, and even during dry times, the path carved by this water is unmistakable. Gazing beyond the badlands, views of the salt flats covering the floor of Death Valley are visible in the distance, with the hulk of the Panamint Mountains towering above.  <br /> <br /> The most pronounced feature viewed from Zabriskie Point is Manly Beacon. This jutting high point rises to an elevation of 823 ft (251 m), and bears the name of one of the first <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/the-lost-49ers.htm\">49ers</a> (gold rush pioneers) to visit the area. Manly Beacon is especially magnificent when viewed at sunrise or sunset.  <br />  <br /> A 15 minute drive east on Highway 190 from Furnace Creek Visitor Center will bring you to the parking area for this not-to-be-missed view point. From the parking lot, the point is a ¼ mile (400 m) walk up a hill on a paved trail. Those interested in hiking in the badlands can pick up the Badlands Loop Trail at the Zabriskie Point parking lot. Hiking distance varies depending on the route chosen: longer hikes can include Gower Gulch, Golden Canyon, and Red Cathedral.   <br />  ",
            "audioDescription": "Bollards separate the parking lot from a paved trail which leads 1/4 mile (400 m) up a hill to the viewpoint. From the viewpoint, brown and yellow striped hills and several large washes are visible in the foreground. One hill, Manly Beacon, rises above the rest in a shape roughly that of an acute triangle. Beyond the hills, white salt flats spread across a brown, rocky valley floor, and large mountains rise in the distance.",

White, plastic dinnerware is not easily visible on the white sand. Remember to <em><a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/leave-no-trace.htm\">Leave No Trace</a>.</em></li> <li>When you are done with your picnic, use our recycling bins by the vault toilets to recycle plastic and aluminum.</li> <li>Consider using reusable tableware to reduce the amount trash left behind in the park.</li> <li>Trash dumpsters are provided in the picnic areas for your use. If the small trash cans are full please throw trash in the large dumpsters.</li> <li>Bag your trash. Wind will pick up things like paper plates and napkins and carry them into the dunes.</li> </ul> <p>For more information on picnic opportunities at White Sands, please visit our <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/picknicking.htm\">Picnicking Information</a> page.</p>",

From this command post, the <strong>U.S. Army</strong> directed part of a frustrating campaign against a small group of Modoc Indians. Determined to defend their homeland, the Modocs consistently outmaneuvered the Army, who at times outnumbered them ten to one. Just over <strong>six months</strong> of battles and surprise attacks, interspersed with long periods of waiting, resulted in the Modoc’s defeat. Significant Modoc War sites are located and interpreted throughout the park</p> <p>For seven weeks in the spring of 1873, <strong>Gillem’s Camp</strong> served as temporary quarters for up to 600 troops. Many enlisted men were new recruits with little training. Isolation, poor food and medical supplies, and the constant threat of attack in an unfamiliar landscape made life here difficult.</p> <p>Walk the easy guided trail around this area and discover why ancient Modoc, the Army, the <strong>Civilian Conservation Corps</strong>, and <strong>National Park Service</strong> rangers alike cherished its location on the shores of old Tule Lake. You can also hike to the top of <strong>Gillem Bluff </strong>(known as Sheepy Ridge to the Modoc and settlers) along the route the Army used to bring supplies to Gillems Camp. The view from the top provides a great perspective of Lava Beds’ volcanic landscape. Generations of Modoc once netted waterfowl here as they flew low over the ridge, and a fence still stands from the attempted reintroduction of bighorn sheep in the 1980’s. You can also look down on Canby Cross, the site where a Modoc War peace meeting ended in tragedy. Visit the cross at the next stop heading east.</p>",

The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected.

Always something of a “homebody,” Emily began college in the fall of 1847, but found the required separation from her family and home distasteful. From 1847 until her death, Dickinson did not leave the town of Amherst more than three times, and rarely left even her father’s house, writing in 1868, “I do not cross my father’s ground for any house or town.” Quite content with her isolation--to her the home and its grounds were the world in microcosm--Dickinson began writing poetry in the late 1850s, using her imagination to describe “the panoply of human experience.”</p> <p>Although her family knew that she wrote for hours at a small desk in her bedroom, no one realized the scope of Dickinson’s work until Emily herself sent writing critic Thomas Higginson four carefully chosen samples of her poetry. The revolutionary structure of Dickinson’s poetry bewildered and intrigued Higginson, but he eventually concluded that the poetry’s \"obscurity and fracture of grammar and dictionary\" would prevent the public from ever appreciating her work. Rather than alter her style, Dickinson chose to remain unknown and unpublished. By 1866, Dickinson’s poetry writing slowed, though she continued to compose for close friends and special occasions.</p> <p>After her death in 1886, Emily’s sister Lavinia discovered a locked box containing the manuscripts of hundreds of Emily’s previously unseen poems. At Lavinia’s insistence, Thomas Higginson reluctantly agreed to prepare <em>Poems by Emily Dickinson,</em> a small volume of Dickinson’s poems, for publication in 1890. Though critics disliked the poetry, public response was favorable. As additional volumes appeared over the years, critical appreciation of the reclusive Amherst poet grew steadily, and Emily Dickinson is now generally considered to be one of America’s most important writers.</p>",

In addition, her poetry and essays are significant because she used them as vehicles to comment upon the experiences of African Americans.</p> <p>Harper was born to free Black parents in Baltimore, Maryland in 1825. At age twenty-six, she moved to Columbus, Ohio, where she taught domestic science at Union Seminary. Shortly after her departure, Maryland enacted a law forbidding free blacks living in the North to immigrate into that state. The penalty was imprisonment and sale into slavery. Harper decided to dedicate her efforts to the anti-slavery crusade. She spent the next eight years traveling around the United States, delivering anti-slavery lectures and writing essays and poems about what she observed in the States. Her essays and poems were widely circulated in Black journals and she published a variety of novels, short stories, and poetry collections, most of which focused on the quality of life of African Americans.</p> <p>In addition to her abolitionist activities, Harper was committed to the temperance movement and the struggle for women’s rights. She believed that alcohol was linked to the decline of the Black community and wrote multiple poems on this topic. Harper was also focused on women’s suffrage and the pursuit of equal rights, job opportunities, and education for Black women. She was a member of the American Equal Suffrage Association, and later formed the American Woman Suffrage Association with Frederick Douglass and other reformers.</p>",

Now a refuge for kayakers, canoers, and hikers, the cabin was once the home of trapper, miner, and famed Naknek local Roy Fure.<br /> <br /> Fure was born in 1885 in Lithuania, and came to Alaska in the early 1900s seeking his fortune. He settled in the Naknek area, supplementing his trapping and mining income by working as a laborer. In 1919, he married Anna Johnson, a woman from Bethel. They had three sons and a daughter, but only two of the children, Alexander and Marian, survived childhood. After Anna's death in 1929, Fure married Fanny Olson, a woman from Naknek. They had a daughter, Nola, in 1930. Fanny left some time after 1940 for Kodiak.<br /> <br /> The Bay of Islands cabin was built in 1926. The roof, walls, and floor are made of hand-hewn spruce logs with dovetail notching reminiscent of European craftsmanship. In 1931, the land on which the cabin stands was incorporated into the expanded Katmai National Monument. He used the cabin into the 1950s. He died in 1962 in Portland, Oregon.<br /> <br /> Fure's cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

            "bodyText": "<h3><strong>April 19, 1775 </strong></h3> <p>In the early morning hours of April 19, 1775 alarm riders spread news across the New England countryside that a British column numbering roughly 800 men were marching toward Concord with the intent to destroy stockpiles of colonial military supplies gathered there. Throughout the morning, thousands of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/the-militia-and-minute-men-of-1775.htm\">militia soldiers</a> gathered at predetermined meeting locations before marching onward to Concord. This act of <strong><em>“mustering”</em></strong> the companies ensured all men were present and prepared for confrontation with the British soldiers.</p> <p>By 8:00 a.m. nearly 200 colonial militia gathered in Concord and advanced to an elevated ridge above the Meriam's Corner road junction just east of town. From that position the militia observed the British column marching along the Bay Road. </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Some were for making a stand,\"</em> remembered Concord Reverend William Emmerson,<em>\"notwithstanding the superiority of their [The British] numbers, but others more prudent thought best to retreat till our strength should be equal to the Enemy's, by Recruits from neighboring towns that were continually coming to our assistance\" </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Dramatically outnumbered the militia determined to retire across the Concord River to another hilltop position of observation. Minute man Amos Barrett recalled, </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“ [we marched] before them with our drums and fifes agoing and also the British. We had grand musick. We marched into town and then over the North Bridge a little more than half a mile and then on a hill not far from the bridge where we could see and hear what was agoing on.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>After crossing over the North Bridge, the militia retired northward to an elevated position known locally as Punkataset Hill. From this hillside the colonists observed the regulars disperse throughout Concord looking for the hidden stockpiles of military goods.   </p> <p><br /> Shortly after the militia crossed the Concord River, a detachment of British soldiers also marched out of town and crossed the North Bridge. At the river the British left 96 soldiers to guard the important access point, while roughly 120 additional men continued two miles westward to the farm of militia Col. James Barrett.  For the British soldiers stationed at the North Bridge the exposed position created discomfort. To cover the bridge and the road to Barrett’s farm, two companies of British Light Infantry advanced forward a short distance to higher ground above the bridge. The light company from the 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot advanced up onto the farm of militia Captain David Brown. From this position near Brown’s cow-pasture, the British soldiers guarded the westward Groton Road to Barrett’s farm and observed the militia force continually growing on Punkatasett hill farther to the northeast. At the same time another company of light infantry from the 10<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot advanced a short distance north to a hill where the Buttrick family homes stood.<br /> <br /> At the North Bridge, Captain W.S. Laurie of the 43<sup>rd</sup> Regiment of Foot recalled his frustration when, </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“…a Country man on horse back, rode past me, with whom I spoke, demanding where he was going, he told me, he was a Doctor going to See a patient…in a short time after, this same Doctor returned, and passing us, was Observed to go towards the Wood where those (militia) men in Arms were drawn up; In a very short time after I saw there whole body Moving towards me, as they came nearer the Light Compy of the 4<sup>th</sup>. Regt. Posted on a height immediately retreated to me at the Bridge, as did likewise the Lt. Compy of the 10<sup>th</sup>. Regt. who also had been at no great distance.” </em></p> </blockquote> <h4><strong>The Muster Field </strong></h4> <p>After gathering additional men near Punkatasset Hill, the colonial militia decided to advance toward the North Bridge for a better view into Concord. When the British light infantry screening this hilltop near and the Groton Road retreated, the militia filed across the high ground and into Captain Brown’s pasture. Lt. Jospeh Hosmer, acting as adjutant, formed the units as they arrived so that they faced the town with the minute men on the right and militia on the left. While the men waited in ranks facing the town, a group of their officers and leading citizens debated their next move. Apparently, they were still uncertain as to the events in Lexington earlier that morning. As the leaders continued their discussions, men from the neighboring town of Acton, including Captain Isaac Davis’s company of minute men arrived. Earlier in the morning, the thirty-year-old Davis and some of his men, made cartridges in his home. His four children were at that time ill, and his last words to his wife Hannah were <strong><em>“Take good care of the children.”</em></strong> After arriving and filing into line, Captain Davis joined the group of officers that were consulting a few rods away.  In the meantime, the regulars in Concord had lit fires to destroy such combustible items stockpiled for military use. As seventy-one-year-old Martha Moulton later attested,</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“…they had set fire to the great gun-carriages just by the [town] house, and while they were in flames your petitioner saw smoke arise out of the Town House… then your petitioner did put her life, as it were, in her hand, and ventured to beg of the (British) officers to send some of their men to put out the fire…”</em></p> </blockquote> <p><br /> It was about 9 o’clock when the militia forming in Captain Brown’s pasture first noticed smoke rising from the town. Concern quickly spread through the ranks, especially by those who had left their families to the mercy of the British soldiers in Concord. According to Concord tradition, Lt. Joseph Hosmer was so moved by the sight of smoke that he went to the gathering of officers and asked, <strong><em>“Will you let them burn the town down?”</em></strong> In the same moment, Captain William Smith of Lincoln volunteered his company to dislodge the British from the bridge, as did Captain Davis from Acton. <br /> <br /> With only moments to spare, the militia officers made the decision to advance against the British soldiers guarding the Bridge. Following the impromptu officer’s conference, Captain Davis returned to face his company where Acton minute man Solomon Smith recalled, Captain Davis drew his sword and said to his company, <strong><em>“I haven’t a man that is afraid to go, and gave the word ‘march.'\"</em></strong> The Acton company then took its position at the head of the column.  <br /> <br /> Stretched across this <strong><em>“Muster Field,”</em></strong> the companies of minute men and militia prepared themselves for combat. Orders were given to load their guns and many men paused to change the flints needed to ignite their gunpowder. A sharp, fresh flint ensured the musket would fire if necessary. This act demonstrated the resolve of the colonial soldiers. After replacing their flints, the men discarded the small squares on the ground at their feet, where they remained for at least 150 years until a local citizen in the 1930's discovered the artifacts laying in two perfectly straight lines where the men had formed. <br /> <br /> After preparing for action, militia Colonel James Barret took one last moment to caution his men not to fire unless fired upon first. The order to march was given, and the Acton company, formed in double file, stepped off first, followed by the Concord minute companies, the Lincoln company, and finally the Bedford companies. At the head of the column was Concord Major John Buttrick, Action Captain Isaac Davis, and Westford’s Lt. Col. John Robinson. The soldiers then filed out of Captain Brown’s pasture, now known as the Muster Field. They marched onto the Groton Road, and forward toward bloodshed at the North Bridge.   </p> <h4>Commemoration </h4> <p>In the two centuries that have passed since the battle at the North Bridge, locals, and historians have called Captain Brown’s cow-pasture many things. The term Muster Field likely comes from late-19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century telling of the events of April 19.  Although covered with a dense layer of trees, much of the field remains intact in the present day. In 1885 local citizens George and Mary Keyes dedicated a stone monument set into the wall along Liberty Street to immortalize this hilltop.   </p> <h4><br /> Sources:</h4> <p>Dietrich-Smith D. 2004.

            "audioDescription": "The present Muster Field is a large rectangular field located on a towering hill overlooking the North Bridge some 350 yards to the east. Near the top of the hill, modern day Liberty Street runs east-west and is flanked by 3 foot tall stone walls and towering trees. The hill reaches a peak near the center of the muster field and a singular tree towering over the hilltop. The field is surrounded on three sides by a dense tree line with additional trees that bisect the muster field from North to South. At the peak of the Muster Field looking to the east the North Bridge is visible beyond the thin tree line that shades Liberty street. The bridge is 350 yards away and substantially lower than the muster field. From this hillside the view also includes the curved North Bridge causeway, the Concord River, and glimpses of the Old Manse house farther to the east. Just below the hill peak, a small stone monument three feet high and three feet wide is set into a stonewall along Liberty Street. The Monument reads, “On this field the Minute Men and Militia formed before marching down to the fight at the bridge.”",

A group under Scarfaced Charley watched from the Schonchin Flow as Army troops marched from Gillems Camp toward their concealed position.</p> <p>Officers Thomas and Wright were leading an artillery reconnaissance patrol to Hardin Butte. The soldiers were unenthusiastic and ill-prepared for an encounter. When the patrol stopped for lunch in the depression before you, a few scouts were sent out, but most soldiers rested. Fearing discovery by this group double their size, the Modoc opened fire from high, protected places such as this outcropping. About two-thirds of the patrol was killed or wounded in the battle; the Modoc suffered no casualties.</p> <p>A soldier not involved in the battle described the outcome:<br /> “At the first fire, the troops were so demoralized that the officers could do nothing with them. Wright was severely wounded . . . and his company, with one or two exceptions deserted him and fled like a pack of sheep; then the slaughter began.”</p> <p>Scarfaced Charley halted the battle, showing mercy for the few surviving soldiers:<br /> “All you fellows that ain’t dead had better go home. We don’t want to kill you all in one day.”</p> <p>This <strong>1.1 mi (1.8 km)</strong> trail leads to the site of a <strong>Modoc </strong>ambush on an <strong>Army </strong>reconnaissance mission during the <strong>Modoc War</strong>. Interpretive signs at the beginning and end of the trail explain the battle and its aftermath. The main trail follows the edge of the lava flow from <strong>Black Crater</strong>. A short side trail just past the trailhead also leads onto Black Crater itself, a large spatter cone. Look for tree molds, made when a living tree was burned away by fresh lava and left the imprint of its bark inside. If you are interested in exploring more geologic features, be sure to stop at pullouts in the <strong>Devils Homestead</strong> lava flow, just north on the main road.</p>",

Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer.

No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p> <p>Horses and pack animals are only permitted on the Three Sisters, Lyons and Whitney Butte trails. <strong>All wilderness rules apply to horse and rider.</strong> Ride at a slow pace; the terrain is rough. Horse riders should carry plenty of water. Summer days are hot and there is no surface water for animals to drink from. Leg protectors are recommended for horses and riders. Be alert for rattlesnakes on the trail. Horses should be sprayed completely, especially on the legs, with a fly and tick spray.</p>",

The drama of our frontier community began to unfold. . . ”<br /> Eva Lee Shepherd</p> <p>In 1864, cattleman John Shepherd homesteaded 160 acres of fertile land and brought his young family to a small adobe cabin he built nearby. As one of the first Euroamerican settlers in the area, Shepherd employed dozens of Paiute men and women, whose labor helped him prosper. He supplied mining camps with beef, hay, and grain, hauled ore to Southern California, and operated a toll road to eastside mines. By 1900, the Shepherd Ranch encompassed 1,700 acres. Much of it would become Manzanar War Relocation Center.</p> <p>In 1873, Shepherd built an elegant nine-room home. With water piped to its kitchen and an ornate fountain in the front yard, it was called “the showplace of the Owens Valley.” You would have seen the home’s tall white gables from far down the dusty Inyo County Wagon Road. Shaded by walnut, apple, and poplar trees, it became a popular stopping place and the center of a lively Owens Valley social life.</p> <p>John Shepherd retired and sold the ranch to water developer George Chaffey in 1905. The house was headquarters for Chaffey’s Owens Valley Improvement Company and home to its farm superintendents. In 1924, the City of Los Angeles purchased the property, and with the orchard community’s decline after 1930, the buildings were moved, burned, or torn down.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Skull Cave</strong> (580 ft / 177 m) One of the <strong><span style=\"color:#008000;\">\"Least Challenging Caves\"</span></strong> The wide open feel of this cave makes it an excellent choice for those who do not like tight, closed-in spaces. It is a remnant of three very large lava tubes, one on top of the other. This allows cold winter air to be trapped inside and create a year-round ice floor on the lower level, accessible via a smooth trail, down a metal stairway to a platform. It is named for the bones of pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and two human skeletons discovered inside.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>580 feet. <br /> You can walk completely upright on main path. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Cave has a relatively \"smooth\" path. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>2.4 mile drive<br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p><strong>Symbol Bridge Cave</strong> (148 ft / 45 m) One of the <strong><span style=\"color:#008000;\">\"Least Challenging Caves\"</span></strong> Irreplaceable historic Native American pictographs adorn the entrance areas of this short caves. Look closely to find the pictographs as they blend in with the rock. An easy 0.75 mi (1.21 km) hike is required to reach it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>148 feet.<br /> You can walk completely upright on main path. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Cave has a relatively \"smooth\" path. <br /> <strong>You must hike out to cave: </strong>~0.5 miles. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>2.3 mile drive. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

These rocks are slippery from mist and algae. The top of any waterfall is dangerous—never play in the stream above a waterfall.</strong><br /> <br /> Hike into a mile-high valley featuring spectacular waterfalls surrounded by rolling ridges. The Graveyard Fields Loop Trail is a very popular and reasonable hiking distance for families, including children, and includes waterfalls. The 1.3-mile loop trail is rated as easy overall, however the spur trails to the waterfalls are moderately steep. Trail access is from the Graveyard Fields Overlook at Milepost 418.8 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but the area is managed by Pisgah National Forest. Finding a parking spot might require the willingness to park a significant distance away and walk on the road to the overlook. Signs on the roadsides clearly mark where motorists can and cannot park. Cars attempting to park in restricted areas have rolled over the edge down a steep embankment! If the parking lot is full, visit one of the other hiking areas available along the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> The two waterfalls in the Graveyard Fields area are accessible from the trailhead near the vault toilets in the overlook. A trail map is available in the overlook parking lot. Familiarize yourself with the general loop trail prior to hiking. Taking a photo of the trail map is recommended. “Social trails” (or illegal trails) have been created over the years, which can make navigating confusing. Please do not compound this problem by going off the established trails. <br /> <br /> Second (or Lower) Falls is only 1/3 of a mile from the trailhead. Follow the trail down to the Yellowstone Prong, the stream that feed both waterfalls. After crossing the stream, take a right on the spur trail that follows the stream as it flows down to the waterfall. A series of stair steps will take you to the base of the waterfall for safe viewing, photography, and cooling off in the mist of the falls. Return to the loop trail the same way you came.<br /> <br /> To reach the Upper Falls, continue on the loop trail through the beautiful open meadow. Look for a spur trail to the right after about a half a mile of hiking. It is before you recross the Yellowstone Prong. This 0.8-mile spur trail to the Upper Falls crosses small creeks and is rocky towards the end. The Upper Falls is divided into two sections, each accessible by a short side trail. At the lower section, the river flows over an angled rock outcrop resembling a chute before pooling above several large boulders. The upper section is a classic tall waterfall where the water falls over a high cliff and flows over a rock face.<br /> <br /> To return to your car, follow the Upper Falls Spur Trail back to the Graveyard Fields Loop Trail. Turn right on the loop trail where it will cross the Yellowstone Prong and ascend through a rhododendron thicket back to the other end of the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Be aware that camping is not allowed in the Graveyard Fields area. During the season, the nearest National Park Service campground is located at Mount Pisgah. In the winter, the Blue Ridge Parkway may be closed in this area due to ice and snow.</p>",

These views were successfully translated into her own new home, The Mount. During an era of flamboyant house decoration, Wharton designed an airy, informal mansion with many design elements drawn from the houses of continental Europe. </span></p> <p><span>Wharton also collaborated with her niece </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/beatrix-farrand.htm\">Beatrix Farrand</a><span>, an acclaimed landscape architect, to design the gardens and landscaping of The Mount. One of America's great writers, Wharton wrote her first major work, </span><em>The House of Mirth </em><span>(1905), “a novel of manners” that described the tensions between New York’s “old” 19th-century elite society and the emerging economic power of industrialists and financiers while at The Mount. The cold Massachusetts’ winters spent there inspired Wharton’s 1911 </span><em>Ethan Frome</em><span>. </span></p> <p><span>After Wharton and her husband sold The Mount in 1911, Wharton refused to visit the house as “a stranger.” She continued to write in her new home in Europe and in 1921 was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for </span><em>The Age of Innocence.</em><span> In 1923, Wharton became the first woman to receive an honorary degree of doctorate of letters from Yale University.

In 1910, developer George Chaffey started the town as part of a 3,000-acre agricultural community. By 1920, Manzanar was an oasis of fragrant orchards, hay fields, and gardens. Two hundred people lived here then, many on irrigated farm parcels. Fifty children attended the grammar school. It had “two rooms and two outside conveniences [toilets], plus a shed for the horses,” recalled former student Dorothy Lydston Gates.<br /> <br /> Within Manzanar’s town center was the Bandhauer’s General Store, where residents traded farm produce for dry goods and mailed letters at the post office inside. You could buy gas at the garage across the highway and cold cider at the fruit stand nearby. The big community hall housed a library and was the scene of weddings, funerals, and church services. Potluck suppers and old-time dancing often filled the hall with music and laughter far into the night. Packing crews later used it to process tons of Manzanar apples, pears, and peaches to ship across the country.<br /> <br /> Advertisements for the Manzanar fruit-growing venture had promised the Lydstons, Wilders, and other families “fortunes in Apples.” But as Los Angeles began buying land and water rights in 1924, many owners sold—some willingly, others under duress—and left. Although others leased back their land and continued farming, the community slowly declined. By the late 1930s, there was little left at Manzanar except abandoned orchards and roads.",

It was created by a different lava source than the caves on Cave Loop.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>1,635 feet<br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must crawl in some places if you go through the whole cave. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>1.6 mile drive. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, constructed between 1900-1902 under the strict guidance of its daring namesake, illustrates Gardner’s intense interest in contemporary European and ancient art, and it is an excellent example of an early 20th-century house museum as well. In 1902, Gardner moved the beginnings of her collection into the four-story Italian palazzo style building. Unpretentious from the outside, the inside overlooked magnificent gardens and a skylighted central courtyard. Over the years, Gardner filled the halls and courtyard with carefully collected and arranged works of art and ancient treasures.</p> <p>When she had arrived in 1860 in Boston’s established and patrician Brahman society, Gardner found the atmosphere less than accepting of her colorful, New York City-bred personality. At first dismayed and saddened by her position, Gardner overcame her feelings and soon became, with her lavish parties and spirited discussions, one of Boston society's premier hostesses; she also became a patron of the Boston Symphony. During the 1890s, Gardner began collecting works of art from around the world and planning her grand museum. Until her death in 1924, Gardner traveled throughout Europe and Asia meticulously collecting art to add to her collection. In her will, Gardner bequeathed the museum to the city of Boston as a public institution. There was one condition, however: the collection had to be maintained precisely as Gardner had arranged it--nothing could be added, removed or rearranged. The museum and its collection, both monuments to personal taste, remain unique to this day.</p>",

The moments before the actual attack were tense ones, spent in trenches like this one. A war correspondent from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial writes that ‘The minutes passed in muted apprehension. There was no evidence in the movement or bearing of the men that they were so soon to essay ‘the deadly imminent breach’ though they must have been conscious that the task laid out for them was on which none but men hoping to meet death would covet…. no one could have guessed from their undisturbed faces, that all the latent gallantry of their natures could be aroused, and lashed into a fury of heroism during the next ten minutes.” At roughly half past 8 am, the signal gun would sound, and the assault would begin.",

            "bodyText": "This line of monuments marks the positions of Union infantry of General John Gibbon’s 2nd Division, 2nd Corps, and General Abner Doubleday’s 3rd Division, 1st Corps, on July 3. Each Union army corps had adopted a patch which the men generally wore on their hats. The symbol for the 2nd Corps was a trefoil. This corps occupied Cemetery Ridge on July 2 and July 3 which is why you will see many trefoils on monuments along the ridge.<br /> <br /> One of the more unique monuments along this line honors the 20th Massachusetts Infantry. The 20<sup>th</sup> had the nickname “The Harvard Regiment,” because a number of their officers were graduates of Harvard College. The regiment’s colonel was Paul Joseph Revere, the grandson of Paul Revere. He was killed by artillery fire on the afternoon of July 2. Among its lieutenants was Sumner Paine, a great grandson of a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Paine was killed during the repulse of Pickett’s Charge. The monument consists of a 30-ton pebbledconglomerate rock known as “Roxbury puddingstone,” named for the town of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The idea for the monument came from some members of the regiment from Roxbury who, as children, had played on such boulders. In 1983, the “Roxbury puddingstone” became the official rock of the state of Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> The men of the 20th and the regiments around them endured the artillery bombardment before Pickett’s Charge as best they could. On the night of July 2, with a single shovel shared by the men, the regiment dug what one described as “a slight rifle-pit, a foot deep and a foot high.” This afforded the men some shelter from the artillery fire, but since most of the Confederate shells were directed at the Union artillery or overshot the ridge, losses were light. When the Confederate infantry advanced, the Union soldiers allowed them to come close before opening fire. Captain Henry Abbott, serving with the 20th, described the fighting in the after-action report of his regiment:<br /> <br /> “<i>After the cessation of the enemy’s artillery fire, their infantry advanced in large force. The men were kept lying on their bellies, without firing a shot, until orders to fire came from Colonel Hall, commanding the brigade, the enemy having got within 3 or 4 rods of us [15 to 20 yards], when the regiment rose up and delivered two or three volleys, which broke the rebel regiment opposite us entirely to pieces, leaving only scattered groups.</i>”<br /> <br /> Another soldier in the 20<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts:<br /> <br /> “<i>From the moment that the men of the Twentieth commenced firing, the smoke was so thick that little could be seen, but there was no trouble in making it effective, for not less than three thousand men formed a vast crowd in front. The noise and turmoil were such that commands could not be heard, and every one fought in his own way</i>.”<br /> <br /> Although the men along this part of the Union line checked the Confederate infantry in their front, the Confederates to the right had greater success and managed to pierce the Union line. Our next stops will take us to this area.<br />  ",

It is possible to walk upright for approximately 800 ft (244 m) to the stairway, after which the ceiling rarely exceeds 3 ft (0.9 m). A few places exist where the ceiling height is less then 12 in (30 cm). A cave map is highly recommended for any group planning to explore the entire cave, as multiple levels and numerous side passages can be confusing. This cave is not recommended for inexperienced cavers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>6,903 feet. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must crawl in some places if you go through the whole cave. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>Cave Loop. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

From 1840 to 1872, Sitka was the Seat of the Russian Orthodox Diocese which governed all of North America, and thereafter it continued as the Seat of the Diocese of Alaska. This outstanding example of Russian church architecture was by far the largest and most imposing religious edifice in Alaska until well into the 20th century. The present cathedral is a reconstruction of the original building which burned to the ground in January 1966.</p> <h4><br /> Architectural Highlights</h4> <p>The original cathedral was built of native logs with clapboard siding. The roofs, with the exceptions of the domes which were metal, were of wood shingle and later replaced with asphalt shingles. The architect was the first Orthodox Bishop of Alaska, Innocent Ioann Veniaminov. After the cathedral burned in 1966, it was reconstructed using drawings made in 1961 by the Historic American Buildings Survey. The object of the reconstruction was to create a reproduction of the original structure, while incorporating modern fire-resistant materials. The building today is constructed of concrete and steel walls with vinyl siding recreating the original texture, with asphalt roof shingles and copper roofing on the domes.</p> <p>The Cathedral is constructed in the form of a Greek cross with a belltower, with the exterior elevations expressing interior spaces. The origin of this concept in Alaska may be seen in drawings of another church designed by Bishop Innocent, the Church of the Holy Ascension, built at Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands in 1825. There, too, the church had two domes, one reflecting the inner space of the center of the cross.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/ak0004/\">Library of Congress, Historic American Buildings Survey - Photos and Drawings</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/66000165\">National Register of Historic Places - Official Nomination Form </a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/akso/history/PDF/nhl-sitka.pdf\">Sitka's National Historic Landmarks: A Window into Alaska's Past</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

The title of the wayside is below the black banner in large black font. The panel has a cream-colored background. Black text is arranged in two columns on the left side of the wayside. Below the text are two photographic images. In the upper right hand corner of the panel are two sketches of plants. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: A Sea of Grasses<br /> <br /> <strong>Text:</strong> Pioneers saw the Great Plains as an endless and monotonous \"Sea of Grasses,\" but it was much more. It was a land inhabited by nomadic people who followed the immense herds of bison. These Native American tribes knew and understood the prairie, its animals and plants. <br /> <br /> The Great Plains are very different today. They have been altered by modern people; both the bison herds and the plains Native Americans' nomadic way of life are gone. <br /> <br /> Thousands of acres of untouched prairie are lost to agriculture and development each year. Less than one percent of the original 400,000 square miles (256 million acres) of native prairie exists. What remains grows in small, fragmented acreages. Today the dominant native prairie plants at Scotts Bluff include needleandthread and blackroot sedge. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Fire moves across grasses, leaving charred remains on the left-hand side.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Prairie grasses and plants are seen below sandstone bluffs. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Prescribed fire is used to maintain a restored prairie. Fire, a critical part of the natural prairie ecosystem, controls non-native vegetation, recycles nutrients, and stimulates the native plants, which are adapted to periodic burning. Scotts Bluff National Monument has an ongoing program dedicated to restoring and protecting the native prairie. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A sketch of the above and below-ground parts of Needleandthread.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image caption:</strong> Needleandthread <em>Stipa comata</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A sketch of the above and below-ground parts of Blackroot sedge.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image caption:</strong> Blackroot sedge <em>Carex filifolia </em>Bellamy Parks Jensen, artist<br /> <br />  ",

            "bodyText": "<h4><br /> North American Coastal Defense & World War II</h4> <p>Sitka Naval Operating Base was the U.S. Navy's first air station in Alaska, playing a key role in the defense of North America at the outset of World War II. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 the base at Sitka was the only major military base on the west coast, north of Puget Sound, Washington.</p> <p>Beginning as a U.S. Navy coaling station in 1902, on Japonski Island across from Sitka, the base was expanded up through World War II when it underwent its greatest period of growth. In 1942, the base was designated a Naval Operating Base to reflect its expanded World War II mission. To defend the base, a U.S. Army Coastal Defense network was established, which included construction of three forts in Sitka Sound. An 8,100-foot causeway was constructed from Japonski Island through seven islands to Fort Rousseau on Makhnati Island, which became the Army’s headquarters in Sitka when it was completed in 1943. Fort Peirce was located 18 miles southwest of Sitka on Biorka Island and Fort Babcock was located 12 miles west of Sitka on the southern tip of Kruzof Island.</p> <p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was not known where the enemy might strike next, planes from Sitka Naval Operating Base patrolled all of southeast Alaska and far out into the Gulf of Alaska. With the establishment of naval air stations farther west, at Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, Sitka became an intermediate point between them and Navy Yard Puget Sound, the primary repair yard for battle-damaged ships of the Pacific Fleet during World War II. When the Japanese Imperial Fleet sailed east, attacked Dutch Harbor and entrenched in the Aleutians in June 1942, the Sitka base was on high alert for a potential attack on the Alaskan mainland. It is one of eight National Historic Landmarks in Alaska that was designated to commemorate the World War II in Alaska.</p> <h4><br /> Learn More About World War II in Alaska</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wwii-nhl-aleu-campaign.htm\">World War II had a major impact on Alaska</a>. At the height of the War more than 100,000 American and Canadian soldiers were stationed in Alaska. Alaska's infrastructure grew immensely as a result. Roads, ports, and airfields were improved or constructed to facilitate the transportation of troops and supplies. An impact that many people are unaware of is the forced evacuation of the Native population of the Aleutian Islands by Japanese and American forces.</p> <h4><br /> Current Condition</h4> <p>The Sitka Naval Operating Base and U.S. Army Coastal Defenses NHL is in good condition. Since 2000 a number of preservation and rehabilitation efforts have begun or been completed that have significantly improved the condition of the NHL. In 2001, the Sitka Maritime Heritage Society began rehabilitation of the NHL's Boathouse, with the objective of turning it into an interpretive center. Infrasture and utility upgrades, new construction, and building rehabilitation in 2005 and 2006 by the Alaska Department of Transportation, Alaska Department of Education, U.S. Coast Guard were all completed without compromising the Landmark's historic design or setting.<br /> <br /> In 2005, Sitka Trail Works began the process of cleaning up, documenting Fort Russeau, the U.S. Army Coastal Defenses portion of the NHL, with plans to develop a hiking trail. In the 2007, with encouragement from Sitka Trail Works, the State of Alaska designated Fort Russeau a State Historical Park. </p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sitk/planyourvisit/upload/nhl-sitka.pdf\">Sitka's National Historic Landmarks: A Window into Alaska's Past</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sitkaww2.com/harbordefenses/harbordefenses.html\">Sitka's World War II Site - History by Local Historians</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<h4><br /> <br /> The Aleutians: An unlikely place for a tree farm</h4> <p>Unalaska Island and the Aleutian Islands chain is remarkable for its treeless landscape. It gives far-off views of tundra valleys, snowcapped mountain peaks, steaming volcano tops, and the deep blue Pacific Ocean.<br /> <br /> This boundless vista unobstructed by tall trees is the site of the first afforestation project in North America. Different from reforestation—where tree cover is replaced—Russian colonizers experimented with afforestation, planting trees where none had stood before.</p> <h4><br /> Russian Enterprise</h4> <p>In 1805 a Russian colony had settled on Unalaska. Desiring to be as self-sufficient as possible they planted spruce trees imported from Southeast Alaska, <em>Picea sitchensis</em> the Sitka spruce.<br /> <br /> Being at the merging point of warm southern currents and cold arctic currents, the Aleutian Islands has earned its reputation as an astonishingly windy environment. You can expect rainfall for about 250 days of the year and strong wind gusts are common. Tree fossils have been found on the Aleutians, but the windy gales are unwelcoming to anything more than shrubby willow and the occasional conifer never reach more than 10 feet in height.<br /> <br /> Twenty years after the first planting only 20 trees stood at the plantation. In 1975, only six of the original Sitka spruce were still growing but hundreds of small saplings surrounded them.</p> <h4><br /> The Sitka Spruce Plantation National Historic Landmark today</h4> <p>Two hundred years after the first planting the spruce are still confined to a tiny plot within the Sitka Spruce Park that Unalaska enjoys as a town park with a small playground. Walking along a trail that winds through the remains of the plantation gives one the feeling of being in a forest. Benches overlook a small reflective pond.<br /> <br /> Though treeless, the landscape cannot be called desolate. The Aleutian Islands span from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula 1,100 miles to Attu Island on the western end of the island chain.  It is a popular destination for birders to catch a glimpse of northern species and migratory birds from all over the globe. You can also observe whales, sea otters, and other sea mammal species. Introduced animals include red and blue foxes and caribou. In the summer months, flowering plants, grasses, berries, herbage, and shrubs give the islands a glowing emerald hue.</p> <h4><br /> A Russian tree farm and the history of Alaska and the United States</h4> <p>The Russian colonizers and tree planters did not settle a derelict land. Russian explorers describe their relationship with Alaska Natives in journals and reports.<br /> <br /> Archeological evidence attest to seafarers colonizing the Aleutians and the Gulf of Alaska at least 9,000 years ago. The rising ocean that submerged the Bering Land Bridge has probably drowned the most ancient human settlements in the Alaska.<br /> <br /> Their descendants, Unangax families (commonly referred to as Aleut), prosper in Alaska today.<br /> <br /> The National Historic Landmark is about two and a half miles from Holy Ascension of Our Lord Cathedral National Historic Landmark. A Russian Orthodox Church, founded in 1826 then rebuilt in 1894, with a strong congregation on Unalaska and Amaknak Islands. The Sitka Spruce Plantation National Historic Landmark is also within the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base & Fort Mears, U.S. Army National Historic Landmark, which commemorates the World War II operations on the islands, including the evacuation of hundreds of U.S. citizens from the Aleutian Islands.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <div class=\"gmail_default\"><a href=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr236.pdf\">Growth of Historical Sitka Spruce Plantations at Unalaska Bay,USFS, 1989</a></div> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Stedman-Thomas Historic District in Ketchikan, Alaska was a cultural melting pot for Asians and Pacific Islanders working in Alaska's fishing industry from the early 1900s to the 1940s. The historic district was one of the earliest neighborhoods in Ketchikan and played an important role in the economic history of the city and in the lives of the district's residents.<br />  </p> <p>For centuries an abundant supply of salmon, halibut, and other ocean resources sustained the Tlingit Indians who established a summer fishing camp at the mouth of Ketchikan Creek. By the late 1880s, the abundance of fish drew white settlers to Ketchikan. These newcomers lived in small shacks at the mouth of the creek, alongside the Tlingit. The Alaskan gold rushes of the 1890s brought thousands of people north, and Ketchikan's location as the southernmost community in Alaska made it an ideal stopover for north-bound steamships. The city, which had incorporated in 1900, was a major outfitting and supply center as well as the regional center for southeastern Alaska’s rapidly growing fishing industry.<br /> <br /> As settlers and entrepreneurs came to Ketchikan, the populations became increasingly segregated. The Tlingit began to move south of Ketchikan Creek, forming a neighborhood known as Indian Town. As early as 1908, a small community of Japanese, Chinese, and Filipinos, had moved to Ketchikan, looking for economic opportunities provided by the fishing industry. Because of social segregation, they settled in Indian Town, opening businesses along Stedman Street. Most of the neighborhood's first businesses were owned and operated by Asian families. George Ohashi had a store at 223 Stedman Street as early as 1910, which advertised its fresh \"Chop Suey\" ingredients in the local newspaper, the <em>Ketchikan Daily News</em>. Other Asian immigrants and businesses included George Shimizu and his family, who owned and ran the New York Hotel and Café at 207-211 Stedman Street; Harry Kimura, who owned Harry's Place at 325 Stedman Street; Jim Tanino, who operated Jimmy's Noodle Café at 227 Stedman Street; and James Tatsuda, who owned and operated Tatsuda's Grocery Store at 339 Stedman Street. The Japanese community had a small school and meeting house on the hill above Stedman Street, where adult volunteers taught the children of Japanese immigrants their native language.<br />  </p> <p>The beginning of World War I created additional demand for protein sources such as seafood and by the end of the war the Alaskan fishing industry was highly prosperous. Ketchikan was the home port for an estimated 2,000 fishing boats with the tidal flats along Stedman Street providing one of the safest mooring areas in the city during bad weather. The Stedman Street area became the home for a small, but growing fleet of fishing boats and businesses formed to supply their needs. Indian Town grew significantly during the 1920s and soon became a self-contained \"city within a city,\" supporting several hundred permanent and seasonal residents.<br /> <br /> As Japanese and Chinese immigration to the U.S. became more restricted in the 1920s, Filipinos came north to work in the <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-e2b88a3d-b11c-9003-f254-1b46f8526f11\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/places/kake-cannery.htm\">Alaska canneries</a>. </b>Ketchikan had one of the earliest permanent Filipino communities in Alaska. Those Filipinos who did not live in bunkhouses at the canneries generally lived in Indian Town. Many Filipinos resided in group homes, and individuals who had established themselves in Ketchikan often acted as sponsors for new arrivals until they had the means to find their own living quarters. The building at 337-339 Stedman Street housed a Filipino Social Club, which became the Filipino Community Club in 1938. This organization, formed by district residents, is considered the first Filipino community club in Alaska.<br />  </p> <p>Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Ketchikan served as a principal outfitting and supply center for the fishermen in the region. The city also became a headquarters for buying, selling, canning, freezing, and shipping fish. Despite the social and geographical segregation they experienced in Ketchikan, the residents of Indian Town believed there were more opportunities and acceptance in Alaska than in other parts of the U.S. The tolerant climate of the neighborhood, in particular, helped many to realize their economic goals, while continuing to maintain their ethnic identities.<br />  </p> <p>The economic importance of fishing continued to increase through the 1930s with Alaska providing nearly two-thirds of the world's salmon, as well as a significant portion of halibut, herring, and other seafood. Activity in Indian Town increased with the improvement of the tidal flats along Stedman Street in the early 1930s. During the winter, boat owners found that the mooring areas in Ketchikan did not provide enough protection and left to winter their boats in other Southeast Alaska cities. To keep the fishing fleet in Ketchikan year-round, the city dredged the tidal flats and built a breakwater in order to provide a protected harbor. Although Indian Town was already involved in supporting the fishing industry, its role intensified with the building of the new harbor known as the Thomas Basin.<br />  </p> <p>The outbreak of war in Asia and Europe in 1939 brought a greater demand for fish. As the war progressed, a shrinking labor pool plagued the fishing industry and canners consolidated their operations. In 1942, with the U.S. entrance into World War II, Ketchikan's Japanese residents were evacuated to relocation centers in the lower 48 states, primarily to the <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-63f1dc24-b11d-abd8-2cb5-8cfe351d2abc\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/miin/index.htm\">Minidoka Relocation Center </a></b>in Idaho.<br /> <br /> The Stedman-Thomas Historic District residents, businesses, and an active neighborhood association have undertaken improvement projects over the years to preserve Indian Town’s multicultural history. The historic district contains 47 buildings and structures that reflect the overall character and feeling of the district during the 1910s through the 1930s. Nearly all of the commercial buildings in the district line Stedman Street and are simple wood frame structures with false fronts, which were added to existing buildings in the 1920s. The residential buildings are mostly two-story houses with shed-roofed kitchen additions in the back. Today, the Stedman-Thomas Historic District is a thriving commercial and arts neighborhood that still evokes the feel of an early 20th century Alaskan fishing community.<br /> <br /> Stedman-Thomas Historic District is located in Ketchikan, AK and is roughly bounded by the Stedman Street Bridge, Stedman St., East St., and the Thomas Basin. The district also includes all of the buildings along Brown Way, Tatsuda Way, Inman St., and Thomas St. For more information visit the <a href=\"http://www.visit-ketchikan.com/\">Ketchikan Visitors Bureau</a> website. </p>",

On May 23, 1861, the regiment was mustered into United States service as the 84th New York Volunteers, however they retained their former title for most of their service. As the regiment recruited heavily from the Brooklyn area it subsequently became known as the \"Fourteenth Brooklyn.\"  <br /> <br /> The regiment saw extensive service during the Civil War and played important roles at both the First and Second Battles of Manassas (Bull Run). At First Manassas on July 21, 1861, the regiment was actively engaged on Henry Hill while supporting the Federal artillery batteries. <br /> <br /> At the Second Battle of Manassas, the regiment first saw action on the evening of August 29, 1862. Ordered west on the Warrenton Turnpike in pursuit of what was supposedly a retreating enemy, the unit collided with Confederates under Gen. John B. Hood. After a brief but severe twilight clash, the regiment withdrew. The following day, August 30, the 14th Brooklyn saw severe fighting as part of Gen. Fitz John Porter's attack at the Deep Cut. The regiment suffered 129 men killed, wounded, and missing at Second Manassas. <br /> <br /> <b>Inscription:</b><br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; text-align: center;\"> </span> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>14th Regiment N.Y.S.M. <br /> (84th Regiment N.Y.

To the right of the text are two images. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title:</strong> A Landscape Changed Forever<br /> <br /> <strong>Text:</strong> Some called it \"The Great American Desert\"<br /> <br /> Unlike the Native Americans, many 19th century European-Americans did not see the abundance and beauty of the prairie. At first it was just a barrier between them and their goals further west. Oregon had the fertile Willamette Valley, California had gold and Utah was the Promised Land. <br /> <br /> As they passed in their thousands: their animals devoured the grasses, their wagons ground deep paths and the people brought diseases to Native Americans who had no resistance. The presence of so many people crossing the plains disrupted the migration of several animal herds the Native Americans depended on for food, tools, clothing and housing. <br /> <br /> Some of the animals disappeared completely, others moved to ever shrinking habitats. The Prairie wolf and Audubon bighorn sheep are now extinct. Lone bears, elk, moose and antelope show up once every few years. The only bison in the area no longer roam free, they live on ranches instead. <br /> <br /> Once Nebraska opened to homesteading, settlers gradually made their way to the Scotts Bluff area. Using modern irrigation techniques, the North Platte River watered their crops and cattle, trees were planted as wind breaks and the face of the American prairie became what you see today. Soon the \"Great American Desert\" became a vital part of the nation's food production. <br /> <br /> What untouched areas are close to your home? Are they, or should they be, preserved? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Parallell wheel ruts are seen cutting through a prairie landscape.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Scars from wagon wheels still mark the landscape.

Howard said of Harker “The only complaint I ever heard was that if Harker got started against the enemy, he could not be kept back… Whenever anything difficult was to be done, anything that required pluck and energy, we called on Gen. Harker.” Harker’s 3<sup>rd</sup> brigade of seven regiments was ordered to charge this section of the Confederate works. In the early morning hours of the 27<sup>th</sup>, Harker was seen sealing and finishing up several letters home. In what was noted as potentially an eerie premonition, Harker gave a member of his staff his personal papers and said “I shall not come out of the charge today alive”. A few hours later, while at the front of the charge and urging his men forward, a bullet tears through his arm and enters his chest. He would fall near this spot. A private from Illinois would later write “Several of the men nearest him spang up to carry him off the field; of these some were struck down at once, but others filled their places.” A surgeon would declare his wound fatal and Gen. Harker would die by 1:00 pm later that day.",

The young soldier fell near this location during the battle. One of his comrades, Lieutenant Randalph Marshall would take on the difficult duty of notifying Sgt. Coffey’s mother with a letter written after the battle. He writes: “I felt it a duty for some weeks to write you indeed I should have done so soon after the death of your son, but the task seemed one of so delicate a character, that I have deferred it till now… That he fell like a brave solider, gallantly fighting in defense of his country, and for the most sacred rights of man, needs no assurance from me. The united testimony from his commander as to his courage, consistency, and patriotic devotion to his country is in conclusion evidence of the esteem in which he was held by them. …Copernicus was my messmate in many campaign, he and myself have messed and slept together and especially on this last one he and I shared the same tent and bed. On the morning of the 27<sup>th</sup> of June, we rose from our bed beneath our shelter tent and after breakfasting filled our knapsacks and started to the fatal charge. …He fell gloriously on the field. I miss him much and shall ever cherish his memory as a faithful and true friend. I know the pang of your sorrow and distress felt by his mother, whom he loved and revered.”",

Magazin National Historic Landmark is the only surviving structure known to have been associated with both the Russian-American Co. (1799) and the Alaska Commercial Company (1868). Both trading companies were controlling factors in the Russian and early American administration of Alaska.  Constructed sometime between 1804 and 1808, it is the oldest of only four Russian structures standing in the United States.</p> <h4><br /> Architectural Highlights</h4> <p>The Magazin (or storehouse) was built of traditional Russian horizontal log construction. Dovetailed at the corners, the 12” wide fir logs were rough hewn, grooved on the bottom to fit over the log below, and chinked with moss. The one-and-a-half story building was originally topped with a tall hipped roof. The first floor of the Magazin originally consisted of two large, unequally-sized rooms, separated by a 9” wide log partition, with no interior passage. These rooms served as a store and warehouse for furs collected by the Russian-American Company, primarily seal and sea otter, but also beaver, fox, bear, lynx, sable, mink and wolverine. The second floor of the magazine was most likely used for residential purposes.</p> <p>The Magazin underwent a number of alterations over the course of the nineteenth century. At an early date the exterior was sheathed with vertical siding, using redwood from Russian holdings in California. At about the time of the American purchase of Alaska, the hipped roof was replaced by a steep gable roof, with a prominent front gable installed shortly after. The building’s front porch was probably also constructed at that time. Horizontal siding was installed on the building in 1883. By 1898, a small projecting bay had been inserted in the southwest end of the building. Two openings were inserted in the first floor interior dividing wall at an unknown date.</p> <h4><br /> The Kodiak History Museum on Kodiak Island</h4> <p>In 1911, the Magazin was sold by the Alaska Commercial Company to one of its employees, Wilbur J. Erskine, who resided in the building until his death in 1948. In 1964, following the extensive damage to Kodiak from the Good Friday earthquake and tsunami, the building was acquired by the Alaska Housing Authority. In 1967, the Kodiak Historical Society leased the building for use as a museum. Purchased by the City of Kodiak in 1972, the Magazin continues to operate as the Kodiak History Museum.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information </h4> <p><a href=\"https://kodiakhistorymuseum.org/\">The Kodiak History Museum </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ak0005/\">Library of Congress, Historic American Building Survey - Photos and Drawings</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/66000954\">National Register of Historic Places - Official Nomination Form</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/nhl/russian-america/index.htm\">Russian America: A National Historic Landmark Theme Study </a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

Developed by the U.S. Army the Nike-Hercules missile was the U.S. military’s first nuclear capable anti-aircraft missile, and designed to destroy approaching formations of nuclear armed Soviet bombers.</p> <p>From 1959-60 eight Nike missile sites were commissioned in Alaska, three around Anchorage and five around Fairbanks. Nike Site Summit was activated in May 1959 on Mt. Gordon Lyon, located on the eastern edge of today's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER), adjacent to Chugach State Park.  Many long time Alaskans living in the Anchorage area have fond memories of the annual live fire exercises that were conducted at Nike Site Summit from 1960-63. Nike Site Summit stood guard over Fort Richardson, Elmendorf Air Force Base, and Anchorage until 1979 when it and the site in Florida, the last two Nike missile sites in the nation, closed.</p> <p>In 1996, Nike Site Summit was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 for its national significance as “an exceptionally well preserved example of a Cold War-era Nike-Hercules missile installation.”  After sitting abandoned for 30 years, subjected to vandalism and the elements a partnership was formed in 2009 and work began to stabilize, preserve, and cleanup. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.nikesitesummit.net/\">Friends of Nike Site Summit</a></span> (FONSS), a volunteer organization, partnered with the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1437/index.htm\">NPS Alaska Region Cultural Resources</a></span> team, JBER, the Alaska State Historic Preservation Office, and the Alaska Association for Historic Preservation.</p> <p>After three years and thousands of hours of volunteer labor guided summer tours began in 2012. Each summer FONSS kicks off the tour season with its highly prized Summer Solstice tours. Building stabilization, clean-up, and safety improvements continue and FONSS is working to get a Nike Hercules Missile to showcase in one of the site’s two Missile Launch and Storage bunkers.</p>",

Like the famous Chimney Rock to the east, Scotts Bluff is an outlier formation to the Wildcat Hills, visible along the horizon to your right. <br /> <br /> Twenty-two million years ago, the surface of the plains was as high as Scotts Bluff - a gently sloping landscape composed of sediments from mountains to the west. About 3 million years ago, the Platte River and its tributaries began to erode the high plains. Bit by bit, water carried away massive volumes of soil and rock, creating canyons that grew wider and wider. <br /> <br /> Today only the Wildcat Hills, Scotts Bluff and other erosion-resistant remnants of the high plains remain. On the multi-layered cliff face ahead you can see many of the rock layers that once covered this region. <br /> <br /> How was the land around your home formed? <br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image:</strong> A section of sandstone bluff known as Saddle Rock is seen with layers of rock.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Captions:</strong> Slender horizontal bodies of rock called concretions are exposed in the rock here. The pale concretions are lime deposits from underground water. This layer of limestone provides a capstone which protects softer rock layers underneath. <br /> <br /> Large, shallow cavities appear on the cliff face where slabs of rock have fallen away.<br /> <br /> Knobs at this end of Saddle Rock have been protected from erosion by erosion-resistant cap rocks. <br /> <br /> These slabs of sandstone broke away from the cliff face and slumped downward. As they slowly disintegrate, the pieces become part of the slope below. <br /> <br /> Between this slab and the cliff face there's a crack wide enough to see through. Eventually the slab will fall away, and new cracks will appear. <br /> <br /> This white ash layer consists of tiny, wind-borne glass shards erupted from western volcanos. Underneath the ash, oxidation has stained the sandstone a rusty brown. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inset Image:</strong> Gray limestone concretions protrude from layers of sandstone. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inset Image Caption:</strong> Hard, pipe-like limestone concretions help to hold Scotts Bluff together.

Floods and lightning caused grass fires killed seedlings that tried to grow on the plains. Mixed tall and short grasses grew on the prairie around the bluffs, perfect grazing for the bison and elk that lived here. Only on top of the bluffs were trees able to grow. <br /> <br /> To the first people of this area, it was not barren. There was life everywhere. Along with game to hunt, there were fish in the river. Many of the plants had multiple uses including the yucca, prickly pear, chokecherry, sunflower, wild onion and wild licorice. The land was bountiful and appreciated.<br /> <br /> Wildlife, including bear, antelope, praiie wolves, coyotes and the all-important bison, roamed the area. What better spot to scout the location of the herds than from the top of the bluff?<br /> <br /> The first recorded sighting of the bluffs was by a party of men from John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Companyheaded east from Oregon in 1812. On Christmas Day, Robert Stuart wrote: \"The hills on the south have lately approached the river, are remarkably rugged and Bluffy, and possess a few Cedars.\" The first white men did not leave much of a mark on the prairie. There were few fur traders and they traveled across the plains quickly.<br /> <br /> What did your home look like before modern houses and landscaping changed it? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of Scotts Bluff Circa 1837. In the foreground men are seen on horseback.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> In 1837 Alfred Jacob Miller traveled to the fur trade rendezvous in Wyoming and stopped to sketch Scotts Bluff.

It has a black rectangular base with two rectangular pillars supporting the wayside panel. The panel is framed in black metal. The wayside is located near the summit of Scotts Bluff, just east of the North Overlook Trail. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Layout</strong>: At the top of the wayside is a thin black banner with white text. Aligned to the left is \"Scotts Bluff National Monument\". Aligned to the right is the text \"National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior,\" and finally the National Park Service arrowhead. The title of the wayside is below the black banner in large black font. The panel has a light-blue colored background. Black text is arranged in two columns in the upper left hand corner of the wayside. There is a primary image that takes up most of the wayside and an inset image in the lower left-hand corner. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: Eroding Landmark<br /> <br /> <strong>Text</strong>: Little by little, Scotts Bluff is eroding away.<br /> <br /> You are now standing on the summit of Scotts Bluff, but each year a little more of it erodes away. In 1933, the top of the metal survey post in front of you was level with the rock surface. In just a few decades a considerable volume of sandstone has eroded away. <br /> <br /> One by one, the grains of sand that make up this sedimentary rock break off, then blow or wash away. Given time, the persistent action of rain, ice, and wind will reduce Scotts Bluff to the level of the surrounding flatlands. <br /> <br /> Erosion may happen slowly over time or suddenly with a rock slide. Weather elements often combine to make larger erosion events occur. <br /> <br /> Human footsteps greatly accelerate the erosion of soft sandstone formations. Please help to preserve Scotts Bluff for future generations by remaining on the hard-surfaced trails. <br /> <br /> What can you do to prevent erosion? <br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image:</strong> Layers of soft, tan sandstone rock are seen capped with a layer of harder, gray limestone. <br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image Caption:</strong> Cap layers of hard, erosion-resistant rock help to protect softer layers below. The cap rock in front of you is gradually breaking away, exposing the pale, easily-crumbled sandstone to the elements. Credit: NPS photo. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inset Image:</strong> A metal post survey marker sticks out of the ground. Yellow flowers bloom at its base. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inset Image Caption:</strong> The survey marker here shows the highest elevation of Scotts Bluff to be 4649 feet (1417 meters) above sea level, but natural and human erosion are working to reduce that figure.

Sulphur Caldron's turbulent waters have a pH of approximately 1-2, which is similar to car battery acid or stomach fluids. <br /><br />Its name comes from the large amounts of free sulfur in its waters.</p><h3>Hot Springs</h3><p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions. <br /><br />Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below. <br /><br />This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p><h3>The Smell</h3><p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area's smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas. <br /><br />Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p><h3>Mud Volcano Area</h3><p>The Mud Volcano area has many mudpots and hillsides strewn with trees cooked by steam. The hydrothermal features here are some of the most acidic in the park.<br /><br />Mud Volcano is near the greatest uplift and sinking of the Yellowstone Caldera floor. Many faults converge here and earthquakes are common.<br /><br />The areas surrounding the Mud Volcano vent and the other major vent near Old Faithful are called resurgent domes. Resurgent domes are active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p><h3>Use Caution in Thermal Areas</h3><p>- Stay on boardwalks and trails.<br />- Thermal water can severely burn you.<br />- Never run, push, or shove.<br />- Supervise children at all times.<br /><br />**You are responsible for your safety.**<br /><br />**Think Safety, Act Safely. Yellowstone is a Dangerous Place.**</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Sulphur Caldron<br />898 words<br />There are 5 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (256 words) <br />Sulphur Caldron, located near the Mud Volcano area, is an acidic hot spring bubbling with turbulent yellow water. Overlooking Sulphur Caldron are two wayside exhibits, mounted side by side on a low log structure. The first wayside exhibit, located on the left, is entitled \"Volcanic Landscape.\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"You are inside the caldera of one of the largest volcanoes in the world! The volcano has erupted at least three times, and Yellowstone is full of signs that volcanic activity is still very much alive below ground.\"<br /><br />On the panel's left side is a large color photo of the landscape here at Sulphur Caldron--a bubbling pool of yellow water with dark hills towering beyond a stand of evergreen trees in the distance. A caption accompanied with an arrow pointing to one of the rounded hills at the photo's top right corner reads:<br /><br />\"On the Rise. Magma is moving and pushing underground, forcing the hill in front of you to rise! Two of these bulges or \"resurgent domes\" have been found in the caldera. From here, you can see part of the Sour Creek dome--an oval-shaped hill about ten miles long and six miles wide.\"<br /><br />More text tells us:<br /><br />\"A Big Cooking Pot. Bubbling, steaming, and churning within Yellowstone's caldera--a Spanish word for a large cooking pot--are thousands of mudpots, fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers.<br /><br />\"By comparing new surveys with benchmark elevations, geologists have determined that the Yellowstone caldera is rising and falling as magma and hydrothermal fluids move below.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (135 words) <br />A small map to the right of the text includes a black dot marked \"You are Here\" in the center of Yellowstone's caldera. Sour Creek resurgent dome is located slightly above and to the right of this dot, and Mallard Lake resurgent dome is located below and to the left. The locations of three eruptions occurring 2.1 million years ago, 1.3 million years ago, and the most recent Yellowstone caldera, 640,000 years old, are also marked on the map. Additional text below the map reads:<br /><br />\"Where's the Rim? Yellowstone's caldera--30 miles wide and 45 miles long--is so huge, it is difficult to imagine the massive eruption that created it! After the volcano exploded, lava continued to flow, filling in much of the caldera and making the crater and its rim hard to see.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (145 words)<br /><br />The wayside exhibit on the right is entitled \"Sulphur Caldron.\" Text tells us: <br /><br />\"Ten times more acidic than lemon juice, Sulphur Caldron sits on the edge of one of the most active areas of Yellowstone's buried volcano. Sulphur-rich gases rise furiously here, filling Sulphur Caldron with sulfuric acid. Incredibly, this muddy pool is teeming with life!\"<br /><br />Below this text is a close-up photo of Sulphur Caldron's yellow water. Text superimposed over the photo reads: <br /><br />\"Home Sweet Home. Billions of thermoacidophiles thrive in Sulphur Caldron. They convert the pool's hydrogen sulfide gas into sulfuric acid.<br /><br />\"The sulfuric acid breaks soil and rock into mud, making this spring a very muddy home.\"<br /><br />Text in a box below the photo reads:<br /><br />\"What is a Thermoacidophile?<br /><br /><br />\"Thermo = Heat<br /><br /><br />\"Acid = Acidic<br /><br /><br />\"Phile = Love<br /><br /><br />\"Microorganisms that \"love\" to live in an extremely hot, acidic environment are called â€˜thermoacidophiles.'\"<br /><br />Section 4 (130 words)<br /><br />Another box to the right is entitled \"pH Scale Basics.\" Below the title is a narrow horizontal band, or scale, blocked into 15 colors, from shades of red and orange on the left to shades of yellow and green in the center to finally shades of blue and violet on the right. Text below this scale tells us:<br /><br />\"If you have ever had \"heart burn\" from eating acidic foods and used an antacid to relieve the pain, you can easily understand pH basics.<br /><br />\"\"pH\" means \"power of hydrogen.\" Acids release hydrogen ions, and alkaline solutions remove them. Acids and bases neutralize each other.<br /><br />\"Thermoacidophiles thrive in an acidic environment that would be deadly to humans. Sulphur Caldron's microbes live in a pool that is almost as acidic as battery acid!\"<br /><br />Section 5 (202 words)<br /><br />To the right of this text is another multi-colored pH scale, this one arranged vertically with red pH 0 at the top and deep violet pH 14 at the bottom. The scale is labeled on the right side as follows: pH 0--Battery Acid; pH 1--Sulphur Caldron; pH 2--Lemon Juice; pH 3--Vinegar; pH 4--Orange Juice; pH 5--Black Coffee; pH 6 is unlabeled; pH 7-Milk labeled at the top, Pure Water toward the middle; pH 8--Baking Soda; pH 9 and<br />pH 10---Antacids; the line between pH 11 and pH 12--Household Ammonia; pH 13--Bleach; and finally, the line between pH 13 and pH 14--Lye. <br /> <br />To the left of the scale, a black vertical line with arrows on both ends shows the green box representing pH 7--milk and pure water--as \"neutral\" with pHs 6 through 0 above as \"more acidic\" and pHs 8 through 14 as \"more alkaline.\"<br /><br />To the right of the pH scale is a color photo of pale yellow Sulphur Caldron. The landscape surrounding the caldron is largely barren but for a few evergreen trees standing in the foreground. A thin cloud of steam rises from the water's surface.<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

            "audioDescription": "The Sunrise Trailhead is found on the south side of a small, paved, loop driveway and parking area, along the south side of Tioga Road. The turn-off to the parking area is marked with a brown and white sign that shows a white icon of a person hiking inside a white square outline. The parking area is surrounded by trees, with Tioga Road to the north. A brown dumpster, six food lockers, and a small structure containing a vault toilet, line the outskirts of the parking lot. At the trailhead, the dirt path leads through tall trees. Three signs are posted next to the path. The first sign is a metal sign that reads, Sunrise H.S.C. 5.2 miles, Clouds Rest 7.4 miles, and Half Dome 12.5 miles. The second sign is brown and reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails.

His right arm is fully extended to his side, with his hand gesturing as if allowing someone to enter a room or pass by him. His hair is wavy and parted to the side.

The title text reads, \"Pleasure and Joy.\" Under the title is the quote, \" Now shall I walk or shall I ride? Ride, Pleasure said. Walk, Joy replied.' W.H. Davies.\" The body text reads, \"Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive are the perfect combination of pleasure and joy. Chances are you took a pleasure ride today and found yourself here. You can easily add a bit of joy to your day right here at The Point Overlook. Notice the break in the stone wall and the steps leading to a path. The path takes you just beyond the trees you see ahead to a large boulder just perfect for sitting and contemplating the horizon. It's a beautiful view! Along with the pleasure of a leisurely ride on Skyline drive, Shenandoah's many gifts include numerous \"leg stretcher\" trails-short walks to beautiful vistas or cool streams. Ask for recommendations at a visitor center and add a little joy to your pleasure.\" Behind the text is a photograph of a man sitting atop a rock outcrop looking over the landscape to the mountains beyond. A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

To the world, it became known as \"The Texas White,\" but for the Johnson family, it was simply known as \"Our Heart's Home.\"<br /> <br /> While Lyndon Johnson was growing up, it was the home of his Uncle Clarence and Aunt Frank Martin. Some of his earliest memories as a young boy were of the \"big house on the river.\" The house he loved for decades became his in 1951 after he purchased it and approximately 240 acres from his widowed aunt.<br /> <br /> As his career grew, so did the house and its functions. The Johnsons added an office in 1958 when he was senate majority leader. In 1962, the dining room and kitchen were both extended to create additional space for entertaining when he was vice president. Additional bedrooms and bathrooms were created and remodeled to house invited guests including world leaders such as the President of Mexico, West German Chancellor, and Israeli Prime Minister. In 1967, late in his presidency, the couple added two master suites for the comfort of their upcoming retirement.<br /> <br /> In the end, the Texas White House expanded to include 28 rooms (8 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms) spanning over 8,400 square feet.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Texas White House. 492 words<br /><br />This 3-and-a-half-foot by 2-foot graphic panel sits at side of the house, near the white fence that encloses the front yard. The yard with its shady trees lies beyond the sign with the house itself slightly to the left. Around the fence corner to the right is the front fence overlooking the whole Texas White House. The structure description follows the panel description.<br /><br />The panel is filled with a black and white photograph of a group of men around a table on a lawn, stone wall visible in the back ground. The men sit in lawn chairs, some with notepads in their laps, other leaning on the paper-strewn table. Most wear dark suits or military uniforms. President Johnson sits at left, in shirtsleeves, as he looks on papers on the table. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"President Johnson meets with his military advisors and Joint Chiefs of Staff in the front yard of the Texas White House, December 22, 1964.\"<br /><br />Text at the bottom of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"Although he lived in Washington for much of his adult life, President Johnson always considered this house his home. During the White House years it served as a busy office, a working ranch, and a quiet refuge from the pressures of being president in tumultuous times. The shade of the big live oak in front of you often served as a makeshift meeting room for the Johnson cabinet.<br /><br />\"President Johnson's capacity to influence or control events did not diminish during his stays at the Texas White House. Outbuildings held sophisticated electronics. Airplanes and helicopters buzzed along the ranch's runway. Inside the house, Johnson met with staff, read papers, watched television, and worked the phones constantly. He also hosted a steady procession of cabinet officers, legislators, celebrities, and heads of state.\"<br /><br />Description Continues...<br /><br />Moving to the right around the fence corner is a full view of the house. From here, the largest live oak tree is set on the left side of the yard. Beyond the tree, there is a one story room with a field stone wall and chimney on its far left and a long porch at its front. Connected to the right of this porch begins a two-story structure made of large blocks of limestone. Its small porch has four white columns and an entry door and window. The second story roof is gabled. <br /><br />To its right is an identical gabled roof above first floor bay windows on a wooden structure. The two gabled roofs are connected by a first floor porch and second floor porch balcony with cross railing. There are green hedges in front of the porches. Attached to the bay windowed room is a single-story addition with a window and roof skylight and three larger windows to the right. At the far right of the building is a short, side porch with stone steps. The swimming pool is on the far right side of the yard beyond another live oak tree. <br /><br />End of description.",

The Buck Hill trailhead is located at the top of a 1-mile drive that is accessed by turning south off the South Unit Scenic Drive, approximately 18-miles into the park. A small roundabout offers parking and a way to turn around for larger vehicles. The roundabout has a paved sidewalk around it, with several trash cans and a two-part wayside. The wayside has a title reading Hidden Garden. Under this, there is text over a photograph of the prairie and buttes to the South as seen from Buck Hill. The text reads: Although it may look like a sea of solid grass, the prairie in front of you supports a great diversity of plant life. Over 400 species of prairie plants reside in the park. Humans have long relied on prairie plants for food and medicine. The leaves, fruits, and seeds of these plants sustain wildlife of all kinds. Next to this text in italics reads: wild flowers should be enjoyed unplucked where they grow. This quote is attributed to Theodore Roosevelt. Below this a line of text reads Please leave all plants for wildlife and other park visitors to enjoy. Beneath this text is a line of six photos of flowers, each with symbols and text beneath them. A key to the left of these photos reads Knowing What’s Growing. Before you can use a plant for food or medicine, you must be able to figure out what it is. Do you know what’s growing here? The key contains symbols representing medicinal use, food for humans, food for birds, food for small mammals like mice and rabbits, and food for grazers like deer, pronghorn and elk. The first flower is a scarlet globemallow, a small orange flower with a yellow center. It has the symbols for medicinal use and food for grazers below it. Text reads: when crushed into a paste, the leaves of this plant help heal cuts and burns. The second flower is a purple coneflower, a tall flower with a spiky center and long, drooping purple petals. It has the symbols for medicinal use, food for birds, food for small mammals, and food for grazers below it. Text reads: Echinacea has many medicinal properties including its root’s ability to relieve toothache. The third flower is plains pricklypear, a small cactus with a large yellow blossom. It has the symbols for food for humans and food for small mammals below it. Text reads: fruits packed with vitamin C make a nutritious snack and can be made into jelly. The fourth flower is Indian Breadroot, a flower with many small blueish purple blooms. It has the symbols for food for humans and food for grazers below it. Text reads: Roots of tipsin were a staple in the Plains Indian diet, earning the plant its name. The fifth flower is prairie wild rose, a pink flower with large petals and a yellow center. It has the symbols for food for humans, food for birds, food for small mammals, and food for grazers below it. Text reads: Red, waxy fruits called rose hips are rich in vitamins. They serve as an emergency food source. The final flower is the sunflower, a tall yellow flower with a large, dark center. It has the symbols for food for humans, food for birds, and food for small mammals below it. Text reads: Local agricultural tribes cultivated sunflowers for their nutritious seeds. The second wayside is titled Prairie Remnants. Text under this reads: The prairie on Buck Hill is special – it has never been plowed. Native, never-plowed grasslands are rare across the Great Plains and around the world. The main image on the wayside is a large circle made up of smaller circles, some of them filled in green, others empty. This circle is labeled The Great Plains. Small bullet points on the green side read: Once disturbed, prairie takes decades to recover, but the healing is superficial. The full complexity of life that exists in native prairie takes thousands of years to achieve. Of all the world’s major biomes, grasslands have experienced the greatest human impacts and yet receive the least protection. What remains exists in small isolated pockets. The ecosystem struggles to function in this highly fractured state. The plants, roots, and soils of native prairie are complex, site-specific communities built up over thousands of years. Prairie is the second most diverse ecosystem in the world. Only rainforests have a great variety of plant and animal life. On the other side of the circle, indicating the clear section are more bullet points. They read: More than 70% of native prairie on the great plains has been lost to development. About 60% has been plowed and converted to agricultural lands. Another 10% has been lost to land uses including construction of roads, buildings, parking lots, and human-made lakes. The trail to the top of Buck Hill starts at the northeast section of this sidewalk, next to a trailhead sign. The first section is paved, after which wide steps lead to a scenic viewpoint. A social trail continues onward, allowing access to trails that lead down from the hill. End of description.",

And yes, that imposing mountain looming behind you is Mount Pisgah. But did you know you’re right next to the site of an old hunting lodge? Seriously! Have a look to the right of the overlook sign. See those wide stone steps? If you go up them, you’ll be on the Mountains-to-Sea Trail and it’s a quick walk to where George Vanderbilt built the magnificent Buck Spring Lodge in 1896. It was a summer retreat that really put the “glam” in “glamping” (that’s glamour camping to you). The buildings may be gone, but you can still walk around the site, stride through the large entryway where the stables once were, and even go down the steps into one of the old storage areas.<br /> <br /> Depending on weather and road conditions, the average driving time to the Buck Spring Gap Overlook is approximately 45 minutes south from Asheville or 2 hours, 15 minutes north from the end of the Parkway near Cherokee.</p>",

A slightly raised sidewalk borders them on one long edge with a sign near the center-right of the sidewalk. The sign reads “Buck Springs Gap Overlook, elevation 4980 feet.\" Behind the sign, the ground slopes sharply downwards, opening up to the valley and a line of mountains beyond. Turning 180 degrees away from the sign, there is a grassy median across from the row of parking. Behind the median is a paved road, which slopes downhill to the left, and continues level to the right. There is another, much longer single line of parking on the other side of this road, again with a raised sidewalk following the long edge. Trees come up from the slope behind the sidewalk. Towering above the trees is Mount Pisgah, a radio tower perched at its summit.",

            "audioDescription": "Bartlett Cove is a body of water that branches off from the entrance of Glacier Bay. To the south is Sitakaday Narrows, and then Icy Straight. To the northeast are the Beardslee Islands, a collection of forested islands. Bartlett Cove itself contains two large docks, one used for fueling, another a public dock allowing visiting boats to dock for various amounts of time. Boats are often found moored in the middle of Bartlett Cove on the Eastern side. At the head of the public dock, the Visitor Information Station is situated, and the Glacier Bay Lodge can also be seen from the water further to the east.",

Chamberlin, First Artillery, who served with distinction in the Civil War and continued as an artillery officer until his death at the Presidio in 1889. This Endicott-era battery was completed and armed in 1904 with four six-inch guns mounted on disappearing carriages. The battery was built to protect underwater minefields laid outside the Golden Gate during the time of war. These guns had a range of nine miles and could fire at the rate of two rounds per minute.<br /> <br /> The original guns were dismounted in 1917 for use in World War I, but the battery was modified to receive two six-inch guns on simple barbette carriages in 1920. During World War II, the Sixth Coast Artillery (Harbor Defense) Regiment, Battery \"D,\" manned the two guns at Battery Chamberlin, which were placed under camouflage netting to hide them from potential air attack. In 1948, the Coast Artillery Corps was deactivated, the battery disarmed and the guns scrapped during \"Operation Blowtorch.\"<br /> <br /> In 1977, the National Park Service received the Six-Inch Rifle Gun Number Nine and disappearing carriage, listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places, from the Smithsonian Institution. The gun and carriage were installed at gun emplacement Number Four at Battery Chamberlin, and are the same type as initially used here before World War I. An underground cartridge room also is open for inspection and contains photos and small exhibits on the coastal defenses of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> Battery Chamberlin, part of the Presidio of San Francisco and a National Historic Landmark, is administered by the National Park Service's Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It is located at the north end of Baker Beach along the western shoreline facing San Francisco Bay in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> <em>Visit Battery Chamberlin's small, on-site museum, and take part in loading demonstrations between 11AM - 3PM on the first full weekend of the month.</em><br /> <br /> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-80f82afa-7fff-e565-36be-ec9b53ac67f9\">Discover more history and culture by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelbayareawwii/index.htm\">World War II in San Francisco Bay Area travel itinerary. </a></b></p>",

            "audioDescription": "Boy Scout Picnic Shelter 321 words Boy Scout Picnic Shelter. 2 minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. The Boy Scout Picnic Shelter is an outdoor pavilion approximately 20 feet wide and 35 feet long, oriented roughly north and south. The structure is open on all sides with brown wooden pillars holding up a gently sloping green shingled roof. The pillars are spaced 7 feet apart, and a horizontal crossbeam runs around the east, west, and north sides about four feet off the ground, restricting entrance to the south. A low cement ledge also runs along the east, west, and north sides ranging from a few inches to a foot in height. A rough stone fireplace stands at the center of the south façade, with its chimney rising up past the peak of the roof. You must enter to the left or right of the fireplace. A metal plaque on the front of the chimney reads: “This shelter is dedicated by the Boy Scouts in Iowa in tribute to the life of Herbert C. Hoover as a reminder that the road of opportunity he traveled is open to all American youth. August 10, 1954.” Inside, you’ll find two long picnic tables running the length of the space, about 8 feet apart. The floor is cement and several light bulbs hang down from the center of the wood-beamed ceiling. The backside of the fireplace features a grill, and a bulletin board to the left of the entrance offers information about park programs and events. Additional picnic tables are located on the grass outside, a few feet to the southeast of the shelter. There is also a public restroom about fifty feet to the west of the shelter along a cement sidewalk. Along the level concrete sidewalk leading southwest from the picnic shelter an exhibit panel titled \"Birthday Salute\" stands in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. End of message. Birthday Salute 246 words Panel: \"Birthday Salute.\" 1 ¼ minute. Second of two descriptions at this location. The panel identifies the historic significance of the picnic shelter. The angled panel titled \"Birthday Salute\" is located along the sidewalk facing the Boy Scout picnic shelter a short distance away. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The title appears at the top of the panel over introductory text. The text reads: \"Boy Scouts built this picnic shelter in 1953 as a tribute to Herbert Hoover's support of youth programs. On his 80th birthday, Hoover gave a nationally televised speech at West Branch's elementary school. Afterwards he came here for the dedication of a bronze plaque honoring his life — 'a reminder that the road of opportunity he traveled is open for all American youth.' Both President and Mrs. Hoover supported national youth organizations like the Boys Clubs, Girl Scouts, and Boy Scouts.\" In the top right corner of the panel, a quote from Herbert Hoover in his 80th birthday address on August 10, 1954, states: \"As the shadows lengthen over my years, my confidence, my hopes and dreams for my countrymen are undimmed.\" In the photograph, Herbert Hoover stands inside the picnic shelter, smiling at friends sitting nearby. On a table, candles surround a tiered cake as the white-haired Hoover holds a knife. A caption reads: \"Hoover cuts his birthday cake after enjoying a lunch of fried chicken, corn, and potato salad.\" End of message.",

Along with Endicott Period batteries on Sullivan's Island, Battery Huger protected Charleston Harbor from naval surface attack. The structure mounted two breechloading 12-inch rifles, which fired 1,000 pound shells. One rifle sat on a disappearing carriage while the other rifle sat on a barbette mount. Serving until 1941, both of the rifles were replaced with four 90 mm anti-aircraft guns, which were removed in 1947 upon deactivation of the battery.<br /> <br /> Battery Huger extends from near the northern walls (left face and right face of the fort) to the gorge wall of Fort Sumter. It occupies about one third of the parade ground. Today, the ground floor has accessible restrooms. Fort Sumter's museum is located in the former site of the gun emplacement of the disappearing rifle on the second floor, or gun deck. America's National Parks also has a museum shop on the second floor. The top of Battery Huger has a panoramic view of Charleston Harbor and serves as an observation deck. ",

This section of the trail is challenging. Along the hike there are some nice examples of original stonework from when George Vanderbilt constructed the trail in the 1890's to connect the Biltmore Estate to his hunting lodge at Buck Spring.<br /> <br /> This lesser visited parking area is mainly used as a rest stop, trail access, and lunch spot. The grassy area between the parking lot and the Parkway is a nice place to spread a picnic blanket and relax a while.<br /> <br /> Nearby Beaver Dam Creek flows north from the gap to the French Broad River. In early history before settlement, beavers were abundant in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Early explorers noted that beavers and their dams were prevalent. Beavers alter the landscape freely to meet their habitat needs, creating ponds and wetlands that also met the needs of other wildlife.<br /> <br /> Settlers and fur trappers came after the explorers and removed millions of beavers for their luxurious fur. The important wetlands and ponds beavers had created disappeared, as well as the wildlife that used them. Unregulated trapping caused their complete disappearance in the late 1890’s. From the 1930’s to the 1950’s beavers were reintroduced into many areas in North Carolina. In the late 1980’s they began to re-colonize rivers and streams along the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> Managing a major scenic motor road for practically year-round use takes unique management skills. Sharing the roadsides, creeks, culverts, and drains with beavers can be an effort. Their innate behavior is to clog culverts, block spillways, dam streams, and divert water which can cause hazards for drivers. However, they also create essential habitat for a variety of wildlife along the Parkway and beyond, which increases biological diversity. The Parkway welcomes the beaver and recognizes the balancing act required to manage this important species.<br /> <br /> Visit Beaver Dam Gap Overlook, reflect on the Blue Ridge Parkway’s ecological significance, sample the Mountains-to-Sea Trail with a quick hike, have a picnic, and enjoy a relaxing moment on the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>",

            "audioDescription": "Badlands Overlook. 323 words. The viewing area for Badlands Overlook is located alongside the curved parking area. A paved sidewalk is bounded by a stone wall on the north and east, with a wayside located part of the way along this wall. The wayside is titled Badlands Overlook and the background photo is the view from the overlook on a slightly cloudy day. Below the main title, a quote attributed to Theodore Roosevelt reads “This broken country extends back from the river many miles, and has been called always, by Indians, French voyagers, and American trappers alike, the ‘Bad Lands.’” Next to this text reads: To the Lakota, this land is mako sica, meaning bad land or bad earth. French fur trappers called it les mauvais terres à traverser meaning the bad lands to cross. Anyone who has experienced the badlands understands exactly how this place earned its name. Below the text is a white line pointing to a butte across the valley with a title asking How Would You Get Here? Below this are three circular call out images. The leftmost circle depicts the side of a butte. Text to its right reads: Cliffs, sinkholes, coulees, and creeks disrupt the land in all directions. These obstacles can turn a seemingly short trip into a lengthy ordeal. The middle circle depicts muddy water with grass growing out of it. Text to its right reads: According to Roosevelt, water is found in “tepid little pools, almost dried up,” and so muddy it “can only be called liquid by courtesy.” The rightmost circle depicts a cactus. Text to its right reads: Cacti and other prickly plants make travel difficult and sometimes painful! From the viewing area, the badlands landscape is visible to the north, east, and west, though part of the western view is blocked by a large butte. On the other side of the stone wall, the ground quickly drops away down a cliff edge. End of description.",

In between the stacked signs is an interpretive sign showing ways visitors can manage their waste and \"Help Keep White Sands White.\" It encourages visitors to throw waste away in the proper receptacles, pick up after their pets, and \"take photos, not sand.\" This restroom in particular is next to a gypsum sand road called Dunes Drive.

Here, visitors marvel at an array of colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, pink, and green), splashed across the hills. These colors are from volcanic deposits rich in compounds such as iron oxides and chlorite, which creates a rainbow effect.   <br /> <br /> Stunning not only at Artists Palette, the Artists Drive loop winds through hills carved by the erosive power of water, and gives vistas of both the rugged Black Mountains and swirling white salt flats. While no maintained trails exist along this loop, several pull outs provide safe parking areas from which to explore this unique landscape on foot.  <br /> <br /> Although Artists Drive and Artists Palette are beautiful any time of day, sunrise and sunset provide additional shadows and changing light, further enhancing the allure of this incredible place.<br /> <br /> When visiting Artists Palette, allow approximately 30 minutes to detour from Badwater Road along the one-way Artists Drive Scenic Loop. The drive begins 8.5 miles (13.7 km) south of the Hwy 190/Badwater Rd. junction and has a length restriction of 25 ft. (7.6 m) due to sharp bends and large dips. <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

            "audioDescription": "This trail begins at a parking area at the side of the road. Near the start of the trail the parking area is edged with a split-rail fence. In front of the fence is a tall, three-sided kiosk with three graphic panels. To the right of the kiosk as you face the trail is a picnic shelter and table. At the far side of the parking area is a small restroom building. Near the beginning of the trail is a small sign that reads, “Parking for Backcountry Camping. Permit required. Available at Visitor Center.” The trail is marked by flat, four inch wide, orange posts with a spade symbol. From the kiosk, it follows a low ridge on the right, across a flat area, then up a slope to a sign where the trail splits to make a loop. That sign has a map of where the camp sites are located around the loop, sites 1 – 5 to the right and 6 – 10 to the left. At that point you are surrounded by the white dunes rising and falling on all sides, with distant mountains visible both to the west and the east. The dunes are bare white sand, often with ripples across their surface. In between are small flat basins with some clumps of grass, small bushes and an occasional yucca plant.",

The current structure is built in the footprint of an actual prehistoric house excavated in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In order to better understand what life was like for people of the past, in 1968 Dr. Dumond led a team of archaeologists tasked with reconstructing an ancient home from one of the 700-year-old housing sites near Brooks River. Their excavations revealed that dwellings from this time period had some unique characteristics: these homes were semi-subterranean, meaning they were built partially underground, and most had an entrance passage with a floor that dipped below the level of the main house, forming a “cold trap.” This allowed the house to more easily retain the warmth of a fire inside. The presence of the cold trap entrance suggests that these homes were used in the winter, as they would have flooded during spring thaws and the rain-heavy months of July and August.<br /> <br /> These semi-subterranean homes were called <i>ciqlluat </i>by the Alutiiq people, or<i> barabaras</i> by the Russians. They were likely built out of cottonwood, because spruce trees didn’t grow in the area at the time. Cottonwood logs also split straighter than spruce, and oral histories from descendants of Katmai’s first peoples report that cottonwood would have been the preferred building material among the local trees. Cottonwood logs were split in half, and then placed over a wooden frame to create the domed walls and ceiling of the home. On top of this, people used sod and sphagnum moss to insulate and protect their homes in the winter. The reconstructed home at Brooks Camp has been left partially open so the inside can be viewed more easily.</p> <h4>What happened to the people who lived here?</h4> <p>Alutiiq people lived around Brooks River until the early 1800s. By this point, Russian fur hunters had been in the Aleutian Islands for nearly 60 years, and their influence was beginning to be felt by people living in the upper Alaska Peninsula. Local Native villages began to see the signs of new trading posts, imported diseases, Russian Orthodoxy, and other effects of Russian contact. In addition, Yup’ik communities from the north were moving southward into the upper Alaska Peninsula, possibly causing some social conflict. The last villages along Brooks River were abandoned around 1300 AD, possibly from a nearby volcanic eruption. By the time Novarupta erupted in 1912, there were no more inhabited sites along Brooks River.<br /> <br /> Although few people have lived in what is now Katmai National Park over the last two centuries, the Alutiiq descendants of Katmai’s first peoples live on today in the local area outside the park and more broadly across the state. Oral histories, cultural practices, materials, and traditions help connect today’s Indigenous people to their ancestors, and help all of us better understand the human stories of this region, past and present.</p>",

            "bodyText": "<p>Old Faithful erupts more frequently than any of the other big geysers, although it is not the largest or most regular geyser in Yellowstone National Park. It is believed this regularity is in part due to no known connection with other hydrothermal features in the area.</p> <p>Its average interval between eruptions is about 90 minutes, varying from 50 to 127 minutes. An eruption lasts 1.5 to 5 minutes and expels 3,700–8,400 gallons (14,000–32,000 l) of boiling water, and reaches a height of 106–184 feet (30–55 m). Old Faithful Geyser has an average temperate of 169.7°F (76.5°C), an average pH of 9, and an average conductivity of 1972 uS/cm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">##View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>Limited parking, especially 10 am-6 pm.</p> <h2>Name Origin</h2> <p>Members of the Washburn expedition of 1870 named this geyser for its consistent performance. Although its average interval has lengthened, Old Faithful is as spectacular as it was a century ago.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>The geyser is the centerpiece of the Old Faithful Historic District. The surrounding buildings are all set back from the geyser about the same distance: 1/8 mile (0.2 km). Only two buildings have been allowed to infringe upon this distance, established by Federal law: the Old Faithful Inn's east wing and the Old Faithful Lodge.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Wheelchair-accessible walkways lead from all parking areas to Old Faithful Geyser, and from the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center to other hydrothermal features.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "A hydrothermal feature at the top of a low, barren hill that spouts water and steam at fairly regular intervals out of a wide, cone-shaped formation of rock. Pools of hot water surround the cone, and several runoff channels of hot water filled with colorful microscopic organisms generally called thermophiles run down the hillside. The hill is surrounded by a large viewing platform boardwalk with backless benches placed periodically along the boardwalk.",

Off-trail hiking can be treacherous and is unadvised. A diverse habitat of sandstone ledges, sandy beachs, and rocky bluffs creates a variety of activities and ecosytems to explore on Oak Island. </p> <h4>Camping, Hunting, and Boating</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">Camping</a> permits are required for all camping in the national lakeshore. A nightly fee is charged for camping in the park and all the permits can be made on <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/search?q=apostle%20islands%20national%20lakeshore\">recreation.gov</a>. Oak has five individual sites and two group campsites. Campsites may occasionally be closed due to bear activity or to preserve sensitive resources.<br /> <br /> Deer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">hunting</a> is allowed on all islands in the national lakeshore. Hunters must pay for a hunter access permit. An archery hunt is offered from September 13 - 30 and from November 1 - December 31. A muzzle loader hunt is conducted during October. Contact the park’s chief of protection for details.<br /> <br /> A wooden dock is located in the middle of the west side of the island. Maximum water depth at the end of this dock varies but is usually about six feet. Docking is permitted as space allows. A fee is charged for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">overnight docking</a>. Dock space may be reserved at certain times for excursion boats. Oak Island provides several possible anchorage areas, depending on wind conditions. Boaters are encouraged to monitor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">marine weather forecasts</a>.</p> <h4>Leave No Trace</h4> <p>Almost all of Oak Island is now included in Apostle Islands National Lakeshore’s 33,500-acre Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. Visitors must do their part to help preserve the island’s wild and primitive character. Please follow the <a href=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/\">seven principles</a> of Leave No Trace outdoor ethics. Beaches are some of the parks most popular attractions. They also support fragile plant communities. Please walk near the water line or on established trails and take care not to trample beach grasses and lichen. Please camp only on durable surfaces like sand, rock, or leaf litter. Where vault toilets are not available for human waste, dig a hole 6-8 inches deep and 200 feet from camp and the nearest body of water. Cover the hole after use. Campfires must be built in fire receptacles where provided. Dead wood on the ground in forested areas or on unvegetated beaches may be collected for firewood. Do not carry firewood into or between islands in the park. Be prepared to pack out whatever you pack in. Do not remove any artifacts from the islands in the park. These leave no trace principles are caring activities designed to decrease the negative effects that users have on the environment.</p> <h4>Bear habitat</h4> <p>Oak Islands proximity to the mainland makes it an easy swim for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/bear-safety.htm\">bears</a> looking for a new territory. Bears and bear signs are frequently seen by island visitors. Improperly stored food continues to lure bears to the island campsites. Visitors must take precautions to help keep this from happening. Never approach or feed a bear. Keep a distance of at least 50 yards, even for photography. Don’t lure or allow bears to feel comfortable around campsites, docks, and picnic areas. Store food and garbage in the bear proof lockers provided at campsites. If you encounter a bear in a visitor use area; make yourself look big, bang pots, yell, make noise until the bear leaves the area, and report the encounter to park staff as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Ojibwe Lumberjacks, and the “King”</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/ojibwe-culture.htm\">Native people</a> have camped and harvested food on Oak Island for centuries. Nineteenth century land surveys note the location of a maple “sugar bush” on the island used by the Ojibwe. In the 1850’s, Benjamin Armstrong from Alabama built a cabin on the island and lived there for about six years. He learned the Ojibwe language and served as a translator and advisor to tribal elders, accompanying them to Washington DC to meet with presidents Fillmore and Lincoln. As early as the 1850s, a cordwood business was flourishing here, supplying fuel to passing steamships. The island was subsequently logged for pine in the 1880’s and 1890’s, and for hemlock and hardwoods throughout the 1920’s. As many as six lumber camps including those of the Schroeder and R.D. Pike Lumber Companies, once dotted the shores of Oak Island. Some of the clearings and remnants of these camps are still evident today. During and after the Great Depression, commercial fisherman used parts of the islands as base camps. One of these men, Martin Kane, took up permanent residence in an old lumber camp shack near the sand spit, where he lived for over 25 years as the friendly “king” of Oak Island. Martin made his living fishing with gill nets and set lines. He sold the whitefish and lake trout that he caught to the Booth Company in Bayfield. A 1946 article from the Ashland Daily Press explained that the shack where Martin Kane lived with two dogs and a cat had a bed, a table, one chair, and a stove. Sparks from the stove ignited a fire that burned about 4,000 acres of the island in October 1943.  </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Oak Island is located 10 miles and Bayfield and 10 miles from Little Sand Bay in the inner ring of islands. It has the highest elevation of all the Apostle Islands rising 1,081 feet above sea level. It is heavily forested and has an array of shoreline features including sandy beaches, sandstone rock ledges, and clay banks. There is a dock in the middle of the western side of the island that gives you access to two campsites and two group sites. The other three campsites dispersed are located on the on the shoreline away from the dock. There are 11.5 miles of hiking trails that range from moderate to difficult with steep inclines. This is a popular island for overnight campers, hikers, hunters, and wildlife.",

In 1805, the Choctaw allowed inns, known as stands to be built along the route to provide basic food and shelter to travelers. By 1811, Noble Osburn opened a stand near this spot. He was known to treat equally his Choctaw neighbors and American travelers. In 1821 at <span style=\"color:null;\"><span name=\"_span_1\">LeFleur’s Bluff along the Pearl River, the city of Jackson was founded and a year later became the state capital. As a result, the postal route shifted slightly east from here to go through the new capital leading to the demise of the stands along this section of the Old Natchez Trace. <br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.</span></span><br /> <span name=\"_span_1\">S<span style=\"color:null;\">ee </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.</span>",

            "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(May - September)</i></p> <p>The Paradise Inn is open generally from late May through September. This historic building, which opened in 1917, allows people to take photos of historic architecture, enjoy a meal in the dining room, or just relax and enjoy the stately lobby. The inn features 121 rooms for overnight guests. Rooms do not include modern amenities such as internet, telephone, and television. A gift shop, café, and dining room are all located within the Paradise Inn. Guests are invited to imagine an earlier time when life was simple without the distractions of today’s modern world.</p> <p>The lure of Paradise has drawn people to the slopes of Mount Rainier for millennia. Local tribes like the Nisqually, Yakama, Puyallup, Cowlitz, and others, traveled to the Paradise meadows to hunt and gather. Early mountain climbers scaling the glaciers, used Paradise as a way stop. Paradise’s wildflower meadows also became a destination for some of the first tourists to the mountain. Before the creation of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, people recognized a need for accommodations at Paradise. Construction of the Paradise Inn began the summer of 1916. Ground was broken on July 20, and most of the lobby, dining room, and rooms above the dining room, were completed that first summer. Opening on July 1, 1917, the inn had thirty-seven guest rooms and a dining room that could accommodate 400. Distinctive furnishing enhanced the lobby, including woodwork of the registration desk, two massive cedar tables and chairs, a mail drop “stump”, and cases for the 14 foot tall clock and the piano. After World War I, enough guests were staying at the lodge that the company could start building again. The Paradise Inn Annex, once completed, more than doubled the size of the inn, providing 104 more guest rooms. Structural braces were added to the timbers to help with the extra stress of long winters. Time and weather have not been kind to the Paradise Inn. Mount Rainier National Park has worked to renovate the structure while maintaining the historical aspects that make the Paradise Inn a unique place to visit. With this work, the National Park Service hopes that future visitors will continue to see and enjoy the historic, rustic beauty of the Paradise Inn.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Paradise Inn is a large wooden building with a steeply-pitched roof, and two stone fireplaces. The first floor is lined with floor to ceiling windows, that are lined in green trim, facing the mountain. A wrap around porch with tables is around the south end of the building. The second floor features gabled windows looking out towards the meadows at Paradise. In the winter the entire building can be covered by snow. There is an entrance on the southwest side of the building. In the grand lobby, large timbers and a massive stone fireplace greet you as you enter. Tables and chairs from an earlier time, made of wood, grace the center of the floor. A historic piano once played by President Harry S. Truman sits on the edge of the room. Note the hand painted luminaries that adore the ceiling as you continue straight past the row of tables just before turning left to follow along the far wall. As you are continuing along the wall, past the café and the gift shop towards the north end of the building, you will see the large corner desk that is the main front desk for the Paradise Inn. If you continue north, through a doorway and down a few steps, the room opens up again to a large dining room. The dining room features floor to ceiling windows on both sides, with excellent views. Tables are set in neat rows to allow for dining, with table clothes embellishing the tops. Staff are there to greet you as you enter the hall and seat you accordingly. A hallway to the northeast of the main desk, leads you to the Paradise Inn Annex. The Annex features long hallways with rooms on either side and windows on the end. There are 121 rooms throughout the multi-floored annex building for you to enjoy your stay.",

            "bodyText": "<h4>Windmill</h4> <br /> The Cyclone windmill situated above the well pumped the cold well water into the adjoining storage tank. Its many blades allowed for the windmill to hold up to the pressure of strong winds and still generate enough torque to pump water from the well during periods of low winds. The well water then flowed by gravity through a pipe to the wooden water trough inside the cooler house. Wind was an important resource that the settlers harnessed. Cooperation with nature was an integral part of life. <h4>Water Tank</h4> <br /> The water tank is an essential part of the pumping process. It stores water above the height of where it will be used, and then is gravity-fed into water troughs and buildings. No electric or mechanical energy source is required for this part of the process. <h4>Cooler House</h4> <br /> The original cooler house was built in the 1880s by N.T. Stubbs, a cousin by marriage to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The cooler house provided cold storage for perishable food and dairy products. It was constructed out of native limestone with walls 18 inches thick. Inside, shelves were built along the thick stone walls for storage of crocks filled with wild dewberries, hog plums, and garden vegetables such as onions, peas, beans, and tomatoes. Cans of milk and churns filled with cream for making butter were kept cool in the wooden water trough. Eggs, preserved in salt, and cabbage, stored in barrels for making sauerkraut, were kept on the cool, moist sand floor, while potatoes and other root vegetables were stored in a large box, layered with sand to keep them dry. <p> </p>",

At the right is a small, stone building, about 15 feet by 20 feet, with a wood shingled roof. There are no windows, only a narrow wooden door on the far side.<br /><br />In the middle, about 8 feet to the left of the building is a round, wooden water tank sitting on top of an eight-foot tall wooden stand. The structure is about 5 feet by 5 feet. From the top of the tank one pipe extends to the windmill on the left. Another pipe on the right stretches from the top of the tank down into the ground.<br /><br />The windmill at the left end of the group sits on a tall, slender pyramidal wooden tower. The rectangular base is about 6 feet square and it sits about 5 feet to the left of the water tank. It is about 20 feet to the top of the fan. The fan is circular, close to six feet in diameter, with narrow wooden blades and has a large, flat vertical wooden tail extending behind it. A long pipe extends from the gear mechanism at top down into a stone-covered well at the base of the tower.<br /><br /><br />End of description.",

            "bodyText": "<p>The Wright Brothers Monument is a 60-foot-tall, Art Deco style, granite monument that sits atop Big Kill Devil Hill-the primary location of the brothers' glider experiments.<br /> <br /> With a $213,000 budget, construction began on the monument in 1928 with the laying of the cornerstone during the 25th anniversary of the first flight. After Big Kill Devil Hill-which shifted continuously due to wind and weather-was stabilized by the Quartermaster's Corps in 1929, the construction began in earnest.<br /> <br /> The monument was officially dedicated in 1932, with approximately 1,000 people in attendance-Orville Wright among them.</p> <h3>Laying the Cornerstone</h3> <p>The cornerstone for the monument was laid atop Kill Devil Hill on December 17, 1928-the 25th anniversary of the first flight and the same day of the First Flight Boulder dedication.</p> <h3>Stabilizing the Dune</h3> <p>In order to build a large monument atop Big Kill Devil Hill, the sand dune needed to be stabilized. In 1929, the dune was stabilized using a mixture of Bermuda grass, bitter panic grass, yaupon, myrtle, pine, live oak, and sumac-all found locally and transplanted. Rye and crotalaria grasses were also used.<br /> <br /> Description of the planting method use:<br /> > Shallow furrows plowed about thirty inches apart. Fertilizer applied, wire [Bermuda] grass roots placed in furrow, and different grass seeds sowed with the wire [Bermuda] grass roots. All planting then covered with a thin layer of sand and the entire area covered with two to three inches of wood's mold. Wood mold helped to fertilize sand and prevented the movement of sand while the seeds were germinating.</p> <h3>Design</h3> <p>In June, 1928, the Office of the Quartermaster General announced a design competition for the development of the monument. In October, 1928, the Office suggested that Big Kill Devil Hill would be a suitable location for the monument. By January, 1929, 36 entries had been received.<br /> <br /> The selection of the winning design was made in accordance with principles established by the American Institute of Architects. The jury chose the submission by the New York architectural firm of Rodgers and Poor, and the Commission of Fine Arts concurred. The winning Art Deco-inspired design was a masonry shaft and base of approximately 60 feet set on a star-shaped foundation. The design implied ancient Egyptian motifs, an important source for Art Deco designs.</p> <h3>Construction</h3> <p>The Wills and Mafera Corporation of New York won the bid for general contractor of the monument. The North Carolina Granite Corporation of Mount Airy, North Carolina, received the contract to supply the granite.<br /> <br /> Construction began in December 1931 and was completed by November 1932.</p> <h3>Dedication</h3> <p>The monument was dedicated in December 1932-one month after completion.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "Wright Brothers Monument<br />403 words (3-Â½ minutes)<br /><br />Located at the top of Big Kill Devil Hill, the 60-foot-tall, granite monument is the tallest point at Wright Brothers National Memorial. With various concrete walking paths winding their way up the hill to the monument, the footpath around the monument is made up of small, square granite stones. <br /><br />The words \"Wilbur Wright Orville Wright\" are carved into the southern end of the monument. A quote reading \"In Commemoration of the Conquest of the Air, By the Brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, Conceived by Genius, Achieved by Dauntless Resolution and Unconquerable Faith\" is carved 360 degrees around the monument, approximately 7 feet off the base. As you stand at the southern end of the monument, two busts of the brothers are visible at the base, Wilbur at right and Orville at left. A steel door at the base of the southern end shows various panels representing the history of aviation. <br /><br />The view from the monument looking west reveals the hill sloping down to the loop road with a coniferous tree-line just beyond the road. A portion of the First Flight Airstrip is also visible. The tree-line extends again beyond the airstrip with distant views of Albemarle Sound.<br /><br />Looking east from the monument, the hill slopes to the eastern portion of the loop road with a strip of coniferous trees just beyond. In the distance is the town of Kill Devil Hills with the Atlantic Ocean visible beyond.<br /><br />The view north reveals the hill sloping down to the north end of the loop road. Beyond the road is a large grassy field with a concrete walking path extending north to the site of the brothers' first powered flight. The walkway turns east-northeast past the camp buildings and toward the visitor center in the distance. The visitor center parking lot are in the northeast distance on the near side of the visitor center, with the towns of Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk visible beyond. The Atlantic Ocean is visible to the northeast. A coniferous forest is visible to the northwest.<br /><br />The view south includes a rapid, downward slope of the hill to a grassy area with the southern loop road beyond. Just beyond the loop road lies the bronze sculpture garden depicting the scene of the first flight. In the southeast distance lies Kill Devil Hills and the Atlantic Ocean. Albemarle Sound is visible in the distance to the southwest.<br /><br />End of message.",

There is also a rest area for bus passengers. The location is a great jumping off point for day hikers or backpackers.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>The Toklat is the largest braided river that is crossed by the Denali Park Road. To the south, different channels of the river flow together near the foot of Divide Mountain. To the north, the channels largely form a few major braids, which can be difficult to cross on foot when water is high.<br /> <br /> The vast plain of cobbles, gravel, sand, and silt deposited by the river is a renewable resource. Every other year, large machinery excavates 22,000 cubic yards (17,000 m<sup>3</sup>) of sediment from the Toklat riverbed for use in resurfacing the park road. Geology and maintenance staff design the excavations to mimic braided river channels to minimize impacts on natural processes and visual aesthetics.<br /> <br /> The park road loses material over time because of erosion, slumping, and dust, and this material must be replaced to maintain a safe surface for travel. Toklat sediment provides a local source for the material, rather than it being imported from outside the park. This reduces the number of vehicles traveling the road. Using locally-sourced materials also prevents the spread of invasive plants whose seeds can hitchhike to new places when transported from outside the park. Finally, because the material does not need to be purchased and transport distances are shorter, the park saves money and produces less carbon dioxide emissions.</p>",

As part of the war effort, Hasket converted many of his family's cargo vessels to privateers. The wealth that the Derbys amassed from privateering was the foundation of the great East India trade that Hasket and others pioneered after the Revolution.</p> <p>The Derbys sold the \"little brick house\" as Hasket called it, in 1796, to Capt. Henry Prince who built the West India Goods Store next to the house in the early 1800s. The Princes lived in the house until 1827. After that time, the house had numerous owners during the remainder of the 19th century. For a while, it was used as a tenement house, and multiple families lived in the building. Many of those families were members of the Polish community who came to work in the nearby mills.</p> <p>In the early twentieth century, the Derby House was purchased by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA), now <a href=\"http://www.historicnewengland.org/\">Historic New England</a>, who restored the home to its 18th century grandeur. In 1937, SPNEA transferred the house to the newly formed Salem Maritime National Historic Site.</p>",

Fresnel lenses are designed to focus and intensify light, and are rated by orders, from first order lenses that are used in the largest seacoast lights and are almost nine feet tall, to sixth order lights that are about 17 inches tall. For many years, Derby Wharf Light had one of only 17 sixth-order Fresnel lenses in the United States.

Upon entering the canyon, visitors find themselves immersed in the badlands; geologic formations made up of fine, silt-like sediments that covered the bottom of an enormous lake which once stretched across much of Death Valley. <br /> <br /> While hiking through these badlands, notice how easily the canyon walls crumble and erode. Badlands are greatly impacted by sudden downpours of rain, which quickly turn this canyon into a river of mud. Hikers will step over piles of dried sediment at the base of the canyon walls, and crisscross a section of deep mud-cracks, all of which were left behind from powerful flash floods and mudflows. <br /> <br /> Most of the badlands in Desolation Canyon are a rich golden color, but as hikers progress up the canyon they will see some sections of green, red and purple rocks. Millions of years ago, when this area was under water, nearby volcanic eruptions deposited layers of ash and debris in the lake, which settled among the silts and clays at the bottom. After the lake evaporated away and exposed the badlands formations, the iron minerals in these ash deposits reacted with oxygen and developed colorful tints. Some of the best times to hike through Desolation Canyon are in the late afternoon and early evening, when the low light catches these colorful rocks. </p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10 AM IN THE SUMMER</span><br /> <br /> <strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>3.6 mile (5.8km)<br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 2.5 hours<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate/Difficult<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 600 ft (183m)<br /> <strong>Trail Type:</strong> Out and back route- not an official trail<br /> <strong>Location: </strong>The short unpaved Desolation Canyon Road is located 3.7 miles (6km) south of CA-190 off Badwater Road. <br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Gravel parking area <br /> <strong>Route:</strong> Up a canyon.

            "bodyText": "<p>The Ellsworth Rock Gardens have been known as the “Showplace of Lake Kabetogama” since the 1940s. Jack Ellsworth, the garden’s creator and a self-taught artist, used natural elements of the native northern Minnesota landscape as his artistic media, creating an original and distinctive art environment on the north shore of Kabetogama Lake. <br /> <br /> Over a period of roughly twenty years, Ellsworth, a carpenter from Chicago, used art and engineering to create a complex, terraced garden on a prominent rock outcrop. Ellsworth constructed 62 terraced flower beds on the outcrop, which he filled with more than 13,000 lilies and other flower varieties. He then accented his garden landscape with over 200 abstract rock sculptures that have been compared to the work of modern sculptors like Noguchi and Brancusi. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness and magnitude of Mr. Ellsworth’s creation and the garden’s importance as a recreational destination since the 1940s establish its significance. The gardens are eligible for the National Register for Historic Places and are the most popular day use destination in Voyageurs National Park. </p>",
            "audioDescription": "Ellsworth Rock Gardens are only accessible by water. A 4 mile boat ride will lead you to the large dock for the site. The dock leads to an accessible pathway that winds its way to the restroom building. The loop near the restroom building is lined with interpretive signage with the history of the site. From the restroom you have a full view of the rock gardens. Historically, the gardens had the appearance of being carved out of the forested wilderness. This boundary between the gardens and forest is one of the primary features of the site. The forest provides a distinct, impenetrable wall, creating a dark, dense backdrop for views within the gardens. A few native spruce or pine trees were left within the gardens, but were \"limbed-up\" approximately 20 feet to create a vertical focal point, rather than a visual barrier. A solitary red pine, approximately 70 feet tall and with branches only at the top, functioned as a distinctive visual landmark at the top and back of the space. This tree was removed in 2004 because of its deteriorated condition. Other tall pines will be allowed to grow in this area to maintain the sense of verticality. The irregular shape of the rock outcropping inspired the garden's organic form, and influenced its overall spatial organization. The topography of the site creates a series of flat planes: the lake, stepping up to the mown lawn surrounded by grassy meadow, followed by the uneven, steeply sloped rock outcropping, leading to the level summit area. The open meadow at the base of the outcropping provided a sense of arrival for visitors arriving from Ellsworth's dock on Kabetogama Lake, and provided a space for viewing the main features of the gardens. The forest that surrounded the outcropping and the meadow established a distinct vertical edge. This forest \"wall\" functioned as visual boundary and established a sense of enclosure to create an impression that the gardens had been carved out of nature. The inherent qualities of water, rock and forest remain unchanged.",

The calm, carbonate-rich and oxygen-poor water of Devils Hole is a constant 33.5–34°C (93°F) in the deeper reaches of the cave and is often even warmer in the shallows. This combination creates a challenging environment for the tiny blue Devils Hole pupfish! These fish subsist on algae, invertebrates, and other micro-organisms found on a shallow rock shelf within the pool. <br /> <br /> The water level in Devils Hole was protected by the United States Supreme Court in 1976 to help ensure the ongoing survival of this unique fish. With only about 100–180 individuals remaining in the wild, scientists continue their efforts to conserve the species for this and future generations to learn from and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Ash Meadows is located approximately 50 miles east of the Furnace Creek Visitor Center in Death Valley and 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The refuge and Devils Hole are accessed via Spring Meadows Road. Refuge roads are dirt and gravel, and higher clearance or 4-wheel drive vehicles may be required depending on conditions. <br /> <br /> Due to the sensitive nature of Devils Hole, the pool is fenced and must be viewed from afar; bring binoculars to better see the tiny fish from the Devils Hole viewing platform. For a closer look at desert pupfishes, be sure to check out the other pools and species on the refuge!</p>",

If entering Longmire from the Nisqually Entrance, drive past the National Park Inn, and turn right at the two-story building with the flagpole. Continue straight through the employee housing area and across the historic Longmire Suspension Bridge over the Nisqually River. The trailhead is located 300 feet past the suspension bridge. There is a small pullout for parking near the trailhead or continue a short distance down the road to park in front of the Longmire Community Building.<br /> <br /> Eagle Peak Trail is 7.2 miles roundtrip with 2,955 feet of elevation gain. For the first two miles the trail ascends steeply through dense forest to a small stream, then continues another mile to a meadow. Beyond the meadow the trail is much steeper and rocky as it climbs the final 0.5 mile to the 5,700 feet saddle where the trail ends. Use extreme caution when you reach the saddle. This area is exposed and a fall could be deadly. Snow can also linger well into June, with dangerous snow cornices possibly hiding the edges of the cliffs.<br /> <br /> This peak was originally known as Sim-layshe, a Native American word for eagle. When the Longmire family settled nearby, George Longmire anglicized the name to Eagle Peak. From the Eagle Peak Saddle look north for views of Mount Rainier and the buildings in the Paradise Area. Look south for panoramic views of the Nisqually River Valley and surrounding Cascade Range, with Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams in the distance. Subalpine meadows along the trail on the final approach to the saddle can have excellent wildflower displays in summer, with peak bloom typically in late July/early August.<br /> <br /> While Longmire is open year-round, snow can make this trail hazardous in winter. Winter hikers and snowshoers must have experience with navigation and avalanche terrain. <br /> <br /> <b>Backpacking</b><br /> There is no designated camp along this trail nor atop the Tatoosh Range. Current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. Treat water before drinking.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The Eagle Peak trail is steep and strenuous, with numerous sections of log steps and rocks. The trail is dirt, and often icy or snow-covered well into summer. There are sections of steep drop-offs, particularly around Eagle Peak Saddle. The Eagle Peak parking lot is a half-circle shaped, dirt pullout on the right, or downhill, side of the road as you head away from the Longmire Suspension Bridge. The trail starts from the left side of the pullout, with a small sign next to the trailhead.",

            "bodyText": "<p>There’s no missing Devils Courthouse.<br /> <br /> Rising above the surrounding spruce forest at an imposing 5,720 feet, this dark mass of exposed rock seems to almost hang over its surroundings. According to Cherokee legend, a powerful mountain giant named Judaculla danced and held court in an underground chamber beneath the rock. A strenuous half-mile trail leads visitors to the very top of this fabled dance hall, where, on a clear day, sweeping views stretch into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee.<br /> <br /> But it’s not just a pretty view. Devils Courthouse also provides habitat for a variety of rare, high-altitude species that migrated here during the last Ice Age. With ample heat rising from the valley, it’s also the perfect territory for birds of prey, including peregrine falcons who nest on the side of the rock’s face—but they’ll only return if their home is left undisturbed. Due to this area’s unique ecology, it is critical that casual visitors and serious hikers alike follow all posted signs and trail regulations, like no climbing on the rock outcroppings and remaining behind the established wall at the trail’s end. By staying on the trail, we can ensure that these natural wonders remain protected for years to come.</p>",

This parking area contains informational exhibits about peregrine falcons and forest restoration and a short, paved walkway that provides access to the Devils Courthouse Trailhead.

In the early 1900s, it experienced a brief-lived gold rush, with people flocking to the area from throughout Alaska and the world. By 1907, the stampede was over and few people remained year-round in the area. Some who stayed continued to pull minerals out of the ground, while others just enjoyed the remoteness and beauty of the landscape.<br /> <br /> With the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in late 1980, the boundaries of Denali expanded dramatically, and encompassed many privately-owned lands in Kantishna. Some private lands have been purchased over time by the federal government, while other inholdings remain. A few of the inholders now run wilderness lodges or other accommodations for travelers—<a href=\"https://www.denalichamber.com/\">visit the Denali Chamber of Commerce to learn more</a>.<br /> <br /> Visitors can mainly reach Kantishna in the summer (roughly June 8 to early September each year) with either a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/visiting-denali.htm\">Kantishna Experience bus tour or Kantishna transit bus</a>.",

            "audioDescription": "The Mammoth Cave Baptist Church is a one-story frame building approximately 42 feet long by 26 feet wide, with white weatherboard siding and a tin gable front roof. The Church sits on a foundation of sandstone blocks. The front of the church has two entrances with three cement steps at each. There is a wooden sign between each door noting, “Mammoth Cave Baptist Church, Established 1827, Meeting Saturday and Sunday”. There is a third door on the side of the building. This entrance has three cement steps to enter. Each sidewall has four two-over-two double-hung sash windows. The church’s interior is unadorned with wood tongue-and groove planked walls and ceiling, and a wood plank floor covered with linoleum in some spots. There are a number of movable hand made pews in the church which are set in rows facing the podium. The Church building is deteriorating slightly from lack of regular use. It is original in design, workmanship and in most materials. The chimney on the west side of the building was removed in the 1970’s when the original metal roof was replaced. The church is wired for electricity. The Mammoth Cave Church property is in good condition with dense woods behind and to the east side of the church. It is a short walk to the west side of the church to the Mammoth Cave Baptist Cemetery.",

            "audioDescription": "Maltese Cross Cabin. 839 words. The Maltese Cross Cabin is a single-story log structure with a high peaked roof located approximately 100 feet from the North doors of the South Unit Visitor Center. A door and two windows are visible. The logs of the cabin are light in color, with concrete chinking. East of the cabin, wooden benches and stumps make an outdoor seating area. A sidewalk leads through a grassy area to a small ramp to the front door. The cabin’s roof is shingled and has two chimneys, one near either end. The wooden front door has a small white doorknob on the right side. An elk antler hangs above the door. Situated approximately five feet to either side of the door are small windows. Inside the cabin, white painted walls and plexiglass panels enclose a space of approximately 50 square feet. There are two doors on the west side of this space, leading to plexiglass alcoves in the kitchen and the bedroom. The floor is made of wooden boards and visitors can see items that belonged to Theodore Roosevelt. Near the rear of the visitor center is a wayside about the cabin. It is titled “Maltese Cross Cabin: Launching a Legacy.” The main image on the wayside is a photo illustration of the cabin at its current location morphing into a historic image of the cabin with a horse and buggy in front of it. Text on the historic section of the photo reads: Photo by Theodore Roosevelt ca.1884-1886. Underneath the photo, captions read: After traveling the country on exhibition, the cabin now sits about 7 miles north of its original location. Sylvane Ferris in a wagon and an unidentified man on horseback pose in front of the Maltese Cross Cabin. Text to the left of the image reads: “I never would have been president if it had not been for my experiences in North Dakota.” – Theodore Roosevelt, 1918. The Maltese Cabin was a temporary home for Theodore Roosevelt who, during his mid-20s, divided his time between his home in New York City and his two ranches in Dakota Territory. The cabin offers a glimpse of what Roosevelt’s life was like on the ranch. The books and letters he wrote about his experiences here reveal the role of the badlands in shaping his character and his passion for protecting wild places. Later, as our nation’s 26th president, Roosevelt established the National Forest Service and designated more than 230 million acres of land as national parks, forest, monuments, and wildlife reserves. How could the strenuous life on the ranch prepare Theodore Roosevelt for his presidency? Text to the right of the image describes the features of the cabin and reads: Features Steeply-Pitched Roof: An oddity on the Northern Plains, the cabin’s steep roof created a sleeping loft for Roosevelt’s ranch hands, accessed by a ladder on the kitchen wall. Pine logs: Exterior walls were built from ponderosa pine logs cut near Ekalaka, MT. The cabin’s survival is owed, in part, to these sturdy logs which were intended for railroad construction. A Grand Structure: The cabin had wooden floors, a root cellar, three rooms, a sleeping loft, and two coal-burning stoves, setting it apart from most frontier homes of its time. Seal of Approval: Empty rifle casings were used to make the shape of the Maltese Cross on the end of a log on the cabin’s right front corner. Just one partial casing remains; the rest were taken as souvenirs long ago. Today, such destruction is illegal. Along the bottom of the wayside is a timeline titled Maltese Cross Cabin Timeline. The text of the timeline reads: September 4, 1883: Roosevelt arrives in Little Missouri, Dakota Territory to hunt bison. Near the end of his two-week trip, he invests $14,000 in the Maltese Cross Ranch. Winter 1883-1884: Ranch partners, Sylvane Ferris and Bill Merrifield, build the Maltese Cross Cabin according to TR’s request. June 1884: While grieving the deaths of his wife and mother, Roosevelt turns his focus to ranching, establishing the Elkhorn Ranch, 35 miles north of Medora. Winter 1886-1887: A very harsh winter causes major cattle losses on the Northern Plains. Roosevelt loses 60% of his cattle. April 1887: Roosevelt begins to sell off interests in his ranches to minimize financial loss. 1898: Roosevelt sells his interests in the Maltese Cross Ranch, including the cabin, to his partner, Sylvane Ferris. 1904: The cabin is dismantled and shipped via railcar to be exhibited at the World’s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. 1905: The cabin goes on exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. 1906: The cabin exhibits at the State Fair in Fargo, then moves to the capitol grounds in Bismarck where the Daughters of the American Revolution take over its care. 1947: Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park established (now Theodore Roosevelt National Park). 1959: Cabin ownership is transferred to the National Park Service (NPS). 1960-1961: The NPS places the cabin on its current foundation and restores the roof to its original appearance.

Most of the timber for the hotel was logged from nearby and milled at a sawmill on the shores of Swiftcurrent Lake.

This area is maintained by the Township of Russell and includes a pavilion, beach, boat launch, and the Little Sand Bay Campground. </p> <h4><strong>History of Little Sand Bay</strong></h4> <p>Two thirds of the mainland unit of the Apostle Islands, including Little Sand Bay, is within the Red Cliff Band Reservation. The land at LSB was ceded to the Federal Government in 1842. Today, we fly the United States flag and Tribal Flag to honor our relationship with the tribal community and to promote tribal history, lifestyles, and teachings of the traditions for the next Seven Generations of the Anishinaabe. <br /> <br /> In the late 1920's the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/historic-hokenson-brothers-fishery-apis.htm\">Hokenson brothers</a> started a commercial fishing operation out of LSB. For more than 30 years the small family-owned business grew out of LSB and you can tour the grounds to see their twine shed, pile driver, dock, and herring shed. Many of the interpretive displays are located outside, including the renovated Twilite fishing boat to showcase how technology evolved to make fishing in the 1930's-1950's more efficient. </p> <h4><b>South Shore Club</b></h4> <p>In 1923 a group of Russell Township residents founded the South Shore Club. They envisioned a resort on the shores of Lake Superior to entice tourists and outside investment. Club members cleared a new road to LSB and established the South Shore Subdivision with lots available for development. Several of the lots near the beach were reserved for a park to keep the area open to the public. Members of the South Shore Club established a tradition of picnics and other activities at the park, but the lots sold slowly, and few buyers constructed any buildings. One notable exception was Herman Johnson Jr.<br /> <br /> Hermie obtained lots in the South Shore Subdivision in the 1930’s. He moved his fishing business from Sand Island to LSB and built a log cabin, dock, icehouse, and twin shed. He and his wife Agnes opened a general store and tavern in March 1941 and developed a tourist attraction that operated through the early 1970s. You could find anything from diesel to root beer floats. Locals would come to LSB to socialize, watch a baseball game, and picnic on the beach. Johnson would take guests out on his fishing boat called the Sand Bay and show them an honest days work on the water. The NPS used the store as a visitor center until 2017. Elements of the current visitor center reflect the style of Hermie’s store.</p>",

By 1920, the well-liked country doctor and Iowa legislator decided to have a new home built for himself. The result was this white, one and a half story wood frame house with large overhanging eaves, an airy L-shaped veranda supported by four Doric columns, and a small inset balcony above the front porch that overlooks Downey Street.</p> <h2>Celebrations & Ice Cream Socials</h2> <p>However, at the turn of the century when Dr. Leech was still living in the Miles house, the empty lot where this home now sits became one of the most popular social centers in West Branch. Here during the hot Midwest summers, Dr. Leech held ice cream socials church groups and 4th of July celebrations for the whole town. His lawn parties grew in popularity when box supper socials to benefit the volunteer fire company became an annual event. The West Branch Times wrote, “All gentlemen are invited to come and buy a box and take supper with your own or someone’s best girl!”</p> <h2>\"A Long Life Of Usefulness\"</h2> <p>Although this home was built many years after <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/heho/historyculture/herbert-hoover.htm\">Herbert Hoover’s</a> childhood, there is still a connection between the physician who practiced medicine in West Branch for 55 years and the young boy who left and became the nation’s 31st President. When Dr. Leech passed away at the age of 91 in 1937, services were held at the West Branch <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/c-e-smith-house.htm\">Methodist Church</a>. Herbert Hoover, ever guided by the understanding that it takes a community to raise a child, sent a personal message of sympathy that was read at the funeral. In it, the former President remembered and praised Dr. Leech’s “long life of usefulness to the community and loyalty to his neighbors and friends.”</p>",

A white picket fence surrounds the home, running alongside the boardwalk that serves the east side of Downey Street. The fence’s pointed pickets alternate between 3 ½ and 4 feet tall. A sign five inches wide by 12 inches tall hangs on the gatepost. Beneath the title “Leech House “, a black and white photograph shows the army band seated in front of the house. A caption states: \"Army Band plays for Leech, a Civil War veteran and Iowa legislator, in the 1930s.\" Beneath the image, text reads: \"Dr. Lewis J. Leech built and moved into this house in 1920. Before that he hosted ice cream socials and Fourth of July parties on the lot. When Dr. Leech died in 1937 at age 91, former President Hoover praised his 'long life of usefulness … to his neighbors and friends.'\" End of message.",

They established it as a mission, naming it San Gabriel de Guevavi. Subsequent missionaries called it San Rafael and San Miguel, resulting in the common historical name of Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi.</p> <p>In 1701, Guevavi was established as a district headquarters and <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/juan-de-san-martin.htm\">Juan de San Martin</a> was assigned as the first resident priest. A small church was started that same year. Father San Martin left in 1703. Fathers <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/agustin-de-campos.htm\">Agustín de Campos</a> and <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/luis-xavier-velarde.htm\">Luis Xavier Velarde</a> visited occasionally after that. <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/juan-bautista-grazhoffer.htm\">Father Grazhoffer</a>, in 1732, reestablished Guevavi as <em>cabecera</em> and completed the church. Unfortunately, he died the following year - possibly of poison. <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/joseph-garrucho.htm\">Father Garrucho</a>, resident priest from 1745 to 1751, recorded 148 burials, many from disease. In 1751, Father Garrucho contracted the building of a 15 foot by 50 foot church, the ruins of which still exist today.</p> <p>The first captain of the <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/san-ignacio-de-tubac.htm\">Tubac Presidio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/captain-juan-tomas-belderrain.htm\">Juan Tómas de Beldarrain</a>, was wounded by Seri Indians and died at Guevavi.

The first <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/franciscan-missionaries.htm\">Franciscan</a> priest, <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/juan-crisostomo-gil-de-bernabe.htm\">Juan Crisóstomo Gil de Bernabé</a>, arrived in 1768 and began the mission with about fifty families. Unfortunately the Apaches attacked in 1769 and killed all but two of the few Spanish soldiers guarding the mission. In 1770 and 1771, the Apaches continued their attacks and the cabecera was moved to <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/tumacacori.htm\">Tumacácori</a>. Antonio de los Reyes, Bishop of Sonora, on 6 July 1772 wrote a report on the condition of the missions in the Upper and Lower Pimeria Alta.</p> <p><em>\"The village of Guevavi is situated on a open and fertile plain beside an arroyo with good land where the Indians cultivate their individual fields of wheat, Indian corn, other crops, and one small community farm. The church on the inside is adorned with two altars and a small side chapel with paintings in gilded frames. In the sacristy are three chalices, two dishes with cruets, one pyx, a ciborium, a censer, and a baptismal shell - all silver - vestments of every kind and color and other ornaments for the altar and divine services. According to the census book, which I have here before me, there are nineteen married couples, five widowers, seven widows, twelve orphans, the number of should in all eighty-six.\" - translated by Kieran McCarty</em><br /> <br /> Guevavi was abandoned for the last time in 1775. After sitting abandoned since the 1770s, Guevavi's ruins were added to Tumacácori National Historical Park in 1990. The late Ralph Wingfield, a local rancher, donated the ruins to the <a href=\"http://www.americanarchaeology.org/\">Archaeological Conservancy</a> which, in turn, donated it to the National Park Service.</p>",
            "audioDescription": "The site is sprawling, including large open landscapes of mesquite and creosote brush in desert upland. A large rock outcrop offers an overhead view of the river bed, usually dry and sandy, with gently sloping banks on either side. Across the road, mountains are visible. The mission site itself is a barely perceptible square outline of low, raised berms of earth, with the adobe remnants of the church oriented north-south along the western edge. The adobe walls run parallel to each other, about 5 feet high except where they slope down to the ground on the south side. On the northwest end, the adobe wall rises to about 10 feet in height. The walls are uneven, coated with a mud plaster on the top, with exposed adobe bricks along their faces.",

            "audioDescription": "The Whiteoak Falls Boundary Trailhead is a 36\"x 54\" color poster. The poster is organized into two columns. On the left the first column begins with the title, \"Did You Know?\" with a photograph of a waterfall cascading through bright red and orange leaves. This image is followed by the subtitle, \"Gushing Over Waterfalls\" with text underneath \"If you want to see some waterfalls, you have come to the right place. Whiteoak Canyon boasts not one, not two, but a whole series of waterfalls and cascades! They range in height from 35 to 86 feet. Whiteoak Canyon's steep gorge and sheer rock walls make the perfect home for the rush of the trail's pools and cascades. Want even more waterfalls? Head on up the Cedar Run trail to see another three waterfalls gently flowing into deep green pools.\" Below this are two vertical images, one of a foggy path surrounded by trees, the other of a tall waterfalls surrounded by lush green vegetation. Another subtitle reads, \"A Trail for All Seasons.\" The text below reads, \"Each season brings a new level of appreciation for the waterfalls in Whiteoak Canyon. Springtime ushers in a canyon that is overflowing with an abundance of rushing water. In the summer, the cool, clear water offers relief from the season's heat. In autumn, the waterfalls make for a vivid backdrop to the canyon's spectacular foliage. In the winter, the falls form frozen cascades of ice that are suspended in air. And the waterfalls only tell a portion of this trail's annual story. Depending upon the season, Whiteoak Canyon is also home to an abundance of wildflowers, migrating butterflies, lush, moss-covered cliffs, and shy winter residents like bobcats and crayfish. No matter when you visit, there is so much to see and appreciate in White Oak Canyon!\" Beginning the second column on the upper right is a 20\"x20\" topographic map oriented west. There is one trail highlighted in yellow on the map. Below the maps is the title \"Suggested Hike\" with the following text, \"Hike: Whiteoak Falls 6.0-mile round trip, moderately strenuous, 4Â½ hours hiking time, 1600-foot elevation gain. Begin at Whiteoak Falls Trail and keep right at the intersection with Cedar Run Trail. Continue on past a series of falls and cascades. Return before crossing the large metal bridge above the upper falls. The trail to the upper falls is steep and challenging. Consider your physical conditioning before embarking on this route. Many people underestimate the amount of time and energy necessary to hike to the upper falls and return to the parking lot. Allow enough time to complete your hike before dark. There is no shuttle service in the Park.\" Below this is the subtitle \"Shorter Version\" with the text \"2.0-mile round trip, easiest, 1Â½ hours hiking time, 500-foot elevation gain. Begin at Whiteoak Falls Trail and keep right at the intersection with Cedar Run Trail. Cross a small stream and arrive shortly at the base of the lower falls. Return by the same route.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. It's dangerous and potentially deadly to climb on the rocks near waterfalls. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitor centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. - Filter or treat water from streams before drinking.\"",
