            "transcript": "Hello and welcome to virtual Kingsley heritage celebration. I'm Susie Sernaker Park Ranger with the National Park Service today we will hear from Peri Frances Bestch and Emanuel Kingsley two Kingsley's descendants about family heritage and the meaning of legacy. Peri Francis and Emanuel welcome. Thanks so much for having me. Thanks for having me pleasure to be here. Thank you so much. It really is a pleasure to be here and to be able to come to you from New York in my case and pair you are in. Right now I'm currently in Nashville, Tennessee, and we're beaming into the plantation. Exactly. So it was virtually I Kingsley Butler other lie out in Brooklyn, so it's good to see I haven't seen many parts salon menu any time many years billing time. And I'm wing regards little picture in the museum of a super nice little picture. Anza. I tried one doing I own a blog. And said, I'm your Aunt is like, you know, shamefully outdated. But that feature view and me there is there. And it's a really cool creature. Severe as well as your earnings doesn't a this. Picture's larger, global earnings are and moving. I remember a lot, of course, DEF coins and people. Its so good to be with you and sit down and talk with you again and to be here on this occasion for the virtual Kingsley heritage that I know you were so instrumental in, you know, starting the Kingsley celebration. So my question to you is on? Can you tell me a little bit about how you found out that you were a Kingsley? The descendant? Oh yeah. Absolutely. The first summer ever heard of over a virtue. Please. I'm sure it was so long ago. I I I wanted I was late for five or six, but I really honestly do not know for my babies who earlier was so so and I was at Grandma's house and dumb sourcing something letters, low, yadda, yadda the familiar, and only later does like, oh, no, you sell your Grandma and Grandpa is gonna Kingsley like loser. I clearly remember. These details am dumb. Then my mom. My mom loves the story, but sometimes she's not, you know to exactly details and so she's like, yeah, no. He was an English pirate, and he's like your great grandfather. And yet an African wife and love, you know, like very. And well, you know, like after that ever since then, the hugely simply sinuses come up absolutely everywhere. And anytime there's a family reunion November weather person from Luke Perry per. Absolutely absolutely presence. I also think about it. How you know how this story? Actually that started in different places right in England in Africa. In two thousand, how that story actually crossed from Florida to the Dominican Republic, which was then occupied my Haiti administered by him. And then, Unitas like when down through the family as something that's very precious insight. It was a big deal now. Always every family reunion had the story of the kings is, you know we have to stick Arabia. So we don't gather by the fire by you know, it was late, you know. Gather by the icy. I guess. And that was always always presents since since then the on I remember, really, wow, I mean, why not migrate. My great grandmother on her. Lessening was key resource. It was the last one to to carry the name not anymore besides circuit recently, but my great grandmother was the last one thousand carry the name, and she's a person that knows very close to me and. On maybe say my Grandma, my Grandma. They were always there. You know. So the name itself was always visual sensation like Heinlein, my family, well, we called her Mama Mia, but her name was Maria, the donor Harris, Kingsley. Don't know. Harry Kane Bettis. Today it is. Yes Kingsley. A C wow. Centuries of an IQ, these great granddaughter. So I didn't really know by Kingsley connection until I really started to get to know Mafia. I and I started to get to know Marlene. When I was in, I first started using know her when I was in college, I was in was at Spelman, my other artwork President. And I just remember like there would be certain milestone occasion in her life. You know, she gets, she's getting married or there was the um. And when she was inaugurated at the President's salmond nor win on the Cosby's made their twenty million dollar gift, which at that time was like the largest single gift ADHD. You know, by all in the news, there would be these Blake, you know, gossipy, little murmurs and whispers the few here among the faculty or staff at Spelman, or you know, people in and Lana society likes to think she's in the code, I. You should never leave the island and she comes can bring all that hair. What anyone? What would it be like if she you know? And so she was to me isn't mom. Levine was like this. Hum. I didn't even make it larger than life. Huge person of thumb. You know, definitely like a President put some like trepidation among. So I I is. I remember I saw her in life. I think it was ebony essence. Magazine issued by standing on top of non a Dude in. You know those some blank but travel feature a maze listed. Her piano bar now is like a half. And so I wrote down the address, I come. I wrote her a note and biking one animals. You're gonna remember me. Come on, Johnny daughter a mini done in Atlanta. I'd like to see you know member. I got back this big Manila envelope with all kinds of newspaper clippings and like this leak this letter that was written on, you know, legal paper, but it had all these like high lighters in my pink and yellow and orange in and instead on. Greeting on the black rhino, vegetarian society and revolutionary headquarters on American beach house do by the specially. Maybe course I remember you and like so arm. So she was the person. Ooh really. Call me about the story like and I, we started corresponding in the I came and I met her, and she terminology people should be like, no. You gotta me, you know all you gotta be told those articles, buzzards, known dividing, grew up in Jacksonville. Oh. So I'm were always in the area through know. So so. It's interesting because I had come to Jacksonville as a small child. And then the last time I've been out for my grandmother's funeral and I was three. And then I didn't go back. My father move to Europe when our skin hum high school. So when when week I went back to Jacksonville, wished him to visit Mommy. And I wanna say I was twenty, and she hadn't been back in eighty years. Old ass found my whole life low in the midst of all of the people that he oh, you gotta be. So oh, she kept saying, we gotta go see Roger Carroll gardens the project zero. And I remember my mother him terrorists. Are those like me who I am do, sir? Roger or cousin. There were is two people that I mean each other related, because sheep's also she spoke of them was such like. You know friendship and love in like those are my people. So I thought they were literally are people come to find out secret. The Rangers at the National Park Service. Hum. And the actual day the eyes first read read his work, which at that time wasn't a book. It was a pamphlet. Yes. I remember when I was standing the first fast hands list with a term paper that was written by a friend of my father's who he meant when she worked at the Village Vanguard, New York. But then she moved to Florida and studied, denounce the stick, Kingsley connection and the connection to a Lewis admit the Legion. So she wrote their armpit. She sent me the term paper and the pamphlet. She tended to my father's house in Perry. Because I was on my way to Senegal. Right? Yes. So I injuries a vaguely knew that there was some kind of connection, but then I'm actually we had like, you know, the document with the dates in the names in the thing. And then like a week later, I was on my own crystallized in ozone, some retailers, Rogers race, similarly of like, made it really President and really real Fermi flow. Remember. Oh sorry, none of you are. I remember. We must me. You know, doctor. Super nerd are very close and dumb when we visited own genes, a producer for the first time we were when we went to Florida, often home since I grew up in Santo Domingo, and then we often wondered the sharp March, our shopping and jealous or loose interpretation of the time and Disney or less. Um. And I remember hundred and hold I was maybe eleven, twelve and. Rip it. I was if our Internet Tilly Lucas, but here without you know, they graduate high school class of ninety four the price. So how come somehow making in an online class of ninety five? I just have my bachelor's is Plaza two thousand. So yeah. So this was a while ago, rice and done the best I could do was lay at the at the at the airport late on the store. I just browsed and found Florida. Florida is exploding nuclear. They knew that frontier of the naturally the South. But um. And then there was, I wanted to see if I could find use a transition because we always knew that it was you don't museum. We actually had, um, family members have visited in the seventies. Right? And and so, you know. And then I, I, I actually found this, and I'm like, wow. And I called up from the airport and like, you know, I'm actually a descendant end NASA. They were late so excited. Then we visited any of the doctor Schafer was their Ninos. And I spent some time in in a few years ago, a years later, I am if I interned at Kinsey, but I did an internship at volunteer Kingsley plantation and said with the safer. But the point is of it's accuracy for contacted me like you won't believe it. I actually located Kingsley descendants in in the Jacksonville area. And I'm like well. I clearly remember that another he said from Martha writes, is surprisingly his daughter Martha was or Mary Mary to manager Sam is yeah right. And I was so excited and I'm late. Well no, but. The less when you guys hung out as well through doctor supers, resources. I correct. You know, I really don't know if Mommy knew of the story before learning of Shapers research the I when she was the person for me crazy, he told a story. Now how it all leads, you know, it's because like we always heard about the Afro, the upper American life insurance company in Illinois, and so he's my great great grandfather held at Kingsley connection is actually Abraham Lincoln. It married Mary friend. Ben Kingsley Amis and he was a bright like millionaire. Was it? You said so he could go back. That's what they say, Florida and need like millionaire in the state of Florida. Now we don't know that you know has had enough, but however, Viet Nam that's the story that he was the like millionaire in the state of Florida. We do not have the Afro American life insurance company would be first insurance company in the state of Florida, black or white. Oh so right on. So I've often wondered you know he. He is a formidable character. Their story is amazing, but I have often wondered how much of his own. Yeah. Dhabi real estate knowledge came from. You know that initial, his first marriage in his first marriage was to a Kingfisher beer. You know if if that helped him get a leg up in acquiring property or noon art business or you know, I just always wonder, but courted by lawyer? There were like the wealthier stone, probably residents of of counties beer, the two daughters, Mary, and Martha married snide one point. Yes. Someone pointed so resolutely and is always late one. You is clearly tell. Some stories are handed own infantilism others are not, and I'm like, you know what. What is it that you know that is it? Because we went to an island and others. You know the fear aspect of of insularity. There's always something that you want to connect. And maybe but the story pass that way because of the the owner is is um, maybe because seniority. Usually written Abraham Lincoln Louis Louis was such a big personality that overshadow that the King, these barriers for us like that for now. You know, there's only become legendary ancestor that describe any narciso was open area and energy and self conscious. I just sometimes wonder, you know, like wages. I mean, well again, my my perspective is a little different, because I didn't grow up in Jacksonville. And the story that I'm definitely knew, but I really didn't even understand the significance of death or either was Abraham Lincoln really affirmation, like just somebody an American beach one until very much later that I am even on. And then I learned the Kingsley story, but I didn't really get at the connection was because Abraham Lincoln Lewis married a seemingly ready and also because that marriage was relatively short. She she die. And he remarried in you married again and go on like a lot of the pictures. But I stopped him or the stories that you know. My Dad and my uncle tell both of us of his Mama zone with another one voter reader. I'm in shape for Tonia even just recently within the past. Are they probably five or ten years? Dad. He once he found both the story and the connection he has made an appointment to interview. My grandmother was Mary, Frances Lewis. Bench on. And he was on his way she was. She worked at Edward waters college, and he was on his way for office, and she was she had fallen ill, and she was taken away in ambulances and cheese. You know he'd later transition for. He never got to interview her, but she remembered her grandmother. Who would the us? You know who remember her grandmother remembered? I'm spending time as the house in Arlington. That is weird was in cemeteries right across. You're exactly where clarion is very erdos. It comes round. So um, what would you say is your connection to an end? And I am just that there's a. There was a story of the legendary investors know. It's more than that. I feel that ladies room. It's really. You know it really, isn't. I revere juices internal having to own up to my identity. Um really, I feel that, um. Listen another few constants in my life. You know the second tab, you know? I started very early on to be interested. There's always one in the family that likes the family history. You know, enzymes, I think out against ice. And Russia is in central United Starlet lake, as a child is asking questions and and always wanted to visit my great aunt's the one who the ones who are still alive and and and here their their stories. And I was fascinated and, and, you know, come to think of it. Also they you when you're in an elderly person. And someone takes an interest in someone young from the family or just anyone at all in the story. But also you do know for them. It was wonderful. I suppose as well when when I visited them and they came alive and it was just amazing. Nice to talk about these things. To talk about justice, like connection that we have some think also like he has my connections to, you know, being a Kingsley. It's such a multinational look at cultural multiracial. Everything in their story that, you know Sage's reveals different aspects. Every time you do the attorney page rate, different aspects of contradictions. Damn this is another the you know what. What you expect? Three light yellow that is not terrorize. I sat down with a waste. Not that China anxiety I now a time like this is not a. Thank you. Sorry. I keep thinking. Oh no, no, no. This is a racket. Oh. So this is kind of like mean to me. Yeah. Now does man listen? I should, but I just have to tell you, dear dear to you reclaimed the name. How did that come about in? And like, what does that mean? He's here. You will lose home. It's about a kind of like a feeling of belonging and identifying arms. So my parents married my my father. His parents were from screen earns home, so sort of them maternal side from Barcelona, the fraternal stars from certain counties in the South in in those year end. So but they were, you know, like, I mean, they're, they're my family, but it's just, you know, they were townsfolk vacuum, you know. In in in in Spain, until there was nothing really that that stood out, and I looked, and you know, and all of the stories, um, and ask questions. And you know, the usual stuff with the other side of the family. But I just never really just connected that much. There's just something about being a Kingsley that that really to me. It's just at, um. It is very impressive, very, very, very special lines. You know, it's double edged and it carries weight, but you know, it's just this is similar, but um, that kind of a connection, really. That's why I decided to choose my name. And I had I was in Spain for ten years on and so on I went. I went to Barcelona in two thousand and six because idols are like. Because I'm a French citizen as well. Does your son is a bit more no matter where you're born here if you liked the Senator Senator? So it's like, like kind of like Zia vs theater nationally. And so I went there in two thousand six on one of the reasons was beef because I was, you know, my boyfriend at the time time, and I could not really. Mary hears. He's from Germany. His visa was running out. We. I mean, I like him. He went on diet pills. Let me tell you. He loves movies. He's saying, like no Dude like she was singing. She was singing are silo me in ass and only about every outlet in a hula hoop know a lot about an offer much more than high through Emily. Yeah. And he's trying to impress, you know, like you don't understand. That's like the big roads. You gonna have that? Radiohead had athlete that they eat really excited about that, Adam. Let's move in and everything like that just accumulate in Seattle and will from everywhere. Really? Yeah. But so one of the reasons is, I like in Spain we could marry in two other safe third country in the world and that, you know, you hear in a suitably, so there's not much we can do this. And we went there, and it was a great time. And I started using the Kingsley name around that time. I kind of like I knew myself that I kind of identified more and more. I started using it. But it's not that easy to change your name being in a place where the civilized late codified likeness on the on the Napoleonic law. So like in France or in an hour Italy, I kind of stuff is not that easy, whereas in in Anglo Saxon like common is very easy. So I I used did, but it was nice not officially when I came back to me are ah. Then I just, I just managed really sixty bucks down there in city hall and then ended. It feels it felt great. And um, flea also want to like a family unit, the name, and so recently, and also sent for Kingsley name. Because you know, for Aetna we we we met. Remember the plantation? I I was staying there. Ah. I I uselessly at home in met him. When you were staying active, I know. Tommy Haas went to get a house like our first big trip together and camping out in oil. It was a like, and we stayed. We let their idea and one of the rooms in the media. The cloud has idea. The answer is on the Rangers. You know like the Minneapolis is that there's like to play for other volunteers day. We stay there ends. At midnight. We walked over to the plantation to the site of the old house in the rivers there, and it is very it was something that really got it together. Alonso is that this history. Freedom of the kings is also like it's become, is he really just absolutely loves it. I mean, now. It's pretty amazing to me that, while operating in in an error I am now you eyes are many time was quarantine. Nasty. Adding a hot desert, though, Nina, Hoss, because I Humpty in Atlanta for the French center. But we shared office faced with the ghost is which, because the German culture center, and tells the executive director of the defense on hum. I typically go by Francis, which is to talking about name. But really it just because I was a high school teacher, and you really don't want to stay super? Fourteen year old time is test on. I know that you know is there is important recently. It's become so my interest according to my another that I be a bad storm hearing claiming Tibet. But you. When he found out that that was my name. No question that were to become prominent, had told him the story, and then I told him about my aunt, and he actually hold up like me. Micro film reviews from the familiarity of her performances in Germany and unite. He kind of told me the same thing. Best your partner did like Choo Choo is like a sensation everyone asking about you know religious. Young African American are in. I bet I was young colored woman who was singing. He knows fellow man, I'd. I'm doing all the figure and she's done for the German state. Auburn with it. You know us. See she was she was so much larger than life entirely that she was dating em. Yeah. You both believed her, but she also was pretty dramatic in that machine or whatever. So it was a fight so many times she would pay something, and he didn't know whether ticket with a brain father as gospel, and it was her out to be like one hundred percent torture. Mommy was. The troops is was, and always will be. I remember those who actually saw release of fright. Me write me earns the bushes. Are you really feel about? You deserve marine. Ah offered you a weirdo. African bees were an American beach range as well, and then she's like the wind, gorgeous writer. How is you like many you in the? We may end the year. I think the year that she had transitioned two thousand and five. You're in twenty fourth cheating. And they open the door on the American beach museum for there's a museum now are calmer. Here is a mare. There's a whole, you know, a mile from. Peter was aware here, Oliver. Her there. So I go to opening for what hand on ways what you mean? Her hair. Is there light at home? She got older she could wanted it to be preserved the big long lonesome. Not yes. So it was most of the later little and all kinds of spices do in a way that it did. The date displayed. It is just genius is in this, like the center of the museum and encased in like a glass or Plexiglas solemn. And it has on to say, yeah. Orange ribbon, infamous orange ribbon, a hand on butterflies. Did you have a lot when I'm at home? Many analogies to like Marion's on. It's week or something. You know, yeah. And she was there. There's no doubt that it should be preserved and should be displayed Google. I'm Abba museum opening in a very emotional. The first time I've actually heard her voice when she transitioned posted by here, they're recording my ethics. I always people are coming up in introducing both me and my Dad and and if something comes up to me, she's like are older. White male mean by hair, parted down the middle of in dark, eating it. She's then. I'm so happy to meet you. She says system museum was my friend like, ah, man. I knew her for many years and nobody knew a lot of people in and around. If I did, how did you meet her. He's dead. I was her postal carrier. And so before she had a house before she had a piano bar, she would need me on Wednesday afternoon on the cop like it was like, literally like Marvin fed. I'll be on the corner. Julia and a one I just pull up. She's pulled up, and marine just like emerged from the Spanish mosque in the trees and was like, hey, get my mail. And since made about airport since this is a magical creature, but go home. My next question in on what does more, you can answered it already? But I am Bruno go. What does Kimberly conditioning you? And how do you feel when you visit know, you know, like, um? So if Sam I for me, I am very conscious of of the different aspects of the different things that happen there, the good and the bad life for me. When I go, there it is. It's almost like a pilgrimage. It is kind of like, um, it's kind of like, you know, like some people say, likely my ancestral castle, in whatever less a for me. That's kinda like being pastoral own home. You know, like a locus of of of of of obsessive of connections of some contradictions as well. It's kind of late to me. It really feels like a spiritual kind of Homecoming of sorts. Really really does say how you feel similar. I mean, get class. I definitely feel like it's like a pilgrimage. I feel like he is. Umm Tina. I feel very blessed and honored and privileged to be of person of African descent in though so called new world who can actually claim an mean failure is Laurie. I know that is rare. Um. I know that, you know people sometimes in Lansdale a certain way about the preservation of plantation owners. The whole debate about, you know? Should they be places where people have weddings and should they should be sorting? Will there be focused on the slave owners rather than the people who were enslaved? But to me, it's like I know. Then I, you know, like those people are directly related to me is my thumb like you said, it's not some faraway gone with the worm, or even like my personal work, you know. So when I followed air, my orientation is is more towards the quarters, then sports to how, if that makes sense, you know, I'm thinking about the visa mean the life that I saw end DEF entire lives possible. And so I, you know, I when I go there often like I'd go to the porters, I walk each for foreigners and then just say, thank you in. Oh. Thank you so much. Because I want them to know that they not forgotten that their that their labor was not in vain that. You know the life that they live continue to be a source of inspiration. Bad you know. Yeah. The complicated history know mom like the. It's funny. You say you claimed the name Kingsley iron. When people ask me what my relations I say. I must kindling guy because I always feel like I don't wanna leave her out and that he or she was then occasionally she was on too much again. Yeah. And so highly of it is, you know, it's a complicated place. It's also it's like, can we go to Goree island in Senegal. You're struck by like the horrific things that happened here was. The absolute beauty of the place is gorgeous island. And I, I feel kind of the same way about Chamblee is like this meme is such. I mean, like the landing with the water and dark house in the rear open. You know, like is gorgeous and it's a place of. Commemoration is the place you know, like I am. I have the opportunity to the air for the national Parks Conservation Association. So we're really looking at, you know, funding of an assisting the National Park with fundraising in the backlog of maintenance and upkeep death is artistic angle. But like all the basic around the country goes by twelve, twenty billion dollars or something ridiculous. And I'm saying, like, you know, there's these places in America that was old ass, Holy estate written. People talk about New Plymouth, rock or people talk about is island, are they talk about. You know these battlefields or like filler to me, this is my. This is my Palestine. You know, this is the place where my American Americans story. Sorry. This is mine. The place where I link back to find a pioneer in with a with a stickler claimed begin to claim the African on an endless, even like when I bring people here, some people ars at first. They're just quieted like they don't really want to be there. And then they kind like ease into it. Apache people. I feel like I can't breathe. I feel like I can feel them like outfield, present here. Arms been some people who are just like I still saw peaceful year like it's been almost feels wrong. Feel so peaceful here. Knowing what occurred here so on it is also having come there, private family to think that you have insomnia so often or so were so many years to become the rear of the Hausa like. I can go to Cambridge and not think about Mommy or not. Think about previous times that I went there or in a carrier group of students there or you know, had a funny theory. I one time I went with a friend of mine who like a big guy and in the parking lot of a P car came in like attack. The car are any so he's. You know he's a is being consumers' corner. Those assuming most vicious we got, you know, in climbing on top of the car. I mean, just all kind of things that I'd marked by female going to Kingsley, um year. So remove memories as we go along to insulate, those members are moving barrels loaded with my husband is like my resort we made is delivery storied. Where Eddie's our is home and Sonos also are supposed to absolute misery simply uses? Is that is well on. You know the historian. I also take the long view on things and dumb Soviets also, like, for example, anarchism of the definition, Kingsley or the Kingsley story. I really do think that you know. Say it is a difficult thing right now. I'm guys at the moment. I feel that there is a lot of, um, you know the eyes about noise and extremes immediate action, instant things convention. And I feel at late with seven actively will never understand it, unless you go into nuances into radiations into the undertones. You know, um, step back and reflect less. What exactly was? Is a billion stories. The nice. They really are three ways it. You know, what is it about is Billy? You know, indicators of I, Kingsley being some of the his funny olive branch for us, the, you know something. That's very, very important. Is the mayor just gonna conquer, which is the land? That was it stylish there. And though you know, when you think about it as well net fifty nine CFO, fifty nine am so people that were enslaved. Slurs liberated. Hum given lands in a case, Reddit and years of Labour, thus through nine years of of labor. But at the end, they were given their lands. I really do think that an and having study also, you know how doctor Schafer said, and I agree with having studied more and more that there were a lot of them. Abolitionists tendencies lose. If an AI Kingsley. I've been studying a bit the later years. Understanding you know night. He died here in New York City, taking forty four. It was, so, you know, trying to find exactly where he was. He was in a place that was called Franklin Square. It no longer exists because when they built them Brooklyn bridge overpass, it was in the Navy. The whole area was torn down. But he say they're at. I think he was in a hotel or something at the time of the house. A pinch. I don't know. That's where he died, but he was dealing writing practice three with an agent that was that had a free labor store. It really read the time meant Los labor, but also am worried that was not my kids, not by only the whole free labor movement say was like associating with these people. He was. So when I when I sick, when I think about that, I also think about lake, you know how he also was not late, personally prejudiced against core of black people. I think about it from a Latin American perspective says, well, not from the U S American perspective in which we we have lakes own fluidity in terms of identity earn. So late, I think about I. I used to not go into one direction and understands, you know, I need to really balance balance evil judiciously as you said, I, I, that's alright. Let's play a very good. You know where humans are messy. We are. We're not. We're not. We're not consistent or not, you know. So I really think that that's part of my series as well. And eight. When I when I try to like analyze things, I think that one of the things that he can definitely learn from the story of stuff, nine and Jain, in fact, yeah, like to that people are complicated. Life is complicating. Things are not always what they seem. Things are not one trick bag. Yeah. Here is this summer. You know, while everything was going on in the world, even like I'm in a. I'm in Atlanta, where I live out. My house is like within two miles from the Wendy's. That was the site of all of the Omri hard worker uprising. So I'm Lenora, at least in my house, hearing helicopters for two weeks three, and I'm reading that treat it. And I'm reading. That treat is that he Rose to try and purchase seem you know, to try and persuade his counterparts to, you know, open their minds to a possible new economic way of looking at their economic system. At the same time, as I'm watching all of these corporations and companies come to term and comes the graph with the, you know, lack Rs. You know the lack of diversity, equity, inclusion, no acknowledgement of my contributions and and creative like film, just like all of these things that are making parallels from the past to now. I know for myself. I feel like I have, um, grown in my compassion for possessing. I am an end for Anna, because at first it was just very easy to just look at like just the sort of the timeline in the back and just like, oh, get a forty old man Murray, thirteen or Pearl, you know, protein was warlord. I never saw the lower system on this very outgoing or my perspective, arguably, does I looked at it like in there. I learned, and I understand in the flesh foods of young people. I say like, oh, it was. She was his wife was like, okay, partner else. Does she have a lot of option? I think you know being oriented as a woman as a person of African descent. Mine. Paul was always to her and to understand her story and look at her and even having to grapple with the fact that she was, she has a formerly enslaved people person who then on play. But for me for a long time, just to be honest. He he lived in. My memory is despite owning like, you know, the creepy guy, who, ah. So who started this thing on with this girl who was a girl nine? And then I started to look, you know, like, what would it have taken once he tried to persuade is. Counterparts in a white land, owning other voting man to to go his way. And he failed and realizing that his all his wealth and all his land in on all the things that either your sacrifice or even though they were coming from, you know, the split of other people, brow that he would not be able to to leave them to his guns. So he knows that there is a, um, a settlement in in the Dominican is because he realized that he wanted is for the preservation of his family rojo boost the mood act. Two makes him an even your best that bike he something a little of what you know in. Oh yeah. So looking at him from that perspective, looking at him, I did. You know, this is the way that the world was looking living inside of this economy. He's living inside of this way of doing business. This is the way of the world. And then he has these relationships. These three African women annually have these children, and he's looking for whenever they looking for. You know a place to be a place to be a place to be a place to be with your family. A place to, you know, be the creator of your own reality to to, you know, for failure, destiny. Two so. God help me to like, expand my view of him until to have more compassion for him. Even inside of you know, like when you are like I. You know, I'm a black child of the semi, the pheasant, the back of beautiful people were really claiming their aftermath. It was all about. You know, being having pride and self esteem in your hair. Here is what I vacillate. Are you next door? Which one your hands is why it or even know why is a light skin? Is our info kind of like the question was always like so? Yeah. Why Michael. You're Mercury. When did it start? And so discovering him, an Earth was, like, got an answer. But then the answer just brought more question. Friday I can. I can understand oscillates for me. It was like, oh, I have a black ancestor. You see, come and screw you. It was. I always, I might like I. I think opposite sides of that, but but you know, like, um, late, as I said, like my perspective is as a Latin American prison, and we, you know in that, I. I don't think it was only for the preservation of his family. Because then why would you liberate in a pretty known people there? I do think that. Um. She doesn't remember. He then goes to America in Florida. It was Spanish at the time. Like where black people could own property where freed black people basically had all their rights. Where inflamed my people could consume and their masters, and so did their owners. And whenever the the I held them so that you know, and and for the actors are replete with with who is in play people suing, you know, there was like a different idea also in terms of racial mixing, it was absolutely a completely different idea and Jenna self again. I would never condone I. I I do not share this period of enslaving anyone. Hello. But I'm just saying that at the same time then comes. The Ameri can system which is very binary, which is which does not allow. You're a, you know, a free pie. You not nigger on new lines, nature now museums. And that's what I mean when the and when he tried to convince people to to sort it maintain more into the Spanish system. And he was rejected, and he saw the, you know, the American way, honey, he knew. And this is a direct threat to my family my way of life. My we. I know we can't stay here. Yeah. Um yeah, that's the only reason or that name. Close? Knowledge and action must have mean that is it can't be overlooked. So no, absolutely not. No no, no. Absolutely not. But yeah, I. You know her fur in see room from a lot of different perspectives at the same time in that. You know, I just view. I do think that he was in a process of both over an emancipated. And am dismayed. I think that you have to fail at the end that you know he was doing something bad. In order to like later on be able to, he is fifty nine individuals and their families who were given London. And I I really do believe that that's where it would it would have been headed eventually. I really do think so. Um. I also think that on foot late again. It's it's not defensible at all, you know. But he finally went at slavery as an economic system that a racial one and an economy would make sense because he. He traveled all around the world at the time. And you can see this is not what about autism. But as you can see in Africa, the societies also were holding slaves. Yes. There are differences in terms of like the treatment of slaves in their status. That is true. Fidelity. Everybody had the Arab slave trade, and the trend for heroin was arguably still going on are meeting play South of Hebron. My people Africans are being enslaved today in Mali, in Sudan by you know my by populations of the north. There's no doubt about that silly. You know, those illnesses is very complex. Ah. Yelped. And but I feel that you know at someone that has ancestry from both sides, I can I have this. You know the possibility of analyzing things from two sides. I really really do. I think that you know we are get on even if you're not directly related to the story. Eating beans so many on. The economy's hansbrough contradict you, but also just nuances like it's so much easier more nuanced than the typical way that we are taught to view that period of time or that period of time in our history. And it's relationship to today, yea, or what those sort of typical hear what you learned, basically, there was no typical way that of was Bron or that people were enslaved or that you know you're on. And so just when you may think that, you know, like I know it for myself in the African American community lot of times, people have this old debate or discussion like, why are they still making plays movie. You know, I don't want to see the dramatic images I don't wanna hear. And I'm link, though you really think that you learn everything there is to learn about the thing that was like so in crucial in his adult life to me, like maybe there's. They should be told in a different way or in a more nuanced fashion was just they like enough of that. All genre, we just funny way. I look at it unlike your your your your are Jewish community really, really Greece. Oh Subaru. So I feel like we have hit upon the vast majority of the question without necessarily like going through the list of the question. Um. So you know, like one of the questions were what are your feelings being distant from both? Ah those enslaved people and those who owns a young son office ending us when ad about that. No. I mean, like rivets are a gym were contradictions and a new hit upon it too late in the same like animals animosity. He also was a slave owner is something that she would have grown up with homes for her was not a racial thing thing as well. You know. So this is like it is really, it's own. If Lou contradictions, and and there, that's where the beauty lies in reality, I believe fleas. So I think I can already emphasized, do a move on from now and then and I think you pretty much dead lift of being a Kingsley mean to you. Yeah. I think I reduces lose by religious than one person. You know, better job so for me, I don't. I feel like it expanded my view. Our knowledge of what what family mean you know? Yeah. Um like I wasn't expecting to like I was. I came to Kingsley after I guess you know, you interned in, and I think the heretic was really more about. Gathering defendant. I came. I was already more about just celebrating the history of northeast corridor. Hum and loose change one night when the states over override. Because when I first went there and you have mentioned before you, I was at peak hour span, and there was beer. It was like, and is the chair where he sat down and all that. And then I feel like once the park service took over them. More voices started being heard homes, and then the descendants came around in. Our story, was included to making a bit more like of living space. So I I. I agree with that. And I've seen that changes will really physical such vandalism than that. I was like, oh, know this. This wasn't a peacock mantis was a living he caught on. I know I know gay anymore. They used app. Hi. I missed that whole thanks. I think the first time I ever went to England is probably ninety nine ones. Ninety nine missing so many stories and mix them all up. Yeah. I thought about that, you know, like when used to go there back the M when it was like a states, the Florida. I really don't know what it's called like. These toys are similar similar Florida State park. I never win. I now I went there then when it was transitioning sign painted on national territories, and there was a, and so it was more like this is how this the owners lived, right. So that's difficult with other species is actually, you know, select, you would go there anyway. Seeley and this year was different eyes, and this one was from the other family. It was like furnished as a living. How bad the peak? I fainted when they told the story of the hashing was standing, and now it was like on the on the on top of the Amazon on the ceiling of the dining room. Then there was a peak of man, and then the lady was selling necessarily associate. The place was like, yeah, Forza fan, and it was I a peak. I find a cigar centers, and I, it's only made us there's a solution is moving. I answered, and just like as they image, not enlighten create. Yeah I. I'm grateful that we've come a long way from that. I first came to King. Pleased with the it was Roger Castor was a National Park by my most residents her. And I think that that's just part of the beauty. Is that you know the National Park system include, you know, places reaching go and experience The Majesty of nature? Anybody Yosemite in the Grand Canyon? But you can also go to Stonewall you can also go to Kinsley can also go. You do in a hurry, home and death like so. Here now and there he is looking at how do the fan the system and how it tells be American story like there is not one on. So the last question I think it's on hit onto is that on you're are. Our family includes later by a black ass, best American and African as wide as European arm. And what are your thoughts about? Identity will again come from a Spanish and Latin American viewpoint is our superiors home. So situational, it is very humorous. View us me. How you identify Schrader, either identify as Hispanic whites and Hispanics. Um oh, that whole Hispanic, um. Qualifier is a comfortable saying, because it's kind of allows you to understand, okay. Yeah. My. I'm overwhelmingly European. I went to isolate the DNA, and it turns out I'm like seven percent African and it could be anything from. And then there were suggestions, but it could be anything like less than three points level seven and three points more than a, you know, depend on the algorithm and love it. Just give you a general idea of of of you where you stand and so late when you are Hispanic and white. And you understand is, is, it's a very different thing, because it means that we are very well aware of how their backgrounds. And it's something that I think more and more like you know in the United States is happening written on more armed, less people largest lake, embracing more aspects of their identity rather than just Geno relationship. You know, this dichotomy, Holmes. My idea that I mean, you know, like taking all of those aspects into consideration. I'm very aware and speak about on the stereo of Anna all the time. Really? I'm. I'm very proud of of data on both sides of the family. Um. I think it's really cool. Though that you have been able to go go to Senegal in an index analyze that actually does more. I lived in London. I. I actually was able to go to the literature. Say Marylebone, London, where surprisingly, senior marry a housewife, and so that was a really interesting thing. I've been also. I suppose there is more your arguments or evidence on that site is. It's a bit easier in that sense to be able to. Ah. I recently also am studying like the young, the loyalist aspect of different items. The senior you know. He was in in South Carolina. They arrived before the revolution. On doomed where by the way, which is also like an interesting thing, because I am an immigrant from the Dominican Republic? Hear the same time I guess is, you know proudly say that, you know, like my family arrived in this country before the revolution you can from Nikki assets. I think that's pretty cool. You know, ends life when you're into the air. It's interesting when people both like Italy of the U S is part of my ancestral plays rather than an stayed in the S and is by. So I am still a I recently I've done. I've been working on documenting everything from me. The ass, every generation for me in my mom's in mind, you know, like through all kinds of documents, haven't been easy and so on. I got ah. This is a United Empire Loyalists Association certificate certified you menacingly as provided a documentary evidence. In the central different accusing was a United Empire Loyalists and so on. You know, she sent for me again. Your life you can use do so many sides to the story that you can just feel crowded and and really just going to our family was basically this means is that this man's economic, usually senior really during the revolution stayed loyal to to to what he as his country, which was a Great Britain to the crown was able to, you know, C he was, she suffered a great deal. He lost a lot of his properties. He was imprisoned three times and went to Canada. And you know like these people basically started English. Speaking Canada like when people say Canada's awesomely and I don't have a pretty siphoning silly. They you know how you become law still in there. One is because these Americans went there the loyal the young United Empire Loyalists, and they basically started English speaking Canada and ask myself. Americans U S American history, Canada. So although these stories are are are super interesting, and I love the human, I love them. I mean, I think that guy dream is the name of the posting again. I think that you know we have on. We have this common link, and we also sometimes divergent approaches. You know where we're coming from is very afraid of iffy. And we each can see something that speaks to us in cost to us in this story and go. I mean like Dan is, that is the beauty of it on. And we can see the ways in which knowing this story have impacted an enriched. And sometimes complicated enough, both of our lie and says, does our philosophy. The thing like Pearl salubrious, those eyes remind us exactly. So it's been a great pain pleasure to speak with you again. Cutler. Yeah. We would buy me a lot with three. Maybe some day and I am not Bara, hopefully. Massless future, we can all go back to kingly and Musa Red army southern in one I enjoy. Oh yes. I would love that. Gather under the terms, so we are over time, and I'm thankful to. Fossil fuels is charged, dabbled in keep in touch. And I hope that from now on our is taking something from this. In addition to largest economies to be able to talk reconsider years and ended big Rangers well to the National Park Service does a really good care of gender translation. Peri Francis and Emanuel. Thank you so much for joining us today or virtual occasionally hears in celebration and for sharing your stories and thank you to visitors for listening for more information, you can visit us at and TS. Dot Gov flash. I am you or you can come on out to Kingsley plantation. We are open right now. Wednesday through Sunday from nine am to five pm.",

There was grass for the livestock, water for the men and animals, and open terrain were he could engage any enemies. After more than three weeks of clearing a road through thick forest, he decided to make camp here and wait for expected reinforcements. He set up his camp in the “vee” between the two streams that joined in the meadow. The stream banks provided some natural defenses from which his men could fire if the need arose. Despite the ground being marshy in spots, Washington described the area as “a charming field for an encounter” The road Washington cleared skirts the meadow to the south. It was improved the following summer (1755), by General Braddock, and became known as the Braddock Road. You can hike portions of the Braddock Road Trace on the park trail system. Continuing on one of the trails about 150 yards beyond the fort will bring you to the Braddock Trace. Beyond that, there is about five miles of hiking trails through the park.",

And maintain that bright line, because if you don’t, you’re going to create problems. Those things aren’t particularly any different than anything, I mean, I would have said that forty years ago. <br><br> So, in today’s world, I think that probably there’s a little more awareness. You know, when I started with the Park Service, my parents’ generation, you know, the man went to work, the woman was a housewife. Stayed home with the kids. Took care of the home. Raised the family. We haven’t seen that in a generation now. So I think there’s recognition of the need for dual careers, hopefully. So I think that’s a positive thing.",

Its wide staircase led to an upper level which was supported by heavy pine beams, hauled from the heights of the Santa Rita Mountains. The large beams were, in turn, supported by two thick adobe piers. On the right side of the doorway are depressions where large clay jars filled with seed and grain were stored for next season’s crops. The storeroom’s surpluses and deficits were the measure of success or failure of the mission. A well-stocked storeroom allowed the purchase of clothing or other resources. Empty shelves signaled stress. The storeroom also embodied the community’s new European-style corporate hierarchy and contrasted with the O’odham’s consensus-based government. Harvested food would be collected here and then distributed on a weekly basis. However, the gatekeeper to the storeroom could withhold access, making food contingent on following the mission’s rules.",

            "transcript": "Park Postcards Podcast Episode Four Crissy Field Transcript Introduction : Ranger Mariajose Welcome to a new podcast from Golden Gate National Recreation Area called “Park Postcards.” Each episode will introduce you to what makes each park site unique, through the voice of community members who have visited, and our park rangers who work there. We aim to highlight the work we do to connect our local community groups to the special places in our park, and what these places and experiences mean to them. We hope that through listening to these “audio postcards”, you get excited to visit Golden Gate National Recreation Area in a healthy and safe future! You’re tuned in to our fourth episode and second special Spanish language Park Postcards Podcast. This is Ranger Mariajose with you again. The beauty of our outreach work is collaborating with diverse community members and newcomers to introduce them and welcome them to their National Parks. This episode I have the pleasure of introducing you to one of our greatest community leaders who has connected families to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and our team for over a decade! Matilde Tellez, a community program manager at Good Samaritan of San Francisco and CARECEN, San Francisco’s Central American Resource Center. Let’s hear one of Matilde’s favorite park memories, an evening harvest program with Ranger Fatima in the Fall of 2019. Community member Matilde Tellez: Hola mi nombre es Matilde Tellez, promotora comunitaria y en esta actuación les voy a hablar de crissy field. Ranger Mariajose: Matilde has shared her audio postcard with us in Spanish but we’ve added a bit of podcast magic and have translated it too. Let’s hear from my mom Ana Cristina, who has voiced Matilde’s translation. Take it away mom! Interpreter – Ana Cristina Alcantara voicing Matilde Tellez in English: Hello, my name is Matilde Tellez, community promoter, and in this audio I am going to talk to you about Crissy Field. Crissy field has a community resource center where there are various activities, such as resource fairs and events. One of those events was the harvest night hike to give thanks for the end of the harvest. We want to thank the rangers and all the staff in advance, as they make it possible for Latino families to come to the center, and they provide us with transportation and different activities. I have taken families from the Central American Family Resource Center and the Latinos Independientes group from the Good Samaritan, and one of those Crissy Field activities we attended was the walk I mentioned. Upon arrival we carried out an art activity where adults and children participated and had a lot of fun. Another of the activities was the walk where they gave us little solar lamps, since it was getting dark. We could see the sun setting on the sea. The day was something very special, very magical. The children were delighted with their lamps and we love that they take it into account that some people can walk fast, others moderately fast and others slower and we appreciated that. At the end of our walk they gave us a small dinner with food that the first people prepared to celebrate the end of the harvest. It was something very special. Since Fatima has the ability to tell us stories, we paid great attention. Apart from those stories, she taught us this song that goes like this: Matilde Tellez Sings in Spanish: Lunes y Martes Miercoles 3 Jueves Viernes Sábado 6 y domingo 7. Ana Cristina sings in English: Again: Monday and Tuesday Wednesday is 3 Thursday and Friday Saturday 6 and Sunday 7. Matilde Tellez closes in Spanish: De nuevo nuestro agradecimiento para todo el personal de guardabosques, todo el personal que atiende Crissy Field y gracias por mandarnos el transporte para poder acudir a las actividades. Ana Cristina in English: Once again we give our thanks to all the ranger staff, all the Crissy Field Center staff, and thanks for sending us the transportation to be able to attend the activities. Ranger Mariajose: “Thanks for the translation Mom!” Ana Cristina: “De nada! Con mucho gusto, you’re welcome it’s my pleasure.” Ranger Mariajose – Transition : Wow! What a great experience Matilde! I can imagine how magical that Harvest Night Hike must have been! Oh Crissy Field, the picturesque lively stretch of land that welcomes thousands maybe millions of visitors every year to San Francisco’s iconic Golden Gate Bridge, Palace of Fine Arts, and Fort Point. People love a casual stroll, a bike ride, flying a kite. Even furry friends and wildlife enjoy rolling around the grass, sands and chilly salty waters. Up next is our own Ranger Fatima Colindres who will share the rich natural and cultural history of the place that she’s had the joy to work at since 1998! Ranger Fatima Colindres - Crissy Field Interpretive history: Hello podcast listeners, my name is Fatima Colindres. I am a park ranger with the Community Outreach team at Golden Gate National Recreation Area. I love working at this park because I get to bring community groups out to one of my favorite park sites, Crissy Field, and share the story of the dramatic transformation of this place through the years. Crissy Field has gone through many transformations through time. In the time when all of San Francisco was Ohlone land, Crissy Field was a huge marsh, connected to other marsh land which circled the entire San Francisco Bay. The area now known as Crissy Field was a rich, and ecologically diverse wetland. Early Spanish conquerors wrote in their journals that there were so many bird species, that if there was a loud noise, like a gunshot, the whole sky would turn dark with birds taking flight. They also named the area ‘La Isla de Las Fresas” or “Strawberry Island,” because the land was covered with beach strawberry. For 70 years after the Spanish/Mexican arrival, the area continued to be a marsh until the Gold Rush, when people moved to this area in huge numbers, and the landscape changed dramatically. It went from a bird haven on the Pacific Flyway, to one of the first garbage dumps of the city of San Francisco. The new Americans did not see the marsh as a treasure, a natural protector for our city and Bay. They did not understand that this marsh provided vital habitat to so many birds, plants, and even humans. They did not realize back then that the marsh would help prevent flooding and would serve as a natural filter protecting the Bay’s fish from ingesting contaminants carried in run off after heavy rains. Instead they saw the area as a wasteland, to be filled in. The army did not have the funds to fill in the marsh as fast as they would wish, but with the help of the city, the marsh was finally filled in with the city trash left over from the 1906 earthquake, just in time for the construction of 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition world’s Fair. As you can imagine, it was a grand event, to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal, and to show the world that the City by the Bay had been able to recover after the devastating earthquake and fire. There was an airfield and a racetrack built to showcase new technological advances in travel. The fairgrounds included rides and pavilions and palaces dedicated to everything from art, science and culture. Only one building remains from that event, the Palace of Fine Arts. After the 1915 Exposition ended, the Army took back the area and maintained it as an airfield until 1937. During those early years of aviation, the area was christened as “Crissy Field,” in honor of one of those early pioneers of flight, Major Dana H. Crissy. In 1937, after the Golden Gate Bridge was completed, the airfield was no longer a safe place to land and take off, because of the large obstacle in its path. So, it transformed again, this time to a helicopter landing area. Eventually the area became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972. Thanks to a partnership between the National Park Service, and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the area was transformed once again by 2001. During the 4-year restoration project, over 80 tons of waste were removed from the marsh, the original racetrack-shaped grassy airfield was restored, and a small portion of the marsh was brought back signaling to birds that it was safe to return. With the help of thousands of volunteers that came to “help grow Crissy Field,” the native plants came back too. Since Crissy Field has been restored, it has become a beloved spot for recreation on the San Francisco shoreline. Since I started working at the park 20 years ago, it has been my pleasure to bring countless groups out to their national park, to experience this unique place. I love seeing visitors play on the sand, go bird watching, or snap the most amazing photos of the iconic Bridge. I also love to share the natural and cultural stories of this place through my interpretive programs. Before it’s time to say goodbye, I remind visitors that we need their help to keep the marsh healthy and clean by recycling, reducing, reusing and composting, to ensure their trash doesn’t end up in the marsh ever again. I hope this episode has sparked your curiosity to visit Crissy Field. And when you do, we encourage you to bring and wear your facemask, and keep proper physical distance from others. Stroll the Promenade, explore the boardwalks over the marsh, look for signs describing the native plants and learn their medicinal uses, but please don’t pick them! Together let’s make sure this place remains for all to enjoy. Bye Bye!

            "transcript": "DESCRIBING: A lithograph showing Fort Vancouver and Vancouver Barracks in 1855. SYNOPSIS: A 19th century lithograph that shows a scene of Fort Vancouver, the Columbia River, and Vancouver Barracks in shades of green, brown, and blue. The viewer is facing east. On the far right side of the image is the Columbia River looking upstream towards Mt. Hood. The river and Mt. Hood are labeled. On the north bank of the river is Fort Vancouver, surrounded by gardens and orchards. In the foreground are earthen paths and small one-room cabins. A road runs east to west through the middle of the image. On the north side of the road are labeled areas showing the St. James Mission, fields and orchards of St. James Mission, and the US Army post. IN-DEPTH DESCRIPTION: Fort Vancouver, located on the north bank of the Columbia River, consists of several buildings enclosed within a rectangular wooden stockade. A towering bastion stands in the northwest corner of the fort. The fort is labeled with the words \"Hudson's Bay Company fort.\" To the east of the fort are orchards; to the north of the fort's stockade wall is a large garden surrounded by a wooden fence. In the foreground on the right side of the image, east of the fort, are three log cabins. An earthen path winds from the far right corner of the image towards a large earthen road that runs east to west north of the fort. On this curved section of path, six horses pull a wooden cart carrying four large barrels. Figures of four people can be seen walking this path. On the main east to west road is a cart carrying a person with a hat and a whip, pulled by two oxen. North of the east-west road that divides the lithograph image in half, in the foreground of the image, is a two-story white building with a gabled roof topped by a cross. This building is labeled \"Church, St. James Mission.\" North and east of the church are fenced areas with small buildings. In the foreground east of the church are a collection of trees labeled \"Fields and orchards of St. James Mission.\" North of the east-west road is a sloping hill that leads to an upper terrace. About eleven buildings, single and two-story, are located on this grassy slope. In the foreground on this slope is a semi-circle-shaped area that appears to be overgrown, contains some cross-shaped grave markers, and surrounded by a fence. On this slope, on the left-most edge of the lithograph, is a small building inside a stockade wall that resembles a smaller version of the wooden stockade that surrounds Fort Vancouver. At the top of the terrace to the north, on the right side of the image, is a row of white military buildings with gabled and hipped roofs. In front of this row of buildings is an enormous flagpole topped by a waving American flag. A row of cannons sits beyond the flagpole, just at the point where the terrace begins to slope. The cannons are aimed down the hill, facing south towards the British Fort Vancouver. This area is labeled with the text \"US Army post.\" Behind this row of buildings is a heavily forested area, thick with evergreen trees. In the far distance are rolling hills leading to the Columbia River Gorge and Mt. Hood, a dormant volcano that comes to a sharp peak and is covered by a cap of snow. CREDIT: NPS / FOVA RELATED TEXT: In 1855, artist Gustavus Sohon visited Fort Vancouver. His illustration shows a community shifting from a fur trading fort to a military post. A Catholic mission occupies the lower left of the scene.",

I’m Josh Bell, a park ranger with the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. Could I have you say your name for the record, sir? Dwight Smith: Dwight A. Smith. Joshua Bell: All right Mr. Smith. And it’s okay that record this conversation today? Dwight Smith: It is. Joshua Bell: Excellent. When and where were you born, sir? Dwight Smith: Baltimore, Maryland, January 16, 1925. Joshua Bell: And what were your parents’ names? Dwight Smith: [00:00:35] Captain Dwight Smith, and Beatrice Wilson Smith. Joshua Bell: And what did they do? Dwight Smith: My father was a merchant seaman, captain of ships, and my mother was a housekeeper, I mean, a stay-at-home mom. Joshua Bell: A stay-at-home mom. Dwight Smith: Yeah. Joshua Bell: Did you have any siblings? Dwight Smith: Yes, one sister. Joshua Bell: One sister. And you grew up there in Maryland? Dwight Smith: No. At the age of three, my father’s home port was changed from Baltimore, Maryland to Brooklyn, New York. So, from my age four right through sophomore year of high school, I lived in Brooklyn, New York. Joshua Bell: What was it like growing up in the ‘20s and ‘30s? Dwight Smith: Well, I survived it okay. On the question, my father never missed a trip on this…with his ship, and we were comfortable during the Depression. Joshua Bell: What was it like having him gone so often? Dwight Smith: Not good at all. I really didn’t have a father. He’d be gone for two months at a time, home for a week, and off again. Never at home for Christmas, or birthdays, or any of those things. Joshua Bell: Oh, Jeez. How did your mom manage? Dwight Smith: First of all, her mother lived with her. My grandmother lived with her until my grandmother passed away when I was 11. And she was a big help to help bringing up the kids and keeping my mother on an even keel. It wasn’t easy. Joshua Bell: Oh, go ahead. Dwight Smith: Let me tell you an incident. When I was discharged from the Navy, I said to my lady friend, “I may go back to sea.” And she said, “The sea or me.” And we were later married, and stayed married for 62 years. Joshua Bell: That’s fantastic. Dwight Smith: Yeah. Joshua Bell: So, as a kid, how did you like living in New York? Dwight Smith: Let me say that I liked it better, because every summer we went to our small house we had in the little village of Groton, Vermont. G-R-O-T-O-N, Vermont. So that was our summer home, and as soon as school let out in Brooklyn, we loaded up the car and headed north, and I spent the summer in Vermont, and then returned to Brooklyn around Labor Day. Joshua Bell: And where did you go to school? Dwight Smith: Public school in Brooklyn, New York. P.S. 97, Seth Low Junior High School, New Utreckth and Lafayette High School. And then, for my junior and senior year, I went to an out-of-state boarding school, Mount Hermon School in Mount Hermon, Massachusetts. Joshua Bell: What’s the highest grade you completed? Dwight Smith: I’m a college graduate. Joshua Bell: Where’d you go to college? Dwight Smith: Wait a minute. Two years to Green Mountain Junior College in Vermont, and two years… Well, anyway, two years in Dartmouth College. I got my diploma from Dartmouth College in February of 1947. Joshua Bell: Excellent. So, when were you in college, what years? Dwight Smith: I graduated from Mount Hermon in June of 1941. And I graduated from Green Mountain College in May of 1943. And my first two semesters at Dartmouth College were through the Navy V-12 College Training Program. And my final two semesters at Dartmouth College were after the war, so it was 1946-47. Joshua Bell: The V-12 Program; is that the Navy equivalent to the Army Specialized Training Program? Dwight Smith: Well, it’s the equivalent of B5 in the Air Force. V-12 in the College Training Program, and when you finished your college work, you ordinarily went on to a 90-day wonder school or midshipman school, and I did that. I mean, I went to the 90-day wonder school, but I came down with the German measles after 30 days, and I was hospitalized for a few days, and by the time I returned to the midshipman’s school, it was decided that… I was so far behind, losing a few days, that they decided I ought to go back into the regular part of the Navy as a seaman first class. Joshua Bell: Sure. When you were in high school, do you remember hearing about what was going on in Europe and in Asia? Dwight Smith: Well, I was in high school when December 7, 1941. Joshua Bell: And what was the general reaction to that? Dwight Smith: The whole nation went to war. I mean, the whole nation. It was everybody was immersed in World War II in some way, you know. My parents, my father was sailing still between West Africa and New York. And my mother, you know, had rations; butter, and meat, and whatever. Your tires; you couldn’t buy new tires for your cars. And, in fact, you couldn’t buy a new car. We all survived it. We all got behind the war effort, everyone. Joshua Bell: What do you remember thinking about the attack at Pearl Harbor? Dwight Smith: Oh, I remember thinking it was a terrible thing, and I went right back to… Let’s see, I was just 16, so I went back to Green Mount College, and after two years of… This is the junior college, two-year college, and as the time went by, more and more of our male students were either called up to service, or volunteered to go into the service. By the time I graduated in May of 1943, I was one of only four or five males left in the student body. Joshua Bell: What was that experience like? Dwight Smith: Well, it was pretty sad, seeing the guys going off to war. And, yes, it was, kind of, sad. Joshua Bell: Did the professors have any reaction to that? Dwight Smith: Yeah, some of them were drafted. Joshua Bell: Some of them were drafted. Dwight Smith: Yeah, because they were young enough to be drafted. Joshua Bell: What was your course of study? Dwight Smith: I majored in… what does my diploma say… Business Administration. Joshua Bell: Business Admin. Okay. Dwight Smith: Yeah. And, when I graduated, I was one of the few of the males left to graduate. In the following year, the school went 100% female. I was the final male student until a number of years later, they went back to both males and females. Joshua Bell: You must have… Dwight Smith: They’ve gone to… Joshua Bell: Oh, go ahead. Dwight Smith: They’ve gone to a four-year school, now, Green Mountain College has. When I went, it was a junior college –– two years. Joshua Bell: So, your dad was going back and forth to Africa at this time? Dwight Smith: Yes, his… He worked for a steamship company called the American West African Line, and his home port was pier 36 in Brooklyn, New York, Atlantic Basin. And, he sailed from there to the… Starting at the Azores and the Canary Islands, working down the coast of West Africa to the Belgian Congo, at that time, the Belgian Congo. And it was, you know, general cargo, and off-loading, and sometimes they have piers to tie up to and unload, but other times, he had to anchor well off shore, and they would come out in wooden carved canoes and pick up the cargo and row ashore with it. It was quite primitive, the ports he called on. Joshua Bell: There must… Was there any concern about German U-boats attacking? Dwight Smith: Let me tell you. In October of 1942, a German U-boat sank my father’s ship. Joshua Bell: Oh, dear. Dwight Smith: Oh, dear, yes. He survived the sinking, and he was the last one off the ship, and he got into a life boat, the capacity, written capacity of 24 people, but 34 men and one woman in his life boat. Joshua Bell: How long were they at sea? Dwight Smith: Ten days. They were not picked up. He navigated to Barbados Island. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: It took ten days to get there. He carried a sextant and a compass in a waterproof bag, with the chain around his neck, when he went over. And that enabled him, along with his knowledge of seafaring, he was able to navigate that life boat to Barbados Island. They were never picked up. He just hit the island. Wow. Joshua Bell: I can’t imagine you and your mother’s reaction to that, once you found out. Dwight Smith: Well, that was another big problem. This was October of 1942. Joshua Bell: Right. Dwight Smith: My mother and I didn’t know if he was dead or alive. And he wasn’t able to tell my mother that he was alive until December of ’42. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: I mean, he was on this British-held island, but… They just answered everything. You couldn’t send a message to home. Terrible. My mother did not know if he was dead or alive. Joshua Bell: But she knew the ship had gone down. Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. No. I’m not sure she knew that it went down. Yes. Because another… Somebody else got ashore sooner and told my mother that the ship went down. He didn’t know what happened to the Captain. Pretty sad. Now, again… Then I was out in the South Pacific in ’43; this was ’42, and my mother went through hell between her husband and her only son. Joshua Bell: So, what led you to choose the Navy? Dwight Smith: I was drafted. At Draft Board #1 in St. Johnsbury, Vermont said, “We have a choice today; you can choose the Navy, Marine Corp., Army, or Coast Guard.” And being as my father was a sea captain, I raised my hand for the Navy. Joshua Bell: So, it runs in the family. Dwight Smith: I guess so. No. My father ran away from home. He was a minister’s son. He ran away from home at the age of 16, and went to sea. What a story. And he was in the Navy in World War I as a lieutenant. Joshua Bell: He was? Dwight Smith: After sailing… He graduated from nautical school in 1907, New York Maritime Academy. And he was a graduate out of nautical school. His first berth was on a lighthouse-keeping ship on the East Coast, was headed for the Philippines, because we had just stole the Philippines from the Spanish, and so it was now our…our necessity to take care of sea in the Philippines Islands, so… It’s, like, the light ship keeping ship was shipped out to the Philippines, and by way of Cape… What’s the… Cape… Cape of South America. Joshua Bell: Oh, yes. Dwight Smith: The Panama Canal had not been built, and he was a junior officer on that ship. And once they reached Manilla, he stayed in the middle of the Philippines until World War II. I mean, World War I. He sailed on British-owned ships out of Manilla up to Indo-China, Japan, China. You name it, in the Pacific. [Unintelligible 00:13:37] islands. He worked his way up to finally becoming a first officer, and then later a captain. And then, when the British went into war in World War I, these ships that he was sailing on out of Manilla, were part of the British Admiralty, see. You know, they took over these cargo ships as British Navy. And, when the United States heard about him being out in the Philippines and working for the British, they brought him home to the United States and made him a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. And they stationed him at a desk job in Wales, which is the last thing he wanted. When he got out of World War I, he went back to sea as a merchant skipper, merchant ships, cargo ships. And he sailed around the world [unintelligible 00:14:38] of Europe and back and [unintelligible 00:14:40], and then he finally landed this job with the American West African Line around 1928, I think. He was torpedoed in 1942, and then he got a shore job. Joshua Bell: Then he was home? Dwight Smith: Yes. Yes, but he moved from Brooklyn, New York to New Orleans, Louisiana, because of his shore job. He was a surveyor for the insurance underwriters who… He inspected cargoes of ships before they sailed out of the United States, to make sure they were properly stowed, or not overweight, or whatever else. He’d give them assurance, the underwriters wanted to know about. So he was an official inspector, and he’d go aboard these ships and inspect the cargoes. And he really enjoyed it, because he got to meet a lot of old friends… Of course, you know, with fellow sea captains. Joshua Bell: I’m sure your mother was pleased with this development. Dwight Smith: Oh, yes indeed. I will say, though, that when he was transferred to New Orleans, my mother didn’t like summer in New Orleans, so she went back to Vermont to spend the summer in our home in Groton, Vermont. And then he’d come up when he had a vacation. Joshua Bell: Were you able to ? When did he get home after being torpedoed? Dwight Smith: December of 1942. Joshua Bell: It was December of ’42? And I’m sure there must have been a welcome home party? Dwight Smith: I forget the details. I do remember he came home alive. What my mother went through in World War II, with my father out there in the Atlantic, and me in the South Pacific in the following year, 1943. It wasn’t easy for her. Joshua Bell: Oh, not at all. Dwight Smith: That’s when my lady friend said, “The sea or me.” Because she knew what my mother went through. Joshua Bell: Oh, yes. Dwight Smith: So, I went into the railroad business two days after she said, “The sea or me.” Joshua Bell: You said you signed up in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Dwight Smith: Yeah. I was drafted then, and the Draft Board #1 in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, because that’s the county seat for our summer home in Groton, Vermont. Joshua Bell: For Caledonia County. Dwight Smith: Yes. I got my driver’s license and things when I was already in the Navy. Joshua Bell: Yeah. What was that day like? Dwight Smith: What about that? Joshua Bell: What was that day like? The draft board? Dwight Smith: Kind of scary. I didn’t know what I was going to be, but when they said I had an option to the four branches of the service, I said, quickly, I said, “Navy.” I wanted no part of… I wanted to have a roof over my head and three square meals a day. And you get that on a ship, and you don’t get that when you’re in the Army. Joshua Bell: That’s right. How did your dad and mom react to you getting drafted? Dwight Smith: Well, they just accepted it, because we were at war. I came home from boot camp, ten days leave. I went up to Groton, Vermont. My parents were up there, and my grandfather was still alive. He lived up there, my father’s father. And, I came home in my full uniform, and I went to see them, and they were quite pleased with that. Once I got back to report back after my leave from boot camp, I thought, you know, they’re going to send me to a technical school of some kind, or some kind of a… No. They sent me right down Norfolk, Virginia, and said, “Get aboard this U.S.S. South Dakota battleship –– We need you.” Right out of boot camp. Wow. Joshua Bell: How did you feel about that? Dwight Smith: Scared to death. They put me on this ship in Norfolk, Virginia, and it was in dry-dock. It had just come down from the North Atlantic. It was working with the British fleet, protecting the freighters headed for Murmansk. Murmansk, Russia, which is above the… It’s way, way, way up north. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: One tip of Norway and around into Murmansk. And the battleship South Dakota worked with the British fleet, protecting loose convoys, and also trying to entice German battleships, which were in the fjords in Norway, to come out and get shot. They stayed put. They did not come out. Joshua Bell: How many ships would go in your convoy? Dwight Smith: I have no idea. See, this was… I was in the Navy when the South Dakota was heading up. Joshua Bell: Oh, that’s right. That’s right. I wanted to ask –– What was basic training like? Dwight Smith: Boot camp? Oh, like Hell. I never knew how to fold sheets or make a bed, or I didn’t like to get up at 6:00 o’clock in the morning. I did not like boot camp. Joshua Bell: What do you remember about your superior officers? Dwight Smith: Well, they were usually not commissioned officers. They were chiefs, chief’s petty officers that were, you know, leading us, and they were very strict and very rough on us. I guess I was a mama’s boy, and there I was at the age of… How old was I? Eighteen. I had just turned 18, and I didn’t like boot camp. No. Joshua Bell: Did you make any friends while you were there? Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yep. But I’ve lost some over the years. Joshua Bell: Did any of them go with you to the South Dakota? Dwight Smith: Yeah. Two or three of them. Joshua Bell: Two or three of them? Dwight Smith: Two or three, actually. Yeah. And we were all lined up on the fantail in the dry-dock, on the ship, being assigned to our divisions. Now, that’s news to me, I didn’t know what divisions were, but they were where they put you to work on the ship. Well, they started calling off your names, and telling you you’re going to division twelve or division six, or you’re going to peel potatoes, or you’re going to be swabbing decks, or chipping paint. Things like that. And then manning a fleet, forty gauged anti-aircraft guns or throwing bags of powder into the 16-inch guns, and things like that. I didn’t really want to do things like that. So, one of the officers made an announcement. He said, “Anybody here have high school math? Raise your hand.” The guys next to me, “Don’t volunteer. Never, never volunteer.” I raised my hand. I got put in the Fire Control Division. Gunfire. Tried to get the bullets to be where that airplane is, at the same time. Joshua Bell: Oh. Dwight Smith: And wind velocity, and every little detail had to be cranked into this system to be accurate when you’re firing these 5-inch, twin 5-inch guns, the ones I was working with. And I was put down into the plotting room, which is in the bowels of the ship. And I had earphones on my head, and a hand crank on a computer down in the bowels of the ship. I’d been getting messages from the people who were working the optics parts of Fire Control Division, you know, the trainers, and whatever, using optics back topside, and following this information tube down to us guys in the bowels, because we had a computer in that portion of the ship. It was all vacuum tubes, hotter than Hell. But, the plotting room and the sick bay were the only two parts of the ship that were air conditioned. And then, when things were quiet, we were allowed to sleep on the floor in the plotting room at night, if you desired, when we’re out of danger. Joshua Bell: And how did you like that job? Dwight Smith: That job was okay, because I was… At sixteen inches of armor plate on both sides of me, you know. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: And, those guys topside with those 48-millimeter anti-aircraft guns, were totally exposed. I could hear the things going on, and I could feel them, but I never saw them. My watch station, I saw everything, because I was just sitting up on top of a twin 5-inch mount, the director, where the optics were. And my job was to sit there and read my manuals so I’d become a better fire control-man, eight hours a day. Joshua Bell: Not a bad gig. Dwight Smith: Yeah, I wish I’d had my camera with me, because sitting up there, and I’m watching… We’re in a task force, Task Force 58, and there’s ships as far as the eye can see. And our primary duty on the South Dakota was to protect those carriers. When the planes start flying over, shoot those planes down. That was our main duty. And our secondary duty was to shore bombard Japanese held islands before the Marines and the Army went ashore. Soften them up with our 16-inch guns. I don’t know how much damage we did, but we sure tried. I guess by the time I got out there in 1943, the Japanese Navy had been pretty well annihilated. There wasn’t much left. So we’re, basically, shore bombardments and anti-aircraft on my ship. We’re also within a sea of cruisers, and destroyers, and aircraft carriers as far as the eye can see. It was amazing. And then every so often, we would pull into an atoll somewhere, and, you know, restore our groceries and put the sick guys, and the guys who were injured onto the hospital ship, and things like that. And we would be able to go ashore, on the beach in these islands, under the palm trees. I must say that the women in those little islands got whiter every time we went ashore. And I didn’t drink beer at that point in my life, and… I do now, but I didn’t then. And, when we went ashore, they gave us a chit for two beers, and I got my chit for the two beers, and once I got ashore, I would auction them off. I did very well. There’s a light side to all this story, you know. There’s a light side to it. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. So… Dwight Smith: You’ve got to be… You’ve got to make it light because, otherwise, you’re going to go nuts. Joshua Bell: Did the South Dakota ever come under fire? Dwight Smith: Yes, but before I was on it, and after I was on it. We were under fire, in that, Kamikaze airplanes tried to sink us. But there was no physical intercourse with other ships, but we were always fighting off these Japanese airplanes. They’d try to drop bombs down our stack, and things like that. Kind of nerve-wracking. Joshua Bell: That must have been especially nerve-wracking because you couldn’t see what was going on. Dwight Smith: You know what was especially nerve-wracking, too? My mother. I mean, think about it. She’s already put up with the German U-boat situation, and there I was out there, her little boy. Joshua Bell: Did you stay in contact with your mom, and your parent…well, your parents? Dwight Smith: Yes. We’d write emails, they called them, I think, or something like that. Victory mails… Joshua Bell: Oh, yeah. The V-mails. Yeah. Dwight Smith: V-mails. Yeah. Oh, yes, we kept in touch. But I couldn’t tell them much about what was happening on the… Joshua Bell: Oh, right. Dwight Smith: …They censored our letters before they were mailed. It was pretty sad. Joshua Bell: So, when you signed up for the Navy, how did you…? Where did you hope to go? Or did you have any aspirations? Dwight Smith: I’d like to have been assigned to a tug boat in New York harbor. Let me tell you, though… Oh. I’m on the South Dakota. I got on there in about July of ’43, I believe, in Norfolk. And, eight or nine months later, I’m walking through the ship, and there’s this little notice on the bulletin board. “The U.S. South Dakota. You have been given a quota of five of your 2,500 passengers, you can send five of them back to the Navy V-12 College Training Program.” Five of that crew, 2,500 men. Again, “Don’t volunteer.” I said, “Yes. I’m going to volunteer.” I raised my hand, and I got a physical exam, and a conversation with an officer, and a written exam. But I failed the physical exam to go back to the Navy V-12 College Training Program. It was down in sick bay, and this young doctor was going through, and he said, “Uh oh, your blood pressure is too low.” And he could see that I was a bit broken up about that. But he said, “I tell you what, son. Go up topside, get out a pack of cigarettes, and start smoking one cigarette after the other, and run up and down the deck, and come back down at 2:00 pm,” which I did, and he said, “You passed. Your blood pressure has increased enough that you can go back.” Joshua Bell: Did it work? Dwight Smith: Did it work? Yes. I was assigned to the Navy V-12 College Training Program, and I went back home as a passenger on an aircraft carrier that was headed to Pearl Harbor. There was something, probably some repairs to make, or something. So, I was a passenger on the U.S.S. Princeton, a big aircraft carrier, and I was a passenger on it. And then, when we got to Pearl Harbor, they had me in a tent on some hillside in Hawaii. And I said, “Well, when am I going to know when I’m going to get from Pearl Harbor back to the States?” They said, “We’ll let you know when we have a vacancy on a ship going back.” And I said, “Well, how will I know when?” They said, “See that pole outside your tent? There’s a loud speaker on it. When we call your name, you better be ready.” So, thus, I never did become a tourist in the Hawaiian Islands, because I sat right by that pole for two or three days. And they sent me back. And I filled out an application for the Navy V-12 College Training Program. And there was three colleges I could apply to. Northwestern in Chicago, Columbia in New York City, and Dartmouth College in rural New Hampshire. Now I’m thinking, first of all, that most of these guys will want to go to New York or Chicago, not rural New Hampshire. So I applied for Dartmouth College, knowing I have a better chance. Not only that, but Dartmouth College was forty miles from our summer home in Groton, Vermont, 40 miles. Joshua Bell: Right. Dwight Smith: Well… Okay. They sent me my orders to go home for 10 days leave. So, I get on a train in Oakland, California, spend five days sitting up at a day coach to Woodsville, New Hampshire, and I finally got home to Groton, Vermont. My orders were –– “After your 10-day leave up there, we want you to come back to San Diego, California for further orders.” Joshua Bell: Oh, Jeez. Dwight Smith: Yes. Oh, Jeez. So back I go on a train and another route to San Diego, five days sitting on the day coach. I’m at this base in San Diego for three or four days. They hand me my orders to go to Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, 40 miles from where I was! I tell you, you’re looking back, you wonder how we won the war. Joshua Bell: So much for logistics. Dwight Smith: Oh, my God, yes. So, I crossed the country three times, by rail, in 30 days. Joshua Bell: Well, hey, that must have been an experience. Dwight Smith: Well, yes, but bear in mind that in my two years and eleven months in the Navy, I crossed the country 10 times. Joshua Bell: Ten times? Dwight Smith: Ten times, coast to coast. Whenever I was on the East Coast, they wanted me on the West Coast. Whenever I was on the West Coast, they wanted me on the East Coast, and I… Ten times. And once I… Not really crossed coast to coast, but I got from Norfolk, Virginia to Oakland, California by way of Panama Canal and the South Pacific. That’s my first coast to coast trip, was from Norfolk to Oakland, California. It took nine months to do the trip, but that’s what the first one was. Joshua Bell: I was going to say, you went the long way around. Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. And then this thing going down to San Diego and back. Also, though, I also… I crossed the country ten times, coast to coast, seven times by rail, once by the ship, South Dakota, and twice by thumb, hitchhiking. Joshua Bell: Twice by thumb? Dwight Smith: Yes. Twice. Joshua Bell: During your time in the Navy? Dwight Smith: Yes. Though, the last time was, I’d been discharged out in Bremerton, Washington, and I’m heading home, and I wanted to visit some friends along the way, so I hitchhiked. The first time was during the Christmas/New Years of ’45-’46 when everybody was on the West Coast trying to get to the East Coast, because the war in Japan was over. Oh, I tried, with a buddy, to see if we could get a bus, or train, or airplane, or something to go to the East Coast. We both wanted to get back to New York, as my lady friend was in New Jersey, and his friend was out there somewhere also. So, the two of gave up and we thumbed our way across, and in five days, we made it. Night and day, we got rides. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: And, I tell you, it was very interesting. Because when you were doing this, this hitchhiking, protocol was for the military people to line up along the highway, and the fellas first in line would get the first ride. And those guys who lined up way at the end of the line, they may sit there for six or eight hours before they get a ride. So, my friend and I, we overnighted at a bunk in the basement of the fire station of Winnemucca, Nevada. Got up in the morning, bright and early, and boy, what [a line up 00:35:20]. This was in November or December of ’45. The war with Japan was just over. And, we were standing there, just moping, because, “Jeez. We’re never going to get a ride.” Well, we’re really out in the desert. And we saw this cloud of dust. It was a car coming across a little dirt road in the desert, there. Guess where the car ended up? At the highway, right where we were standing. Never mind what protocol is, we jumped in that car and headed east. An old Indian was driving it, and every roadhouse we passed where he could get a drink, we, the two, my friend and I were sent into the roadhouse to buy him a bottle of beer, because he couldn’t buy it. The Indians were not allowed to drink alcohol. So, we kept feeding him the beers. I think we went 300 miles with him. Anyway, that’s how we got across country in five days. I’d say, you got to get a few breaks. Because I was… Now I had met this young lady, and she’s in New Jersey, and I’m in California, and I spent Christmas and New Year’s with her. Not New Year’s eve because I was headed back to the West Coast again, because that’s where I was supposed to be. I was sitting on the day coach again. I remember New Year’s Eve, we were crossing through Wyoming, and my mother put a little jigger of whiskey in my suitcase. And I got it out and celebrated the New Year away. Drank sitting on the day coach. Joshua Bell: Good ol’ mom looking out for you. Dwight Smith: Yep, in the wilds of Wyoming. So I have many a tale to tell, but I think I ought to condense this, because I started out on the South Dakota, I went through Navy V-12 College Training Program. I graduated from that. I took two semesters at Dartmouth, and, by the way, I was the… Our company… In the Navy, there were companies, and in these college programs, we all wore uniforms, and we all marched up and down the college green, and so forth and so on. Most, or 99.9% of the students, the V-12 students, were either right out of high school or were attending college. And I was the only one in that whole company that had battle stars on my ribbon on my uniform. And, it was quite unique. I get this picture of the whole company marching across the green, and there’s one guy holding something up, and I’m holding the flag in front of the team, because I’m a veteran already. Joshua Bell: How did the other guys feel about that? Dwight Smith: The other guys were amazed. They were, you know, awestruck. “How do you do this? How did you get into this college program?” I said, “I raised my hand and volunteered.” Joshua Bell: And you didn’t have to give up any of your rank to get in, did you? Dwight Smith: I was still seaman first class. Joshua Bell: Still seaman first class? Dwight Smith: Yeah, big deal. Joshua Bell: How many battle stars? Dwight Smith: Four. Joshua Bell: Four battle stars. Dwight Smith: And my Pacific ribbon, yeah. I had the Atlantic ribbon because I’m getting ahead of myself, here, but I had the Atlantic ribbon. I have five ribbons in all. And I would have had six ribbons if I got the Good Conduct Medal. But I had to be in the Navy for three years to get the Good Conduct ribbon, and I was in the Navy two years and eleven months. Joshua Bell: Oh, Jeez. Dwight Smith: So, by one month, I never got this Good Conduct ribbon. So, it was the South Dakota, then it was Dartmouth College. And then it was midshipman’s school in the Bronx, somewhere in the Bronx. New York Nautical Academy for my 90-day wonder school. It was going to make an ensign out of me, God willing. And, 30 days into the program –– and it’s an intense program. You’re up and about, and running here, there, and everywhere, and taking exams, and all of it was intense. And after 30 days of it, I came down with the German measles. I was sent over to the St. Alban’s, New York Naval Hospital. And I was there maybe four or five days. And, if you lose four or five days out of the 90-day wonder school, you’re lost. You’re never going to catch up. So, when I went back to Port Schuyler, my name was on the bulletin board that I’m dismissed from this program, along with several others. And, there I was, back into being a seaman first class, and sent to Great Lakes Training Center out of Chicago, for further orders. I was on the East Coast, of course, they had to send me out to Chicago for further orders, they can’t get me any in the east. So, here I am. Now, I have to backtrack on this story, because… Joshua Bell: Of course. Dwight Smith: …when I was on the South Dakota, and then I was moved to the States, as a passenger. I was a passenger on the U.S.S. Princeton, which is an aircraft carrier. And while I was on the Princeton, I was carrying my hammock and my mattress, and everything else, over my shoulder. You know, carrying this heavy thing over my shoulder, my bedding. I said to myself –– Jeez, if I go to college, I’m going to have bunk. I’m not going to need this stuff. So I stuffed it into an empty locker on the Princeton. And there were… You know, I left it there, and on I went on my journey. Several months later, the U.S.S. Princeton is torpedoed or bombed. It’s sunk by the Japanese, and it was sunk. The carrier went down. So, here I am at Great Lakes, Illinois, in this big receiving center. Out of college, which, of course, I didn’t need the hammock. I look at my quarters in this big building in Great Lakes, I see bunks with no mattresses on them. So, there’s a gnarled old quartermaster who’s in charge. He was probably in the Navy for 20 years, and he finally got a good job. And I went up to him and I said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any bedding.” “Why the hell don’t you?” I said, “It went down with the Princeton.” “Oh, fella, let me help you. I’ll go get you a mattress.” I mean, you had to tell a little, you know… Joshua Bell: Well, it was true. It did go down with the Princeton. Dwight Smith: That’s, that’s the God awful truth. I twisted the truth so it worked for me. And so, I got a bunk, and so forth. So… Oh, guess where I was on VJ Day? Joshua Bell: Oh, please tell me. Dwight Smith: You know that photograph of the sailor and the nurse in Times Square? Joshua Bell: Yes. Dwight Smith: Yes. Well, it could have been me. I was in Times Square on August 15, 1945, because, at that point, I was attached to the Brooklyn Armed Guards Center in Brooklyn, New York. And, I got a couple of babes together, and we… Nickel fare, we rode the subway into Times Square and had a great time. Joshua Bell: What do you remember thinking about VJ Day happening? Dwight Smith: Oh, very pleased, believe me. Very pleased. It meant I didn’t have to go back to the South Pacific. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: So, there I was in Brooklyn. Now, why was I in Brooklyn? Because when I got out of Great Lakes, they sent me to radar operator’s school. Finally, the Navy sends me to a school I can attend and graduate from. They sent me to a radar operator’s school in Point Loma in San Diego, California. The most beautiful place I have ever been, as far as climate was concerned. You get out on the water… A point of land in San Diego, and the cool ocean breezes, and the warm sun, 70 degrees and low humidity, and six weeks of studies to learn how to operate radar…which I did. And I got my certificate, and I needed to be reassigned. Of course, I’m in California, and so they have to reconsign me to somewhere on the East Coast, don’t they? They did. They sent me to the Brooklyn Armed Guard Center in Brooklyn, New York, where my parents were living, at that time. And, it was totally useless to do these things to me, but they did. And, so then, they finally put me on a ship. It was to operate the radar on a merchant ship, because the Merchant Marine companies didn’t have radar yet. Only the Navy had radar. So, they installed radar…little bits of radar were on these cargo ships. So, I was sent down, by train, to Jacksonville, Florida to board the S.S. Thomas W. Hyde, which was a Liberty ship loaded with kegs of tobacco and prefabricated houses, wooden prefabricated houses. We were headed to London, England. And we were both… Tobacco and housing was in need… They needed it. We sailed out of Jacksonville, Florida with this cargo, and I’m the radar operator, and I’m very proud of this. I got a private cabin, because they didn’t know where to put me. Even though I was still a seaman first class, they gave me a private cabin. It used to be the radio operator’s cabin. I dined with the officers. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: Yeah. I’m a seaman first class, but the only one on the ship who knew anything about the radar. Joshua Bell: Big time. Dwight Smith: Yeah, big time. So, I enjoyed that journey, because once I went topside, and I said to the skipper, “Do you want me to show you how this works?” He said, “Ah, I don’t believe in it. Don’t bother me.” Joshua Bell: Don’t believe in it. Dwight Smith: So, I had this trip over to London, England and back, at the Navy’s expense. Joshua Bell: Not bad. Dwight Smith: And once we got to London, we off-loaded our… This was November, September, October, yeah, September, October, it was ’45. The war in Japan was over. In fact, the whole war was over. We still had a Navy gun crew on the Thomas Hyde, but they didn’t have anything to do except polish their guns. And I didn’t have anything to do because the skipper didn’t believe in radar, so… He was a merchant seaman. So, I said, “Okay. I’ll enjoy this voyage.” And then we… I went ashore with some of the gun and crew buddies, and we saw London, the upside, and London and the downside of London. And we spent a few days there. And, finally, we headed back to Boston, and we had a cargo of troops, returning troops from the war in Europe returning to the United States. They put up bunks in the cargo holds, and we carried troops back with us. So, it was a nice round trip, and once we reached Boston, I think I’ll… maybe I’ll go out on the ship again. I hope so. [Unintelligible 00:47:27] Some officers come aboard with clipboards, and call me down, “Where are you?” And I just told them, “I’m up here.” And so, they came up and interviewed me. They said, “Were putting three men on to replace you. Two to operate it, and one to repair the radar. They are going to be Army men.” I said, “Okay. Whatever.” So, they put me back into, I don’t know, some receiving station somewhere. Oh, I know. I was on the East Coast, right? Well, guess where I’m sent? San Francisco. Joshua Bell: No way. Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Nothing spectacular, but… So, I reached San Francisco, and I learned that I’m going to be a crew member on the LST-835 landing ship tank in San Francisco. It was anchored off of Alcatraz, there in San Francisco Bay. It had brought back… The war was over in Japan. The war was over, and they brought back on this LST a lot of military gear that was still usable. You know, trucks, and tractors, and other stuff that was over in the islands of the Pacific. And they put it all on this LST, and sent the LST to San Francisco, where they unloaded all this stuff. Now, the Navy said the LST… They used to go up to Portland, Oregon. It will be decommissioned, eventually. So, I’m put on the LST-835 as a radar operator. Again, no interest on the part of any other crew that we needed radar. So, again, I was just a passenger. And we went up the coast to Astoria, Oregon. We put up there for a while. And then we went up the Columbia River to Portland, Oregon, and we tied up there for the winter. This was 1945-46. And I am totally bored. Nothing to do. So, I said to the crew; there’s a yeoman and a storekeeper. Each went ashore everyday together in a Navy truck, not in a big truck, but a Navy truck to run errands. The storekeeper’s going to buy groceries so we can eat on the ship, and the yeoman has got paperwork to go to the Naval headquarters, back and forth. So, the two of them would go ashore every day in this truck. And I went up to them, and I said… They were nice guys, and I said to them, “Would you like to have a chauffeur take you every day?” “Oh, sure.” So, that was my job, to take them ashore, not ashore, we were tied up at a dock, but to take them downtown. And our first stop every day was Union Station in Portland, Oregon to have a… USO to have a coffee and a donut. And we ran our errands and came back. In the afternoon, we had nothing to do, but nonetheless, it was something for me to do, because I was on that LST for the whole winter of ’45-’46, and never saw the sun shine in Portland, Oregon in the winter. But it wasn’t cold or it wasn’t snowy, it was just gray. And, there I was in Portland, Oregon, and I’m about to be discharged. I finally have enough points to be discharged. And the yeoman says to me, “You have to discharged on the East Coast because that’s where you started out of.” I said, “Oh, Jeez. Another train ride, coast to coast.” I really wanted to hitchhike, because I just wanted to be out of the Navy, now. And I could stop along the way and visit some of my old Navy buddies, who lives in Texas, and lived in Louisiana, and Oregon, Eastern Washington, and so forth. I wanted to stop, you know, make a nice trip out of it. So, I said to the yeoman, “How do I get discharged out here instead of Boston?” “Well,” he says, “do you happen to have a job out here?” I said, “No, I don’t.” “Well, you have to have family out here.” I said, “No, I don’t.” “Or you could have a car out here.” Ah ha. I whipped out my [unintelligible 00:51:40] wallet, and there’s my registration from my Model-A Ford. Still good. A Vermont registration. The car was up on blocks in my garage in Groton, Vermont. The registration was still valid. So, the yeoman signs all of the paperwork, and I’m discharged in Bremerton, Washington, and I’m paid three cents a mile to drive my car back to Boston. And I pocketed the three cents a mile and hitchhiked. You know, I think my story almost sounds like I had too much fun. Joshua Bell: That’s fantastic. Dwight Smith: It is! It really is. Joshua Bell: It sounds like it was a little frustrating, though. Dwight Smith: Oh, yes. Oh, definitely. Joshua Bell: More [unintelligible 00:52:24], perhaps. Dwight Smith: Well, there were many places which would frustrate you. And, particularly when the Navy brass is making decisions for you, and you wonder where they got their brains from. We groused about it, you know, but, you know, in two years eleven months, I crossed the Atlantic Ocean, I crossed the Pacific, I mean, I went from California to Oregon by boat, and I was out in the South Pacific. And all that and a full college year at Dartmouth College. Two semesters of a regular college year. And radar school, and… To think about it, two years eleven months, I crammed all of that stuff in? Coast to coast and doing everything. And having met my lady friend. That was during…while I was in the Navy. I met her for two different weekends, and then I was off to the seas again, and we corresponded by mail. And, finally, when I hitchhiked back, Christmas of ’45, we were still… We hadn’t seen much of each other. And we made plans, and the following summer, I went back to college, and she had a summer job near, but I only… We got engaged and married, and now I’m the – we together, produced five children. And now, she’s passed away, but I have nine grandchildren now, and eleven great grandchildren, and it’s pretty amazing to me. I’m 91 years old, and I don’t feel it, and I don’t look it. Joshua Bell: No, you certainly don’t. Dwight Smith: I am thoroughly… Feel that I am fortunate, because I’ve got my health, I have a new lady friend who’s… We’re very close. We just enjoy each other’s company. I have a daughter and son-in-law whose very close to me, living five miles away from here, and where I live. And I have a son and his family living over in Bridgton, Maine, which is about 25 miles from here. And I have a son and family living in South Portland, Maine, which is about 60 miles from here. And I have a son and a daughter-in-law living out in Battleground, Washington, which is… They both work in the city of Portland, Oregon. But that’s all I have today, and I’m so pleased with it, that I’m here and the shape I’m in. I just feel fortunate. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. I wanted ask, what are you most proud of about your time in the service? Dwight Smith: I’m most proud of the fact that I served in… I’m a combat Naval veteran, and I did my, whatever I had to do, and I did it willingly. I didn’t have much choice, but I mean to say, though, that once I was in this dangerous situation, I held up very well. And I… I can’t say I didn’t really enjoy the ten trips across the country. There’s a tale in that one, too. Let me tell you. Joshua Bell: Oh, please, please. Dwight Smith: I chose… Because I’m a rail fan, and my whole working history was in the railroad business, that I took different routes every time I crossed the country by rail. The same rate fare, but I took different railroad company’s routes. And the most popular one was from New York to Chicago on either the New York Central or the Pennsylvania Railroad. And then, from Chicago to the West Coast, the usual route was Chicago and Northwestern to Omaha, Nebraska, and the Union Pacific to Ogden, Utah, and the Southern Pacific on to California. And that was the typical route for everything moving from Chicago to the West Coast. There are exceptions, of course, but, basically, that was the major one. My first time gong west on that route, like, we’re in the some railroad station in Chicago, ready to board this train that’s going to take us to California. And they said, “For you servicemen, we have a special deal for you today. We’re going to allow you to have your own coach, and you’ll get on now, before the public gets on the train.” Whoopee-doo. They put us on this old cattle car that had kerosene lamps, and no air conditioning, and stiff-back seats. And then they opened the rest of the train with streamline cars, with reclining seats, and the air conditioning in the [unintelligible 00:57:07], and that’s how they rode to the West Coast. I said, “This is bullshit. I’m not going to do this again.” So, the next two times I did, I was in that same station, and the same offer was made to me, I stayed with the civilians, and waited for them to be called to board the train, because they’re not going to sit in those comfortable cars. So, those three trips, I learned on the first trip what not to do, and the second two trips were just fine. It’s just you have to work the system as well as you can. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. Dwight Smith: And, yeah, I did, and I… Overall, it was not a bad situation that I had. I mean, yes, it was not very safe out in the South Pacific, but I… [End of recorded material 00:57:52] June 27, 2016 [Start of recorded material 00:00:00] Joshua Bell: Today is June 27, 2016. I’m Josh Bell, park ranger with the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. I’m joined, again, by Dwight Smith, who has been telling us about his experiences in the Navy. How are you doing today, Mr. Smith? Dwight Smith: I’m doing fine. I’m in good health and good… I feel well. Joshua Bell: Excellent. And it’s all right if we record our conversations like we did last time. Dwight Smith: It is okay. Joshua Bell: All right. Excellent. So, we covered quite a lot the last time we talked, and I was wondering if there was anything that I didn’t ask you that you’d like to share with the Historic Area? Dwight Smith: Yes. I would like to discuss, briefly, each of the three ships I sailed on. What were they doing while I was on there? I mean, why was I on there, and what were they doing? I think I’ll start with the third one and work back, because it gets more exciting going back. Joshua Bell: Sure. Dwight Smith: The third ship that I sailed on was a LST-835, which is a landing ship tank. And I boarded it in… I got to look at my records, here. I boarded it in 1946 in San Francisco Bay. It was out in the Bay after it had come… The war in Japan was over, and LST was in San Francisco, and it brought back from Japan, retrievable U.S. military gear. They just loaded up the stuff that was still usable, and brought it into San Francisco. And they off-loaded it. And then it was empty, and it was going to head up the coast to Portland, Oregon to be decommissioned. They needed a crew to get on it, and I was…happened to be at a Navy waiting station, if you will, in Treasure Island. And they said, “We’re assigning you to be the radar operator on LST-835. Joshua Bell: Oh, I’m sorry, there was a blip there. What was your duty? Dwight Smith: Radar operator. Joshua Bell: Radar operator, okay. Dwight Smith: That’s the time I had a rating of radar operator third class. And so, I boarded the ship, and we sailed up the coast, first to Astoria, Oregon, and then to Portland, Oregon, where we tied up. I had absolutely nothing to do on the ship other than look at the radar while we were in route to Oregon. And we got into Portland, Oregon in the fall of 1945, and then we tied up there, and I sat on that LST, and I had absolutely nothing to do. I was awaiting another place to be discharged. You see, you had to earn so many points, based on time and other factors, to be discharged. So, I was waiting to be discharged, and I had nothing to do on this ship. And I noticed that we were tied up at a dock in Portland, Oregon –– Swan Island, Portland, Oregon. And the ship’s yeoman and the ship’s storekeeper went ashore every day to do errands in the downtown city of Portland. The yeoman had Navy paperwork to exchange with the Navy base in Portland. And the storekeeper had to go into town to buy groceries for the LST dining hall. And they went in…took a Navy truck adjacent to where we were tied up, took a Navy truck and went into town every day. And I said to them, “Would you like to have a chauffeur?” They said, “Sure.” So, I then drove them into town every day while they ran their errands. So it gave me something to do, and it gave them a little bit of help. And I said to them, I said, “Well, what do you do every day?” Well, they said, “First we go to the Portland Union Railroad Station, and the USO in there has coffee and donuts. So that was our daily routine, the coffee and donuts, and then we ran our errands and came back to the ship. Now, it’s getting close to my discharge time. There I was out on the West Coast, and my home is on the East Coast –– This is the way it was in the Navy. And they said to me, “We’re going to have send you back to Boston, on a troop train, for your discharge.” And I said, “I’ve already crossed the United States six times by train, seven times by train, coast to coast, and I would like… Joshua Bell: And this is when you hitchhiked. Dwight Smith: That’s correct. And this is when the ship’s yeoman said to me, “You ready to be sent off to Boston on the train?” I said, “No. I’d like to be discharged here, at Bremerton, Washington.” He said, “Well, you can’t unless you have one of these three things to pass. Do you have any family out here?” I said, “No.” “Do you have a job out here.?” I said, “No.” “Do you have a car out here?” And without a further word, I reached in my pocket, pulled out the current registration I had for my Model-A Ford, valid. I didn’t tell him that the Model-A Ford was in Groton, Vermont, up on concrete blocks, waiting for my return. So, I get discharged in Bremerton, Washington, and hitchhiked home. This time I took two weeks to return to the East Coast by my thumb, because I wanted to visit friends along the way. And I had a shipmate that had already been discharged down in Texas, and another one in Spokane, Washington, and Washington D.C. So, I made these stops when I was hitchhiking across the country, and it took me a full two weeks to do it. Joshua Bell: What were the names of your friends that you stopped to see? Dwight Smith: I don’t remember. They were shipmates of mine, and they were already discharged. So I visited them, and I saw the country, and it was a very nice trip. And that was it. I was out of the Navy. But my lady friend, back on the East Coast, was very interested in me, and I was very interested in her. And I said to her, “I may go back to sea.” And she pointed to me and said, “The sea or me.” That was the end of my naval career, and seagoing career, and I went into the railroad business, which I stayed in until 1999. Joshua Bell: What did you do in the railroad business? Dwight Smith: Well, I worked for the Boston and Maine Rail Road in New England for 26 years, in freight marketing, freight sales, freight traffic department. And they were spiraling downhill, so I quit. I was not downsized. I did not get fired. I just quit. And I said, “I can do better by myself running my own railroad.” Now, there’s a step. So after, I really fell into luck, and I ended up starting our first train on the Conway Scenic Railroad, 11 miles long, in 1974. It was called Passengers Only; a little, short, you know, one-hour round trip in the summer, in North Conway, New Hampshire, where I live now. And it was very successful. Joshua Bell: I have been on that train. Dwight Smith: Have you? Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: Well, good. Good. I hope you paid for your trip. Joshua Bell: I certainly did. Dwight Smith: Because I’m living off of my… I sold my last share of stock in it in 1999, and I’m now living off the income of my investment. It’s been… It was very, very fascinating job. That was a job I enjoyed having, and enjoyed the challenges of starting from ground zero on a business. My wife and I were side by side. She ran our gift shop, and I ran the railroad, and my son ran the snack bar, and it was just…And, mostly, summer employees were… Because we only ran in the summer and into October. And so, most of my help were either college students, or school teachers who had the summer off, or retirees. And every one of them, though, enjoyed the job, because they all liked to work for a railroad. From track workers to the conductor on the train. And people would ask me, “What is your job here? Are you a conductor or engineer?” I said, “No. I stay here, back in the office, and count the money.” But it was a fascinating career, and I really was very, very fortunate to be enabled to do it. But, back to the Navy. That was the reason I sailed on the LST-835 was because they had nothing else for me to do. But to go back to the next ship backwards, here. The next ship was the S.S. Thomas W. Hyde, which is a Liberty ship, and Liberty ships were made, by the dozens, in shipyards throughout the United States, during World War II to help balance out the number of merchant ships that were lost to German submarines, or Japanese submarines. So, I was assigned as a…I was now a radar operator, and I was assigned to the Thomas W. Hyde, which is a merchant ship with a merchant crew, but they still had onboard the Navy Armed Guard, which were some Navy personnel, and they had some guns mounted on these merchant ships. This was in the fall of 1945. The war is over in August of ’45 and I boarded this ship in September of ’45. I boarded it in Jacksonville, Florida, and it was really on a mercy trip, because they loaded the ship down to Florida with kegs of tobacco, and pre-fabricated houses, which we delivered to London, England. Of course, a lot of homes were bombed out over in England in 1943-44, and these pre-fabricated houses were very welcomed. So, it was a mercy trip, really. And, once we got to London, England, we tied up and stayed there for a while. And when we left, we had a cargo full of returning troops. In other words, when the cargo facilities were emptied, they put in metal bunks, three deep, probably, and we took, you know, several hundred troops back to the United States. And we came back to Boston. Again, here I was, I was a radar operator, and just as we were leaving Jacksonville, Florida, I said to the skipper, “You want me to start using this radar the Navy just installed on your merchant ship?” He said, “Oh, no. I don’t believe in it.” So, I had a cruise to London, England and back, with absolutely no duties, because he was not interested in… He was a merchant skipper, but not interested. But what had happened at this point in time was, the U.S. Navy had developed workable radar, but none of the merchant ships really had any of that. So, the Navy put these radar - fit machines on these merchant ships, along with a Navy personnel –– me. And it would have been great if we needed it, but I guess we didn’t. So, I enjoyed the tour to England and back. And, once we reached Boston, I said, “This is a good deal. I’d like to stay on this ship for a while.” Well, a couple of officers onboard the ship, called for me and told me that I would have to leave the ship because they’re putting on three people to replace me. Two to operate the radar, and one to repair it. Now, these were Army guys, not Navy. I said, “Oh, okay.” So, there I am in Boston, Massachusetts, a few miles, not many miles from my home, and the Navy decides that a better place for me would be back in California, again. Joshua Bell: Oh, naturally. Dwight Smith: Oh, naturally. Well, that’s how I ended up on the LST-835 in San Francisco, because it’s as far away from Boston as they could find to get me. Now, back to number one, the U.S.S. South Dakota. Battleship 57 –– BB 57. Its goal was to annihilate Japanese Navy, annihilate occupants of Japanese-held islands in the South Pacific, which they were quite good at doing. And I was just out of boot camp, ten days leave at the home, and just out of boot camp, and they shipped me down to Norfolk, Virginia. And there was this big battleship in dry-dock, it had just come back from the North Atlantic, because it was helping the British] fleet guard the merchant ships that were headed for Murmansk, Russia, which was above the… What’s the word? Above the Arctic Circle. If you go up the coast of Norway, and around the top of Norway, and you end up at a port in Russia –– Murmansk. And that was where tons and tons of ammunition and land tanks, and all kinds of stuff were delivered to the Russian people because they were on our side against Japan, and against Germany. So, the South Dakota was working with the British fleet for a while, and then they were discharged from that, and sent down to Norfolk, Virginia to be in the dry-dock for a little bit of work. And that’s when I boarded the South Dakota. And, mind you, I was just out of boot camp. I did at home for a ten-day leave. I didn’t know beans about Navy ships or whatever might happen next for me. But the South Dakota needed… They let about 200 of their seaman that had been on the ship up until…with the British fleet. Before that, the South Dakota had already been out in the South Pacific. And when they reached Norfolk, they let about 200 of them go onto other duties, and didn’t have to stay on that particular ship. So, I was one of about 200 who were assigned to the South Dakota. We lined up on the fantail, and one evening, as we arrived the first day we had on the ship. And officers were telling each one of us what department we were going to be in, what division we were going to be in. Are we going to be peeling potatoes, or swabbing the decks, or chipping paint, or manning those anti-aircraft guns, which were totally exposed to the weather, and the bombs, and so forth? And so, I was going to be assigned to one of those divisions. Then one of the officers said, “Anybody out there have any high school math?” “No,” the people around me, “Don’t volunteer. You never volunteer in the Navy.” I said, “Well, I’m going to.” I raised my hand, and I got assigned to the Fire Control Division, which is quite technical. And so, I spent nine months in the Fire Control Division as a Fire Control-man, striker, they called them. I was a seaman first class. Off we went through the Panama Canal and into the South Pacific. And, I entered a new part of my life, because here I was a crew member on a battleship in the South Pacific in 1943, when things were not going very well down there. There I was, a vital crew member on this ship. My battle station was down in the bowels of the ship, working with a computer. There was twin 5-inch mounts, and there were two of them manned by… They had the director up topside, and there is a room, a rotating room where you had the optics. You could look in the magnifying optics and see the airplanes, and so forth. And, down in the plotting room, where I was, we had a computer, which was all vacuum tubes. Hotter than Hell down there. And the guys with the optics up topside were feeding us information by phone. And I, you know, I had earphones on me, and I was listening to them telling me these facts, and I’m cranking data into the computer. So that was what I did when we were being attacked. Joshua Bell: And what did the computer compute? Dwight Smith: Damned if I know. Oh, how to aim those twin 5-inch guns. Joshua Bell: There you go. Dwight Smith: In other words, they feed in the temperature, and the humidity, and wind direction, and all these factors, so that when you pull the trigger on the gun, topside, you’re going to hit the target, because we entered all this data. Hopefully, you were going to hit the target that’s moving very swiftly. Joshua Bell: And what were…? Were the 5-inch guns anti-aircraft? Dwight Smith: Yes. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Okay. Dwight Smith: And they were bilingual, they were anti-aircraft and they could also do other ship-to-ship things. When I was out there, it was for anti-aircraft. Joshua Bell: Were there other people in the Fire Control room with you? Dwight Smith: Oh, yes. It was crowded. We had lots of guys doing the same thing for other guns. I had one…two sets of twin 5-inch guns that I was directing, helping to direct. And the ship had ten of these twin 5-inch gun facilities. Ten of them, I think. And then the ship also had nine 16-inch guns, which were not used for anti-aircraft but for shore bombardments, and they had their own plotting room. And it was noisy. I could hear things down there, and feel things down there, but I never saw anything really, during my battle station. But, the rest of the cruise, I was topside on one of those 5-inch directors, which are a piece of armor-plated machinery that has the optical finders up there. And my day, every 8-hour day, night, day or night, I was assigned to man one of those facilities. But, actually, when the battle station was called, you know, you got to go get to your battle station, I dropped from that site down into the bowels of the ship, where my battle station was. So, it means that I spent my work time, eight hours a day, sitting on top of that gun director topside, reading my manual on how to become an excellent Fire Control-man, and looking out over the Pacific Ocean, and there’s a… You look out from where my seat was… We were guarding primarily aircraft carriers. There were also cruisers out there, and destroyers, and destroyer escorts, and hundreds of ships, as far as the eye can see. There was… Well, it was entertaining, if nothing else. But, it was scary at times, because you were guiding these aircraft carriers, and you see these airplanes being launched off the carriers, and landing on the carriers, and some of them missing. They… All over the drink is dead, and that was, kind of, sad. But, nonetheless, we were doing a very, very… A very special phase of our battleship’s life was to protect, with our anti-aircraft guns, to protect those aircraft carriers. And the other thing we did while we were in the South Pacific, go to these little islands, offshore, those little Japanese-held islands. And with our 16-inch guns, we would fire 16- inch armor at the islands, just trying to blow up the Japanese quarters, or whatever, before our troops landed. In other words, our duty with those 16-inch guns, was to soften up the islands before our people landed on them. And that was a… That was interesting, and I was down, again, in the plotting room for that, because that’s where my battle station was, and we were at battle standards when we were bombarding these islands. So, that was the only…really part of the World War II that I really felt I’d done something. Joshua Bell: Mm-mmm. You mentioned that you have several battle stars. Dwight Smith: Four. Joshua Bell: Four. Which battles? Dwight Smith: Well, it says so on my… Just a minute, I’m going to let you [unintelligible 00:24:19] exactly. And I’m going to be sending you some of these documentations. Joshua Bell: Oh, that will be great. Dwight Smith: Okay. First history of the battleship... While I was aboard the ship. It departed Norfolk, August 21, 1943, and I departed from it in May of 1944 to come back to the college training program. In between… After I got onboard, we went through the Panama Canal, and we stopped at Pearl Harbor, and finally arrived at Havana Harbor at [unintelligible 00:25:27] Island in the New Hebrides Islands. And we went island hopping. Fiji Islands had started new campaign of island hopping. The next offensive for the Japanese included the South Dakota began with the attack and liberation of the vast Gilbert and Marshall Islands. Starting in November of ’43. Specific targets of the Marshall Islands include Kwajalein Atoll, Roi, R-O-I, Taromaaoelap T-A-R-O-A-M-A-O-E-L-A-P, and when that operation was secured, we steamed out to bombard the island of Namur, after which she escorted the carrier, Bunker Hill, back to Efate in the New Hebrides. Now that’s the balance of 1943. And in ’44, I’m on the ship until May. We were screening carriers. Then she took part in the mid-February upon the primary Japanese forward anchorage of Truk. It had devastating results for the Japanese Navy. The South Dakota would continue carrier screening duties during the raids on the Marianas, with strikes upon Tinian, Saipan, and Guam, and returned to Majuro by the end of February of ’44. In March of “44, we went on to the Caroline Islands of Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Walea. The battleship returned briefly to Majuro to resupply, and then departed to cover air strikes against various airfield targets, to cover U.S. troop landings on the Hollandia and along the points of the New Guinea coast. Later April, the South Dakota participated in a second strike upon the Japanese base at Truk. In May of ’44, the South Dakota was back in Majuro on the Marshall Islands for minor refits and to prepare for the invasion of the Mariana Islands. At Majuro, Dwight Smith left the South Dakota, and boarded the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Princeton for passage to Pearl Harbor, and the first leg of his journey back to the U.S.A. and the V-12 College Training Program. So that’s where I was. Joshua Bell: Excellent. You mentioned the V-12 program. What was your living situation like? Dwight Smith: It was at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and we V-12 all were in uniform, and we had college dorm rooms. I had three roommates. There were four of us in a two-bed… Normally, in peacetime, just a two-bed room. Put two double bunks in the room, and so there were four of us living in the room in the college, one of the college dormitories. And… Joshua Bell: You must have got up to some sort of antics. Dwight Smith: Well, it was a little bit cramped, but the other three guys and I got along very well. But I miss… In that entire battalion of V-12 students at Dartmouth College, everyone except me, is either right out of high school or college, directly into the V-12 Program wearing Navy uniforms, but this was their first Navy experience. I was the only one in the whole group that had four battle scars already. Joshua Bell: You were the old man. Dwight Smith: Yeah. I was the only one that had been to sea. I was the only one who was a seaman first class. Think about that. I mean, my God. Well, I have a picture I’m going to send you. It shows the whole battalion come to one dormitory, anyway. About a hundred marching across the green at Dartmouth College. And there, leading the pack, is one guy who was really there, and I’m second of line, carrying the flag. The rest of them are eight abreast, marching. And I was standing in front of this…parading in front of this group, holding the flag, and one of my roommates was appointed to be the boss. I mean, it’s just amazing to me. Joshua Bell: So, what did you do with your spare time, or did you have spare time, I guess would be a better question? Dwight Smith: Yes, we were college students, and we had weekends off. We didn’t have summer vacation, but we had weekends off. Let’s see, I had that car that was up on blocks when I got discharged. I had the car down at the V-12. And my home was 40 miles away. And my roommates and I would go down to Northampton, Massachusetts on one of our weekends to see the girls down at Smith College. And we’d go up to Montreal. We did real college-type stuff on the weekends. But we were in uniform, and we had to take certain courses. But we were also free to take elective courses, as well. And we were in uniform at all times. We were in the Navy. Joshua Bell: Did you find the program of study rigorous? Dwight Smith: Yes. We had… We all had to take… What’s the word? Physics I. That was where we met at a big amphitheater, and one professor is, you know, lecturing to about 50 of us, or so, in the room. And his name was Dr. Merch. And we finally began calling it, this class, Merch’s Mystery Hour, because Physics I, for most of us, was totally a different world. But we got through it okay. I got my diploma for my two semesters at Dartmouth College. Joshua Bell: So you finished the program? Dwight Smith: Yes, the V-12 Program. Joshua Bell: You finished the V-12 Program. Excellent. Dwight Smith: But that was… I had already had two years of junior college, which counted towards my full college. So, this is my third year of college. And then when the V-12 Program for us ended, I was assigned to a 90-day wonder school down in New York Maritime Academy at Fort Schuyler in the Bronx, New York. And that’s where you’re supposed to come out of that class as an ensign. Well, I was… It was a very, very intense course. Believe me, you were gone… I mean, there was hours of drilling, and classes, and studies, and, you know, like, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm. It was grueling. Well, I was doing okay for the first 30 days, when I came down with German measles. Now, I don’t know why I came down with German measles. I don’t know why they put me in a Navy hospital with German measles, but I was sent to a Navy hospital for… I think I was there for a week. And, of course, this was a very intense course. You lose a week, you’ve lost it. So, I came back to Fort Schuyler, the Navy nautical school, and found my name on the bulletin board as being no longer part of this class, along with several others who probably failed physically, mentally, I mean - They probably failed not because of German measles, but they failed because of the scholastic abilities. Joshua Bell: Did that ever happen in the V-12 Program where people were dropped out at Dartmouth? Dwight Smith: Yeah. This was… Yes. No, not the V-12 Program. I think most… Well, there could have been. I know, because we were…got a certificate that we had fulfilled out course requirements at the V-12. But this was the midshipman’s school… Joshua Bell: Right. Dwight Smith: … The 90-day wonder school, and I lasted 30 days. So, we were around the East Coast, so they sent me to Chicago, my next place in the Navy. And, let’s backtrack a little bit on this story, because I’ve told you earlier that I was a passenger on the U.S.S. Princeton from Majuro when I was on the South Dakota to… Joshua Bell: Oh, yes, yes. And it was… And then the Princeton was sunk. Dwight Smith: Yes. Joshua Bell: And you were issued new bedding. Dwight Smith: Yes. This was in Chicago after I… Yes. I left my bedding on the Princeton, and I got into the huge bedroom out at Great Lakes, Illinois. Great Lakes Naval Base. I see the bunks with no bedding on them. And I went up to the boatswain in charge. You know, they’re old time, longtime, tough old Navy men. And I said, “Sir, I don’t have any bedding.” “Why the hell don’t you?” That’s when I told him it went down with the Princeton. He threw his arms around me, he says, “Okay, fella. I’ll get you some bedding.” I didn’t lie. Joshua Bell: You didn’t lie. Dwight Smith: No, I didn’t lie. Joshua Bell: You didn’t lie. I’m trying to think of other questions I can ask you, but I think we might have… The only other thing I can think to ask you is if you…if you recall any of the guys you were with, or any stories from your time in Dartmouth? Dwight Smith: Stories? I think I was - only when I had real stories to tell. [Unintelligible 00:36:46] the V-12 Program, because they were all just out of high school or freshman college. But… No, I… Now, I’ve done programs with the local World War II Historical Museum at Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and I’ve done a program with a couple of them at the Conway Historical Society telling my tale. And I just did it for the local men’s… Congregational Church men’s Friday breakfast. They have different speakers every Friday morning, and I gave them a program the other day. Some of the other veterans there were quite interested in my little tales. I never go into one of these and give a program on how I won the war. I go into what it was like from the eyes of an 18-year-old. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. Dwight Smith: That’s what I’ve been telling you, is what I saw of the Navy as through my mind and through my eyes. Joshua Bell: Well, I appreciate that very much, and on behalf of the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area, I really have to thank you for sharing your story with us, and we’ll absolutely make sure that, you know, we preserve it and share it with future generations. Because what your generation did is quite large and significant, and… Dwight Smith: I’m fully aware of that, and I’m always… I’m sadly now aware of the fact that there are very few of us World War II veterans still around. That is sad. But I did what I had to do, and I did it because I felt I wanted to. And, I wasn’t a hero, but I was there doing what I was…they asked me to do. And, I also think that the nearly everyone in the United States was behind us. That is something that hasn’t happened in any of the wars subsequent to that. That one was 100% backed by everyone in our country. Joshua Bell: It was. Dwight Smith: And I’m proud of what I was able to do. Other than my father who was torpedoed and sunk in 1942, I have had no family members involved in any military activities. And, if this is… If I’ve answered all your questions, I’d like to say I’m going to send you these pictures I promised, and also some of the fact sheets. [End of recorded material 00:39:47]",

The Confederates were breaking through the tree line onto this field and it was the Union soldiers of the Pioneer Brigade and the Chicago Board of Trade Battery who pushed them back. The Pioneer Brigade was an experiment: two of the best soldiers from each infantry company would form this brigade. These men had not trained together, nor had they ever worked together. Yet, so desperate was the situation that General Rosecrans had to rely on these engineers to stop the Rebel tide. Mid-day of December 31st, 1862, the Confederates attacked the Union troops here three times. The Confederates even reached within 50 yards of the Union line before being repulsed. A Union counter-charge was ordered and the line moved forward about a quarter of a mile to a small ridge which was lost earlier in the day. The Chicago Board of Trade Battery fired nearly thirteen hundred rounds into their attackers during the afternoon. A Union sergeant of the Pioneer Brigade recalled seeing through the woods “the rebel flag, seen dimly through the smoke and trees, wavered, started forward, and then surged back. Yes! There was no mistake about it! It was going back!” The Chicago Board of Trade Battery and the Pioneer Brigade were tested and proved their worth while keeping the Nashville Pike in Federal hands.",

Early excavations found hydraulic lime surfaces at the bottom of the boxes, suggesting they were meant to be water tight. However, archeologists and historians continue to disagree about their original function. Some refer to them as cisterns. Others theorize they provided rudimentary “indoor plumbing” to the convento. Still others look to the unfinished bell tower as evidence the vats served a function in working limestone plaster. The side walls are reconstructions. We do not know if they originally rose above ground level. What is your leading theory?",

As the monsoon season approached, families would move to locations where shallow irrigation channels delivered rainwater to their fields. The O'odham living along streams channeled river water directly into rich fields of corn, beans, squash, agave, and melons. With the Spanish came European ideas of irrigation. The fired adobe structure before you is part of the acequia madre, the main irrigation channel that brought water to the mission from the Santa Cruz River a mile or more to the south. The narrowed end could be closed, raising the elevation of the water to serve various functions. As a compuerta, or diversion box, it turned water from the ditch into the orchard to the east. As a holding tank, it was convenient for filling ollas, earthen jars, to carry water back to the houses for drinking and cooking. Because it had a polished, red surface, it was probably also used as a lavandería, or place for washing clothes and dishes, and possibly even bathing.",

Water can present itself in many ways, but how does it feel to you? Speaker 2: The water is quiet. Speaker 3: The water is calming and peaceful. Speaker 4: It makes me fall asleep. Background sound: Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. Speaker 5: Whoosh. Speaker 1: Water can be rhythmic. A steady pitter-patter of rain. Speaker 6: Music in your ear. Speaker 1: The pull and ebb of waves. Speaker 7: I like the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. Speaker 1: Petals lapping at their borders. Speaker 3: One of my favorites was the bubbling of the mangroves. Speaker 1: At Canaveral National Seashore, many animals rely on this resource for food, travel, and shelter. On a clear, sunny day, you might get the chance to see dolphins, spraying mist with their splashing tails. On quiet, moonlit nights, visitors can come to the park to see nesting loggerhead sea turtles. But there's many more unexpected creatures just below the surface of- Speaker 5: The ocean. Speaker 1: Let's take a dive. Speaker 8: What listening activity that we have done at Young Sound Seekers would you like others to try? Speaker 9: The hydrophone cause you got to hear what was underwater. You got to listen to something you can't really see. It was nice to hear the popping shrimp in there, just popping, whipping their tail. Speaker 2: Sounds like a crab snapping its claws. Speaker 9: Fishes passing by. Boats you could hear from a distance. It was nice. Speaker 1: Here at the Indian River Lagoon, more than 4,000 species of animals and plants thrive, all in under four feet of water. Long ago, the Timucua Native Americans prospered from the bountiful supply of oysters, shellfish, and muscles, leaving behind immense mountains of shells like the one at Turtle Mound. Within the diverse lagoon, you can hear the soothing sounds of chirping birds, the dashing fish, water rushing over the shells piled along the shore, and the many plants swaying in the wind. Speaker 1: Come to Canaveral to experience, to live, to protect, and listen.

The first European settlers on the island were Spanish missionaries who in 1587 established the mission of San Juan del Puerto, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Excavations near here documented both Indian and Spanish Occupation. Missions were commonly placed in existing Indian villages such as the one on this island, which housed members of the Saturiwa tribe of the Timucua at the time of Ribault’s landing. In 1595, Franciscan Father Francisco Pareja described the mission as very ornate with a bell tower and organ. His Confessionario, an account of mission life, became a primary source of information about Timucua lifeways and language. The document was rewritten in the native tongue and Spanish. Destroyed in 1597 by Guale Indians who didn’t subscribe to the European religion and culture, the mission was rebuilt, and served the entire region for over 100 years. Use of the island’s original name, Alimacani, declined in favor of San Juan, during the 1600s. The mission was destroyed in 1702 by British Governor James Moore of South Carolina and was not rebuilt.

Actually, I injured my back on the farm and ended up herniating two of my disks in my lower back and had to have surgery. And I traded one of my carriages to the surgeon for the surgery. ~laughs~ Second speaker: ~laughing~ That doesn't happen very often!",

            "transcript": "007 (Grade 6) Slanted Wayside Panel: Built to Order 751 words / Panel Description: 5.9 minutes In front of you, is a slanted panel 3 feet wide by 2 feet tall, and about 3 feet off the ground, Mormon Trail Road is about 105 feet, or 32 meters, to your right. You are at the Trailside Historical Park. To reach this panel, you passed through an opening in a wood fence with posts about 4 feet apart. 3 wood planks run between the posts. Around you is a rolling landscape with trees and farm fields. There are dense trees to your left and behind you, starting around 275 feet, or 80 meters, away. There is a black banner across the top on the panel. Left side text reads Garden Grove. Right side of the panel has the white, orange, and black triangular logo for the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. Title: Built to Order Main text below banner: Here, halfway across Iowa, the Mormon pioneer Vanguard Company set up the first way station. Crews dug wells and built cabins. Others restocked provisions and readied fields for planting. With a shared goal and much perseverance, they organized a small village. After a few weeks, most of the group continued their journey west. Several hundred people stayed behind to recuperate and cultivate the crops. They hoped to feed travelers who would come later. This “Magic City of the Woods” was perfect for farming. But the Latter-day Saints still faced starvation, disease, fatigue, exposure, and rattlesnakes. Over 500 emigrants stayed here during the first winter, but 70 did not survive. The Garden Grove settlement remained active until 1852. End of Text In the top right corner, is an infographic with tan and white text on a faded brown background: Infographic title: Lessons Learned Logistical challenges slowed the travelers down after they left Nauvoo. As they continued westward, they became more organized and progressed more quickly. 100 families organized into 1 company. 1 company was made of 2 units. 1 unit was made of 5 groups. Each group had 10 families. End of Text Above the text is a graphic that explains the company organization. There are 100 circles organized by 10 pairs of vertical rows with 5 circles in each row. The color of each pair of rows alternates between white and dark gray. On the left side of the graphic, a dark green teardrop points to the top left circle. On the teardrop, is a simple white drawing of a covered wagon. The wagon represents 1 family. Each circle in this graphic also represents 1 family. 1 pair of vertical rows represents 1 group, which has 10 circles, or 10 families. 5 pairs of vertical rows represent 1 unit, which has 50 circles, or 50 families. All 10 pairs of vertical rows represent 1 company, which has 100 circles, or 100 families. A colorful illustration fills this panel. This artistic interpretation of the Garden Grove settlement is drawn from archaeological studies. A wide dirt road runs from the bottom middle of the panel toward the top. On the left and right sides of the road, are 2 rows of brown log cabins and smaller outbuildings. The cabins have pitched rooves with wood shingles, and stone chimneys. Some of the chimneys have white plumes of smoke coming out the top. In the bottom middle of the road, is a covered wagon led by 2 pairs of yoked oxen, with a second wagon close behind. Groups of people gather to exchange supplies, in sacks and barrels. There are 4 other wagons scattered across the wide part of the road. Away from the road and behind the cabins, are small wooden outhouses, and corals for livestock, clusters of trees, or rows of green vegetables in gardens. Yellow, green, and brown fields extend out from the cabins towards the edges of the panel. On the left side, below the main text, is a man in an open wagon. He, along with 2 other men standing a field, are harvesting wheat. At the far end of the wide road, near the top of the panel, the road narrows and curves left then right, farther out on the horizon. There is an orderly line of covered wagons led by animals. The road is flanked by rolling hills to the right and left. A light blue sky fills the top part of the panel. In the bottom right corner of the panel, is a QR code that you can scan with a mobile device to explore more about this wayside, including audio description. [End of Message]",

The O’odham farmed along the river, using the floodplain and low banks to grow crops. Later, missionaries and explorers would rely on these existing networks to colonize the area. In 1775, an expedition of approximately 240 people and nearly a thousand head of livestock followed this river on the first part of a journey that would establish the first European settlement on the San Francisco Bay. The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail was designated to commemorate this massive and important movement of settlers across the land. Today the Anza Trail preserves this important history while also providing valuable outdoor recreational space. At Tumacácori it passes through habitat that supports the most diverse migratory bird population outside of the tropics. Hikers, runners, and riders can travel along its route.

            "transcript": "The Roosevelts' greenhouse is visible to your left, on the southern side of the garden. It was used for flower and vegetable propagation, and it housed roses for cut flowers. The ice house stands to the right of the greenhouse, and the hemlock hedge nearby surrounds the rose garden and presidential gravesite. Just beyond the greenhouse and ice house are the stables, the coach house, and the Roosevelt family home. When the Roosevelts bought this property, vegetables and flowers were both grown in the area inside the hemlock hedge. The Roosevelts were only a family of three, but the garden continuously expanded throughout their time here, even after Franklin’s father passed away and FDR was away at school. Eventually, the vegetable garden moved outside the boundary of the hedge and expanded to the area it occupies today. In 1948, the Home Garden was replaced with a parking lot for both the National Historic Site and the Presidential Library. This lot improved public access to both sites, but it did so at the cost of an important piece of Roosevelt history. The acquisition of the Bellefield property in 1975 allowed the national archives to break ground for the Visitor Center in 2001, relocating the parking lot and reestablishing the Home Garden in its original location. Demolition of the parking lot began in 2002, and groundbreaking for the Home Garden as you see it today occurred in 2015. Restoring the Home Garden remains an ongoing project as park horticulturists work to undo the soil compaction that occurred here. Although the garden is designed to replicate the Roosevelts’ garden at Springwood as closely as possible, some adjustments have been made to ensure the health and accessibility of the garden, including deer fencing around its perimeter and porous pavement paths. Wherever possible, this garden contains heirloom varieties grown by the Roosevelts. However, these crops are grown using modern organic practices that may look different from what would have been here during the Roosevelts’ time. You may see bug traps, black biodegradable film, white row cover, and plants sprayed with kaolin clay, all of which are used to combat current pest pressures. Please proceed to the end of the garden to continue the tour.",

            "transcript": "Contrary to the Air Force image, the missile field workforce primarily traveled by car, truck, or armored vehicle. Because of its close proximity to the Interstate and being only seventy-miles from Ellsworth Air Force Base, Delta-01 was one of the easier control centers to reach. More remote sites could require a three hour drive each direction. While helicopter pads were present at every control center and silo, helicopters were only occasional visitors. The armored vehicle parked in the yard is a Peacekeeper, produced in the early 1980s by Cadillac Gage. Used by Air Force Security Forces as a fire team armored vehicle for escorting missile convoys, the Peacekeeper would have been only an occasional visitor to Delta-01. Blue-colored government vehicles, often pickups, jeeps, or suburbans, were most commonly used to travel to and from the launch control facility, and would have been parked here. A large garage hidden out of sight behind the main building heId a front end loader for use in clearing snow in the winter. On occasion, Delta-01 might have hosted overnight larger vehicles for maintenance or transport. Over the years the missile field operated in South Dakota, road networks continued to be maintained through federal funds to accommodate Air Force personnel and maintenance activities. Area businesses also benefited from traveling missile crews. With the introduction of Air Force personnel regularly traveling through the area, Wall Drug began advertising free coffee and donuts for Minuteman missile crews. This eventually led to free coffee and donuts to all veterans, truck drivers, hunters, snowmobilers, and honeymooners.",

            "transcript": "Hi, I’m Sarah with Preventative Search and Rescue. In this podcast we’re going to discuss some self-rescue tips and common problems encountered by hikers on the trail. One of the great things about Grand Canyon hikers is that they tend to look out for each other. If you are seriously sick or hurt on the trail don’t be afraid to ask other hikers to look for a ranger for assistance. Emergency phones are located at 1 ½ mile resthouse, 3 mile rest house, Indian Garden and Pipe Creek on the Bright Angel Trail, and at the trail head and Tip-off on the South Kaibab. You may be able to use one of the emergency phones to call for assistance, or you may be able to send another hiker to call for you. Make sure that hiker is able to describe what kind of problem you are having, and where you are located. Let’s stop and talk with this hiker. He looks like he’s not feeling well. Sarah: Hi, I’m Sarah. I’m one of the Rangers here at Grand Canyon. Can I help you today? Hiker 2: Yeah, I’m really tired, my legs are all cramped up and I threw up a couple of times. Sarah: How long has this been going on? Hiker 2: Well, I hiked out from Phantom Ranch with my friends this morning about 4 am. I was really tired starting out. I’ve had a cold for a couple days and last night I couldn’t sleep. I spent the whole night coughing. This morning I tried to eat breakfast but I couldn’t get myself to eat much. I live in Los Angeles so the altitude is getting to me but I didn’t want to slow my friends down. I hiked as fast as I could this morning but by the time we got to 3 mile resthouse I was just beat. I told the other guys to keep going and I’d see them at the top. But now I feel like I can’t do anything. Sarah: What have you had to eat and drink this morning? Hiker 2: I’ve had about 1 liter of water and 2 little granola bars. I read the sign at the trailhead about eating salty food but all I had was this spicy trail mix and I couldn’t eat it. Sarah: Sounds like you could use some more food, some water and electrolytes. I’ve got some plain saltine crackers with me. They’ll give you some calories and help settle your stomach. And I’ll mix up some electrolyte drink for you too. For right now just rest here in the shade and try to eat and drink slowly. Are you too hot or too cold? Hiker 2: I’m ok, I put my jacket on when I sat down. Sarah: Good thinking. I’m going to stay here with you for a while and we’ll see if you feel better after some rest, food and electrolytes. Some of the most common problems I see on the trail are fatigue, nausea and leg cramps. Many times these problems are caused by the early stages of hyponatremia, or too little salt, along with too few calories for a high level of exertion. This hiker has done several things right. When he got tired he sat down in the shade to rest, and he has tried to eat and drink this morning. Although he’s feeling sick right now, many times these problems can be resolved with rest, salty food, water and electrolytes. Sarah: How are you feeling now? Hiker 2: I feel a lot better. I was able to eat some crackers and pretzels and drink some electrolytes. My leg cramps and my stomachache are gone. I think I can keep walking now. Sarah: Great! I’ll walk up the trail with you and make sure you are ok. Just take it slow and rest whenever you need to. We have as much time as you need. If you still feel sick when we get to the top there is an Urgent Care Clinic at the South Rim. In the summer the Clinic is open from 8 am to 6 pm every day. Before we finish this podcast, let’s go over a few quick tips on self-rescue: 1) Stop and rest when you start to feel tired rather than waiting until you are completely exhausted. 2) Your body can’t hike hard and digest food at the same time. Rest in the shade for at least 30 minutes when you stop to eat. This will give your body time to digest the food and fuel your tired muscles. If you are still tired after 30 minutes, keep resting. 3) Stop and fix small problems while they are still small. If you ignore your body and keep pushing the pain or illness will get worse and may make recovery more difficult. 4) Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm on hot days. If you are on the trail between 10 and 4 find a shady spot and stay there until the temperature cools down. Adjust you’re hiking pace to what you can comfortably maintain, and rest when you need to. Have the slowest member of your group set the pace. In our next podcast we’ll go on a virtual rescue and find out how rangers help hikers who are seriously ill or injured and require advanced medical care. It’s going to be exciting so make sure you take this opportunity to rest, eat some lunch and get rehydrated. See you in podcast #5.",

            "transcript": "007 (Grade 5) Slanted Wayside Panel: On to Oregon! 662 words / Panel Description: 4.5 minutes In front of you, is a panel 3 feet wide by 2 feet tall, and about 3 feet off the ground, on dark brown painted aluminum posts. In metric, that is about 1 meter wide by a half meter tall, and about 1 meter off the ground. This exhibit is mounted on a concrete slab along a curved concrete trail. Behind the panel, are some bushes. There is a wood fence, about 3 feet or 1 meter tall, along the edge of the lawn, next to Wayne City Road. This road was historically part of the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California National Historic Trails. Across the top of the panel, is a black banner that lists the partner organizations associated with these National Historic Trails. At left, across the top of the panel, is dark text on a light blue background: On to Oregon! Many of the travelers who moved through the Kansas City area were heading for the Oregon Trail. In 1845, about 5,000 emigrants walked and rode from Missouri to Oregon. These were hopeful families seeking land and opportunity. They came by steamboat on the Missouri River. Then they made their way to town to stock up on supplies. For those who arrived at the Independence Landing, climbing this hill was the first of many challenges. Over the next 5 months, they would travel as far as 2,000 miles, or 3,219 kilometers. Many lost people, animals, and possessions along the way. Families felt both fear and excitement as they traveled the road to Independence. End of Text A color illustration of a winding trail fills the panel. This trail follows the same route as Wayne City Road. The trail is filled with wooden wagons with round cream-colored canvas tops. The wagons are pulled by either a pair of mules or a team of 4 oxen. In the foreground, at the right, are 5 people and a brown and white dog. Among them, a boy and a girl run ahead of the first wagon with their gazes forward. 2 women in pale dresses walk behind them. 1 woman wears a wide-brimmed tan hat. In the bottom center of the panel, a girl in a blue dress runs ahead of the wagon. She is looking ahead and smiling. 2 women sit at the front of the first wagon. The woman on the left is wearing a purple top and holds the reins for the mules. The woman on the right is wearing a red top. A small yellow dog sits beside her. To the left of the first wagon, is another covered wagon stopped on the side of the trail. A man and a woman tend to the front pair of yoked oxen. A third person kneels by the rear spoked wagon wheel. Similarly sized wagons follow behind along the winding trail. The dirt trail is bordered by ankle-deep green grass and meanders through a hilly green landscape. In the distance, along the horizon line, 2 steam ships are docked along a blue river. Steam billows from several buildings behind the ships. Light blue sky fills the top third of the panel. In the top right corner of the panel, is an inset map. North is toward the top of the panel. Most of the map is green. Roads are gray and the blue Missouri River curves from the top of the left side, to the right side of the top of the map. You are at the Upper Independence Landing, or Wayne City, Overlook, near the top right corner of the map. 3 trails are shown in the right, or east, half of the map: the Santa Fe Trail in yellow, the Oregon Trail in orange, and the California Trail in pink. All 3 trails continue south through the Upper Independence Landing, or Wayne City, Overlook to Independence Square, near the bottom right corner of the map. Below the map, is white text on a dark background: It was about 3.5 miles, or 5.6 kilometers, from the boat landing to Independence. The first stretch followed switchbacks up a steep hill.

            "transcript": "On Hale Farm they have what they call the sugar bush, where they made maple syrup. We had to tap the trees and hang a bucket on ‘em and put a lid on the bucket to keep the rain out. Hale was sorta fussy about his trees. He wouldn’t let you put but one bucket on the tree. And he made the syrup, generally. He was there. Had a high stool—I don’t know whatever happened to that high chair—that was about six foot high. He could set up in that and he'd oversee the whole operation. See, you'd haul the--we had a big sled or something with a team of horses and pull it in when you got it full. And up in back they had a vat, I guess you'd call it, and we'd dump it into this vat and then it would go down inside, into the--they had a, like a table like this and they started down here, in different sections, and they'd run it in here and it'd siphon from one to the other up to the end where they--when you took it off. And he'd have to tell how--it had to meet certain specifications, had to be 11 or 12 pounds to the gallon or something like that. You know syrup was expensive then 'cause you could get about $2.75 a gallon for it! And he had parties there all the time, on Saturday, they call 'em taffy parties or something. He'd make taffy and have all these people comin' out. It was pretty good. It was interesting: it was hard work, but it was interesting.",

But it looks like a Hemigrapsis [Asian Shore Crab], which is an invasive crab that came here about, oh, 30 years ago and now there are millions of them in the bay. And they compete. They eat other crabs. They’re just considered an invasive, highly invasive species that’s not desirable. Intern 1: Are there any turtles in this? I know like—on this particular marsh, are there any turtles? GF: I haven’t seen a live turtle here. I’ve seen gulls dropping them on the marsh. Intern 1: Oh my god. GF: But I’m sure they use the marsh edges for feeding in the creeks, those tiny creeks around the marsh. But currently, the rim road of the West Pond currently gets about 300 turtle nests per year. Intern 1: Oh my gosh, that’s cool. GF: At least, maybe more. But 20 years ago, it was more like 2,000. Intern 1: Wow. GF: So the numbers are greatly declining— Intern 1: Yeah. GF: —in this part of Jamaica Bay. But at Kennedy Airport, has huge numbers of turtles coming onto the shores. Intern 1: Oh interesting. Intern 2: I actually read—heard about that. They had to slow down flights because turtles were on their tracks, on their plane tracks, like herds of them. GF: Yeah, they’re getting thousands of turtles there. Intern 2: Cause they always go back to the water at like in the morning, the early morning. I remember in Wantagh Park, you’d always see multiple lines of turtles going into the water at like 5am. GF: They come onto the rim road. Quite a few of them lay their nest—their egg in holes on the rim road actually. And others adjacent to the rim road. During June and July, you spend two or three half days there, you’ll probably see some nesting terrapins.",

            "transcript": "If you look beyond the tallgrass prairie, on the horizon, you can see a red barn with white trim tucked beneath some trees. This 3-level wooden barn, part of the Miles Farmstead, is the only agricultural structure in the area that survives from the time when Hoover was a young boy. (sound effects: native birds) Isaac Miles was a widower with two young daughters when he moved to West Branch in 1874 and opened a drugstore. Three years later, he met and married a young woman, who had inherited 100 acres of farmland to the southwest of the Hoover cottage. So Miles sold his drugstore and decided to give farming a try. And as soon as the two-story frame house and barn were built, the new family moved in. Isaac's daughters, Providence and Abbie were around the same age as the Hoover children, and it's likely they played together in this rural playground filled with natural wonders. (music) Iowa farmsteads were laid out according to the character of the land. Rolling hills could serve as pasture or as a partial support for buildings like a barn. Where the ground was flat, crops were planted; (sound effects: chickens, rooster) outbuildings like chicken coops were constructed close to the home, but definitely downwind, to make for a short walk in the winter. And a road was leveled to give the farmer access to railroads and markets where he could sell his harvest. An 1880 census showed that Miles had managed to get 73 acres under cultivation with corn, oats, rye, potatoes, and apples. He also raised 5 milk cows, 5 beef cattle, 55 pigs, and 20 chickens. Farming did provide for Isaac and his family, but in 1882, Isaac became involved with his father Benjamin in the establishment of a Quaker-inspired school to educate Native American children in the industrial arts. It was during this time, when some of the Osage, Cheyenne, and Arapaho children lived and worked on the Miles Farm, that 8-year old Bert Hoover fished and hunted the countryside with them, learned the lore of the woods, and how to make bows and arrows.",

            "transcript": "Park Postcards Podcast Episode Seven Marin Headlands TRANSCRIPT Welcome and General description - Ranger Mariajose Alcantara: Happy 2021 everyone! This is Golden Gate National Recreation Area’s Park Postcards Podcast! This is a podcast where each episode introduces you to what makes each park site unique, through the voice of community members who have visited, and our park rangers and staff partners who work there. We aim to highlight the work we do to connect our local community groups to the special places in our park, and share what these places and experiences mean to them. The beauty of our outreach work is collaborating with diverse community members and newcomers to introduce them and welcome them to their National Parks. We hope that through listening to these “audio postcards”, you get excited to visit Golden Gate National Recreation Area in a healthy and safe future! Introduction to Podcast - Ranger Mariajose Alcantara: You’re tuned in to episode seven featuring two guests who absolutely love the Marin Headlands as much as I do. This is your friend and host, Ranger Mariajose. The Marin Headlands is the most magical place of the GGNRA, at least in my opinion as a former Headlands ranger. From 2008 through 2018, I had the privilege to live in the historic military barracks at Fort Cronkhite and Fort Barry, where I woke up to the chuckles of quails and elephant seals, and fell asleep to relaxing foghorns as I saw the shadows of deer pass my windows. I’ll never forget the evenings spent hiking the hills at sunset and making friends with a skunk who would walk me home from the visitor center. I am thrilled to introduce our guest Carmen DeLeon, who will share her audio postcard from the Headlands. She’s an environmental educator, born and raised in San Francisco. She studied wildlife biology at UC Davis and natural resources at the University of Idaho before flying back to the bay as fast as possible! She has worked both for the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory and Nature Bridge- one of our park partners. Carmen got to know the Headlands landscape through work and daily life, also as a resident in the historic housing. She is currently a volunteer leader at the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory where she has supported the science of protecting migratory raptors since 2008. Let’s hear her story: Special Guest from Golden Gate National Raptor Observatory – Carmen DeLeon’s Postcard: Hey there, it's Carmen and I'm coming to you from Hawk Hill in the Marin headlands. Whenever I set foot in the headlands, I'm transported to my favorite memory of hawk hill where I get to spend time as a volunteer bird bander and docent. come along with me for a day on Hawk Hill as we remember the very first bird I was able to band with the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory. I was a brand new intern on my first real adventure working in the world of wildlife biology. It’s the month of August affectionately called “Fogust” by a lot of us volunteers, and we drive up the windy road toward our field site gazing at the rolling Bay waves below and watching for birds along the signposts. we climbed the trail to Hawk Hill with the gravel crunching beneath our feet and nimbly avoiding the Lupine plants to approach the bird blind. The bird blind is kind of like a hideaway where we can sit to avoid disturbing the landscape and wildlife when we do our work to monitor the migrating Raptors. my teammates and I cheer and give each other high fives as we see the blue sky break through the fog and feel the northwest wind. We eagerly watch the sky. Suddenly! an American Kestrel the smallest falcon in North America, flies into one of the vertical threadlike nets at the field site. I quickly darted outside and gently scoop her up protecting her folded wings and lightly placing my fingers around her yellow legs. Though I work fast to keep her calm and safe, the world stops for a moment as I notice how perfectly each tiny feather lays across her face. The darkness of her eyes is striking we bring the kestrel into the cool dark space of the bird blinds, measure her, and use special pliers to apply a metal anklet- the bird band. It has a unique number to help us track her movements over hopefully long and healthy life. After we collect the measurement data, it's important to return our banded birds to their migration quickly so they have time to find food to continue their journey and shelter to rest each night. Our encounter lasts just 15 minutes before our Kestrel is back on her way hovering along the hillsides in search of tasty dragon flies. Even though I can't bring everyone with me on a field day bird banding, I think you should definitely check out the view from a hike to Hawk Hill. There's always something new to notice any time of year from whales spy hopping, to resident Ravens preening their shiny feathers. Be sure to bring binoculars, and wear lots of layers, the weather here can change suddenly from sunny and warm to fog so thick that you feel like you're on a rocky island with only the bellowing foghorns to remind you that there is water below. Hawk Hill is a place where I come to reflect and to refresh as I think about the dynamics of migration, movement as natural as the rhythm of our breath, for both people and wildlife. It's such an honor to know that my appreciation for this place and raptors also contributes to important work for conservation. I hope that you can enjoy it too as we all embrace nature and the outdoors in our own unique ways. Transition to Ranger Cordelia - Ranger Mariajose” I feel like I was right there with you Carmen! Thanks for inviting us into your vivid memories of the Headlands! Now let’s hear from our ranger friend and my colleague Cordelia Vargas who has been working in the Marin Headlands since May of 2019. Cordelia has a Bachelor's in Environmental Studies, and minor in Feminist Studies from UC Santa Barbara. She’s super passionate about social justice and has researched indigenous Miwok history, women of the Nike Missile Site, and Marincello- the housing project that never came to be in the headlands. Ranger Cordelia recently coordinated social science surveys throughout the Headlands to assess visitor interactions and safety throughout the pandemic. Since the Headlands is a bird haven, of course Cordelia is also a bird lover who enjoys the outdoors and has inspired hundreds of visitors to also fall in love with her park site. Let’s hear some of her interpretation and what she loves best about working as a Ranger in the Marin Headlands. Ranger Cordelia Vargas’ Postcard and Marin Headlands Interpretation: Hello, my name is Cordelia Vargas, and I am a Park Ranger in the Marin Headlands, which is on the ancestral lands of the Coast Miwok. Why do I love working in the Marin Headlands? I’ve actually had a pretty hard time answering this question because there are so many things I love about this place. For one, I am kind of a bird nerd and the Marin Headlands has so many birds to enjoy. We have the raptor migration here in the fall, but really any time of year you’re going to see tons of turkey vultures, hawks, and harriers all soaring over the headland hills. There are a bunch of different wading birds and sea birds that frequent the Rodeo Lagoon, like the Great egret and double crested cormorants. There are peregrine falcons that nest by the Point Bonita Lighthouse, and if you are lucky you might see a great horned owl if you visit here at night! You could truly do a tour of the headlands revolving around birds. A couple of months ago actually, I was hiking by Rodeo Lagoon, and as I approached, I could hear this loud splashing in the distance. It almost sounded like rain and I was confused because it was sunny. I thought, “What on earth is that?” and as I got past the tall fennel blocking my view, I could see down into the lagoon where there was a massive flock of brown pelicans. They were just flapping away, splashing in the water, fishing, preening, and enjoying the lagoon. It brings me so much joy to see all these amazing creatures right in my office, so to speak. Ultimately though, I’d say my favorite aspect about working here is that I get to share what I know and love about the Marin Headlands with visitors. Whether it be sharing the history of all of our military batteries from World Wars I and II, peering through a visitor’s binoculars and helping them identify a bird they’ve never seen before, or sharing the story of how community activism stopped the Marin Headlands from becoming housing and helped it become a national park in 1972. Among my favorite aspects of this job has been leading tours down to the Point Bonita Lighthouse. I love to surprise people with the fact that where the lighthouse stands today is not where it was originally built in 1855. It was originally built high up on a cliff hundreds of feet above the water, close to where the radar tower is today. But this lighthouse was only the 4th one built on the west coast of the United States, so there were environmental conditions they didn’t quite take into consideration, and by that I mean the dense fog we have here! It rendered the lighthouse basically useless in its original location. So in 1877, the lighthouse was moved to where it stands today at the very point of Point Bonita, but to do that required the building of a tunnel through unforgiving basalt rock, rock that formed 300 million years ago from volcanoes erupting and cooling underwater. The tunnel that we can walk through easily in a matter of moments to reach the lighthouse today, took Chinese-American railroad workers 4 months of carving by hand to make that trip possible. The history of our lighthouse is a rich one, and reflecting on how this light has been a guide to ships, allows us to examine how we can be guiding lights to the people in our lives. Now I am a little biased, but I believe that anytime to visit the Marin Headlands is the best time. If you visit on a foggy day, the moisture in the air captures the earthy perfume of the coastal sagebrush flora here and its pretty remarkable. But if you want to catch the iconic views we have of the golden gate bridge, you’re going to have a better chance seeing those views unobstructed by fog if you visit during the spring and fall months. Karl the fog tends to ease up around those times of year, but there are of course no guarantees. As our sites re-open, like the Point Bonita Lighthouse, they’ll only be open on specific days and times so be sure to check on our official national park service website for the most up to date information. Getting outdoors and enjoying nature can be so beneficial for one’s physical and mental health, and to do this while we face COVID-19, please wear a mask out on the trails when you cannot social distance from others. Consider visiting earlier in the day, or to less frequented areas to avoid the crowds. I also recommend bringing layers anytime you visit. It could be sunny and warm everywhere else in the San Francisco Bay, and it could still be cold and foggy in the headlands. I hope that giving this a listen sparked your curiosity about this fascinating and beautiful place, and I invite you to come give us a visit! We hope to see you safely and soon. Conclusion - Ranger Mariajose: Thank you Ranger Cordelia for the valuable tips on visiting the magical Headlands, and for sharing some of its history with us! I’ll keep and ear and eye out for splashing pelicans on my next visit too! And I want to thank you podcast friends for tuning in! We are happy to have explored the Marin Headlands with you on this episode, and we hope you will join us again on future episodes that will feature other park sites around the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Stay tuned for episode eight! We’ll feature Lands End and we’ll hear from our park partner Yakuta Poonawalla from the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy and former park intern Jainita Patel, who have shared both of their Park Postcard.

            "transcript": "At this location the famed 19th Century artist and photographer William Henry Jackson camped here in 1866 along with the freighting company he worked. Earlier that year Jackson found himself in Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory – a jumping off point for freighting caravans headed west. Despite lacking any experience handling oxen or hauling freight, Jackson signed on as bullwhacker for an outfit bound for Montana. Along the trail he sketched the sites he saw and the people he met. Jackson was a gifted artist and found that his journey west was filled with new inspiration. Jackson left the freight caravan near South Pass in present day Wyoming and headed south for Salt Lake City and eventually California. His experiences in the West struck a chord in him, and he realized that documenting the settling of the frontier might become his life’s work. It is through Jackson’s images of the frontier coupled with the first hand experiences found in emigrant dairies that we have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of what life truly was like along the Oregon Trail. If you would like to learn more about William Henry Jackson and his works please visit the park’s museum and tour the William Henry Jackson Room where you will find reprints of some of his watercolors and photographs. From here the historic trails make their way north returning to the banks of the North Platte River and westward to the mountains. We hope that you have enjoyed your walk and tour, and that we have given you a better understanding of the Oregon Trail and the people who traveled it. This concludes the Oregon Trail cell phone tour.",

            "transcript": "The stone slabs in front of you are all that remain of the home of Neil McCoull, who owned 600 acres and enslaved six people here. His house, built in 1846, stood here until it burned down in 1920. McCoull, too old to serve in the army, was nonetheless an ardent supporter of the Confederacy. During the battle, members of the McCoull family hid in the basement while the rest of the house served as headquarters for Confederate general Edward Johnson, until his capture on May 12. As dawn slowly began to creep across the horizon on May 13, 1864, the surviving Confederate forces were pulled out of the Bloody Angle and ordered back to Lee’s Last Line, which had been completed over the course of the night. Mississippian David Holt, who had fought through most of the battle’s worst carnage, provided a visceral testimony to the Bloody Angle’s aftermath. “We halted in a pasture and broke ranks,” he wrote. “Then came the reaction. All moved by the same impulse, we sat down on the wet ground and wept. Not silently, but vociferously and long. . . . We were covered with bloody mud from head to foot. Soon we got rations of corndodger and fried bacon, but not a man could eat.” Back at the Bloody Angle, the U.S. forces realized their Confederate foe had retreated. Weary and cautiously, the Union soldiers peered over the trenches that had been the dividing line for the last 24 hours. Realizing the salient was theirs, the Union soldiers slowly began to creep forward. They found the horrors of the Bloody Angle fully illuminated by the day’s new lights. One Massachusetts officer wrote, “the dead were piled in heaps upon heaps and the wounded men were intermixed with them, held fast by their dead companions who fell upon them continually adding to the ghastly pile.” Both armies, as if shocked by the horror that had just unfolded, remained in their positions throughout May 13. Besides some light skirmishing, there were no major attacks. Grant wrote to his wife on May 13, “The world has never seen so bloody or so protracted a battle as the one being fought and I hope never will again.” The fighting resumed on May 14. Looking to the south, Grant and Meade tried to catch Lee off guard by shifting troops to the Confederates’ right, but the Federals were rebuffed. Constant rain stalled both armies and frustrated Grant’s attempts at getting around Lee. As Lee continued to slide soldiers over to face the Federal movements, Grant figured Lee’s center was now weak and open to attack. He determined to attack Lee’s Last Line by attacking from the Bloody Angle and covering this ground, advancing towards the Harrison House in the distance. On May 17, the tired Union soldiers tramped once again into position. By the morning of May 18, nearly 12,000 Federal soldiers from three corps had arranged themselves to attack Lee’s position. It required the Federals to assemble near the Bloody Angle, where, after almost a week since the fighting on May 12, many of the dead remained unburied. Some Union soldiers stuffed leaves into their noses to protect themselves from the overwhelming stench. It was not enough, for some, though. “The stench which arose from them was so sickening and terrible that many of the men and officers became deathly sick from it,” one U.S. soldier wrote. Federal cannon opened fire on the distant Confederate trenches before the U.S. infantry swept forward. This time, though, there would be no breach in Lee’s lines or desperate hand-to-hand combat. Studded with almost 30 cannon, the Confederate trenches were nearly impregnable. The artillery blasted away at the Federal lines, cutting great gaps away as the blue-coated soldiers crossed this ground trying to get to the Harrison House and beyond. One Confederate artillerist recollected that, “Vainly do they endeavor to press forward—again and again we break them, and their officers uselessly dash up and down their lines, endeavoring to hurl them upon our works. . .. They are but food for our gunpowder.” Before the Federal infantry even got within musket range, the attack was turned back, and the survivors retreated. With the failure of the attack on May 18, Grant and Meade reached the conclusion that they had done everything they could do at Spotsylvania. It had been ten days since the battle began, and they were no closer to breaking through Lee’s lines than they had been on May 8. Similarly to how Grant outflanked Lee to the south following the battle of the Wilderness, Grant once more began to look for ways to get around Lee.",

            "transcript": "In Lakin, Sandburg took advantage of the Kansas wheat harvest by working for another threshing crew for about three weeks. The work came easier with getting used to it. The dust in your nose and eyes, the chaff sliding down your sweating back, you got used to. One evening at six o'clock the boss said there was only two hours of threshing left and a full moon would be up. We ate supper, at seven went on threshing by the light of a bright full moon, and finished at nine o'clock. On Sandburg's trip out of Lakin, a \"shack\" (train brakeman) kicked him off the bumpers of a fast freight. Riding the bumpers refers to standing on the couplers between two cars and keeping hold of the brake rod for stability. It was extremely dangerous.",

            "transcript": "While Longstreet's wounding may have been a lucky break for the Federals, it would not have done them very much good if they had not made the proper preparations the evening before. Unlike the Confederate 3rd Corps, the US 2nd Corps had spent the night entrenching. Here at the intersection and stretching to the north and south, US troops dug several lines of trenches and earthworks along the Brock Road. As they retreated towards the road, these defenses made natural rallying points. South of the Orange Plank Road, the US troops, were shattered, but to the north, protected from the worst of the flank attack, many of the regiments came back largely intact. Taking up positions behind their trenches, these regiments were ready to defend the vital Brock Road in relatively short order. Shattered as they were, many of the Union soldiers on the south side of the Orange Plank Road began working on reorganizing and solidifying their lines for another fight behind the protection of trenches. \"It was our one hope – shattered, fatigued, and out of ammunition as we were by this time – to get across the parapet and, after a short rest in the hollow ground in the rear, to re-form and be ready again for action.\" Thomas Galwey 8th Ohio. Winfield S. Hancock, commanding the 2nd Corps, threw his energies into reorganizing and preparing his command for the inevitable Confederate attack. Around 4:15, Confederate troops beat back the US picket lines and began to slam into the Federal trenches. Lee hoped to simply smash through the Federal battle line with pure brute force. For half an hour, the Confederates blasted away at the US positions, however, the Union soldiers were well protected as they poured lethal rifle fire into the stubborn and exposed Confederates . A chance to break the US line came when a portion of the trenches here caught fire, forcing the defenders to abandon them. Confederates seized the opportunity and broke through right in front of a US artillery battery, which loaded their guns with canister—cans of iron balls—turning them into giant shotguns. US infantry surged into the breach and beat the Confederates back in hand-to-hand fighting. By 6 pm, the Confederate attack had failed, leaving Lee little more than a long causality list to show for it. On the north side of the battlefield, back at Saunders’ Field, the Confederates tried one more attack and struck the Federal flank there, but it came too late in the day, and the setting of the sun all but ended the battle of the Wilderness on the evening of May 6. On May 7th, Grant and Meade had a hard decision to make. More than 29,000 men were dead, missing, or wounded, 17,666 Federals and approximately 11,400 Confederates. It became clear to them that any more fighting where they were was useless. They had tried everything they could, and none of it had worked. At any other point in the war, the two armies would have separated. They would have spent the next few weeks or even months recovering from their fight before either made a move. But this was not any other point in the war, and Lincoln was about to find out. On May 6th Henry Wing, a correspondent from the New York Tribune, left the battlefield for Washington with reports of the first day of the battle. As it would turn out he would be the first person to bring any news of the fighting to the national capital. Haggling for time on a US government telegraph line in Union Mills 20 miles from DC, his report came to the attention of Lincoln himself. Wing was transported to the White House to report on the situation directly to the President. Wing revealed that before leaving the wilderness Grant have given him a message for the president. Grant’s message was simple “Well, if you see the President, tell him from me that, whatever happens, there will be no turning back.” Lincoln was so overjoyed by this news that he lifted Wing off the ground in a bear hug and planted a kiss on the messenger's forehead. For more than three years, Lincoln had been looking for a General that would stand his ground and finally fight the war to a finish. Now he knew he had finally found one. As soon as the sun set on May 7, the Army of the Potomac marched for Spotsylvania Courthouse. There, Grant hoped to return to the original plan of getting in between Lee and Richmond. For the first time, the Army of the Potomac had fought the enemy and made the decision to keep the initiative; to force Lee to react to them, rather than the other way around. For the next 11 months, the Army of the Potomac would only do two things. They were either fighting the Confederates, or marching to the next fight. The Battle of the Wilderness was the beginning of the end for the Army of Northern Virginia. But first, the two armies would come to blows once again, just 10 miles down the Brock Road around the Spotsylvania County Courthouse.",

They shipped milk out of there every day in big cans, 10 gallon milk cans. You see them old cans? They would take them out to the road and the truck, Chick Ross was his name, would drive his truck down and pick that stuff up, take it to Akron to the dairy and have it, you know, bottled and everything. They raised Holstein cattle, I think it was there, and they raised the babies on up, you know, they had raised the little calves on up to big cows and everything. So it was quite a park and they did a lot of farming. They raised a lot of their own grain like corn for the animals and things of that nature. And they had several people work there and a couple of tractors and a lot of big equipment. I thought that was a really big place, you know. And it was a pretty nice farm but it finally dwindled away, I don't know whatever happened to it. The building is still there, the house though. But the rest of the buildings, the barn and all that, is gone. But that's the same building.”",

Each episode will introduce you to what makes each park site unique, through the voice of community members who have visited, and our park rangers and staff partners who work there. We aim to highlight the work we do to connect our local community groups to the special places in our park and share what these places and experiences mean to them. The beauty of our outreach work is collaborating with diverse community members and newcomers to introduce them and welcome them to their National Parks. We hope that through listening to these ‘audio postcards’, you get excited to visit Golden Gate National Recreation Area in a healthy and safe future!” Transition to Community Speakers: Ranger Fatima “Hello everyone, welcome to Episode 6 of the Park Postcards podcast. My name is Fatima Colindres, and I am park ranger with the Golden Gate National Recreation Area’s Community Programs and Outreach team. As part of outreach work we collaborate with community group leaders and park partners to bring non-traditional park users to their National Park. It is my pleasure to introduce Betty Delaney and Erica Choy, two members of the Rafiki Coalition, an organization located in the Bayview, which has the mission to ‘eliminate health inequities in San Francisco’s Black and marginalized communities through education, advocacy, and by providing holistic health and wellness services in a culturally affirming environment.’ . They will be sharing their memories of a recent walk in the Presidio of San Francisco, when they explored the Tennessee Hollow watershed restoration from Crissy Field Marsh to the Main Post.” Community Speaker’s Postcard: Betty Delaney – Rafiki Coalition Community Member “My name is Betty I'm from San Francisco. I'm a native to San Francisco and I love the Presidio. Today I took a short walk and we were taking a break at the Redwood Grove, and I would encourage you to come here because you get to see, not only what was - in terms of how they're doing the development of the watershed - but you get to go through the shaded area of the redwoods. You can sit on the benches that have been recycled from trees from the Presidio, and you can enjoy all the beauty of the nature in this one segment of the Presidio. Thank you for the wonderful opportunity to see the Presidio, for all the work being done by the people, and I encourage you to come be a part of it.” Community Speaker’s Postcard: Erica Choy – Rafiki Coalition Community Member “Hi my name is Erica and I just wanted to give an ending to my nice hike or walk that we just took with Miss Amy and Miss Rebekah. As a San Francisco resident a lot of times we take for granted that there's so many beautiful places here within the city, that we actually don't even know they exist! My children did attend the Presidio Child Development Center, so I was familiar a little bit with the area, but I've always loved this area. So thank you for making this possible for us, and that I didn't have to pay to come to this nice tour. Sometimes that can also be a hindrance for low income families, so but I was very glad and I really enjoyed it. I have back problems, I have a knee problem, and I thoroughly enjoyed this this walk. It was very encouraging just talking to the different people in the group, very comforting, very stress free, very relaxing. So thank you for making this possible. So I invite anybody from the city, you know come and see this gem that our beautiful city has to offer, and all the wonderful work that is still in progress, but at the end you know is going to be done, and so thank you for making this possible for us, thank you very much have a good weekend.” Transition to Amy Deck: Ranger Fatima “Thank you Betty and Erica for sharing your memories. As you described your experience, I traveled back in time to 1998 when I first started working in the Presidio, when Thompsons reach and the Redwood Grove did not exist and all that was there in its place was a field of tall non-indigenous grass, and nothing else. Wow! How this place has changed! Next I would like to introduce Amy Deck, who works for our partner agency, the Presidio Trust. She will share the story of the Tennessee Hollow watershed and all the new transformations taking place right now in your park.” Amy Deck’s Postcard and Presidio Projects overview: “Hi my name is Amy Deck and I work for the Presidio Trust in our Community Partnerships Department. I'm going to talk about a trip to the Presidio with the Rafiki Coalition, a group from the Bayview neighborhood in San Francisco. We are learning how to engage with communities in different ways during the pandemic, and this was one of our first safe walks with masks and social distancing in place. The Rafiki Coalition is a longtime partner, and it was wonderful to get outdoors and welcome these friends back to the park. On a beautiful Fall sunny day with a slight breeze, we took a walk through the northern part of the Tennessee Hollow watershed - and I have to share that I was nearly moved to tears to see the amazing work that has been made on the Tunnel Tops Project and the restoration of the Quartermaster Reach Marsh project. The Tunnel Tops project is well underway and is planned to be open in October of 2021. The Quartermaster Reach project is one of the last projects in our efforts to revitalize the Tennessee Hollow watershed. For well over a decade, the Presidio Trust, with our partners, has been revitalizing sections of the watershed. This means that creeks have been brought back above ground, native habitats have been restored, Army landfills have been removed, trails and playing fields are being upgraded, and the history of those who once lived here is being shared. Volunteers have been key to this ongoing work by caring for these newly created habitats, by planting and weeding. We met at the Sports Basement parking lot, and we were so thrilled to see the new terminus for the Muni 30 Stockton - it now comes straight into Crissy Field. We were able to see the Tunnel Tops new trails and overlooks taking shape, and the channel cut in the Marsh restoration project. We talked about the watershed and how after many years of restoration projects, this section of the freshwater Creek has been brought back to the daylight after running through pipes for many years. It was very interesting to be here at a time where we could see the formation of the creek, and talk about how our natural resource specialists have a plan to draw oysters from the Bay into this new habitat using oyster shells gathered from restaurants. We walked up the Tennessee hollow trail and took a rest at the Wayburn Redwood Grove - which I'm pretty sure was Betty's favorite spot. The Grove was dedicated to Ed and Peggy Wayburn, who advocated for the preservation of America's wild open spaces and the establishment of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which the Presidio is a part of. This Redwood Grove overlooks Thompson's Reach, which was a riparian restoration project that was completed in 2005 and connects to the Quartermaster Reach. We walked up towards the Main Post where we were able to see a new topographic map that's positioned right in front of the fire station. It was a wonderful way to see the entire watershed. Overall, it was a fantastic walk and visit with some of our beloved community partners. I encourage you to come back to enjoy the Presidio, your National Park “ [Background music escalates to a more upbeat rhythm: “Trail” – Adobe Stock Music] Conclusion and looking ahead: Ranger Fatima “Thank you once again Betty, Erica and Amy for sharing your special memories of the Presidio visit to the incredible watershed restoration that can now be enjoyed by all visitors at The Presidio. For more information about the sites discussed today, visit https://www.presidio.gov/places And thank you podcast friends for tuning in! I hope you’ll join us again on future episodes that will feature other park sites around the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In our upcoming Episode 7 we’ll hear from Ranger Cordelia Vargas, our friend from the Marin Headlands, who’ll share her bird knowledge and highlights from her area of the park. Episode 8 we’re excited to hear from park partner Yakuta Poonawalla from the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy at Lands End. We can’t wait for you to hear them! Until then, stay safe and recreate responsibly in your National Parks!” [Background music fades out: “Trail” – Adobe Stock Music]",

            "transcript": "This location was once the site of the Bullock House, a small farming operation run by the Bullock family and five people they enslaved. Today the buildings that once stood here are gone, but the intersection between Bullock Road and Elys Ford Road is the same one travelled during the war. This region of Virginia was known as the Wilderness of Spotsylvania County. It was a sparsely populated area with more dense thickets and second growth forests than agricultural clearings. The Orange Turnpike, modern-day Route 3 , extended from Fredericksburg westward and passed through the Wilderness. About 4 miles north of this spot is the confluence of the Rapidan and Rappahannock Rivers. A network of roads connected the Orange Turnpike to the rivers, but there were also many informal paths that could make travelling here difficult without an accurate map. The Confederates spent the winter on this side of the river, so they were familiar with the terrain. While the Army of the Potomac did not have the same first-hand experience, Hooker’s intelligence gathering enabled him to plan and execute complicated troop movements. Hooker’s plan was to lay a trap for Robert E. Lee. He knew that the Army of the Potomac outnumbered the Army of Northern Virginia over 2 to 1 and that the Confederates were dependent on the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac railroad track for what little supplies they had. With these factors in mind, Hooker planned to split his army and surround Lee, force Lee out of his defensives at Fredericksburg, and cut the Confederate supply line. To cut off Lee’s supplies, Hooker would utilize almost his entire cavalry. On April 29, US cavalry under the command of General George Stoneman rode across the Rappahannock at Kelly’s Ford and set off on a deep sweeping raid into Lee’s rear. Their intention was to tear up railroad tracks, destroy bridges, and deprive the Confederates of supplies and reinforcements. Hooker deduced that if Lee lost access to the railroad, the Army of Northern Virginia would have to retreat. On April 27, portions of the Army of the Potomac began marching westward, aiming to go around and over the river to end up behind Lee’s Confederates in Fredericksburg. As the US forces began crossing Kelly’s Fords on April 28, the US 6th Corp, stationed across from Fredericksburg provided a distraction by loudly crossing the river and creating the illusion for observant Confederates that they would replicate the same mistakes made in December. This move encouraged Confederates to mass their forces on the hills outside of Fredericksburg. With Confederates focused to the east, Hooker’s troops completed their march around Lee. If Hooker’s plan succeeded, Lee would be sandwiched between US forces to his east and west, with a river above him, and no supplies coming from below. Once across Kelly’s Ford, the US troops split into two columns and raced to cross the Rapidan River at Germanna and Elys Ford. The crossing at Elys Ford is a little over 4 miles northwest of this location, up Elys Ford road. Confederates at the river crossings offered only minor resistance, but did send word to Lee about the US movements. On the morning of April 30, the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry was heading towards the Chancellorsville intersection from Elys Ford along Elys Ford Road, a 5-mile journey. Behind them was the rest of the US 5th Corps. Here at the Bullock’s clearing, about 1 mile from Chancellorsville, they collided with the 12th Virginia Infantry in a very brief engagement from which the Virginians quickly backed away. As more US forces passed this location on their way to the Chancellorsville intersection, it became clear that Hooker successfully managed to spirit the bulk of his army around Lee. Hooker was confident, declaring to the army that day, “the operations of the last three days have determined that our enemy must either ingloriously fly, or come out from behind his defenses and give us battle on our own ground, where certain destruction awaits him.” The troops that swept over the Bullock House Site at the beginning of the battle were optimistic as they marched towards the Chancellorsville intersection. That intersection would become the epicenter of US decision making over the next few days. Those optimistic US soldiers did not know how quickly and how dramatically Hooker’s plan would unravel.",

            "transcript": "Good day, and welcome. My name is Becca. I am a National Park Service ranger, working at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Today I would like to share with you a Canyon Cut brought to us by Ranger Doug. Ranger Doug has a story to share … a story of love, romance, and the Grand Canyon. The title is: CANYON CONNECTIONS A Canyon Romance … Times Three! I will let ranger Doug introduce himself. This … is his story. My name is Doug Crispin. I’m 68 years old and I live in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This is a story of my first visit to the Grand Canyon. I was 17. This was like the Chevy Chase classic station wagon family visit to the Grand Canyon. We left Southern Calif there actually three generations of us including our Grandma. She didn’t ride on the roof! She actually rode in the passenger compartment. The family ended up at Mather Point for the first time. We walked out. I can specifically remember looking down into the abyss and thinking “wow, This is awesome, this is great. The Grand Canyon is just really really cool. So I asked my parents … just drop me off and leave me. Which they did! But the back story is I went into the employment office and Fred Harvey, the park concessionaire, and I got a job working as a Bus Boy at the famous El Tovar hotel. Then I asked my parents to “drop me off and leave me”, which they did! And I spent the rest of my summer living and working at the Grand Canyon. How cool is that? Now, the job itself, you know, wasn’t very good: busing tables, and working six days a week, split shifts, take home pay 93 cents an hour. But, I got to live and work at the Grand Canyon so I told my roommate, Elmer, I said, we get off work at 10 o’clock tonight. And we have one day. Let’s hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. We loaded up our packs, and we headed straight down the Canyon when we got off work. Got down to the river maybe 2, 3, 4 in the morning, something like that. Had a quick snooze on the beach and then continued all the way down to Phantom Ranch. I can remember stripping off our clothes and jumping into the swimming pool located at Phantom Ranch. Looking all the way back up to the rim and thinking “wow, this is great, this is the life. Swimming at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.” Now we couldn’t enjoy it for too long, because we had to hike all the way back up and go to work the next day, which we did. But after my summer work season ended, I stayed on for another four days. And this time I took a more leisurely trip, all the way down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Camping the night at Indian Gardens, as well as Phantom Ranch. And more swimming in the Phantom Ranch swimming pool. Loving life! After … when it was time for me to go back home, I handed my camera to a tourist along the canyon rim. And I said, now watch … I’ll give you a signal and I want you to take my picture. Then I carefully climbed over the rim, which you are not supposed to do these days, I had found a little limestone opening, a natural rock arch and I crawled down over the rim, sat crossed-legged in this opening and I waved at the tourist and he took a couple pictures of me. Because I had a plan. I wanted to use that picture of me at the rim of the Grand Canyon for my senior Yearbook picture. It didn’t make the scrutiny, unfortunately, of my Yearbook Committee. But nevertheless, I didn’t care. It was my senior class picture taken at the Grand Canyon. I made small little copies, wrote corny sentiments on the back like seniors do, and handed it out to all my high school friend. That introduced me to the idea of living and working in the Grand Canyon which I thought … or in any national park, which I thought was pretty cool at the time. Now a few months later, on Veterans Day, I talked a few of my friends into driving all the way out, in November, to visit the Grand Canyon for the first time for three of my buddies. Now we needed a place to stay, and again, don’t do this today, it’s not legal, but I found a small, abandoned miner’s tunnel just below the rim, not too far from the El Tovar Hotel … maybe a mile away. And that’s where the four of us rolled out our sleeping bags. And for Veterans Day weekend in 1969, we slept in an abandoned miner’s tunnel. Had a great time. All my friends loved the Grand Canyon. And were very envious of me getting to spend the summer there in the park. Two years later I talked a friend of mine into hiking rim to rim to rim, which we did. And on our way up from the South Rim headed towards the North Rim, we camped at Cottonwood Campground. I was 19, my friend was 18 which put us at prime draft age as the Vietnam War was still raging in 1971. I was politically opposed to the Vietnam War, but, you know, if my draft number came up, then I would be faced a very important life decision. What’s going to happen? As luck would have it, the draft lottery selection occurred while we were at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. And spending a night in Cottonwood Campground, we met some hikers who had just hiked down from the North Rim. And they had a current newspaper with them that they were getting ready to burn in their campfire. We snagged that newspaper from them and we were able to look up our draft numbers as they had printed the draft lottery results. And that is where I found out, that my name would probably NOT going to show up on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington DC, which today contains over 58,000 names. So I have a very close attachment and affinity to Cottonwood Campground, in the bottom of the Grand Canyon, cause in a way, that kind of saved… may have saved my life, and saved me from going to Vietnam. I was starting to acquire and … an affection and a love for the Grand Canyon at a very early age. On that rim to rim to rim hike, I collected a small bottle of Colorado River, dirty, muddy, water as we crossed over it the second time. I took that back and had it for all these years at my college desk. Occasionally I would shake up this bottle and turn it all muddy. And a day or two later, I would see all that Colorado River sediment had settled out at the bottom. And that’s how I kind of remained connected to the Grand Canyon during my college years. Now when I graduated from college, I still on my mind, on the idea of working for parks as a possible career. I worked in another park concession job, I worked as a volunteer national park ranger, I worked park maintenance jobs, and eventually worked my way up to a permanent national park ranger job, which was, you know, a childhood dream of mine. In 1979 I started dating a former Grand Canyon National Park summertime ranger who had worked at Desert View as a fee collector. I met her working in parks in South East Utah. We started dating. And we started building a romance. A couple months after we started dating in ‘79, I got accepted in 1980, to go to the National Park Ranger school located at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. I was so impressed, my girlfriend would drive 250 miles, one way, from SE Utah, to visit me on her weekend. I thought that was a very special women that would do something that … just to see her new boyfriend. We continued to grow spiritually together, we started to have a spiritual connection to the lands of the American Southwest, the peoples, and the stories. And two years after my Grand Canyon ranger school, my friend contacted me and said “hey, I have permit to take rafts through the Grand Canyon. I am planning a 23-day trip. I would like to know if you and your girlfriend would to join me? I am only taking seven people, and six of the seven or either current or former national park rangers?” I said “heck, yea man, let’s go.” So that was a wonderful time to spend together, my girlfriend and I. Twenty-three days sleeping on a tent on sand bars, doing day hikes, fighting the rapids, and enjoying the Grand Canyon as only the way that rafters can. And two years after that I proposed to my wife and we actually got married, standing right on the rim of the Grand Canyon. A place called Shoshone Point. I can truthfully say that was one of the happiest days of my life. After getting married on the South Rim, we drove all the way to the North Rim spent our first honeymoon night together in a cabin at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. And we continued to spiritually connect with each other and the Grand Canyon. A short time after that, I did leave the National Park Service, I moved to Oregon, and we bought a house. We had a child and we started a family life. Eventually I retired from my State of Oregon job. My wife recently retired from her career in education and we started making plans together like retired couples do. My wife remained healthy for about three weeks, and then she got sick and suddenly died about four months later. And that happened last year, which, you now, obviously, completely turned my whole life upside down. So … people have different ways of dealing with grief and loss. How do I deal with it? Well the first thing I did was I shaved off all of the hair on my head. I couldn’t look in the mirror and picture myself as the same person again. I wanted everybody to know whenever they looked at me that I wasn’t the same person again. I had suffered too serious a loss. Grief, kind of like your hair slowly growing back … maybe it could help get through this loss and grief, you know, about as fast as your hair grows, which isn’t very fast. And then last year, on the Anniversary of our wedding, I made a pilgrimage to Shoshone Point. And walked out there. Sat quietly by myself on the very end, had a quiet moment. I said a prayer for my wife and thought of those 40 great years that we had together. But, I was facing an uncertain future. Or, you know, some people said no future. You know, you lost … I lost my life partner. My whole life had been turned upside down. So I was contemplating: what should I do with my life?” Grief counselors usually say don’t make any radical or sudden decisions after you suffer a loss. I had made the decision that I did not want to lose my national park career. That’s my third love in life. Let me backtrack a little bit. You know, I had an early exposure to the Grand Canyon and what park work may be. I started at the very bottom working my way up, and eventually, you know, served in five different national parks in five different Western states. And I was a career national park ranger in two separate national parks. When I left the National Park Service and moved to Oregon, I continued in my park career. I was an Oregon State Park ranger. I stayed in the profession. A total of 25 years I worked as an Oregon State Park ranger. And I retired … when I retired from that job, with my wife’s blessings, I returned to working as a summertime ranger for the national parks. And since I retired, it was 11 summers ago, I’ve worked in eight different national parks. So if you put all that together, my career has taken me to about a dozen Oregon State Parks, 13 national parks. I have been in the park profession for a total of 48 years. I did not want to lose that profession. I had already lost my life. I love working as a park ranger because I am helping to preserve the best of America. Some people call national park rangers “America’s Storytellers”. They’re guardians of nature, and of history, and of culture. You know, there are many great professions in the world … you can go into medicine, you can go into education, but I like to call park rangering one of the last great American professions. And I did not want to lose that. I made the drastic decision after my wife died, I’m going to sell our family house, which we had lived in for 25 years, and devest myself of all of my worldly possessions. I took some duct tape, I measured off a 4’ by 7’ rectangle in the garage, which is the size of my pickup truck bed, and whatever I wanted to keep in my life after my wife died, I put it in that little rectangle. If it didn’t fit in my truck, I ether sold it or gave it away or otherwise got rid of it. I worked with my supervisors … my old national park. They wanted me back. They said, you know, “take whatever time you need for grieving.” I said “the sooner I could get back, the better, cause that will be a measure of normalcy in my life.” Because I like doing the ranger walks, I like giving the ranger talks, leading the tours, giving the campfire programs in the campground. Giving out hiking advice to people in the visitor center. Helping the park visitors being connected to the parks. I was very anxious to get back to that national park lifestyle. This year is 51 years since I worked as a bus boy at the Grand Canyon. So in a way, you know, I have come full circle with my life. Bookends. Started my career now I am working as a summertime park ranger here at the North Rim of Grand Canyon. In a way, I feel I am honoring the memory of my wife. And, I am rekindling, and keeping alive my park connections by wearing my ranger hat every day. Some people say “ranger Doug, you know, why do you keep doing this? You’re Age 68, you have Social Security, you’re on Medicare, you don’t need this for finances. Why do you keep coming back? And I tell them, because, you know, I’m surrounded every day by inspirational scenery. There are very powerful stories in the national parks concerning the people, and the places, and the times. And I want to be part of sharing that story with the American public. And, let me just give you an example of how special national parks are and how they have been so special in my life. I have witnessed Old Faithful geyser erupt 350 times. I have hiked to see Rainbow Natural Bridge 91 times, hidden in a remote corner of Southeast Utah. I have seen wolves, grizzly bears and moose, sometimes in the same week, at Grand Teton National Park. And for a whole month as a volunteer ranger, I fell asleep every night in my tent, to the sound of Yosemite Falls, off in the distance. And I’ve climbed wooden ladders, stone steps, and I’ve entered Cliff Palace cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park, a total of 142 times. And sat there and admired this ancient village and the story represented by these folks. And today, I enjoy a Grand Canyon sunset every day. It is a part of my life. The park ranger profession is my third love and it allows me to have these and many other unique and special experiences. What would I say to the person contemplating coming out to visit the Grand Canyon, or any national park for the first time? You know, I would say Go for It. Give the Grand Canyon a chance. Or any other national park. You know, the Grand Canyon doesn’t care about your race, your age, your gender, your economic situation. It doesn’t care what your immigration status is, your sexual orientation. You know, just stand by the rim of the Grand Canyon and gaze into it. Watch the sunset on the rim. Be inspired. Be wowed. You know, be humbled. We need places like this in America, where, I like to say, you can recharge your emotional and your spiritual batteries. Will visiting the Grand Canyon for the first time change your life? Probably not. But it could! You know it happened to me. My name is ranger Doug, I’m a park ranger at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, and I approve this story and message. Before we go, we have a final invitation for you. Think about somebody you know. Somebody in your life. When the time is right, set aside a moment with that person. And ask. Ask them to share a story about their life. Then listen. This has been a Grand Canyon National Park micro podcast. A Canyon Cut Entitled CANYON CONNECTIONS A Canyon Romance … Times Three! I’m ranger Becca. Ranger Doug, thank you for sharing your story and your voice. And to all those listening, near and far, thank you for your time.",

At the urging of Tanagharrison – “The Half King,” Washington made a pre-emptive strike. He then returned to his camp, and strengthened the defenses by erecting a stockade and a storehouse. After reinforcements arrived, Washington continued on his road building mission. Upon learning that a large French force had been dispatched from Fort Duquesne to attack him, he returned to “Fort Necessity” in the Great Meadow. He had his men dig earthworks: trenches and mounds, to improve the forts defenses. The French arrived two days after the British forces returned to the fort. On the morning of July 3, they surrounded the fort and there was brisk fire from both sides throughout the day. A steady rain fell, increasing as the day went on, filling the trenches and drenching the combatants on both sides. Though the French were unable to capture the fort, their position seemed advantageous enough that at the end of the day they were able to convince the British to surrender.",

            "transcript": "The Story Told in Artifacts In the middle center of side one are a series of five artifacts presented in a row. In addition, a sword lines part of this row above and a musket lines part of this row on the bottom. Following is the caption and then the description of each item presented from left to right. Caption: From left: George (1776) and Martha (1772) Washington portraits by Charles Willson Peale; Washington’s dress sword from the first inauguration; makeshift frying pan fashioned from a shovel; Brown Bess musket; Joseph Martin’s firsthand account of his experience as a Revolutionary War soldier; Isaac Whitehead’s canteen. Descriptions: The George Washington portrait is an oval miniature of him painted on ivory and framed in gold. He wears a dark blue regimental coat with gold epaulets on each shoulder. The collar and lapels appear white but are really a light tan. Under the coat, he wears a vest called a waistcoat with a thin line of gold embroidery around the neck and down the front edges. White cloth circles his neck, and a white piece of ruffled shirt peeks out from the top of his vest. A blue sash crosses over his waistcoat and under his coat on a diagonal going from his right shoulder down towards his left side. Washington's face appears like a long oval. He has white powdered hair combed back from his face and covering the tops of his ears. He looks directly at us. He has a prominent long nose, thin slight smile and a bit of a five o'clock shadow. There is nothing in the background except a light blue color.&nbsp;The Martha Washington portrait is also oval miniature, framed in a thicker and more decorative gold. She sits at a slight angle to her right, but her eyes are turned slightly left as she looks directly at us. Her brown hair is pulled back. At the top of her head is a decorative piece with a string of pearls on either side with the left side being visible only. Attached to it in the back is a longer piece of fabric. Like a ponytail, it is draped over the front of her right shoulder. Around her neck is a string of pearls. The v-line neck of her dress is bordered with a thick piece of intricate lace with a bow at the center that also has a string of pearls as a part of the bow’s tie. The tones of the painting are blueish and her skin has an ivory cast. Her lips are closed with the corners slightly upturned. &nbsp;The makeshift frying pan is black with some rust. It looks like an old metal dustpan with upturned edges in between the rounded short metal handle at the top and a downward angled edge at the bottom, making it easier to shovel up or sweep something into the main flat section of the pan. &nbsp;Above the makeshift frying pan is George Washington's sword with its blade pointed slightly downward and to the right. At the top, its decorative handle includes a roundish globe called the pommel at the top. On top of the pommel is a much smaller globe, called a button. The handle has a thin metal knuckle guard which is attached to and juts out from the top and the bottom portions of the grip, where the person’s hand would wrap around to hold the sword. The grip section itself has an intricate metal pattern that looks like metal string wrapped around the entire grip. The bottom part of the grip is the crossguard, which is a squat roundish piece where the person’s closed hand might rest against. Underneath the crossguard is the blade, which is only partially seen as a portion of a page from a book covers the rest.&nbsp; The title page of Joseph Martin’s first-hand account. At the top of the yellowing page with splotches of brown is the typed title: “Narrative. Some of the adventures, dangers, and sufferings of a Revolutionary Soldier.” Other text on the manuscript page is too small to read.&nbsp; A round wooden canteen shaped like a drum with flat sides has the letters “I W” painted on the face. A brown leather strap to carry the canteen is secured around the canteen’s circumference. &nbsp; Underneath the makeshift frying pan, Martin’s title page and the canteen is a Brown Bess flintlock musket. The musket is distinguished by its long English walnut stock and brass and iron furnishings. The total length of this type of musket is about five feet. The barrel length is about four and a half feet.&nbsp;",

            "transcript": "In the spring of 1993, missile combat crews served their last alerts at Delta-01. They departed as the remainder of South Dakota's missile field was being dismantled in accordance with the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and warheads either country could possess. Delta-01 offers an unprecedented opportunity to see an underground control center in its original setting, and to contemplate the choices America has made to \"provide for the common defense.\" While the threats America faces have evolved in the generation since the end of the Cold War, the Minuteman missile remains a key component of United States nuclear deterrence. Known today today as \"Missile Alert Facilities,\" forty control centers similar to Delta-01 continue to watch over missiles kept on ready alert. Access inside the gate of Delta-01 is available on a reserved tour only. To protect the historic facilities and to provide for visitor safety, each tour is limited to six participants and a park ranger. This tour lasts forty-five minutes, beginning and ending at the entry gate. All tour participants must be able to walk and stand unassisted. All tours of the Delta-01 Launch Control Facility require advanced reservations and an amenity fee. Reservations can be made on-line or by phone. Reservations can be made up to 90 days prior to tour date. In the summer season, tours fill up to eight weeks in advance. We hope you enjoyed your walk to the gate. You can continue your visit at the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Visitor Center located 4 miles east of here at exit 131. There you can get more information on tours, watch the orientation film, and explore exhibits, and a bookstore. Be sure to also visit the Delta-09 missile silo located 10 miles west at exit 116.",

Now who in lived there I cannot verify, but I'm kind of assuming it might have been my great-great-grandparents. And then my mother told, just briefly one time, that the original Point farm house burned down and was replaced, so I can't put a date on those accurately. I would just be guessing. \"There were many structures across the street. It was the popular thing at that time to build the house on one side of a road, and all the barns and equipment things across the street, and that was the way it was at the Point farm. I do remember two big barns. I think one barn was for the cattle. The other barn was for the equipment . . . the wagons and carts and buggies. And I remember a milk house. And then I think there were a couple of other buildings over there, but the only thing that I see that's remaining there now is the one large barn.”",

There were more than just our family that survived on that farm, especially during the Depression years. In fact, sometimes, you know, when I think about all the good things we had, you know, the fruit pies, and I loved cottage cheese, and we had all we wanted of that. And we had all the sweet cream and the sour cream and cakes and pies. We usually—of course we made everything from scratch. I think we were living on—I thought we were living on gourmet food! ~laughs~ And I didn't realize at that time that we were even poor. Of course, I knew that my parents had, you know, some worries and tough times, but when you're a kid you were free and you played and you laughed and you didn't have any big responsibilities so, you know, I can say today it was good!",

National Heritage Areas differ from other park units in that their funding is provided through Congress each year, and must be matched in full by the managing organization. But what happens when funding is reduced or fluctuates from year to year? In 2017, the National Park Service provided three organizational sustainability workshops to NHAs throughout the country in order to help them identify strategies to improve their business structures, engage community partnerships, and diversify funding opportunities. Hosts Peter Samuel and Miriam Akervall dig into the framework of the program in order to answer the question: how can the NPS encourage the long term stability of National Heritage Areas?",

By three doors left unguarded They enter my castle wall! Henry wrote this poem about his daughters! See if you can find the broad hall stair and the three doors left unguarded as you explore the house. How do you think Henry Longfellow would describe you? First, give your name. Then give an adjective – a word describing your personality. Finally, give a characteristic – think how tall you are, your favorite piece of clothing, or how fast you can run!",

In the meantime a water business came up for sale and I had no clue on what a water business was, but I didn't realize that half of the valley, or more than half the valley, bought water because they couldn't get a well. So in interviewing this fella that wanted to sell his water business he had really basically nothing to sell but a worn off truck and loyal people who maybe wouldn't be loyal to me. So I decided to buy a tank and put hoses on it and advertise and for two and a half years I hauled water to people that had cisterns. It was a pretty interesting job because you really get to know everybody in the valley.”",

            "transcript": "MARKER #21 – the Nelmar House This large house was built by John Stuart in 1877. As mentioned, the island began to be subdivided and sold as lots in 1873 by Rollins and Ayer. John Stuart's house was one of the first houses built. The house is constructed of wood, with cypress shingles covering the second story and the tops of the porch posts. Ornamental features include octagonal chimney pots and novel designs in the muntins in the front door and side lights. The Nelmar house is named after John Stuart’s daughters Eleanor “Nellie” and Marion. Eleanor Stuart married Rear Admiral Victor Blue, who was a highly decorated due to his heroism in the Spanish American War, and together they spent many winters at Nelmar. Blue eventually bought the Nelmar House and then subdivided much of the island into lots offered to members of private clubs that he helped organize. Adm. Blue was the founder of the Army Navy Club which became the FG Club in 1923 (located at the Kingsley house and adjacent building). FG Club was less relaxed than RICL which he also built later to replicate other clubs he had been in. This house is significant because its association with the Recreational Development period of Fort George Island (1870s/1880s) with the Club development in the 1920s, and is perhaps the finest remaining residential structure built during the Rollins ownership of Fort George Island.",

            "transcript": "You now stand on the southwestern part of Saunders field, on the Confederate battle line. Here General John Jones's brigade of Virginians laid in wait for the US attack, watching as a wave of blue-clad soldiers marched out of the wood line and into the field in front of you. The US battle line stretched the entire 2000 foot width of Saunders’ Field, which today is about half as wide as it was in 1864, and a mile and a half south of it. As US troops moved forward, they ran into problems after the first step. Moving faster in the open field than their comrades in the woods to the south, the US battleline broke into disconnected chunks immediately. Griffin’s Federal troops were left exposed to the Confederate defenders, who met them with a rain of lead and iron. At first, the attack here went relatively well for the US troops. Even though some regiments became disconnected from the units to their south, the US battle lines stayed largely intact. On both sides of the Orange Turnpike, Confederate troops gave way. General Jones’s death early in the attack left the Confederate defenders south of the turnpike without a leader in a crucial moment. Troops from Gen. Charles Griffin's Union division penetrated the defenses held by Jones's and General George Steuart's Confederate brigades. However, as the Union troops gained ground, they found themselves lost and disoriented in the woods. The black powder smoke produced by soldiers' muskets was trapped by the thick woods, making it impossible to see what was happening. As US Regular Sergeant Burgess Ingersoll recalled, it became \"a weird, uncanny contest – a battle of invisibles with invisibles. Men's faces were sweaty black from biting cartridges, and a sort of grim ferocity seemed to creep into the actions and appearance of everyone within the limited range of vision.\" To make matters worse, the Confederate battleline was longer than the Federals’. When the attack landed, the Confederates simply swung the longer northern part of their line down onto the US troops, outflanking and outnumbering them. As some Union soldiers fell back, others were left behind and surrounded. North of the turnpike, the 140th New York, which had been in the first wave and broken through the Confederate lines, was now trapped inside the Confederate Army and forced to fight their way back out. Here on the south of the turnpike, Alabamians counter attacked the confused and disoriented US soldiers. Some Union troops accidentally ran towards the Confederate soldiers as they tried to retreat. As they fled, many soldiers, the wounded in particular, collected in the swale, the depression that runs diagonally across Saunders’ Field in front of you. While the fighting devolved into small independent struggles for survival, the woods caught fire. As the fires spread, many wounded soldiers from both sides were consumed by them. As the US forces retreated across Saunders’ Field, some Confederates followed them and counterattacked. But Warren had advanced a reserve force in the trenches the US soldiers had already built, and the reserves stopped the uncoordinated Confederate counterattack cold. But the Confederates were not going to go back empty-handed if they could help it. During the assaults, two cannon from Battery D, 1st New York Artillery, advanced to support the infantry. But the guns were mostly useless. Ordered to set up in the field just south of the turnpike, the gun crews found themselves unable to aim high enough to fire directly on any Confederate positions. Instead, they fired diagonally across the field, putting the Union soldiers in just as much danger as the Confederates. When the US attack collapsed and the Confederates counter-attacked, these guns were left behind. First captured by the 1st and 3rd North Carolinian Infantry regiments, who were forced off by other Federals, the guns were captured again by the 6th Alabama. For a moment, the two Confederate units faced off, both convinced the capture of the guns were rightly theirs. They were so focused on their internal argument that the battle raging around them was forgotten, and a regiment of Federals tried to retake the guns, but the field was a no-man's land of fire and lead, and while the Confederates were driven away, the Federals were forced back themselves, leaving the guns abandoned in the field. This constant back and forth, attack and counterattack like a bloody pendulum would come to define not only the fighting at Saunders field, but the Battle of the Wilderness as a whole.",

            "transcript": "Fredericksburg resident Jane Howison Beale was a widow by the time the Civil War began, having lost her husband in 1850 to a heart attack. Following his death, which left her with nine children to raise on her own, she began to keep a diary. This diary helped her overcome her grief and provides us with a vivid account of the civilian experience in Fredericksburg just before, during, and after the battle. At this stop, we will listen to Jane Beale’s own words. You are welcome to walk to the top of Howison Hill and see the cannons there, but with the trees grown up, there is no longer a view of town. Take this moment to reflect: how you might feel if you were in Jane’s position? November 19th, 1862 Watched with trembling hearts the long line of Yankees pouring over the Chatham hills...they come in countless numbers and our hearts sank within us as we thought of our little Spartan band who hold the fords, [ ] why do they remain to be sacrificed? And to bring destruction upon our town were queries that forced themselves upon us, nor did our wonder cease much when we heard General Lee had telegraphed to Colonel Ball “to hold the passage of the river at Fredericksburg at all hazards.” December 11th, 1862 Martha, our chamber maid, came in and said in a rather mournful tone, “Miss Jane the Yankees are coming, they have got two pontoons nearly across the river.” Before we were half dressed, the heavy guns of the enemy began to pour their shot and shell upon our ill fated town, and we hastily gathered our remaining garments and rushed into our basement for safety...About 6 o’clock [in the evening] the sound of my dear brother’s voice was heard at the door...”come he said instantly, I have got an Ambulance for you, the enemy is across the river and there is not a moment to lose...” December 13th, 1862 Again the booming of artillery sounded in our ears and this day there was but little cessation, all the gentlemen and boys left us and hurried to the top of a high hill on my brother’s farm which overlooked nearly the whole length of the battlefield...they seemed deeply impressed with the scene, they had seen Meagher’s Irish Brigade advance from the town, in full close columns and receive a storm of shell and shot from the Batteries stationed on Marye’s Heights which thinned their ranks and caused them to falter, but they returned to the charge with a bravery worth of a better cause and hundreds of them who escaped the fire of the heavy guns fell beneath the shot of the infantry stationed along the stone wall...we knew the enemy had been repulsed, but officers who came to Mr. Temple’s said that but a small portion of our Army had been engaged in the fight, and they supposed that it would certainly be renewed on the morrow as the Yankees had such an immense army that they would be apt to try it again. December 16th, 1862 Early this morning a note and a messenger came from brother John, the note stated that during the night, the enemy had disappeared from our front and every man of them had gone across the river, every body was immediately in action, Mr. Brent and the boys started off to ascertain the condition of things in town...Bernard Temple went in with Mr. Brent and the boys, and when I saw him returning in the evening, I ran out to hear his report, he told me that the town was in ruins and the streets filled with all sorts of articles which had been dragged from the houses...but it was with strange and glad surprise that I heard that my house was apparently untouched, there were numerous holes in the roofs and sides torn by shells and balls but that the furniture was all in its place...I felt grateful, very grateful for all this and wondered how it had happened, that I should have escaped so much better than any one else. Jane Beale survived the war, living to age 67, but her diary ends here. In 1860, the city of Fredericksburg boasted a population of about 5,020 inhabitants, 3,300 white, 420 free black, and 1,300 enslaved. 34% of Fredericksburg’s households included enslaved people. While Jane’s experiences mirrored that of many white Southerners who feared the Union Army, black residents, free and enslaved, often felt differently. John Washington, an enslaved Fredericksburg man, recorded the following lines about the arrival of the Union Army in the preceding spring: “…every servant was out on the house top looking over the River at the Yankees for their glistening bayonets could easily be Seen. I could not begin to express my new born hopes for I felt already like I Was certain of My freedom now.” Washington crossed the Rappahannock River shortly after the arrival of the Union Army in the spring of 1862, an act through which he claimed his long-sought freedom. Jane Beale commented on the flight of the enslaved population in June, 1862, writing: “The Federal army has abolished slavery wherever it has gone and certainly if their design was to punish us by subjecting us to every inconvenience and indignity which an entire rupture of our domestic relations was certain to produce they have succeeded.” Fredericksburg’s social order was being unraveled even before the US Army returned to the area in November. On the eve of Battle of Fredericksburg, many remaining civilians fled and only a few hundred people, including Jane Beale, remained in town. Once the battle was over, 10% of the city was destroyed between the US bombardment on December 11, and subsequent Confederate fire on US forces in town over the next few days. It would take decades for the city to fully recover its pre-war population and to build an economy that was not dependent on enslaved labor.",

            "transcript": "One year after George Washington surrendered at Fort Necessity, the British launched a three-pronged attack to remove the French from what they considered British territory in North America. General Edward Braddock, a veteran of the elite Coldstream Guard, was the overall commander of the operation. He personally led the force to Ft. Duquesne at the forks of the Ohio river. He commanded a large army, and had supplies and gunpowder necessary to besiege and destroy the fort. Aware of this, the French chose to leave the fort and meet the British in the open. On July 9th, 1755, the two forces collided along a wooded road about six miles from Fort Duquesne. Unprepared for battle, the British force fell into disarray and was routed. General Braddock was mortally wounded and died during the retreat. Washington, Braddock’s aide de camp, managed the retreat. He buried Braddock in the middle of the road and had the retreating army march over the grave to hide it from the pursuing warriors. Braddock’s remains were discovered some fifty years later and moved to the top of a nearby knoll where the monument now stands. As you cross the ravine on the way to the monument, you can find the original burial site about 25 yards down the ravine to your right.",

            "transcript": "We begin outside the gate at Delta-09. Hello, my name is Bret Whitmore. I am a U.S. Air Force Cold War Veteran. I guarded this site (among 149 others), serving in the 45th Missile Security Squadron from 1982-1985. I'll be your guide as we explore Delta-09. Before you enter the gate, pause and look back at Interstate 90. For nearly 30 years, South Dakotans and other visitors just like yourselves traveled 1-90, never realizing they were crossing a war zone. With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, the front lines of the Cold War were everywhere, not just behind the 'Iron Curtain'. Imagine you were one of those travelers and had glanced at the fence and the strange structures inside it. Was it a water well or perhaps a local power substation? One could assume so at a glance, but in reality, this site had a more ominous role. Where you are now standing was ground-zero for World War Ill. We're cleared for entry. Step inside Delta-09 and learn how one of the most powerful weapons in history stood in silent vigil just beneath this lonesome stretch of prairie. Let's walk to the center of the fenced area. Take a moment to look around you and absorb the seemingly endless expanse of prairie. Most of western South Dakota is sparsely-inhabited ranch country. As far as the eye can see, there are grasslands stretching toward a vast horizon. Remoteness was key to the United States Air Force basing the Minuteman here and in five other missile fields. There are no large cities in this part of the country. Planners thought that this low population would limit casualties in the event of a nuclear war, as the presence of missiles made this area a primary target. Missiles were also based here due to the relatively close proximity of northern-tier states to the Soviet Union. A missile launched from Delta-09 could soar straight over the North Pole and strike targets deep within central Russia. Minuteman II had a maximum range of over 6,000 miles, putting almost all Soviet targets within reach. Minuteman facilities were designed to withstand the nuclear environments produced by a near miss from an attacking warhead detonation. The operation of the Minuteman depended on a second strike capability. This means that the system must be able to function even after exposure to a hostile nuclear environment. The design of the silo and its support facilities reflect this hardened design in many ways, including the steel launch tube liner that provided electromagnetic shielding and prevented damage to the missile from surface erosion and from flying chips of concrete at launch. Before we visit the silo, make a perimeter scan inside the fence. The United States Air Force called this 1.6 acres of gravel, concrete, and steel a \"Priority Area\". This was one of ten sites under command of Delta-01, and when all systems were functioning properly, this site was unmanned. With solid fuel technology, the missile could lie dormant for weeks, months, or (theoretically) even years with limited maintenance and upkeep. Launch Officers at Delta-01 monitored these sites remotely via multiple sensors and miles of underground cables. Minuteman was America's quickest-responding ICBM. From the moment the capsule received a valid launch order-and completed a checklist-guided key-turn procedure-it could take as little as one minute for the missile to fire. Only when the missile or its silo needed maintenance, or when its intrusion detectors noted an alarm, was Delta-09 ever manned. As so complex a system as Minuteman aged, this became more frequent. Daily, five or more missile sites of the 150 total in the Wing required scheduled repairs of some kind. That's when Minuteman's three interdependent support organizations-Operations, Maintenance, and Security-worked in close harmony to secure sites and get them back on-line for constant alert. Let's now head to the glass enclosure over the silo itself. Below us is a Minuteman II training missile standing in launch configuration. Minuteman was a technological wonder for its .day; a 3-stage, solid-fueled, sub-orbital spacecraft nearly 60 feet tall and weighing 38 tons. Its combined engines produced over 235,000 pounds of thrust that propelled its payload to a speed of 4 miles per second. Inside the nose (Reentry Vehicle) was a Whiskey-56 thermonuclear warhead that produced an explosive yield of 1.2 megatons, more than 80 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. And yet: this missile was just one of 10 in Delta Flight, and there were 15 missile flights of 10 missiles each in the 44th Missile Wing, dispersed across 13,500 square miles of western South Dakota. This was only one of six Minuteman wings providing deterrent coverage of 1,000 ICBMs throughout the U.S. If this weapon had been launched, the following would happen: The missile combat crew at Delta-01 would, upon proper orders, send a launch command to the missile's computer. Underground cables connected the control center to the ten silos of its flight. This command was received through the umbilical on the side of the missile. After processing this command, the umbilical detached. Next, ballistic gas generator detonations would forcefully slide this massive 90-ton door covering the silo through the fence, out of the way. The first stage would ignite, a roar of hellfire erupt, and within three seconds the missile would leap skyward, bound for it's target half a world away. After launch, each of the three stages burned for about one minute each, and after the third stage separated, the warhead could reach over 15,000 miles per hour. At such speeds the missile could strike a target over 6,000 miles away in just 30 minutes. 180 seconds post-launch, all rocket stages. would burn out and fall away. The warhead rose approximately 700 miles above the Earth. Reentering the atmosphere, spinning ballistically, and utilizing the forces of aerodynamic drag and gravity, it raced to destruction. Its advanced guidance system provided an accuracy radius of one quarter-mile. Detonation would utterly consume a target area. For over a mile in all directions all living things would vaporize; all man-made objects be incinerated. Nothing recognizable would remain. 200 mph winds would obliterate even stoutly-constructed buildings within three miles. Beyond lethal doses of radiation, people up to eight miles away would be flash-blinded. Lingering radiation would make the area uninhabitable for centuries to come. To your right lies an ultra high frequency antenna surrounded by concrete. This blast hardening would help withstand effects from a nearby warhead detonation. This antenna provided a link between the missile and the Airborne Launch Control System. Should the missile become electronically isolated or nearby launch capsules destroyed, special aircraft could launch missiles from the air. Airborne Command Post aircraft, designated 'Looking Glass,' anchored this system. Based at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and sharing capabilities of Strategic Air Command's underground command post, a General Officer headed specialized battle staff teams aboard these planes. Throughout decades of heightened Cold War tensions, a 'Looking Glass' mission flew over the central U.S. around-the-clock, seven days a week. Airborne Command Post aircraft from Ellsworth Air Force Base supplemented 'Looking Glass' flights and all could launch the Minuteman force if ground-based missile crews were disabled. 'Looking Glass' missions began in 1961, flying continuously through 1990 when it assumed ground alert. Its mission continues today. The low concrete deck is the top of the Soft Support Building. Its box-like roof is about one foot above ground, but below the surface, the walls are another 11 feet deep. It houses electrical and environmental equipment that provide 'life-support' for the missile. Foremost among these is a large generator. Launch Facilities were run on commercial power, but in case of outages, the generator would automatically start and provide electricity. The launcher itself had emergency batteries, but without this auxiliary system, the missile could have been disabled. Reliable electrical power and a backup was essential to maintaining the missile at the ready. The Soft Support Building also contained a secure, direct phone to Delta-01, and a chiller unit which regulated silo temperature and humidity and cooled electronic systems. A stable interior environment was vital to the system working at peak efficiency. The temperature inside the launcher remained near 60 degrees, optimal for the missile and its computerized components. The large blue 'lid' in front of the silo is the Personnel Access Hatch. Although the site was primarily unmanned, escorted maintenance teams periodically visited here for scheduled upkeep or to repair problems that might arise. The Personnel Access Hatch is a heavily-reinforced door, weighing five tons. Both Security and Maintenance strictly controlled access through this hatch to the interior of the silo. Only Security could open the first half of the system, the blue \"A-Circuit\" in front of the hatch. The security escort entered a combination provided to them by the Flight Security Controller. After opening the lock they removed the 'A-circuit', retracted a locking shaft, and flipped a switch that hydraulically raised the hatch. The door takes several minutes to open. Once open, the maintenance team chief reached another combination lock. Entering an encoded combination here, an elevator-type \"B-Plug\" with a telescoping ladder slowly lowered to provide access to the equipment room. Opening the \"B-Plug\" coincided with how long it took an Alarm Response Team to arrive from Delta-01, should anyone have broken protocol or attempted to gain unauthorized access. Among many areas here, the equipment room, the interior of the silo were considered \"No-Lone Zones\". Personnel had to remain within visual contact of one another at all times. Any area of the missile field where the command and control of nuclear weapons could be compromised was considered a \"No-Lone Zone\". Daily work \"trips\" could last up to 16 hours at a time. This impacted Maintenance and Security troops alike. Since Maintenance couldn't access a site without Security providing the first half of their entry, even after Maintenance had re-secured their \"B-Side\" areas, Security still had to install a new \"A-Side\" combination and re-secure it. On most \"trips\", crews spent over half their work-day in long drives to and from sites, as well as the meticulous process of gaining access to or securing the site. Long days often broke a mandatory safety timeline, forcing crews and their escorts to Remain Overnight (R.O.N.) at the nearest Launch Control Facility, like Delta-01. Accommodations were acceptable and the food decent, but few crews enjoyed getting stuck in the field. It was a common source of frustration among many. The tall white pole to the left of the launcher is the Improved Minuteman Physical Security System. In 1989 this replaced previous intrusion-detection systems that, less able to discriminate threats, caused numerous nuisance alarms. While designed to detect intrusion by humans, deer near the fence, rabbits, snakes, flocks of birds, and even a swarm of locusts inside the site, could set it off. When motion was detected, the Delta-01 crew was the first to know. They'd notify the Flight Security Controller who would dispatch his Alarm Response Team to the site. Times varied, but at this location, Security could reach the site within 15 minutes. They followed strict checklists to detect intruders, report damage, confirm the site was secure, then waited off-site until the capsule reset the alarm, before returning to Delta-01. There were few human intrusions over the years. Most were peace activists protesting at the gate. Though isolated miles from base, Launch Facilities were high-security U.S. military installations and site signage provided ample warning. If a person attempted intrusion of a manned Launch Facility, site security challenged them with M-16s. If the site were undergoing maintenance, challenges could be less pleasant. Intruders at an unmanned site heard no audible alarm. Within minutes an armed Security team detained them, turning them over to civilian police. No Soviets ever attempted to breach a site or gain access to the missile or warhead. The two thick steel pylons near the launcher were vital to the emplacement of a missile. Whenever a missile required repairs on base, a massive vehicle known as the Transporter Erector made the transfer to and from Ellsworth via a slow-moving convoy accompanied by both Maintenance and Security teams. Arriving on site, the driver aligned with marker lines, then backed slowly towards the silo. When in place, crewmen secured the Transporter Erector frame onto the pylons. Once ready, the trailer box cradling the missile slowly pivoted upwards via hydraulics until it stood vertical over the silo. Another team then retracted the launcher closure door beneath it. At this point, the missile would be slowly lowered into or raised from the silo. This operation could take three to four hours to complete. A newly-installed missile would have no guidance and control section or warhead. Other teams added these later in separate operations. For periodic upgrades on-base, removing and replacing a warhead was also required. As this meant transporting nuclear weapons over long distances on public roads, it demanded some of the heaviest armed security in Strategic Air Command. The Reentry Vehicle traveled in a special tractor-trailer within a convoy. Twenty heavily-armed Security Policemen, divided among four armored vehicles and a helicopter for overhead cover, escorted this lone Reentry Vehicle and Guidance Control van. A United States Deputy Marshal headed the convoy to and from its destination. South Dakota's Minutemen were on-alert 24-7 for thirty years. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush and Soviet leader Gorbachev signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and warheads either country could possess. It also allowed one site per side to be preserved for historical purposes. Months later, the Soviet Union dissolved, and with it, many of the tensions of the Cold War. Both nations had spent enormous sums on nuclear defenses they never launched, but the long, unwinnable stalemate that ensued successfully averted a war of massive devastation on a global scale. South Dakota's missiles were the first taken off alert. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty dictated that silos be destroyed and filled with rubble and soil. The Air Force even allowed some former landowners to push the button that imploded the site themselves, before eventually selling the land back to them. Delta-09 offers an unprecedented opportunity to see a Cold War ICBM in its original setting, and to contemplate the role of nuclear deterrence in preserving peace. It is the story of the Cold War and how it impacted generations of Americans who grew up under the tangible threat of Soviet communism. It is the oft-overlooked saga of courageous men and women serving thanklessly and unseen in the United States Air Force missile fields, and the story of the people of western South Dakota who lived alongside Armageddon. But while this chapter has ended, the story is not over. Harsh international realities persist, thus U.S. nuclear deterrence continues. Thousands of young Airmen supporting 400 Minuteman Ill missiles remain on alert across the Great Plains. These missiles are scheduled to be operational through the year 2030. We hope you enjoyed your tour of Delta-09. Continue your visit at the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Visitor Center 15 miles east of here at Exit 131. There you'll find more tour information, view our orientation film, explore exhibits, and visit our bookstore. Don't forget Delta-01 Launch Control Facility at exit 127. Tours of that site require advanced reservations.",

            "transcript": "[steam engine sounds] Welcome to Grand Canyon Village. We hope you enjoy your time exploring the historic district of the park! While touring the Village today, please be courteous of other visitors along the Rim Trail. During the winter, watch out for snow and icy patches on the pathways. Water and sunscreen are always a good idea at 7,000 feet elevation but are especially important during the hot summer months. You may encounter elk and squirrels within the Village. While they may appear friendly, do not approach, feed, or water them. As you learn about the expansion of visitation over the years at Grand Canyon, it’s important to remember that Grand Canyon has been home to native peoples for over 14,000 years. The canyon is the traditional homeland of the Apache, Havasupai, Hopi, Hualapai, Navajo, Paiute, Yavapai and Zuni people represented by 11 federally recognized tribes. On September 17, 1901, the first steam-powered train arrived at the South Rim of Grand Canyon. Visitors were greeted by a wooden train depot, now one of the oldest standing in the United States. Prior to the arrival of the railway, visitors rode by stagecoach for 90 miles from Flagstaff to Grand Canyon. By train, visitors could travel to the canyon comfortably and in style. With the arrival of the train, the quiet area of the South Rim rapidly expanded into the bustling Grand Canyon Village. [people chattering] The first decade of the railway saw the construction of the luxurious El Tovar Hotel, Hopi House, and Verkamp’s Curios Shop. Over the next three decades, the Grand Canyon Village expanded to accommodate for growing visitation. By the 1920s, more people started to visit the canyon by automobile, making it even easier to access the canyon. Increase in visitation led to the expansion of the Village. Eventually, the automobile become the preferred method of transit, and the train was forced to stop running in 1968. However, as you may see today, the train is back in commission! The train has been up and running since 1989, when it was purchased by private investors. It also provides an option for visitors to experience the legacy of the Grand Canyon Railway. As you walk towards the next stop, consider how you arrived at Grand Canyon today. Did you take the train or did you use a more modern method of transportation?",

Is this a peaceful spot in the canyon or is there too much activity around you? The National Park Centennial in 2016 and the Grand Canyon National Park Centennial in 2019 brought yet another spike in visitation. The parks are becoming more popular and available to people but at a cost. The view points are more crowded. Shuttle buses are required as there is not enough parking. Lodging and campsites are constantly impacted. If visitation continues this way how would you solve these problems? Where would people stay? Would you build more on the rim? Away from the rim? Or would you decide not to build at all? Would you develop more viewpoints to accommodate for more people? Would you establish a timed entry system or limit the number of visitors per day? Are the trails are too busy? Would you require permits to hike in the canyon? Inevitably, visitation will continue to grow at National Parks. Individual parks must continue to adapt in order to accommodate for increasing numbers, whether that means adding more or cutting back. The mission of the Park Service is to preserve and protect natural and cultural resources for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration this and future generations. At what point will parks have to decide between the visitor and the resource?",

            "transcript": "We are now at stop #9, the final stop on the tour. Along the Valley Pike, which is today Route 11. You should be at the interpretive marker labeled-The Union Counterattack. Face the marker and you will be looking to your west, and in the distance you will see the Alleghany Mountains. Also, looking in that direction, to your left front, amongst the trees, you will see the metal roof of the historic Miller House, which we talked about and saw at stop #7. Remember that Miller House is along the final Confederate line that afternoon, just north of Middletown and along the historic Miller Lane, today called Cougill Road. That marks the left end of the Confederate line, which was lined with heavy stone walls and made an excellent defensive position. Also, remember the Confederate line ran at least a half a mile, if not slightly longer beyond the Miller House. The right end of the Confederate line actually continued to stretch on the other side of the Valley Pike, Route 11 today, behind you, but also farther to your south, closer to Middletown which is off to your left. Also, looking to your left rear, you will see in the distance the top of Massanutten Mountain including Signal Knob. The Confederate right again stretched to the north of Middletown, on the other side of the Valley Pike and beyond where modern day interstate 81 is today. Despite the fact that many Confederates were still looting the Union camps, remember General Early the Confederate commander believes that he can wait out the Union army which is to your right a mile to your north, until nightfall and then retreat under cover of darkness. As we know, General Sheridan has returned to the battlefield, he has rallied his army, and now will begin his counterattack around 4:00 pm that afternoon. That counterattack starts and that Union lines stretching 2 miles in length. His line also stretching beyond interstate 81 where it is today and across the Valley Pike will sweep across the open ground in front of you, from your right to left, and came rolling across this ground which was much more open back then, and towards the final Confederate line. Despite being outnumbered the Confederates stood their ground and gave the Union attack a murderous fire. One Union soldier in the attack later recounted this. He said, “We got into the open fields, the rebels pouring into our faces a deadly fire from behind a stone wall. We gain a hill in the enemy front and here we halt and pour in our own fire. Of all the fires I was ever under during the war I think it was by far the hottest. The air boils and seized with minié balls and screeching shells and solid shot and deadly canister. All tear and plunge through our ranks. Our boys fall thick and fast.” At first the Union counterattack was basically halted in its tracks. And some of the heaviest and deadliest fighting of the entire battle took place in the fields right out in front of you. What finally brought the Confederate line, broke it I should say, and drove it back was the fact that the Union right was much longer than the Confederate left and it began to overlap it at the far end of Miller Lane and began to outflank it and drive it in. And what turned the Confederate retreat, because the Confederate left began to crumble into a rout, was Union cavalry. There was an immense Union cavalry force way beyond the Confederate right and beyond the Confederate left as it was, and began to sweep in across the open fields. Some of that Union cavalry led by none other than George Armstrong Custer, who led a division of Union cavalry, came sweeping in beyond the Confederate left and turned that retreat into a panic. The Confederate left basically crumbled and the whole Confederate line, from its left to right or west to east towards you crumbled. Despite the efforts of Confederate officers, the Confederate line just began to roll up and collapse and the whole Confederate battle line just retreated, routed back towards Middletown. And the same ground they fought so hard to gain that morning was basically now lost. Through Middletown, passed Belle Grove, over Cedar Creek, through the streets of Strasburg, there was a traffic jam. Much of the spoils of war they captured that morning were now lost including all 24 guns they had captured, they lost all of those and 24 of their own. So the Union counterattack captured 48 guns during the retreat. Also, they captured, the Union army captured 1,200, one thousand two hundred prisoners. What was left of Early’s army tried to rally itself at Fisher’s Hill where they started the night before. The Battle of Cedar Creek would end as a tremendous Union victory. Total casualties that day for the Union army 5,700 killed, wounded, missing, including almost 600 dead. The Confederate army although not nearly as high in number were about 2,900, almost 3,000 but considering how much smaller the Confederate army was a very high percentage. This basically finished off Early’s army. And what was left of it retreated southward throughout the remainder of the Valley the next day. From here on out till the end of the war, militarily, the Valley would remain under Union control, so this great Union victory that was won by Sheridan’s return, literally snatching a victory out of the jaws of defeat here at Cedar Creek would put the Valley under Union control the rest of the war. Politically, this victory was important because just 2 ½ weeks later, the election would occur and Lincoln is able to ride the coattails of Sheridan’s victory in on Election Day putting him over the top. The numbers I just rattled off to you are just statistics, but you must remember that each number is a human, a person, with a story behind it and for every soldier lost on the battlefield there is a family at home. And they are also victims of the battle of Cedar Creek. They are more than just numbers. And I think that point is driven home when you read the accounts of the survivors. One person in the 6th Corps of the Union army left a vivid account of the aftermath of this battle, and certainly drives home the impact of this battle to us today even over 150 years later. He simply wrote, “The dead and dying of the two armies at Cedar Creek were comingled. Many of the wounded had dragged themselves to the streams in search of the first want of the wounded man - water. Many mangled and loose horses were straggling over the fields, wagons and gun carriages and caissons were strewn in disorder. Abandoned ambulances sometimes filled with dead and dying were seen in large numbers. And loose teams dragged overturned vehicles over the hills and through the ravines. Dead and dying men were everywhere. Cries of agony from the suffering were heard in all directions. And the moans of wounded animals added much to the horrors of the night.”",

            "transcript": "MAP and TEXT: Staying in One Place DESCRIBING: Large horizontal color aerial perspective 3-D map of the Walla Walla River Valley. SYNOPSIS: Map of the vast Walla Walla River Valley from the headwaters of the river in the Blue Mountains on the right side of the map to where it joins the Columbia River on the left side of the map. The valley name is Walawála meaning ‘many small streams’. The map includes the Snake River and tributaries of the Walla Walla River, historic trails and travel paths of the Cayuse People, and other known sites. On the map are labeled significant places and features with both their Native place names and English translations of these place names. The map includes shaded relief to show topography and a color gradient to show elevation from darker green in the lower elevations to white in the higher elevations. The purpose of this map is to share information about cultural and historic uses of the Walla Walla Valley, and it is not meant for navigation. IN-DEPTH DESCRIPTION: On the far right side of the map are the Blue Mountains which are the highest point shown. ‘Walawála,’ the Walla Walla River, flows from the Blue Mountains on the right side of the map to its end at ‘Ncí Wána,’ the Columbia River, which curls and meanders around in a backwards “c” shape on the left side of the map. ‘Nax̣íyam Wána,’ the Snake River, fades into the map from the top middle and ends at the Columbia River just above the Walla Walla River. In the middle of the map, above the Walla Walla River is a dark green dot and label, 1836 Mission (current location of Whitman Mission National Historic Site). This location is also labeled in gray, Weyíilet, Place of waving grass. Shown in grey crisscrossing the valley in mostly horizontal directions, the trails and historic travel routes are shown in dotted lines. Most of the trails parallel the waterways. Tributaries of the Walla Walla River meander through the length of the Valley. At the far left of the map Cooyáakinma, the North Fork Walla Walla River, and ˀImtwaha, the South Fork Walla Walla River, join and flow to the left. Left of the 1836 mission site Túuši, the Touchet River, joins the Walla Walla River. There are 9 places labeled with their native place name on the map in gray. On the Columbia River, just below where the Snake River flows into the Columbia, is tmɨšpa which means ‘at chokecherries.’ At the confluence of the Columbia and the Walla Walla rivers is Walúula, which means ‘little river.’ Just below this confluence is Wáatpatukaykas, which means ‘the Cayuse sisters.’ Roughly halfway between this confluence and the 1836 mission site near the confluence of the Walla Walla and Touchet rivers is Túuši, which means ‘baking salmon on sticks over coals/fire.’ Above the 1836 mission site on an unnamed tributary river is Sitxwsnáma which means ‘where button root grows.’ Right of the 1836 mission site on two unnamed tributary rivers are Waatnuwáš which means ‘spirit power seeking place’ and Pášx̣a which means ‘balsamroot sunflower.’ In the upper right corner of the map on the Touchet River, is Atákšašpo which means ‘come together.’ CAPTION: The Valley As It Was - This map shows some waterways and trails of the mid-1880s. weyíıletpuu followed streams into higher country each summer. RELATED TEXT: A religious revival in the 1800s, called the “Second Great Awakening,” encouraged Christians to dedicate their lives to missionary work. Inspired by this revival, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent the Whitmans and other missionaries throughout the continent to convert American Indians. The Whitmans introduced the weyíıletpuu to a different spiritual relationship to land. People stayed in one place tending fields and livestock instead of moving with the food. This new way of life conflicted with weyíıletpuu spirituality and tamáalwit, and began to destabilize their society. “All are scattered in little groups far and near, digging their kamas root and taking salmon. Here is the missionary’s trial in this country. The people are with him so little of the time, and they are so scattered that he cannot go with them.”—Narcissa Whitman writing about weyíıletpuu seasonal rounds, 1841",

            "transcript": "The Confederate trenches off to the right and into the woods were defended by a division of soldiers commanded by Gen. Henry Heth. From here, they protected the Confederate right flank and guarded the approaches to Spotsylvania along the Fredericksburg Road. Though Heth’s line was also a salient, it had plenty of artillery to protect the position’s vulnerabilities. Opposing Heth on the morning of May 12 was Gen. Ambrose Burnside’s 9th Army Corps. Burnside, who had commanded the U.S. Army at Fredericksburg, was in a unique position. After serving well in Ohio and Tennessee, Burnside returned to Virginia at the head of the 9th Corps, but he technically outranked the army’s commander, George Meade. Rather than deal with the bureaucratic confusion of figuring how Burnside fit into the army’s command structure, Grant kept the 9th Corps separate from the rest of the Army of the Potomac. For the time being, Burnside reported directly to Grant. This though, led to unintended consequences of breakdowns in communication and coordination. The unwieldy setup first proved its setbacks at the Wilderness, when the 9th Corps floundered through the woods and were repulsed. Here at Spotsylvania, Burnside’s orders were to attack in conjunction with the assaults against the Muleshoe Salient, but there was little connecting his lines with Winfield Hancock’s to his right. Nonetheless, around 4:30 a.m. on May 12, Burnside sent his men forward to Heth’s Salient. The Union soldiers soon ran into Confederate opposition. “Our well-directed fire told on their ranks,” one of Heth’s soldiers wrote. He went on, “Though the two assaults had lasted hardly an hour. . . the Federal dead and wounded lay as thick on the ground as if a battle had raged for a day.” One of the attacking regiments in Burnside’s corps was the 17th Michigan, whose monument sits in front of you. Going into action, the 17th Michigan quickly hit the Confederate lines. “The young fresh leaves of the forest made it impossible for us to see very far in any direction,” one Michigander wrote. Confederate musketry and artillery crashed into the regiment, knocking dozens down. Before the regiment could recover, a Confederate counterattack of North Carolinians surged into the Michiganders, making dozens more prisoners of war, and even capturing the 17th Michigan’s flag. In its brief attack, the 17th Michigan suffered 189 casualties of 225 men going into action—a loss of 84%. Fighting see-sawed back and forth near Heth’s Salient over the course of May 12, but ultimately no Federals were able to break through. Heth’s Confederates held firm, and six days later again repelled the Union attacks on May 18. Grant and Meade had been stopped in their last attacks at Spotsylvania. Realizing they would not be able to break through, both commanders looked for ways to get their army around Lee’s right once more. To do so, they would need the Fredericksburg Road.",

Actually, it was a very freeing thing.” George Fox, founder of the Religious Society of Friends in 17th century England, was quite forward thinking about the role of women in the Quaker faith. Pastor Ruthie Tippin of the West Branch Friends Church reveals that in 1671, Fox requested that women have their own place to do business at their “monthly meetings.” It was during those meetings that the sliding wooden partitions dividing the room were pulled down. (sound effects: roller partition closing) Ruthie Tippin: (music) “The idea was to give women opportunities to learn how to lead, to learn how to clerk or chair a meeting, to take roles in leadership within their community. And oftentimes he had seen that men would take over those roles in mixed company, and it was better, he felt, for women to exercise those kinds of qualities on their own. And from that came this divided business meeting concept, and it flourished, and it strengthened women’s' voices; it strengthened women’s place in leadership, not only in the Friends church, but in all of life.” Hoover’s mother Hulda was one who did not hesitate to take on a leadership role within the meeting. She helped conduct revivals, founded and led a young people’s prayer meeting, and took an active role in prohibition campaigns. After her husband’s death, the thirty-two year old widow became even more focused on the two things that brought her joy: her children and her faith. Imagine the power of one voice echoing off the walls while everyone else sits in silence. Hulda spoke often in meeting, and over time, her testimonies and insights were not only welcomed and encouraged, but also formally acknowledged by the congregation’s elders.",

            "transcript": "Swales on the Prairie Swales on the Prairie. 446 words. As you face this graphic panel at the side of the gravel path, you are looking out over a series of long swales running diagonally from your upper left to your lower right. They look like wide ditches covered with various grasses. The path continues to the left then curves towards the right to cross the swales. A small woody thicket lies on the far side of the swales. The graphic is three feet wide and two feet deep. The background shows a color illustration by Kathy Bourgeois of. A wagon train moving across a wide prairie. One covered wagon pulled by four mules is coming towards us at the lower left corner. A woman and a man sit in the wagon and another man walks alongside with a dog. A caption reads, “Traders often walked beside their wagons so that as many trade goods as possible could be carried in the wagon.” Three more wagons form a line moving from upper center toward lower right and three more wagons move in the same direction farther to the right. Some are pulled by mules and others by oxen. One man rides a horse alongside the group. Text across the top of the panel reads, “Created by thousands of wagons crossing the prairie, Black Jack Ruts are some of the most impressive swales along the Santa Fe Trail. One of these swales came down the hill and passed to your right, continuing through the woods and crossing the creek to the north. While the Santa Fe Trail was primarily a trade route, use of the trail changed through time. By 1854, settlers used it to access the newly organized Kansas Territory. Settlement led to a long-term cycle of displacing indigenous populations, disrupting prairie wildlife and vegetation, and permanently imprinting the land.” In the lower right corner of the panel is a small aerial photograph showing the four deepest and most visible swales, a whit arrow marking each. The trail crosses the swales in the foreground and then curves towards the distance. Text to the left of the photograph reads, “Finding the Best Route. Wagons traversed a variety of environments that posed unique challenges. Surrounded by creeks, teamsters here had to cross Grindstone Creek without breaking a wheel or axle. Wagons then climbed the ridge referred to as “The Narrows,” a nine-mile stretch of land between water hazards.” “Ten Swales. Four very deep, easily visible swales pass through this prairie. At a depth of four-and-one-half feet, they are some of the most dramatic on the trail. After the prescribed burn each April, ten swales are visible, traversing these 18 acres of prairie.” End of Description.",

As FDR’s political life expanded, so did the guest list for luncheons and dinners. Sara employed about a dozen servants to manage life at Springwood. The staff consisted of maids, butlers, valets, gardeners, cooks, and governesses. But as Eleanor recalled, “after we went to the White House, the big house at Hyde Park became more of an official residence, and at time we brought extra people to help his mother’s employees because of the large number of guests who followed the President, and the extra staff that must come with him.” The room is unfurnished today while restoration of the alcove nears completion.",

            "transcript": "Welcome to the Delta-01 Launch Control Facility and Launch Control Center. My name is Bill West, former United States Air Force Sergeant, and I served as a Flight Security Controller at Delta-01 from 1972 to 1974. I'll be your guide as you walk to the gate. This tour begins in the parking lot and each stop will take you closer to the Launch Control Facility. Access inside the gate is available on a reserved tour only. The six acre fenced compound you see in the distance was not a secret, but the millions of people who passed it on lnterstate-90 may have dismissed it as nothing more than a ranch house. Imagine though, if you were one of those innocent passersby and had glanced at the strange structures contained within the fence. Why were there so many antennas, and what were they for? What would you have thought the structures were? What went on inside the fence? How did this remote outpost contribute to America's Cold War defense? Along the walk to the front gate, additional stops will explore the features to be seen through the fence at Delta-01. The facility in front of you was continuously staffed by ten Air Force personnel day and night for thirty years. Two officers stood vigil in the underground launch control center, replaced each morning by a new missile combat crew dispatched from Ellsworth Air Force Base. Eight topside support personnel, including two flight security controllers, two two-person armed response teams, a cook, and a facility manager, worked three-day shifts. A single, manned, launch control facility such as Delta-01, linked to ten, unmanned, underground, missile silos was designated a \"flight.\" The silos were separated from the launch control facility and from each other by a distance of several miles. There were no missiles at this location. The dispersal of silos and control centers was to prevent the Soviets from destroying two targets with one of their warheads. Delta-01 was the hub for Delta Flight, one of five flights assigned to the 66th Strategic Missile Squadron of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing, headquartered at Ellsworth Air Force Base, near Rapid City. While it may feel remote, Delta-01 constantly communicated with the missiles under its command, the other control centers in the squadron, and Strategic Air command through a number of high tech systems. If you'd driven to the gate of Delta-01 during the Cold War, do you think the armed security police would have given you a warm welcome? As you open and close the gate for the sidewalk, you are practicing good manners for ranch country. The landscape around Delta-01 was open ranch land, and all manner of live stock might be grazing in adjacent fields, roads, and even the driveway to the launch control facility. Leaving a ranch gate the way you found it is considered to be good manners in ranch country. Delta Flight was part of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing, which spread over 13,500 square miles of western South Dakota, impacting the lives of many farmers and ranchers. In return for hundreds of miles of improved gravel roads and electric power to rural, previously-unserved areas, employment for local labor in the construction process, and the economic impact of the increased Air Force presence, local residents became uneasy partners with the nation's rapidly growing nuclear force in the early 1960's. The meeting of national security and practical local needs did not occur without conflict. The issue of land rights took on great importance. Most of the land needed for the system was in private hands. The Air Force had to acquire its pre-selected sites and do so quickly, whether through direct purchase, or, in extreme cases, the right of eminent domain. Landowners were at least partly right to think that strategic planners in far off military headquarters were playing God with their pastures. To ensure that the government took landowners' rights into consideration during site selection and fairly compensated landowners, a group of farmers and ranchers formed the Minuteman Missile Area Landowners Association in the early 1960s. The association disseminated information to area landowners, believing that working collectively would aid the defense effort while safeguarding their private interests . Inside the fence and beyond the volleyball court is a device that resembles a barbeque grill or a bingo spinner. Instead of making steaks or displaying a lucky number, this was a code burner used to destroy obsolete code books. Like milk, the secret codes used in the missile field had expiration dates. What did missileers do with secret code pages after they were out of date? They stored them in a paper bag in the Launch Control Center for up to a week. After changing over with the incoming missile crew, the off going crew would burn the bag of secrets in the code burner. Once the paper codes were burning well, the crew would spin the roller using the crank to either side. Rocks in the burner broke the ashes into tiny, unreadable particles. The code burner stands as a reminder of the nature of the work of the missile field and a workforce of Air Force personnel in their twenties with top secret clearances. How many antennas can you see inside the fence? The ability to quickly and reliably communicate with the ten missiles of Delta flight and the other flights in the squadron and missile wing was critical to the every-day operation of the missile field. Communications systems at Delta-01 include commercial telephone, the hardened high frequency transmit antenna, hardened high frequency receive antenna, hardened ultrahigh frequency antenna, survivable low-frequency communication system antenna, very high frequency antenna, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile super-high-frequency satellite terminal antenna, television satellite dish, and the cables of the hardened intersite cable system. Why so many antennas? First, multiple methods ensured constant communication within Delta Flight and to the wider Strategic Air Command regardless of operational circumstances·. Second, these antennas chart the near constant evolution of technology and operations. The two concrete circles mark the sites of the hardened high frequency transmit and receive antennas; built in 1963, these were abandoned by the late 1960s. The code burner sits.at the site of another high frequency antenna removed by the early 1970s. Obscured behind the building is the white dome of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile super-high-frequency satellite terminal antenna, installed in 1992, the year before Delta-01 was retired. The round white satellite dish in the yard did not serve a military purpose.- Added to the site in 1988, it provided satellite television reception for the airmen stationed here. Contrary to the Air Force image, the missile field workforce primarily traveled by car, truck, or armored vehicle. Because of its close proximity to the Interstate and being only seventy-miles from Ellsworth Air Force Base, Delta-01 was one of the easier control centers to reach. More remote sites could require a three hour drive each direction. While helicopter pads were present at every control center and silo, helicopters were only occasional visitors. The armored vehicle parked in the yard is a Peacekeeper, produced in the early 1980s by Cadillac Gage. Used by Air Force Security Forces as a fire team armored vehicle for escorting missile convoys, the Peacekeeper would have been only an occasional visitor to Delta-01. Blue-colored government vehicles, often pickups, jeeps, or suburbans, were most commonly used to travel to and from the launch control facility, and would have been parked here. A large garage hidden out of sight behind the main building heId a front end loader for use in clearing snow in the winter. On occasion, Delta-01 might have hosted overnight larger vehicles for maintenance or transport. Over the years the missile field operated in South Dakota, road networks continued to be maintained through federal funds to accommodate Air Force personnel and maintenance activities. Area businesses also benefited from traveling missile crews. With the introduction of Air Force personnel regularly traveling through the area, Wall Drug began advertising free coffee and donuts for Minuteman missile crews. This eventually led to free coffee and donuts to all veterans, truck drivers, hunters, snowmobilers, and honeymooners. The topside crew was eight enlisted airmen, who served at Delta-01 for three days at a time. While they had official tasks, especially for the off-duty alarm response team, you often had time to fill. Outside, a basketball hoop, horseshoes, and volleyball court awaited in good weather. Indoors, a weight room, cards, board games, ping pong table, pool table, a television with VCR and satellite dish as well as a good selection of books and magazines were available. In the Launch Control Center, thirty-one feet underneath the basketball hoop, the two missile officers had fewer options for entertainment. Many missileers used time in the capsule to fulfill the requirements of a master's degree. When there was not enough free time between alarms to concentrate on studying, missileers often played cards, pursued hobbies, or browsed through magazines. Some missile crews referred to such activities as \"frontline defense against alert boredom.\" In the 1980's, a TV and an AM/FM radio and cassette player were installed in the Launch Control Center capsule for the crew on duty. Missileer Matt Loughney remembered, \"there was always tension over what was being watched on TV, because our TV was controlled by their­ settings upstairs on the satellite. Invariably, the eighteen-year-old cop wanted to see Rambo eighteen times, so we would be stuck downstairs trying our damndest to stay awake at three in the morning, and there's Rambo for the fifty-eighth time on TV.\" Getting through the gate was not just a matter of driving up and asking to be let in. The sign at eye level alerted visitors that \"Use of Deadly Force Authorized.\" Everyone accessing the site-even those recognized-had to be authenticated before entering the compound as a precaution against sabotage or attack. This emphasis on security was included even in routine activities. One facility manager, serving at Delta- 01, once read his code backwards to the combat crew. Realizing his mistake, the crew asked if he was sure this was the way he wanted to state the codes. Unfortunately, the facility manager did not understand their hint, and was forced to return to Ellsworth Air Force Base to reverify his codes before accessing Delta-01. After verification, the Flight Security Controller would electronically open the gate lock. Incoming personnel would immediately report to the Security Control Center to verify their identity. Facility managers were also responsible for meeting any individual that entered the property, including everyone from branch chiefs, maintenance crews, and local law enforcement to family members and local ranchers. All visitors needed approval to visit a site, including family members. The family those serving alerts were allowed at the launch control facility on occasion, especially at Thanksgiving and Christmas. During the Cold War, visitors such as yourselves happening-across Delta-01 would not have received a warm welcome. When encountering unauthorized visitors, the standard procedure was for security forces to \"jack up\" suspects against a fence or wall and check their identification. At the far west end of the Launch Control Facility there were seven bedrooms, ensuring extra space for maintenance and security teams caught by bad weather. The cook had a large, well equipped kitchen to prepare anything from meals from scratch to fast food to foil pack meals. The foil packs were entrees prepared, frozen and shipped to Ellsworth Air Force Base from the kitchens at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The day room was a large, multipurpose room where you could eat a meal, read a book, play cards, or watch TV. The southeast side of the building has a communication equipment room, water treatment' room, and boiler room that are accessed through exterior doors. The boiler room can also be entered from the interior of the building. The rear of the support building has an attached very ­high-frequency antenna and an air conditioner. The Security Control Center was the office for the Flight Security Controller, located behind the large windows that look directly at the front gate. From this office, the Flight Security Controller controlled access to the facility's main gate and coordinated with their Security Alert Teams over the radio. The Flight Security Controller was the primary security contact for the missile officers in the Launch Control Center as well as controlling access to the Launch Control Center. In the three rooms between the Security Control Center and the front gate of the facility there were an air handling room that provided air conditioning and filtration to the Launch Control Center; a diesel generator for backup power to the Launch Control Center, and a recreation room with exercise equipment. In the spring of 1993, missile combat crews served their last alerts at Delta-01. They departed as the remainder of South Dakota's missile field was being dismantled in accordance with the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and warheads either country could possess. Delta-01 offers an unprecedented opportunity to see an underground control center in its original setting, and to contemplate the choices America has made to \"provide for the common defense.\" While the threats America faces have evolved in the generation since the end of the Cold War, the Minuteman missile remains a key component of United States nuclear deterrence. Known today today as \"Missile Alert Facilities,\" forty control centers similar to Delta-01 continue to watch over missiles kept on ready alert. Access inside the gate of Delta-01 is available on a reserved tour only. To protect the historic facilities and to provide for visitor safety, each tour is limited to six participants and a park ranger. This tour lasts forty-five minutes, beginning and ending at the entry gate. All tour participants must be able to walk and stand unassisted. All tours of the Delta-01 Launch Control Facility require advanced reservations and an amenity fee. Reservations can be made on-line or by phone. Reservations can be made up to 90 days prior to tour date. In the summer season, tours fill up to eight weeks in advance. We hope you enjoyed your walk to the gate. You can continue your visit at the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Visitor Center located 4 miles east of here at exit 131. There you can get more information on tours, watch the orientation film, and explore exhibits, and a bookstore. Be sure to also visit the Delta-09 missile silo located 10 miles west at exit 116.",

And I would climb up the maple tree, probably three-quarters of the way up, and from that spot, you could see the entire farm. And so if Mom needed to get a message to Dad, because of course there were no cell phones then, I’d climb up the tree, find out where Dad was, come back down, saddle up my horse, and I’d ride out to get him. You know, that was always kinda fun because that meant I got to use my horse, you know, at different times. And the fun thing about growing up on a farm was, I mean, it was a different era. You didn’t have to worry about your kids being out by themselves. We’d get up on a Saturday morning and pack our peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich and go hiking in the woods, or get on the horses and go wherever. And the rule was, you were home, washed, in your seat at six o’clock for dinner, and if you’d been out on the horses, you were back in time that the horses were groomed, and they were cooled down and they were fed before you were in your seat.",

            "transcript": "[-]Alan: The remarks following are taken from The Book of Abigail and John, a collection of letters between John and Abigail Smith Adams, edited by Lyman Butterfield, Marc Freidlaender, Mary Jo Kline, published in 1975. John and Abigail, Abigail and John – their names are as inseparably linked as those of any human pair in history… When they met in 1759, John Adams, 23 years old and a graduate of Harvard. Abigail was 15. He had recently returned from keeping school and studying law… to establish a practice in the village of Braintree on the South Shore of Massachusetts Bay…There was a tension between determination and self-doubt that was to remain central to John Adams character throughout his life… It may not be too much to say that these opposing forces would have pulled him apart…had he not encountered Abigail Smith. [-]October 4, 1762 Miss Adorable, By the same Token that the Bearer hereof sat up with you last night, I hereby order you to give him, as many Kisses and as many Hours of your Company after 9 O’Clock as he shall please to Demand… and I presume I have good right to draw upon you for the Kisses as I have given two or three Millions at least, when one has been received, and of Consequence the Account between us is immensely in favor of your, John Adams [-]Braintree February 14, 1763 Dear Madam, Accidents are often more Friendly to us, than our own Prudence. I intended to have been at Weymouth Yesterday, but a storm prevented. Cruel, yet perhaps blessed storm! Cruel for detaining me from so much friendly, social Company, and perhaps blessed to you, or me or both, for keeping me at my distance. For every experimental philosopher knows, that the steel and the magnet or the glass and feather will not fly together with more celerity than somebody and somebody, when brought within striking distance… John Adams [-] Debbie: In the mid-eighteenth century, young people wrote lots of letters, for fun and self-improvement even if they had little of consequence to tell each other. It was common to avoid signing one’s own name and to choose a name from ancient history or classical mythology. This was done not only to display one’s literary attainments but also to gain – or pretend to gain – at least temporary freedom from Puritan manners and morals. Thus in some of their earliest letters Abigail and John appear as Diana and Lysander. Diana was the Roman goddess of the hunt, while Lysander was a Spartan General whose defeat of the Athenians in 404 B.C. ended the Peloponnesian War. [-]Weymouth September 12 1763 …. Have you heard the News? That two Apparitions were seen one evening this week hovering about this house, which very much resembled you and a Cousin of yours. How it should ever enter into the head of an Apparition to assume a form like yours, I cannot devise. When I was told of it, I could scarcely believe it, yet I could not declare the contrary, for I did not see it, and therefore had not that demonstration which generally convinces me that you are not a Ghost. The original design of this letter was to tell you that I would next week be your fellow traveler provided I shall not be any encumbrance to you, for I have too much pride to be a clog to anybody. You are to determine that point. For your – A. Smith [-]Alan: In 1761 John Adams had inherited from his father a saltbox cottage at the foot of Penn’s Hill, with the arable orchard and wood land that went with it. … By 1763 he was formally recognized by the Smiths as Abigail’s husband-to-be. Fixing a time for their wedding was complicated by an outbreak of smallpox in Boston early in 1764. As a lawyer, Adams had to travel the court circuits, and so it seemed wise for him to be inoculated before establishing a household.” Adams was “confined’ in Boston for the month of April 1764. Abigail remained in Weymouth. May 7 and 9 saw a correspondence about Abigail’s “faults.” [-]Boston May 7th 1764 I promised you, sometime agone [sic], a Catalogue of your faults, imperfections, defects, or whatever you please to call them. … But I must caution you, before I proceed to recollect yourself… instead of being vexed or fretted or thrown into a passion, to resolve upon a Reformation – for this is my sincere Aim, in laying before you, this Picture of yourself. In the first place, then, give me leave to say, you have been extremely [sic] negligent in attending so little to Cards. You have very little inclination to that noble and elegant diversion… Another thing which ought to be mentioned… is, the Effect of a Country Life and Education, I mean. A certain Modesty, sensibility, Bashfulness, call it … which… you will, that enkindles Blushes forsooth at every Violation of Decency, in Company and lays a most insupportable Constraint on the freedom of Behavior… In the third place, you could never be prevailed on to learn to sing… An ear for Musick would be a source of much Pleasure, and a Voice and skill, would be a private … Amusement of great Value… In the fourth place you very often hang your head like a Bullrush. You do not sit, erected as you ought, by which Means, it happens that you appear too short for a Beauty, and the Company looses [sic] the sweet smiles of that Countenance and the bright sparkles of those Eyes. This fault is the Effect and Consequence of another, still more inexcusable in a Lady. I mean an Habit of Reading, Writing and Thinking. But both the Cause and the Effect ought to be repented and amended as soon as possible. Another fault, which seems to have been obstinately persisted in… is that of sitting with the Leggs [sic] across. This ruins the figure and the Air; this injures the Health… A sixth Imperfection is that of Walking with the Toes bending inward. This Imperfection is commonly called Parrot-toed, I think… But it gives… the reverse of a bold and noble Air, Reverse of the stately strut, and the Sublime Deportment. Thus have I given a faithful portraiture of all the Spots I have hitherto discerned… Near Three weeks I have conned and Studied for more, but more are not to be discovered. All the rest is bright and luminous. Having finished the Picture, I finish my Letter… There’s a prettily turned Conclusion for You! From your --- Lysander [-] Debbie Weymouth May 9, 1764 Your brother brought your letter… I thank you for your Catalogue, but must confess I was so hardened… to read over… my Faults with as much pleasure as another person would have read their perfections… Especially may I avoid that Freedom of Behavior which according to the plan given consists in Violations of Decency, and which would render me Unfit to Herd even with the Brutes. And permit me to tell you Sir… that there is such a thing as Modesty without either hypocrisy or Formality. As to a neglect of Singing, that I acknowledge to be a Fault which if possible shall not be complained of a second time… if I had not a voice harsh as the screech of a Peacock. The Capital fault shall be rectified, tho not with any hopes of being looked upon as a Beauty… To appear in the Eyes of Lysander has been for years past, and is still the height of my Ambition. The fifth thought will endeavor to amend… but you know I think that a gentleman has no business to concern himself about the Leggs of a Lady… But I must not write more. I borrow a hint from you, therefore will not add to my faults that of a tedious letter - a fault I never yet had reason to complain of in you, for however long, they never were otherwise than agreeable to your own A. Smith [-]Alan: Sept 30th, 1764 My dear Diana, It happens very unfortunately that my Business calls me away at this Juncture for Two Weeks together…Tomorrow Morning I embark for Plymouth with a disordered Stomach, a pale Face, and Aching Head, and an Anxious heart. And what Company shall I find there? Why, a Number of bawling Lawyers, drunken Squires, and impertinent and stingy Clients. … Oh my dear girl, I thank Heaven that another Fortnight will restore you to me…. My soul and body have been thrown into Disorder by your Absence, and a Month… would make me the most insufferable Cynick [sic] in the World… But you who have always softened and warmed my Heart, shall restore my Benevolence as well as my Health and Tranquility of Mind. Believe me, now and ever your faithful--- Lysander",

            "transcript": "009 (Grade 5) Slanted Wayside Panel: On the Brink 593 words / Panel Description: 4.5 minutes In front of you, is a slanted panel 3 feet wide by 2 feet tall, and about 3 feet off the ground. You are on a short concrete sidewalk that extends about 23 feet, or 7 meters, to your right. Near the middle of the sidewalk, there is a second angled sidewalk that extends ahead and to your right. The ground slopes slightly downward ahead of you. Follow the sidewalk to pass through a short, wrought iron fence. Continue about 100 feet, or 30 meters, to reach the Mount Pisgah Monument. Around you, are scattered deciduous trees. The ground slopes down into a valley with more scattered deciduous trees. Behind you, is a gravel road. On the other side of the road, is a 1-story brick restroom building. There is a black banner across the top on the panel. Left side text reads Mount Pisgah. Right side of the panel has the white, orange, and black triangular logo for the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. Below the banner, on the left side of the panel, is green and black text on a bright blue background: Title: On the Brink. Main text: The Mormon pioneer Vanguard Company arrived here in mid-May 1846, on the edge of the United States’ settled land. With a nearby spring for drinking water, Mount Pisgah was an ideal location for a second camp and resting place. Within a few days, additional emigrant companies arrived. Over 2 weeks, they built cabins and planted several thousand acres of crops for future travelers. Then they continued westward. They crossed the Grand River, off in the distance in front of you. Over 200 Latter-day Saints stayed here to farm the fields and welcome later travelers. The population grew to 700 by summer. This way station provided comfort but was also sorrowful. In the winter of 1846 to 1847, over 700 emigrants across Iowa died from exposure, malnutrition, and disease. End of Text Below the text, is a quotation: “Being pleased and excited at the varied beauty before me, I cried out, this is Mount Pisgah.” –Parley P. Pratt, May 11, 1846 The view reminded Pratt of the biblical mountain, from which Moses first saw the Promised Land. End of Text To the left of the quotation, is a historical photograph of Parley Pratt, a man with a receding hairline and bushy hair around his right ear. He wears a dark suit with a white shirt and a dark tie. His mouth is a straight line. To the right of the main text, is a scanned copy of a sketch of large landscape. The sketch, in dark ink, shows a rolling hill across the foreground with a flat valley stretching out behind it. Near the bottom left corner, is a seated man with a wide-brimmed hat, looking out at the landscape. Along the rolling hills, are 2 people and a scattered group of animals. There are small tents, covered wagons, and scattered trees in the valley. In the bottom right, in cursive handwriting text reads: Forenoon Sunday 18 May ‘46. Along the right side of the sketch, is the artist’s signature. Text below sketch: Peter O. H. Kimball sketched the rolling landscape around you on May 18, 1846. End of Text Across the bottom, is a color photograph of rolling green and light brown hills, with scattered clusters of leafy green trees. In the bottom right corner of the panel, is a QR code that you can scan with a mobile device to explore more about this wayside, including audio description. [End of Message]",

            "transcript": "The large blue 'lid' in front of the silo is the Personnel Access Hatch. Although the site was primarily unmanned, escorted maintenance teams periodically visited here for scheduled upkeep or to repair problems that might arise. The Personnel Access Hatch is a heavily-reinforced door, weighing five tons. Both Security and Maintenance strictly controlled access through this hatch to the interior of the silo. Only Security could open the first half of the system, the blue \"A-Circuit\" in front of the hatch. The security escort entered a combination provided to them by the Flight Security Controller. After opening the lock they removed the 'A-circuit', retracted a locking shaft, and flipped a switch that hydraulically raised the hatch. The door takes several minutes to open. Once open, the maintenance team chief reached another combination lock. Entering an encoded combination here, an elevator-type \"B-Plug\" with a telescoping ladder slowly lowered to provide access to the equipment room. Opening the \"B-Plug\" coincided with how long it took an Alarm Response Team to arrive from Delta-01, should anyone have broken protocol or attempted to gain unauthorized access. Among many areas here, the equipment room, the interior of the silo were considered \"No-Lone Zones\". Personnel had to remain within visual contact of one another at all times. Any area of the missile field where the command and control of nuclear weapons could be compromised was considered a \"No-Lone Zone\". Daily work \"trips\" could last up to 16 hours at a time. This impacted Maintenance and Security troops alike. Since Maintenance couldn't access a site without Security providing the first half of their entry, even after Maintenance had re-secured their \"B-Side\" areas, Security still had to install a new \"A-Side\" combination and re-secure it. On most \"trips\", crews spent over half their work-day in long drives to and from sites, as well as the meticulous process of gaining access to or securing the site. Long days often broke a mandatory safety timeline, forcing crews and their escorts to Remain Overnight (R.O.N.) at the nearest Launch Control Facility, like Delta-01. Accommodations were acceptable and the food decent, but few crews enjoyed getting stuck in the field. It was a common source of frustration among many.",

Quart-size cardboard bottles were affixed with \"Connemara Farms\" caps and sold to local dairies and individuals. After mandatory pasteurization laws were passed in the early 1950's, Mrs. Sandburg no longer sold milk directly, but collected the milk in large containers to be sold to larger dairies for pasteurization and distribution.",

            "transcript": "ASHLEY C. FORD Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony’s fingerprints are all over The Constitution. Frederick Douglass – with the 13th and 14th Amendments – especially the 15th, which provided for Black men’s right to vote. Susan B. Anthony – with the 19th Amendment, which secured women’s right to vote. What most people don’t know is that Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony were lifelong friends. They had a rich, complicated 45-year-long friendship. They were allies. They were sometimes adversaries. They agitated each other. They agitated the nation. They had one of the most important and unlikely friendships in American history. I’m Ashley C. Ford. This is The Agitators. …. Presented by the Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission the National Park Service and PRX. What you are about to hear over the next six episodes is a fiction based in facts. What are the facts? That Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass met as adults and became lifelong friends. Fact. We know that their families were close. The Anthony’s were Quakers and abolitionists. On Sunday afternoons, local activists gathered at their family farm in Rochester, New York. The Douglass Family often attended. Before Frederick was close to Susan, he was especially close to Susan’s father – so much so that when Daniel Anthony died, Frederick gave the eulogy at his funeral. We know that Frederick and Susan were both speakers for the Anti-Slavery Society. We know, during Reconstruction after the Civil War, they were vital to the creation of the American Equal Rights Association – the AERA. We know they had a messy, public fight over the 15th Amendment – which, in 1870, prohibited voter discrimination based on race, but not sex -- effectively granting Black men the vote, yet still excluding all women. We’ll get more into that later. Frederick was, arguably, the foremost male feminist of the 19th Century. He routinely gave speeches at meetings for the National Woman Suffrage Association, which was founded by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. In fact, on the day Frederick died – February 20th, 1895 – he had spent most of the day sitting next to Susan at a meeting of the National Council of Women – in Washington, D.C. And in that council meeting, on that particular day, there were women of color meeting alongside white women. But we know that the women’s suffrage movement too often excluded women of color– and this was a source of tension between Frederick and Susan. These are the facts. We know Susan and Frederick were in the same place together at the same time with regularity for forty-some years. What we don’t know is what Susan and Frederick said to each other behind closed doors. That is where playwright Mat Smart comes in. This six-part podcast is based on his play The Agitators which uses the facts of their friendship and. . . takes a leap. 2020 is the perfect year to reflect on these two American titans… it’s the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment and the 100th anniversary of the 19th. So let’s get to it. Episode One: Beginnings. 1849 and 1861. We begin our story in 1849, on the day that Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony met in Rochester, New York. Oh – one more thing – we know that Frederick taught himself how to play violin – and that he was good at it. Prologue. [In darkness, a breath. In. Out. In. A heart beats. Steady, then faster. Chains drag across a wooden floor. Chains fastened to a post. A whip lashes. It lashes again. Again. Again.] In silhouette, we see a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a brilliant mane of hair. He holds a violin. It is Frederick Douglass. [He plays three short notes of the same pitch followed by a fourth on a lower pitch. The violin quiets the other noise. He plays the last note louder and louder until it loses tune. He pulls the bow from the strings. The sound of another lash. Another. The sound of the gag, the thumb-screw, the pillory, the bowie-knife. The violence of noise grows louder until it is unbearable. The violinist raises the bow and attacks the strings. He plays a few short, strong intervals. It quiets the other noise. The music from the violin is erratic. It has a melody for a moment and then the melody disappears. The violence of noise returns, gradually becoming louder than before. The man continues to play the violin along with it. Bloodhounds bark. A pistol fires once. Twice. The heartbeat and breath are deafening. A light rises on a tall woman with a piercing stare, some distance away. She watches the man play violin. The cacophony grows and grows until a string on the violin breaks.] Frederick stares at his violin as though he does not understand what he holds in his hands Episode One The Anthony Family Farm Rochester, New York Autumn 1849 [A bright, Sunday afternoon. The lawn of the farmhouse. FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 31 years old, stands on the inside of a split-rail fence. Next to him, there is a chair and a tray of food. There is a dish of peach cobbler. It looks cold and untouched. SUSAN B. ANTHONY, 29 years old, watches him. FREDERICK takes out a pencil and hurriedly writes something down. He crosses a word out and writes another.] SUSAN Mr. Douglass? Mr. Douglass? I cannot tell you how much I have looked forward to meeting you, Mr. Douglass. You are one of my father’s favorite people in Rochester. There is nothing he loves more than the Sunday afternoons you and your family spend here on our farm. And I apologize that my teaching in Canajoharie kept me away. It is an honor to finally meet you. But you have barely said a word all afternoon. Why are you out here by the fence, by yourself, in the far corner of the yard? And why have you not tried the peach cobbler I made? It is cold now. What were you playing? What song was that? Do you not like peaches? What did you write down? – a moment ago. You do not have to tell me, of course, but I am curious. FREDERICK Here. SUSAN “We have to do with the past only as we can make it. . . “ FREDERICK “Useful.” SUSAN “We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future.” “We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future.” Thank you. I could not find good peaches in Canajoharie. Since I resigned my position, I have eaten a dozen peaches a day here. And I am not tired of them yet. I cannot believe you do not like peaches. I should have made an apple cobbler. Next Sunday, I will – FREDERICK Did I say I do not like peaches? SUSAN You did not say anything at all. Do you like peaches? FREDERICK Yes. SUSAN Oh. Then do you not like cobbler? I offended you earlier – is that what happened? I never should have stammered up to you and asked you to sign my copy of your autobiography. I apologize. Did I offend you earlier? FREDERICK No. SUSAN No? FREDERICK No. SUSAN Then I think you are being quite rude. FREDERICK Rude? SUSAN Yes, if I put you off earlier, then I apologize and I quite understand your behavior. But if I did not put you off, then I should think you are being rather rude. FREDERICK You did not put me off earlier. You are putting me off now. I am here, in the far corner of the yard, because this is the best vantage point to watch my children play. To watch my beautiful wife Anna – with our little Annie swaddled to her chest. To watch your father and your mother, your brothers and your sisters. You. Look at all these abolitionists – young and old. Look at the miracle of our families all together. It is a glimpse of what the future of this hateful, hypocritical country could be. Outside this fence, a black man talking to an unmarried white woman is a death sentence. This conversation – right now – is enough to have me killed. SUSAN You are safe here. FREDERICK I am welcome here. But there is nowhere in America that I am safe. Charles! Down from the – Charles Remond Douglass! Down from that peach tree! You filthy abolitionist! Now! [From across the yard, the sound of children laughing] SUSAN Outside this fence, the fact that I am 29 years old and unmarried is scandalous. Most women my age have six or seven children by now. FREDERICK And why do you not? SUSAN Oh, the question everyone must ask me! Do you too think I am incomplete without a husband and six or seven children? FREDERICK It is not an indictment. It is only a question. SUSAN As soon as a woman marries, she dissolves into her husband. All of the wages she earns go directly to him. She cannot purchase property. She cannot sign contracts. And if her husband drinks every night and beats her – she cannot divorce him. She cannot leave him. Because if she did, she would lose her children and be cast out from society forever. Her only prospects being prostitution and death. It is a wonder to me that any woman chooses to marry. FREDERICK But what about love? SUSAN How do you mean? FREDERICK What if you fall in love? SUSAN Who is to say I have not fallen in love? FREDERICK I meant the general you – not you in particular. Because when one falls in love, sometimes it changes one’s thinking. SUSAN Well, if and when one falls in love, it should not change one’s thinking on the injustices of the institution of marriage. . . . If I ever fall in love, it will be with an equal. FREDERICK When I first met Anna, I was a slave and she was free. We were not equals. She was everything I hoped to become. Anna! You are a vision! – standing there with your violin – I love you! I have loved you since I first saw you in Baltimore walking down South Caroline Street! [FREDERICK picks up his violin and plays an impassioned riff] Do you hear how much I love you? [FREDERICK plays another riff. From across the lawn, the sound of his wife Anna playing her violin in response. FREDERICK listens. He smiles. He plays a riff, responding to her music. She responds to his. Together, they play a strange, rapturous duet. They finish with a flourish. From across the yard, there is clapping and a burst of approval] I owe everything to you – you beautiful, euphonious woman! [The children laugh; quietly, to SUSAN, still looking at Anna] I only had the courage to run away because I was running away to Anna. Twelve days after I escaped, we were married. Throughout my life, it is women who have taught me how to be the man I am. Your father said you recently gave your first public speech in Canajoharie – a speech on temperance. He said it caused quite an agitation. SUSAN Agitation is overstating it. It was more of a. . . stir. A gentle stirring really. FREDERICK It prompted people to start calling you “The Smartest Woman in Canajoharie.” SUSAN I am afraid that is not much of a compliment. [FREDERICK laughs] And more accurately, people called me “The Smartest Woman Who Has Ever Been in Canajoharie.” Sadly, still not much of a compliment. FREDERICK Your father beams with pride when he speaks of you. SUSAN I do not know why. I am a school teacher who quit her job and moved home. I have done nothing yet. FREDERICK He believes you can become anything you want to become. . . . Do you realize how unusual your father is? SUSAN He is like many Quaker men. FREDERICK No, he is not. Even though Quaker men say they believe in the equality of the sexes, when it comes to their wife – or daughter – speaking her mind with abandon – their conviction wanes. It may be 1849, but most men, however enlightened, find the idea of a woman giving a public speech repugnant. SUSAN And how do you find it? FREDERICK I find it. . . as vital as oxygen. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. SUSAN And to meet you. FREDERICK Please – sit. SUSAN No, thank you. FREDERICK Sit for a moment – I insist. SUSAN I do not know how to sit. May I tell you why I resigned my teaching position in Canajoharie? It is because I cannot sleep. I lie awake at night, my mind racing, my heart pounding – only thinking of one thing: How do we end slavery? How? Mr. Douglass, what can I do to help? I know there are many things that my father – and all of my family – have already tried, but nothing has changed. What more can we do? It is 1849 – how is this still happening? I cannot think of anything else. I cannot sleep. I – FREDERICK So we should end slavery because it keeps you up at night? SUSAN That is not what I – FREDERICK Why then? When is your birthday? SUSAN What? FREDERICK When were you born? SUSAN February 15th, 1820. FREDERICK I do not know mine. Not the day. Not the year. Do you keep a record of a horse’s birthday? Or a mule? I did not understand – when I was growing up – why did the white children get to have birthdays and I did not? Why do you get to have a birthday and I do not? Answer that. Why? [SUSAN tries to find an answer, but she cannot] Slavery is not an idea to me – it is not a great evil that happens far away in the South that keeps me up at night. Slavery is what stole the first twenty years of my life. Why do you get to know your brothers and sisters and I do not? Because mine are in chains – right now – my sisters and my only brother are in chains right now – And three million of my brethren. Has your father ever hit you? SUSAN What? – no. FREDERICK Has he ever whipped you? SUSAN No. FREDERICK Has he raped your mother? SUSAN Mr. Douglass! FREDERICK That is what the white man – my father – did. That is what the white master did to my mother. Over and over. Slavery steals our bodies away from us. It is a destroyer of family. My daughter Rosetta was born June the 24th. Lewis on October 9th. Frederick – March 3rd. Charles – October 21. Annie – March 22nd. They are why slavery must end. . . . What I would give – to have known my mother. What I would give – to look across the yard on a Sunday afternoon and see her. I only saw my mother but four or five times in my life. After I was born – she was taken from me and put twelve miles away. But four or five times, at night, she was able to walk the twelve miles and lie down with me and sing me to sleep. And long before I waked, she would be gone. She had to walk the twelve miles again before daybreak or she would be whipped. She worked sun-up to sun-down, walked twelve miles, sang me to sleep, then walked twelve miles back before sun-up. And I – I cannot remember the song. [FREDERICK hums three short notes of the same pitch followed by a fourth on a lower pitch] It is always just out of reach, just beyond. But I will find it. I will find my mother’s song. [FREDERICK picks up his violin and plays. On his violin, FREDERICK plays the three shorts notes of the same pitch followed by a fourth on a lower pitch. He cannot remember any more. He plays the four notes again. He plays it again. He cannot remember it] SUSAN What can I do to help? FREDERICK There is only one thing to do. To agitate. Agitate, agitate, agitate. SUSAN But agitation alone is not enough. FREDERICK Agitation is the spark to the fire of all change. As long as there is slavery, the Constitution is a sham. It is nothing but a piece of paper with lies and unfulfilled promise. We must make people angry, make them listen, make them talk. Nothing changes if people are not talking about it. That must come first. SUSAN We need more than words. FREDERICK Why is it illegal to teach a slave to read? Because words can shine light unto injustice like no other force. If I did not know how to read and write, I never could have escaped slavery. What can you do? Use your words as weapons for moral change. Use the privileged air you breathe to speak out against slavery to everyone you know and everyone you meet. We need you. We need more of our white brothers and sisters to break their silence. We need you to speak out in the street in the counting house in the prayer meeting in the conference room by the fireside from the pulpit, but especially at the polls. Convince your father to vote. It is a crime that he has the right, but never has gone to the polls – not once. SUSAN Quakers have no interest in voting. The government is corrupt. If he votes, he becomes a part of that corruption. The government wages war. If he votes, he condones that violence. FREDERICK But if he votes – SUSAN He has no interest in voting. Neither do I. FREDERICK You ask me what you can do. I say use your words. You say we need more than words. I say convince your father to vote. You say he will not vote. Why did you ask for my opinion if you did not want to hear it? I hate to tell you, Susan, but white folks have a problem with listening. And the only thing harder for you to do than to listen to a black man is to hear him. A shipwrecked man was cast upon the sands of a faraway beach. SUSAN What? FREDERICK Days before, when the sailors had set sail, the sea was smooth with a smiling surface. Only after they were well embarked, did the waves turn to fury and send the ship to destruction and doom. The one man who lived, upon waking on the sands of this faraway beach, cursed the sea for deceiving him. For destroying his ship. For drowning everyone but him. Much to the shipwrecked man’s surprise, the sea arose and replied: “Lay not the blame on me, O sailor, but on the winds. By nature, I am as calm and safe as the land itself, but the winds fall upon me with their gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to me.” SUSAN Am I the shipwrecked man? Or are you? Is my father? FREDERICK I am partial to Aesop and his Fables. Not only because Aesop was born a slave, or that he was African, or that he gained his freedom with his own cunning and intellect, but because Aesop forces us to think about our own twisting, changing, selfish nature. SUSAN What is the wind? FREDERICK What is the wind? SUSAN Will you please try the peach cobbler? FREDERICK Fine, yes – I will try it. [FREDERICK picks up the dish of cobbler. The fork falls from the plate to the ground] SUSAN I will get you another fork. FREDERICK No need. My hands will do just fine. Wait. Have you had any? SUSAN No. But I am starting to think you never will, Mr. Douglass. FREDERICK Stop calling me Mr. Douglass. We are nearly the same age. SUSAN What shall I call you then? FREDERICK Call me what your mother and father call me. SUSAN You are a great and famous man – I cannot call you Fred. FREDERICK I am your parent’s friend. I am your brothers’ and sisters’ friend. I am yours as well. SUSAN Even though I put you off? FREDERICK It is the trait I most desire in my friends. SUSAN Frederick. Fred. No. Frederick. FREDERICK Have some cobbler. SUSAN I will later. FREDERICK I insist. Ooo. This is the best cobbler I have ever tasted. SUSAN My mother said that is what you told her about her cobbler. FREDERICK I did. But I had not yet had yours. [They laugh.] SUSAN . . . Do you believe this can ever be a country for all? FREDERICK I hope it can be, but Susan. . . there are great many people who will do anything in their power to prevent that from happening. SUSAN I know. FREDERICK You do not know. And I hope you will never know the depths of hatred that I have seen man descend to. SUSAN Then let us – us women and men – reach for the heights together. [There is a brilliant, burst of light. The moment stops. It burns into their memory. After several moments, we hear the sounds of an angry mob] Association Hall Anti-Slavery Society Meeting Albany, New York February 5, 1861 [It is ten-and-a-half years later. Evening. Smoke is everywhere. There is the pulsing sound of feet stomping, fists pounding walls, and a mob shouting: “Damn the abolitionists! Damn the abolitionists! Damn the abolitionists!” SUSAN, now 40 years old, and FREDERICK, now 42 years old, rush through a wooden door. They slam it shut behind them and lock it. They are in a small storage room. The smoke surrounds them. They cough. They cover their mouths with handkerchiefs] SUSAN What happened? FREDERICK Someone threw pepper in the stove. [The sound of the mob on the other side of the door grows louder.] Your lip is bleeding! ASHLEY C. FORD End of Episode One.

I'm Joshua Bell, park ranger with the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. Today, we have Paul Schaughency. How are you doing today, Paul? Paul Schaughency: I'm doing fine. Thanks, Josh. Joshua Bell: Outstanding. I just wanted to let you know this conversation is being recorded. Is that okay? Paul Schaughency: That's okay. Joshua Bell: Outstanding. For the record, could I have you state your name and when and where you were born? Paul Schaughency: I'm Paul Schaughency. The spelling sure doesn't come out anything like that. I was born in Beaver, PA, a town of about 5,000+ and a county seat. Joshua Bell: When were you born? Paul Schaughency: I was born September 14, 1921. I'm 94 and still operating under my own two feet. Joshua Bell: Excellent. I'm glad to hear it. Paul Schaughency: Yeah. I am too. Joshua Bell: I imagine. What were your parent's names? Paul Schaughency: My father was known as \"C.P.\", Charles Preston. My mother was Julia Rogers Schaughency. Joshua Bell: What did they do for work? Paul Schaughency: My father was a wholesale hardware salesman, and my mother was a housewife. Back then, we're talking about the '20s and the depression years, women didn't work. I mean there were a few. There was a woman doctor who came to the people across the street in her black - I don't know what kind of car it was; I've forgotten - coupe. Joshua Bell: That must have been quite something. Very different, I'm sure. Paul Schaughency: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Joshua Bell: Do you remember her name? Paul Schaughency: No. I remember our doctor's name, but I don't remember the name of my friend's doctor across the street. Joshua Bell: Did you have any siblings growing up? Paul Schaughency: Yes. I was the youngest of three boys. We were spread out pretty well. My oldest brother was seventeen years older than I. My next brother was nine and a half years older than I. Then, I came. If you'll notice, my initials are P.S (Post Script). I thought it's kind of ironic: my mother was within three days of her 41st birthday, so I almost didn't get here. Joshua Bell: Talk about rolling the dice. Did they join the service as well during World War II? Paul Schaughency: No. They were too old by then. By 1942 my mother and father were in their 60's That didn't fit. Joshua Bell: No. Your brothers didn't join either? Paul Schaughency: No. They were married with children and in their 30's. Joshua Bell: Yes, certainly. What was it like growing up in the '20s and '30s? Paul Schaughency: Well, it was the depression. I don't remember a whole lot about the '20s. I remember Hoover. Then, we had a Hoover button. I hung it in our canary's birdcage. Then Hoover was blamed for the Depression, and so he didn't get re-elected. That started Roosevelt's era… I remember that part. I was twelve or something like that. It was really bad. We lived in a small town… it was a residential town surrounded by lots of industry. The people worked. People were laid off. It was tough. They had to do something. Old Roosevelt came out with program after program. Joshua Bell: He sure did. Did the depression affect your family at all? Paul Schaughency: My dad lost his job with one company and went back with another company. He was working. Of course, salesmen are on commission. I can remember him saying , \"I didn't make enough to pay for the gasoline today.\" Times were tough. He was working all through but skimping. I do remember candy bars, for a five cents and movies, ten cents. It's hard to believe with the inflation we've had. The prices of those things today are much, much, much more. Joshua Bell: They certainly are. I want to change gears a little bit. Where did you go to school? Paul Schaughency: I went to Beaver High School and graduated in 1939. Hitler was going well over in Europe. \"We bailed them out once,\" you'd hear. \"We're not going to go over there again.\" The president decided we'd better get some preparedness. They put the draft through, but I'll tell you how divided the country was on this question. The draft passed by congress by one vote. That's pretty close. The draft was put in. There was a song, \"Good-bye, dear. I'll be back in a year, 'cause I'm in the Army now.\" It was a one-year draft. They activated the National Guard units and called them in. They were supposed to be called up for a year. I think there were one or two that were called in early actually got back home. Then, December 7th hit. They were called back in. Joshua Bell: You mentioned Hitler. What do you remember hearing about him? Paul Schaughency: Bad. It was awful, some of the things. We didn't know too much about the Holocaust. That was pretty well covered up by them over there. I mean covered up. There were other things. We knew about the Kristallnacht when the storm troopers broke the glass and broke windows of Jewish business people and so forth. Those things were going on either in a news reel … we didn't have television but news reels, radio or newspapers. We got the stuff. The sentiment here was as I said, \"We're not going over there again.\" Joshua Bell: How did your family feel about that? Paul Schaughency: They were not against getting prepared. I didn't hear them saying anything against it. I guess they were all right with it. Joshua Bell: Then, Pearl Harbor was attacked. Paul Schaughency: Then came Pearl Harbor. I can't explain to you or the young people today how that affected all of the people. I mean the America Firsters which were the anti-going to war and helping Europe out, they weren't too much against preparing for here but, “Don't go over and do that again.” You just didn't hear anything from them. They attacked us. That was really unifying us … well, a Japanese admiral, after the war, I read a this admiral had said, \"I'm afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant.\" No truer words were spoken because that whole country pulled together. There was no arguing, \"We should have done this,\" or, \"We should have done that.\" I mean we declared war … I remember listening to the radio. President Roosevelt said the Monday after Pearl Harbor and it was on a weekend, \"I'm asking congress declare that a state of war has existed since December 7.\" I said to the guys around listening at the fraternity house, \"It 'has existed'. I like that. We're declaring war retroactive to December 7th.\" It was a dastardly attack as he had said, and it was. We all pulled together and got the industry going. Pittsburgh, of course, was a big, big part of it, the steel. It got going. Of course, they had price controls and so on. Prices didn't go up terribly during the war. Pittsburgh was very, very important to the war effort. You could sense it around. Joshua Bell: You said that you were in the fraternity house when that happened. You were at college? Paul Schaughency: Yeah. In '39, I graduated from high school. The depression was still on. There's no way I was going to get to go to college unless I got a scholarship, and I did. The University of Pittsburg had one scholarship for they called it their 'honor's scholarship. I did well in school. I got the scholarship that was half the tuition. Mother said, \"You've got half of the tuition. I will find some way of getting the other half.\" Tuition was $150 a semester, $300 a year. Getting that scholarship got me in the university. We were registering at the beginning of my freshman year. My friend from Beaver, Bill Donaldson, (who became a doctor and later the medical director of Children's hospital here), was kind of showing me around. He had gotten the same scholarship the year before. We got to the end of the line. They had these IBM cards. I was asked, \"What do want, gym or ROTC?\" I turned to Bill. I said, \"What did you take?\" He said, \"If you take gym, you've got to go up to Trees Gym. That's way up the hill over there behind the stadium. You've got to take a showerand if you have a class next period, it's bad.\" He said, \"I took ROTC.\" I said, \"What’s that?\" \"Reserve Officers Training Course.\" He said, \"You go as a lieutenant if there's a war instead of a private.\" All I was looking at is that big climb up that hill and so I said, \"I'll take ROTC.\" That was a great step, but I didn't know it at the time. I got into ROTC. In 1941, I got into advanced ROTC. Then, December 7th hit. The colonel came to the class and said, \"Now, boys, there will be enough heroes, running off to join the Air Corps.\" It wasn't the Air Force at that time. It was the Army Air Corps. \"Your Uncle Sam wants you boys to stay and get your education.\" We all looked at each other and said, \"If Uncle Sam wants us to stay, I guess we better.\" It was a great thing! We got to finish our degree! Joshua Bell: What was your major? Paul Schaughency: Business. Joshua Bell: How did you feel about this idea that Uncle Sam wanted you to finish your education? Paul Schaughency: [00:14:42] Great! People were running off and volunteering and so forth. I was in the program. They said they wanted us to stay. I said, \"Well, that's a good thing.\" They had a lot of programs during the war, training. They had the ASTP [Army Specialized Training Program]. They said, \"We're going to need trained people. We got to start training them in technical areas.\" It didn't pan out too well because the Battle of the Bulge came, and they took all those guys out of ASTP there and started in the infantry and backing up the Bulge problem. ROTC got to finish and get our degree. Before the war, ROTC, after your junior year in the summer, you went to a six-week summer camp, but now they're training divisions. We’re getting ready for war. They couldn't be messing around with these college boys for six weeks and busting up their training schedules. They said, \"No, no. We're not going to do that. You'll go to something new called OCS, Officer Candidate School.\" We finished college and got called to active-duty. Earlier they had asked us if we wanted to join the Enlisted Reserve. There were some wiseacres in our class that said, \"Wait a minute. If you join the Reserve, you're in the Army. If you wash out of OCS, they'll soon tell you where to go. If you go as a cadet, then you have to come back home to be drafted.\" Some of us said, we're going to play that game, \"We'll go as a cadet.\" But by the time '43 came, we were told, \"There are some that are not in the Reserve. We want everybody in the Enlisted Reserve. You go to your draft board and tell them that you need to get drafted. Then, you'll be assigned to the Enlisted Reserve from your draft.\" That was fine except I went to my draft board. I knew the girl there. I went as a contingent of one, a draftee sent up to Pittsburgh for my physical processing just like a draftee. I get down to the end and the Sgt. said, \"Do you want to go now or in two weeks?\" I said, \"Hold it. I'm in the ROTC out at Pitt University. I'm supposed to be drafted into the Enlisted Reserve.\" This sergeant didn't know what I was talking about. He said, \"Do you want to go now or in two weeks?\" I said, \"Neither one.\" I said, \"I'm supposed to go into the Enlisted Reserve and then go when I finish ROTC.\" He got some major. The major knew about it, thank God. They said, \"Okay.\" I got drafted. I was assigned to the Enlisted Reserve and then went back to school and finished. I went to OCS. They'd asked us to go to summer school to get finished sooner. I said, \"Well I've got to work. Can I work for my expenses?\" They said, \"Approved.\" The other guys that did go to summer school in my class went to Camp Davis Anti-Aircraft OCS When you went to college in those days, if you went to this college, they had this kind of ROTC, maybe infantry. Another one might have field artillery. Ours was coast artillery, and that was Seacoast and anti-aircraft. Davis was the anti-aircraft OCS. We ended up in Seacoast which was down at Fort Monroe, a beautiful fort in Virginia. The engineer on the project to build that fort was Robert E. Lee. During the Civil War, the south never took Fort Monroe. I suppose that engineer knew how it was constructed. It was pretty well-constructed so they didn't want to try, I guess. I don't know why. Joshua Bell: That makes sense to me. Paul Schaughency: [00:19:38] Yeah. We got through there. I got my choice of places. Fort Hancock, New Jersey was one of them. You got your choice based on your class ranking and what you picked. I got Fort Hancock. That was supposed to be a great assignment because they had a ferry boat \"45 minutes from Broadway\" as the old song went. You're sticking out from New Jersey, but you're close to New York. That sounded great to me. The only trouble was that they didn't tell you what unit you're going to be assigned to. I was assigned to the 265th Coast Artillery, a Florida National Guard unit. The word was they're being alerted for overseas. It was November 19th. I graduated out of OCS. I got down there in early December. Christmas time was coming. [00:20:56] I contacted my girlfriend back at Pittsburgh. We'd been dating for a couple of years. She couldn't come for Christmas. She didn't want to leave her parents alone, but she'd come for New Years. Okay!! She came for New Years. We decided on a Thursday to get married the following Tuesday on a three day pass and have a church wedding. Being the boy in a family, of boys, I didn't know about all the details. I've learned since. She called her father to make arrangements at the church. I said, \"I guess I'm supposed to ask your father if it's all right.\" I talked to him. He approved. We're still married. She's still living. Seventy-two years married. We got back to Ft. Hancock on time. I said it was a Florida National Guard outfit that had been activated. Of course, they had changes. Some people were taken out. Other people were draftees or sent in. It was about half and half. [00:22:29 ] Before we had left the Fort, this one sergeant, a real sharp guy said, \"Lieutenant, don't worry about this overseas things.\" He said, \"This outfit's been alerted for overseas twice before. Don't worry about it. Go have yourself a nice wedding. We'll still be here when you get back.\" He was just a little mistaken. [00:23:10] After we got back, we were there seven days, and then my wife was on a train back to Pittsburgh. I was on a train for Fort Lawton in Seattle. Seattle, we knew was the … the port of embarkation for Alaska. When we were in OCS and assignments were coming up, two guys wanted to be together. They signed up for Fort Lewis, Washington. Scuttlebutt got Fort Lewis and Fort Lawton mixed up, I guess. The word was that Fort Lewis was the port of embarkation for Alaska. Instead of a \"forward march\", we kidded them, \"You'll be saying forward mush, ho, ho, ho,” because you're going to be going to Alaska. Arriving in Seattle, I now know the difference. I called one of the two guys. The first thing thisguy says to me, \"Oh, Schaughency.\" He says, \"Forward mush! He knew that we were at the port of embarkation for Alaska.\" Joshua Bell: I want to go back for a minute and ask about the OCS. What was training like there? Paul Schaughency: [00:24:33] Very rigorous as far as classroom work and the gunnery part. There was marching. We did get some practical experience on some of the big guns. The classroom work was the biggest thing. You had a lot of math. They told us, \"Sure, we've got base end stations where there's a telescope.\" They could measure the angle. You set these two stations up and site on this ship. Triangulation will tell you where to fire the guns and how far and so forth. They said that the data went into a plotting board. They sent the information to the big guns to shoot out into the sea. You knock off the ship. They told us, \"You've got to understand this whole thing because down in the Pacific, the guys are setting these up on orange crates.\" They can get a triangulation and get this thing set up. There's a plotting board. There's a real nice room and fixed up pretty nice at Fort Monroe. They were telling us, \"You've got to know all this stuff.\" It was rather rigorous in math and science. Joshua Bell: Did you guys get up to anything on your downtime? Paul Schaughency: We didn't have a lot. Our orders to go to active-duty were, \"Proceed to Cumberland.\" That was processing-in. You got your uniform, your shots and so forth. Then, the assignment to basic training in Fort Eustis, Virginia. Those Pitt guys were really complaining. \"Oh, my golly. First, they tell us we're not going to six-week summer camp. They've got this 90 days, OCS. It's been extended to four months now. Then, we were supposed to go to OCS. What are we doing? We're going to basic training.\" It was gripe, gripe, gripe. We got over to Fort Monroe. There were three groups in our class. One group was up from the ranks and passed their OCS application and go to the OCS board and the OCS examination. They had come through the ranks. The other group was our Pitt group- part of them; the rest came on in the next class. They said, \"We'll get one class through and then start the next one.\" That was all it was. We were in basic training like just a couple of weeks. Then, the others came on a month later. There was a group up from the ranks, the group from Pitt who were complaining, weren’t complaining. The third group was from the Citadel. Those Pitt boys really quit complaining. They said, \"Holy smokes. Those guys are in uniform all the time. That's the West Point of the South. They have to do this too. Oh, boy. We only go in uniform one day a week, and then we go to class. They're into this stuff. Matter of fact, they can get demerits. They're restricted for the weekend. We've got none of that. Oh, boy. I guess we don't have so much to complain about.\" We got along fine with the Citadel group. It was very interesting. At hindsight, you can see what was happening, we had to wait until the classes started. At the time, boy, we were really complaining. Joshua Bell: How did your family feel about you being activated? Paul Schaughency: The war was on. I think they were pleased that I was going to be an officer. That was something that they were proud of… I was the first one to go to college and graduate and with the war on go into officer school. The war being on, at my age, it was a foregone conclusion you're going to go. Joshua Bell: How did your wife feel about it? Paul Schaughency: She cried. She tells about it. She says, \"I cried all the way home to Pittsburgh on the train.\" One other little incident: there were four trains that took our regiment from Fort Hancock out to Fort Lawton for the port of embarkation. One train went through Pittsburgh. This Major who befriended me, saying, \"You catch that last ferry boat at 10:00 PM, or 11:00 PM” and \"I'll sign you out after midnight.\" I was always happy about that and appreciative. This same major was on one of the other 4 trains, that went through Pittsburgh. Several of them got newspapers. He's reading one. He sees this item in the Society section. It says, \"The Schaughency’s Reside at Hancock.\" That was the heading on the column. It told about the wedding and so on. He's showing it around, going through the car and says, \"Like hell. He's on another train going up through Canada to Seattle. He's not going to reside in Hancock. \"We had \"resided\" just seven days at Fort Hancock. [00:31:58] Our unit, a small, battalion headquarters battery. The whole regiment left and went we learned later up to Kodiak. The destinations and all that stuff were really kept secret. You weren't allowed to let your family know where you were. It's much, much different than today with the iPads and cellphones right on the battlefield or could be. Our battalion headquarters battery and another one didn't get sent with the regiment. We didn't know why. Then, we heard a story of a liberty ship that they were building there Seattle was a big ship building place. I think it was at Bremerton, Washington, right across Puget Sound The story was a liberty ship was launched, and it had a crack in the hull. They had to repair it. The rumor got around that it was supposed to be our ship, but since they had to repair it, they had to find another ship. That's why we were being delayed. Well that was bologna, but we didn't know that. We got sent out to Adak. It's one of the Aleutian Islands that's just about the middle. Joshua Bell: What was that trip like? Paul Schaughency: Sort of uneventful. We were on not a real big ship. Pretty soon, it was cold. It was January. It was a bit chilly in the United States. Going up there, that was even colder. The Aleutians, by January '44 when we got there had been cleared by the Japanese. Back in December 1941 the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. [00:34:25] Then not long after that, they took Attu which was the big island out on the end. There was a village there and a coast guard weather station. They took Attu and the native and weather station couple (she taught school) to Japan as prisoners Then, they came back and took Kiska which is the next big island coming back. They had bombed Dutch Harbor which was right at the end of the Alaskan peninsula. If you look at a map of Alaska, the peninsula comes out there sticking out into the Pacific Ocean. At the end of that peninsula was Dutch Harbor, a Navy base. The people in California and Oregon and Washington were worried., All they could see was --- when are they coming over here. In the South Pacific, nobody was stopping the Japanese. I mean they were coming down through the islands of Asia and the Philippians and so on down. \"Where are they going to stop them? Where are they going to stop up there?\" There was fear especially on the west coast. Then we went out and took Attu back. All this had happened before I got up there. Adak was a base. The Navy liked the harbor there. It was a supply base and an air field. The Air Corps could take off and bomb or strafe the Japanese on Kiska. We next attacked Kiska, but under fog, the Japanese pulled out. We had our American territory back. I didn't fight any Japanese. That all happened before we landed on Adak. The US was building a larger supply base there. On Armed Forces Radio, they said, \"This is the Armed Forces Radio.\" (I think they gave the APO number, the Army post office number.) \"On the northern highway to victory\" that was their byline. I often wondered a little about that. I'll come back to that; “on the northern highway to victory.” [00:37:12] The weather, I said I didn't fight any Japanese. We fought the weather. The Japanese current is warm. It comes up by the Aleutian Islands and curves and goes down along our west coast. It warms the west coast. That's coming up warm. The Bering Sea is a little chilly coming out of the Arctic. The Bering current comes down, and they meet at the Aleutians. One of the terms for the Aleutians is ‘the weather kitchen' because when stuff happens up there. They can tell, some of the time, what we're going to have down here. The weather was not bitter cold. Fifteen above would be a low, not like back on the mainland where it was dry cold. They get 40-60 below. The weather was really a bad thing. The Army was not prepared for Attu, clothing & equipment. There were no trees. No trees out in the Aleutians. The ground is a muskeg tundra but clumps of tundra. It's difficult to walk across. You decide you're going to walk on the top on the clump. You walk on that. Then, \"No. I think I'll try walking down in the little valley between the clumps.\" Neither is very satisfactory. We learned about it. As far as the clothing and the equipment are concerned, until, I think it was Iwo Jima, Attu had had the largest casualty numbers. A lot of it was frostbite. We didn't have the right clothing for our soldiers there. But by the time we got there, they had shoe packs which were rubber bottom and leather that would come up your legs. That was real good. I never had to use them very much. In certain conditions or working, you might use a shoe pack. The boots were good. We had a suit made out of raincoat material, pants and jacket and a hood on the jacket also. The cartoons in the Post newspaper we had always had a guy with a \"hoodie\", we call them now, but made out of raincoat material. You could work out in that kind of stuff. We had parkas and didn't need them very often. The weather in the month of July would be like a month in spring in the northern United States. The little delicate flowers would all of a sudden bloom - purple and yellow and different colors of flowers. It was real pretty. By the end of the month, four to six weeks of summer was about par. Then it would start … even in the summer, the word was “Williwaw.” That was the Aleutian natives, the Aleut's word for the storm. [00:40:36] Aleuts were different. In Alaska, you had the Eskimos. You had the American Indians or Native Americans. Out on the Aleutian chain, you had the Aleuts. They had different cultures, all three of them. When the Japanese took Attu and Kiska, they took a village of Aleuts as prisoners over to Japan and two Americans. When we saw what was happening, we took the native Aleuts off the islands and took them back to the mainland down along by Juneau down along the side of Alaska that goes by on the west coast from Canada. That was not a real good treatment of the Aleuts… The furnishings were not very well done. That's what happened. [00:42:58] The Air Base had a wind meter. It went up to 115 miles an hour. There were times those storms would, beyond that. It was tough weather, but we survived because we had good equipment by the time we got there. Joshua Bell: I take it the weather was the first thing you noticed. Paul Schaughency: Oh, yeah. In January, we had … this was a Florida National Guard outfit. It's blowing and snowing and hitting us in the face when we went down the gangplank. One of the guys was from Key West. They referred to them as 'Key West Conchs'. I never used that term because I thought it might be a derogatory slur. One of them, when going down, got off a little slur and a slap at the fact that we were Florida National Guard out here. The snow is hitting us in the face. He says, \"Oh, just like Miami Beach!\" [laughs] The guys laughed. Nobody did anything. [00:44:46] Being the young, junior officer got me some jobs. We were relieving another Battalion. They were going back to the states. They had put up pyramidal tents for us with wooden floor and sides and a stove in the center. The concept was that the coast artillery works with the Navy HECP (Harbor Entrance Control Post) … there was an HECP way out on the end of a little peninsula. That was where the Navy would flash signals to a ship coming in. If they didn't flash back the right thing, they'd say to artillery, \"Fire one round over the bow.\" There we had 155-mm cannon, mobile and a couple of wheels on them. They fired one over the bow. The Navy said, \"Wake up that captain out there.\" That usually did it. They'd flash back. The idea was if the Navy said, \"That's an unidentified craft. Fire on them,\" then the coast artillery would fire on that ship and assist the Navy in protecting the harbor. The plan was that our Battalion Headquarters was to move out adjacent to the Navy Harbor Entrance Control Post. We were just temporary in the tents until we relieved the other outfit. Then, we moved out to new quarters. [00:47:10] Another story comes to mind, speaking of quarters. We in the Army say, \"You know, the gravy's in the Navy.\" I never realized how that was. An officer in this coast artillery, battery that was near the Harbor Entrance Control Post, told me that when they came up there, they were in pyramidal tents just like temporary ones where we were with the wooden sides and so forth. The Navy was getting Quonset huts. The Harbor Entrance Control Post didn't have very many people. They contacted the Coast Artillery Captain. They said, \"We'll make you a deal. You help us put up these Quonset huts. You've got men that are available, and we'll give you one large one that you can have for your mess hall.\" He said, \"That would be great,\" because they were coming out of the tents, going over to the mess tent and back. The Captain agreed - \"If we could have a mess hall, boy; that would be great.\" They told me this. It happened before we got there. I said, \"Jeepers creepers. I could just imagine being one of those Army guys. Your work crew, today, is going up to the Navy.\" You get on a truck and go up there and help them put up these Quonset huts, come back to your own pyramidal tent. All you had to do was tell yourself, \"We're going to get one of those buildings for our mess hall, so we've got to do this.\" That wouldn't be a lot of fun, I don't think. Joshua Bell: What was your role with the unit? Paul Schaughency: [00:49:16] I got transferred, being the junior lieutenant, I was in the headquarter battery as one of two officers. Then, I was moved to one of the firing units. I think we fired practice … we had dead, just you went through the motions and opened the gun up and putting in the shell, rammed it in and then put the powder in. We would go through those. … I think maybe when I was with one unit, we did fire one or two times. Really it was key getting your place fixed up so living would be more tolerable was one of the things we did. The unit that I was assigned to was on Shagak Bay. All these places have like Russian names. You can hardly pronounce them. The night that we arrived, Schaughency being the junior officer was told, \"Tonight, you're the OD,\" officer of the day. \"I had to go over to operations,\" one of the Quonset huts where information came in from the base end stations with Radar. They gave me this message, \"Lieutenant, I got to notify you that there's an unidentified object off Cape Adagdak heading toward Cape Chigegak.\" I said, \"Yeah, sergeant. Where are they?\" He got the map out and showed me. I said, \"What do we do now?\" He said, \"Nothing.\" He added, \"It's probably something out there. They'll call back and tell us. I wouldn't worry about it. We get these all the time,\" or frequently. \"Okay.\" I'll never forget that. Those two locations, I never heard those big words before. It was something. Joshua Bell: What about some of the guys who were in your unit? You made friends with them, obviously. Paul Schaughency: [00:52:59] Yeah. We made friends. You're kind of in this thing together. A lot of it was, as I said, fighting the weather. One of the firing batteries would have four guns and four gun crews and a sergeant in charge of each gun crew. Those were our work crews especially the unit out on the far side of the island at Shagak Bay. We were called an outpost unit. When a tugboat came around from the main post, we got \"rations and a quarter.\" I mean 25 percent more rations than what the normal was. It was a going feature when I got there. They said, \"We'll have a midnight snack at 9:30 PM.\" What that Mess Sergeant did was to take Spam that you heard about being \"bad\". He put those aside and served those at 9:30 PM. I never heard an enlisted man or officer complain about Spam because we didn't have that served for our meal out there. Psychologically, the Army owes me three meals a day. When they're giving me this extra one, so-called midnight snack, that's something extra. It was also a little social thing. Your guys get in there, and they have whatever the sergeant had pulled out to serve. We'd have a little something to eat and drink. It was nice. I find out that Spam, a lot of it is psychological. I'll tell you another story about that place out there. The captain was Buck Slaughter. He was from Reedville, Virginia. He had a nice, southern drawl. We were out on this outpost there. There weren't very many people around. Once in a while, we'd get an inspector. This Alaskan department inspector a colonel was out there. Some of our guys had been out hunting and brought back some. geese. that they'd shot with a carbine. The mess crew dressed them. The colonel comes and looks in the refrigerator, opens up both doors. There are these geese in there hanging. They're all ready to be cooked. The colonel turns to captain Slaughter and says, \"Now captain, you know that it's against the Alaskan department regulations to be out hunting. You're not allowed to do that.\" Capt. Slaughter replied, \"Well, sir, colonel.\" He says, \"You know, we've got these Williwaws out here. They don't have those back on the mainland, but we've got those Williwaws. They are terrible storms. The wind blows. These geese were going by. The storm came up and blew them right up against the side of the mess hall. The sergeant here was fast thinking. He had his men clean them up, and we're going to have those for dinner one of these days.\" The colonel looked and shook his head and just shut the door as if to say, \"If that guy can come up with that story so fast, I'm not going to fuss at him.\" Joshua Bell: That's fantastic. I think we've reached about an hour. I still have more questions. Paul Schaughency: What do you want to do? Joshua Bell: Let's look at scheduling for maybe some time that works for you. [End of recorded material - 00:58:21] June 15, 2016 [Start of recorded material - 00:00:00] Joshua Bell: Today is June 15, 2016. I'm Josh Bell, park ranger with the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. We have back with us today, Paul Schaughency, who is going to continue sharing his story with us. How are you doing today, Paul? Paul Schaughency: I'm doing fine, Josh. Joshua Bell: Just like last time - Paul Schaughency: And you? Joshua Bell: I'm doing well. Thank you. Just like last time, this conversation is going to be recorded. Is that okay? Paul Schaughency: That's okay with me. Joshua Bell: Outstanding. You had some more stories to share with us. Paul Schaughency: [00:00:40] Yeah. There's the story about the rescue mission. I thought it was unusual, at least for me. We were at this outpost unit on the far side of the island on Shagak Bay, away from the main base. It was in the spring with the weather up there, you can have a real nice day and bingo, it goes bad, with only a few minutes notice. The Chaplin at the main base hospital saw it was a bright, sunny day. He said, \"We ought to go out to that unit out at Shagak Bay and have a mass.\" He took two or three nurses along just for the hike. Hospital motor pool drove them to the top of our trail. At the end of the road, there's a big ravine. You cross over that with a little dolly arrangement. We explained this to them and told them when they get down to the bottom of the mountain trail, at the shore of the bay, there's a telephone. \"Call us, and we'll send a boat over.\" It all worked out very nicely. They had mass in the mess hall. We all had dinner. When, the time came for them to leave, we took them back in the boat along the shore of the bay, to the trail. Along the shoreline there the mountain just comes right down to the water, almost straight down. That's why the trail didn't go along the shoreline; there wasn't any shore. We had this boat to travel back and forth for this part of the way. The boat and driver returned. It was a nice day but clouds started coming in. It wasn't anything unusual for the Aleutians. We thought nothing of it. But then, we got a phone call, \"Is the Chaplin still there?\" \"No. They left some time ago. The nurses were with him, yeah.\" \"They're not up here;” (where you meet the transportation.) “It's blowing up here.\" The captain told them, \"We checked with the guy that ran the boat.\" \"Oh, yes, he took them over. They got out and started up the trail. Everything was fine.\" When we reported that, they said, \"They're not here. It's really blowing snow up like a blizzard starting in up here. We're concerned about them.\" The time was such that they should have been up there. Sure enough, they ask us to send out a searching party. Our captain says, \"Schaughency, how about you lead this party and pick a crew of volunteers?\" We got plenty of volunteers. I selected six guys. We took the boat over. As soon as we got off, it was snowing and blowing down on that side of the mountain. The further we went, it really was coming down. With snow on the ground we could follow their tracks. You don't get training in a search party operations in any training that I received. I said, \" Here's what we're going to do.\" By this time, we're in a low blizzard. The snow's coming down. I said, \"We don't want to lose any more people. We will stay together as long as we can see their footsteps. If we can't we will spread out.” “You make sure you can see the person in toward me. You three guys, look to the left. You three guys, look to the right. Make sure you can see that person. We'll spread out. I'll go like this with my arms. That means spread out just as far as you can.\" We're combing this trail. \"When you find footprints,\" you can't call anyone due to the howling wind. (It was a blizzard now). \"Go down Whoever finds prints, stop and then you, waving your hand, pointing down like this. We'll all close in on you.\" That happened several times. It worked. Now, we're into a real blizzard. We got up in some places you couldn't … the wind would blow off on the … you couldn't see the trail, and we'd close in. Make sure you close in. We'd followed and then when we couldn't, we'd spread out as much as we could and try to find where we could find the trail again. We got up to the top, and we see these snow mobiles with their lights on. By this time, it's dark. Some were on the far side of the ravine and saw one coming on our side, they said, \"Did you see anything?\" I said, \"We followed their trail up to right by ---,\" and I gave a location back of us. It was not very far. I said, \"I know they're up that far because we followed their tracks, and then we saw you guys.\" He said, \"They're not up here.\" With what we had brought up to this point, one of the guys in a snow mobile said, \"You know, there's an old trapper shack just down there (pointing away from the trail.) With this snow and wind blowing like it is, coming down the mountain, there's a tendency to move away, with your back to the wind. If they did get up to where you saw their tracks and then did that after arriving up here on the level part, they could have gone down to that trapper shack. We're going down and check.\" Sure enough, there they were. The chaplain and the nurses had found that trapper shack. They got in the snow jeeps. The recovery was made. We all got a commendation letter from the general, commander of the island. Joshua Bell: That's great. They must have been real happy to see you guys. Paul Schaughency: Yeah, they were. They were taken back \"home\" to the station hospital in the snow mobiles. That's the story about the search and rescue mission. Joshua Bell: You said something else last week about beating the Army at its own game. Paul Schaughency: [00:09:04] A new lieutenant came out to our unit from another battery in our battalion, as I said earlier, we were on the far side of the island. It was just that one artillery battery out there. Adak was a pretty big supply base that they were using to build up for, as the armed forces radio called it, \"the northern highway to victory.\" (note: ration and a half explained in interview one) There was a Navy port and a repair base, and a Navy Air Station, an Army Base plus the Army was building great, big warehouses there. We were still out on the outpost location. We had a new battery Commander. He was an older guy, originally from the Oregon National Guard. This young lieutenant, 'Bork', we called him. The name, do you want that or not. Joshua Bell: Oh, sure. That'd be great. Paul Schaughency: Well, his last name was Boericke, B-O-E-R-I-C-K-E. He said, \"Boericke, rhymes with 'America'.\" It was a Dutch name. His family was the Curtis Publishing, Co - (the Saturday Evening Post and several others.) He came from a wealthy family. He was the only one I had run into to, then or later, that, as I said, \"beat the Army at its own game.” He graduated from Saint John's College. I think it's 'University' now, Saint John's in Annapolis, Maryland, a small school boasting that Francis Scott Key was a graduate. It has the Ten Great Books curriculum. When they graduate from there, they've studied the Ten Great Books series. That's a regular part of their curriculum. They’re noted for that, but it's a little different. \"Bork\" didn't like this assignment coming out there because he liked to go the PX and the post library, the theatre, and the various facilities on the main base. You could either go there or go to the Navy theatre and stuff like that. He just missed it. We'd get a guy to bring a movie out on a rucksack, a big backpack down the trail. \"Oh, we got a movie tonight!\" It was different. He didn't like that. A lot of the units on the main base, had duties and responsibilities that their table of organization or their assigned personnel didn't make quite enough. They'd bring people in from other infantry units, artillery units, and so forth to these service places over on the main base. We would have some of our people on special duty with these units. Back in those days, the Army paid by cash. You had to have a paying officer. We kind of took turns at that. From our place, the paying officer duty wasn't a bad … you kind of looked forward to it because you would find these people. You'd get somebody over there to get you a jeep. You'd take the pay, for example, over to the three of our guys at the quartermaster tank farm. Then, you'd take the two guys over to this ordinance unit and the guys at various post facilities. You had to hunt them up and then pay them in cash. Then, they signed the payroll. It took 2 or 3 days, maybe. We always thought it was all right for the pay officer to stay over a couple of days. Go to the officer's club. Go to the theatre. Go to the PX and so forth, two, three days and then come back. That was kind of the custom. Lt. Boericke was assigned to be the paying officer. He goes over to the main base and doing his duties there. This captain says, \"Three days, four days, how long does this take?\" I explained just what I told you, \"Five days, six days.\" He says, \"Isn't this getting to be unusual?\" I called Bork up and said, \"Hey, Boericke, the captain is getting kind of unhappy. He's making talks about putting you on the morning report as AWOL. You don't want that.\" I was getting concerned. He says, \"Oh, the old boy is getting unhappy, is he?\" He didn't seem to be concerned about it. Well, he did get put on the morning report for AWOL. That caused the action to take. He was put under house arrest or something and court marshaled. He was found guilty of AWOL and fined half of his pay for six months. That meant nothing to him. His family has money. Half of the pay would make little difference. Custom of the Army (and I suppose other services) is if an officer is found guilty of some minor offense he's transferred out of that unit, and automatically transferred to another unit. There weren't any other units out on the outpost area. The other units had to be over in the main base. He got just exactly what he wanted. He got an assignment, a good assignment right over in the main base. He could go to the PX and the library and all this stuff. He had a good sergeant there in the unit. They hit it off well. He got exactly what he wanted. His penalty was insignificant because it was what he wanted. That's that story. Why don't you ask me the questions? We'll make sure we get them in this time. Joshua Bell: I guess I'll ask this question; how did you pass your free time? Paul Schaughency: [00:17:20] Free time, there was Armed Forces Radio. We'd listen to that, Armed Forces Radio. It was all security, a lot more. I mean today, everybody has a cellphone. They can call home whenever they want. There would be Armed Forces Radio especially if it was bad weather and you didn't have to go out. I think I mentioned this about the clothing in the first part. We had good clothing unlike what they had at first. You could go out and work in the bad weather. We didn't have people out in the really, real bad stuff. You had to go out in snow and rain. You had things to do. The past time, we had our own movie projector. That was one thing. I think I mentioned the other part of it. We had the midnight snack at 9:30 PM. That helped especially being out on the outpost there. A lot of the duty time was spent in making your place better. For instance, at first, there would be Chic Sales for the latrine. Joshua Bell: What's that? Paul Schaughency: Chic Sale is from the late 1800s. He was a privy, outdoor outhouse builder. He had some great designs that he put in. Rather than say, \"I'm going to the outhouse,\" or some other words, you'd say, \"I'm going to the Chic Sale.\" Then for our unit, we had a shower and a water heater building. We wanted to extend that. Once, somebody had gotten some flushed toilets from the Navy. Boy, oh, boy. “If we could do an addition to the shower room and have warm, flushed toilets that would be really great!” That was one of our projects, putting in the toilets and putting in the drain. They had a lot of shortages during the war. They had wooden pipe that was wrapped with wire. They had a wooden mallet. You kind of put one end into the other just like terracotta or any other kind of plastic pipe. You put the small end to the big end and tap it in snug with a wooden mallet. It worked. We were running the drain line from the shower room down to the ocean, take it out into the ocean. It was a place that whoever selected the place was before us that was there as a unit when I got there. There was a creek going down. We had running water because they dammed up the creek beyond our unit and had water pipes coming down for the kitchen and the shower. The spare time during the day, we had four gun crews. Those gun crews and the sergeant in charge that made up a work team, \"Gun crew #1, Sergeant Smith, you take your crew and go over here,\" at the formation. They get their assignments. I'd say some, unofficially, there were some guys liked hunting. The little carbine rifle would make good hunting so that, improving the roads and communication. A lot of the work had to with making your area of your unit better. Joshua Bell: Yeah. It sounds like it was trying to make it homey and trying to make it normal. Paul Schaughency: Yeah, that's right. You'd keep working. In the first part, I told you the story about the Navy getting Quonset huts and Battery A was down over the hill there in the pyramidal tents winterized. When I got there, it was all Quonset huts. I guess, technically, they were Pacific huts. They were a little different competitor, but the word gets around, 'Quonset hut'. Joshua Bell: It was homey. Did you stay in touch with the people back home? Did you stay in touch with your family? Paul Schaughency: [00:17:20] Letters, v-mail, letters. As matter of fact, my wife has my letters still. Joshua Bell: Oh, she does? That's fantastic. Paul Schaughency: Yeah. I need to read those one of these days. She wrote every day. Of course, they didn't come every day. They'd come in batches but not too bad. The APO 980, (Army Post-office #980), that was the radio station. \"The APO 980 on the northern highway to victory,\" they said. Joshua Bell: Right out of Seattle, no doubt. Paul Schaughency: No. The radio station was there on the island. They played transcriptions or records. Wait a minute. I need a little water. Hang on. Joshua Bell: Go ahead. Paul Schaughency: If you hear the water running, you know I'm working on it. I got a drink. Thank you. Go ahead. Joshua Bell: Who were your superior officers? Paul Schaughency: [00:25:28] That was Captain Rohrbach, R-O-H-R-B-A-C-H from the Oregon National Guard. That was the guy that came in. I told you the story about Buck Slaughter, didn't I and the geese? Joshua Bell: Oh, yeah. Paul Schaughency: Buck Slaughter was from Reedville, Virginia. He was Captain Slaughter. We had a provisional battalion headquarters. We were sent out to Adak to relieve another battalion headquarter. We weren't set up to be a separate battalion. All of the supply and administration and so forth was done at regimental headquarters. That was back in Kodiak. We reported in to the post commander on the island. We didn't report to the colonel back in Kodiak. We were a separate battalion headquarters, and we weren't set up to be one. We had a lot of people doing different things. Our adjutant, he'd been a sergeant major. He really knew administration. We didn't need a personnel officer. He had two good sergeant majors heading up the administrative part and the personnel part. We didn't need a personnel officer, so we didn't fill that position. [00:27:23] He was, Warrant Officer Deegan. He called one day and said, \"The colonel wants to see you.\" \"Okay.\" All this time, I'd been in different firing batteries. I'm the outdoor kind. I'm happy with that. We looked down our nose to those people in administration, called them 'desk jockeys'. That was not a compliment. I go to see the colonel. Since Deegan called, I went to see him first. He said, \"The colonel wants you to be the new personnel officer. We're getting into a lot of stuff here with the points system.\" The Army had put in a point system for rotation. You got one point for each month in the states. You got two points for each month overseas. You got various points for battle awards and so forth. I never heard anybody complain about the point system. The point system, all those over so many points, the people that we relieved went back to the states. They started this rotation. They picked units to send back to the states. They'd take out the people with the low points and fill it up with people with high points from other units. They'd go back to the states. We were into this rotation thing. Then when V-E Day (Victory in Europe) hit, it escalated because we were getting ready for Japan, bringing troops back and getting them ready for Japan. They used the point system for who comes back and who stays. That was getting to be quite some duty. I had a real good personnel sergeant major. I had promoted him in the personnel section because the personnel sergeant major had rotated out. We hit it off just fine. He taught me. I'd say, \"Is this right, sergeant?\" and \"Where do I sign,\" because I was just learning. I found out that this personnel job was interesting. I quickly learned my job. Rather than degrading those \"desk jockeys\", I was one. I said, \"Look,\" I explained our provisional Battalion Hq setup and so forth. At this point I need to explain the Army has an MOS, Military Occupational Specialty. You had that number because of what was in the table of organization, and your assigned job within that organization. You could have more than one MOS number. If everything goes right, you're working on your military occupational specialty. We had people with MOSs that did not have anything to do with the actual job they were now doing, because the table didn't call for that job, but we had to have it, being out there on the island as a separate unit. I said, \"You're reassigning people,\" with low points to replace higher point people. “I know what our people are doing. For instance, this guy's got MOS for mechanic, but he's working as our motor pool sergeant. If he's not going to be rotated back to the States with our unit that's leaving, he should go to the transportation corps. Similarly, we have guys working on our phone system, but the table organization does not have those jobs.” He said, \"Schaughency,\" he had a nice office up at post headquarters. \"Why don't you sit down at that table over there? I'll give you where we need people. You put your guys in there, what you know that they can fit.\" I said, \"I just want to make sure our guys get assigned something that they're accustomed to rather than completely oddball jobs just because of their MOS. He handed me a pencil and said, \"You go ahead and do that?\" He apparently liked what I did. Pretty soon, I find myself up at post headquarters as a post personnel officer. He was being promoted to Post Adjutant. Joshua Bell: Where was that located? Paul Schaughency: In the main base of Adak. I didn't serve, other than a few months, any place other than Adak. Continuing on, now, I'm up at post headquarters and soon became a captain. When our unit was to be rotated back to the States, I went up to talk to personnel office [Captain Byron Ward]. The main mission was getting the boys back home, especially after V-J Day, and filling personnel needs of the units on the post. The post personnel officer was technically an assistant adjutant. My move to Battalion personnel office and the Post HQ job got me into personnel work. The G.I. Bill came along and I said, \"I better learn more about the civilian side of personnel. This has been interesting. I'm sure there are certain things you can apply.\" I came back and got my master's degree at Pitt in what they called 'industry department' but all personnel courses all because the colonel pointed at me and assigned me personnel. Joshua Bell: Funny how that works sometimes. What was your rank during this time? Paul Schaughency: [00:34:37] Of course, I started as a second lieutenant when I was commissioned on the 19th of November, '43. Then, I became first lieutenant up there, then captain on the post job. I came out a captain. I signed on for one year, regardless of points, so that I could get my wife up there. Joshua Bell: No. You didn't tell me that. Paul Schaughency: Your dependents are jumped. I didn't tell you that? Joshua Bell: No. I don't think so. Paul Schaughency: [00:35:29] We're right at that point. I got in in '43, and I was working with the points all the time. I had it figured out that I would have about six to nine months to go. I got a new boss, Post Director of Personnel and Administration the General's Staff. After the war, he would make colonel. As a custom to the service, you referred to him as \"general.\" My new boss was staying in. He says he was in the post-office. His seniority went on along because of the government. He says, \"I've got no reason to get out. I'm going to stay in.\" He said, \"You know those buildings over there that was the Advanced Alaskan Command?\" (In case they’re moving forward, they had some real nice buildings all prepared for Alaskan headquarters to move out there.) He said, \"They're going to make those into dependent housing. I'm signing up for one.\" He added, \"You might think about that.\" I said, \"Okay. It sounds like a good idea.\" In the regulations, first of all, they came out and said, \"Unless you have at least one year of service, you can't take your overseas dependents with you.\" People were being sent out of the states to replace high-point people. They were taking their dependents, and pretty soon they'd be coming right back. It sounded reasonable: Unless you have one year of service, you can't take your dependents. Another regulation that I was familiar with, it said you can sign on for one year, three years or indefinitely. The major, my boss came in telling me he had signed on for indefinitely and sending for his dependents I signed on for one year. You don't go to the university and say, \"I'm here, so I'd like to start.\" No. You start in September or the beginning of a semester. I would lose nothing. I signed up. I got a 45-day leave and came down and got my wife and took her back with me on the George Washington Carver, that had been a hospital ship during the war. We were the first boat load of troops that had dependents, - three couples of us that landed on Adak. That was interesting. One of the couples was the post engineer, Colonel Ware. His wife had been a Home Economics teacher. My wife was so well-accustomed to the kitchen. She could boil water without burning and cook grilled-cheese sandwiches. I think that's the list. You talk about the potter and the clay. They really hit it off. They lived across the road on Adak. It wasn't bad being friends of the post engineer’s wife (Peg) when you needed something done on your Quonset hut. My wife is a great correspondent. She would write to my parents. One time she wrote that they were going to put in flooring. I was away. I had to go back to the mainland. While I was away, she had talked to Peg. They were going to put in flooring for us, tile blocks. The flooring in a Quonset hut is four by eight sheets of plywood. What they were going to do is put this tile, I think it was wooden on top of the plywood. My mother wrote back and said, \"Oh, you poor dears, I knew you two were having a hardship, way up there in the Aleutians, but I had no idea you had no floor in your Quonset huts.\" The Quonset hut came with a shower stall. It would take up less room than the tub. We had a shower stall. Peg was visiting us and said, \"I really miss my tub. I like soaking in that tub.\" I said, \"Peg, I happen to know where there's a tub way out at another unit I was in.\" I said, \"I would suppose you could talk to somebody that could get a couple of guys to go out there and get you a tub.\" \"Oh, that would be wonderful.\" I knew where this unit was. It was our headquarters unit, and it was abandoned out there. This major, who had some connections with the Navy, ended up with a bathtub, probably the only bathtub in any Army unit. Peg was real pleased. That didn't hurt relationships at all. Joshua Bell: No, certainly not. What year was that? Paul Schaughency: That would be 1946, then, '47, '48, I got my master's. We were there one year and flew back. That year was so different. You can't believe how different it was having your wife there, and having your own quarters. Joshua Bell: That must have been a big change. Paul Schaughency: Yeah. It was all for the better. That was our honeymoon. I told you that story about the train going west. We were married seven days, so that was our honeymoon in the Aleutian Islands. Joshua Bell: You didn't get home once you got up there, did you? Paul Schaughency: No. Cathy and I were there a year and then came back. That was it. Joshua Bell: I mean when you went up there with the service in '43. Paul Schaughency: No. The first time I got back after arriving in summer of 1944, was when I came back to get Cathy. Joshua Bell: Right. That was the first leave that you had. Paul Schaughency: Yeah. Joshua Bell: That's a long time. Paul Schaughency: People were away longer than that. Joshua Bell: Did you ever think that you wanted to be assigned someplace else? Paul Schaughency: I tried to make the best of where I was. Apparently, it worked. In getting assigned to that job, that I wasn't looking forward to, was probably the best that happened. I came out with my master's degree and went on with PPG Industries. They now call it 'human resources'. I had a career with them. I'm in debt to the Army for pointing a finger at me and getting into personnel. I wrote a letter of gratitude to a guy that stayed in the Army. In 1941 I knew him as Lieutenant Husband, an instructor in the ROTC at Pitt. I wrote a two-page typed letter, sent it to him and a copy to each of his two daughters. I had tracked him down. He's a colonel and retired now. I wanted to thank him. Stop me if I told you this. In '41, having completed Basic ROTC, I applied for Advanced ROTC. That would be in September. (We're not to December '41 yet.) He called me at the fraternity house. He said, \"Schaughency, you didn't pass the physical.\" He added, \"I have called the hospital to find out what it was.” He told me it was a rapid heartbeat. \"Here's what I want you to do. There's nothing you can do about it. You just get a good night sleep. I've arranged for you to have that physical checked again. You get a good night sleep and go up and get that rechecked.\" I did, and I was fine. I passed the physical. If he hadn't taken the time to check my physical and call me … WOW. The draft was on, but many weren't worrying about Hitler. That's over there. We're not going to get involved again. I was in Advanced ROTC. December 7th hit, and now we're at war. That was a real favor he did for me. I wouldn't have thought of having a recheck. He did that, and I really appreciated it. I sent that letter to him titled, \"One Man's Caring, another Man's Career.\" I outlined how I got in the Army and the Army putting me into personnel and later personnel had been my career. He was real thankful and grateful that I had sent it to his kids. Joshua Bell: That's very nice. You went from thinking that Germany wasn't the problem and then all of a sudden, we are at war with Japan and Germany Paul Schaughency: We all knew as soon as we were at war with Japan, that wasn't the only one. Japan kept taking more territory in the Pacific \"Somebody's got to stop them. The British will probably stop them.\" That didn't work. When they attacked us, that solidified the country. There were no more America firsters and German \"bunders\" with the people here. The whole country united. We were really united. We were then about a fourth- ranked power in the world. We came out of World War II number one or tied with Russia. We've been up on the top ever since. We can go wherever we want, but we couldn't back then. Joshua Bell: How did you feel on V-E Day? What were you doing when you learned about V-E Day? Paul Schaughency: [00:48:58] V-E Day, I was real happy about that and went out to the officer's club that evening and celebrated. I think it was the only time I got really tipsy. The bartender gave me French '75. I had asked, \"What's that?\" He says, \"It's a kind of an amber champagne.\" Hell, it wasn't an amber champagne. It was champagne with brandy in it - a French 75. I wasn't completely out, but it was as far as I ever wanted to be. As for V-E Day the feeling was Oh, boy. We're done over there. You got that Hitler and he'd killed himself. That was a day of celebration, not as big as V-J Day but we celebrated. Joshua Bell: Tell me about V-J Day. Paul Schaughency: [00:50:08] V-J Day, yeah. That's the last story I've got for you. I'm up at post headquarters this time. It's up on the side of the mountain there. There's one great, big mountain, Mount Moffitt. It has a shoulder to it. Post headquarters is high up and you could see from there down to these ten huge warehouses and an airbase and Kuluk, K-U-L-U-K Bay. It's why we were there. The base was built there because of the big bay. The Navy liked it because there was a finger that went off of the bay in the narrow bay that they called 'Finger Bay'. They had marine repair shops there. It would accommodate ocean-going vessels. Well, three days after V-J Day, I get up the morning, go to the office and look out. That bay is absolutely peppered with Navy. This was a taskforce, not a big one but it was a taskforce. It answered my question about \"the northern highway to victory\" slogan. They had a cruiser leading it. That tells you the size. Usually it's a battleship or an aircraft carrier. Later in the war, usually it was an aircraft carrier that led it. Destroyers and other vessels protected the aircraft carrier. This was a cruiser that's a size below the battleship. It was like in the movies. “They're coming. Here come the yanks.” The bay was all peppered with destroyers, destroy escorts, supply ships. I'd never seen so many ships in one place. I went to the club that night and got talking with a Navy doctor and got invited down to see his office. He was on a destroyer escort. We went onboard and went in to see his operating room. He pulled down this bed. It was hanging up like in the pictures I've seen in the movies inside of a submarine. It's all compact. He pulls this down. He says, \"This is my operating table,\" . I had a little tour of the ship. He said, \"We were under sealed orders out of Pearl Harbor to come up here for three days.\" I never did get quite this thing of three days, something in the Navy about getting the crew off of the ship. They had three days. They could get a third of them off each day. They could go to the ship service or the PX or the theatre and get their feet on the ground and then back. \"Our orders to come up here. Then, we are to meet troop transports coming out of San Francisco and escort them over to northern Japan,” Hokkaido, maybe. I forget which island it was. Sure, as shooting, we had been going to land there. We were on our way. This was to be a secondary attack on Japan. When I looked down at the bay that morning, all I could think of was that whole bay full of Navy vessels and not one of the sailors or marines injured or killed. That was just a little part of what was down south, in Okinawa, and these other islands heading for Japan. We were headed for Japan. That was going to be a slaughter. It was going to be on the Japanese soil. We would be peppering the land with all kinds of bombs and shells to prepare for the guys to land. [00:55:19] These people that want to rewrite history and say the atom bomb was terrible, well, of course, it was terrible. If you're standing where a 500-pound bomb goes off, it's terrible. You're dead. We'd hear in the news broadcast on the radio, \"Fifty-seven sorties bombed Stuttgart,” where there are ball-bearing factories. I don't know how many times we heard that. Time after time after time We went to bomb Stuttgart. All of those people in Stuttgart are just as dead as they are in Nagasaki. There just weren't as many of them at one time. When I saw that bay full of ships, my first thought was, \"Every one of those sailors and marines out there, they're all alive today.\" That was my atom bomb story. Joshua Bell: I want to ask the final question. What are you most proud of from your time in service? Paul Schaughency: I think that rescue mission. I think it was something that came up on the spur of the moment that we had to do. I was well-pleased with the results of that. I'll be glad that I had been up there long enough to realize what kind of equipment, what we needed to do and be careful. I guess that's it. Plus, the other thing is that I did well enough in the battalion personnel job to get advanced to post personnel and a promotion out of it. Those two things kind of hit me as accomplishments. Joshua Bell: I wanted to thank you very much for your contribution to our oral history project. Thank you for your contribution leading us to victory in the Second World War. Paul Schaughency: I don't know that I did anything leading to victory, but we were ready to go. Joshua Bell: I think everybody did their part. You certainly did.

I’m Josh Bell, a park ranger with the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. Could I have you say your name for the record, sir? Dwight Smith: Dwight A. Smith. Joshua Bell: All right Mr. Smith. And it’s okay that record this conversation today? Dwight Smith: It is. Joshua Bell: Excellent. When and where were you born, sir? Dwight Smith: Baltimore, Maryland, January 16, 1925. Joshua Bell: And what were your parents’ names? Dwight Smith: [00:00:35] Captain Dwight Smith, and Beatrice Wilson Smith. Joshua Bell: And what did they do? Dwight Smith: My father was a merchant seaman, captain of ships, and my mother was a housekeeper, I mean, a stay-at-home mom. Joshua Bell: A stay-at-home mom. Dwight Smith: Yeah. Joshua Bell: Did you have any siblings? Dwight Smith: Yes, one sister. Joshua Bell: One sister. And you grew up there in Maryland? Dwight Smith: No. At the age of three, my father’s home port was changed from Baltimore, Maryland to Brooklyn, New York. So, from my age four right through sophomore year of high school, I lived in Brooklyn, New York. Joshua Bell: What was it like growing up in the ‘20s and ‘30s? Dwight Smith: Well, I survived it okay. On the question, my father never missed a trip on this…with his ship, and we were comfortable during the Depression. Joshua Bell: What was it like having him gone so often? Dwight Smith: Not good at all. I really didn’t have a father. He’d be gone for two months at a time, home for a week, and off again. Never at home for Christmas, or birthdays, or any of those things. Joshua Bell: Oh, Jeez. How did your mom manage? Dwight Smith: First of all, her mother lived with her. My grandmother lived with her until my grandmother passed away when I was 11. And she was a big help to help bringing up the kids and keeping my mother on an even keel. It wasn’t easy. Joshua Bell: Oh, go ahead. Dwight Smith: Let me tell you an incident. When I was discharged from the Navy, I said to my lady friend, “I may go back to sea.” And she said, “The sea or me.” And we were later married, and stayed married for 62 years. Joshua Bell: That’s fantastic. Dwight Smith: Yeah. Joshua Bell: So, as a kid, how did you like living in New York? Dwight Smith: Let me say that I liked it better, because every summer we went to our small house we had in the little village of Groton, Vermont. G-R-O-T-O-N, Vermont. So that was our summer home, and as soon as school let out in Brooklyn, we loaded up the car and headed north, and I spent the summer in Vermont, and then returned to Brooklyn around Labor Day. Joshua Bell: And where did you go to school? Dwight Smith: Public school in Brooklyn, New York. P.S. 97, Seth Low Junior High School, New Utreckth and Lafayette High School. And then, for my junior and senior year, I went to an out-of-state boarding school, Mount Hermon School in Mount Hermon, Massachusetts. Joshua Bell: What’s the highest grade you completed? Dwight Smith: I’m a college graduate. Joshua Bell: Where’d you go to college? Dwight Smith: Wait a minute. Two years to Green Mountain Junior College in Vermont, and two years… Well, anyway, two years in Dartmouth College. I got my diploma from Dartmouth College in February of 1947. Joshua Bell: Excellent. So, when were you in college, what years? Dwight Smith: I graduated from Mount Hermon in June of 1941. And I graduated from Green Mountain College in May of 1943. And my first two semesters at Dartmouth College were through the Navy V-12 College Training Program. And my final two semesters at Dartmouth College were after the war, so it was 1946-47. Joshua Bell: The V-12 Program; is that the Navy equivalent to the Army Specialized Training Program? Dwight Smith: Well, it’s the equivalent of B5 in the Air Force. V-12 in the College Training Program, and when you finished your college work, you ordinarily went on to a 90-day wonder school or midshipman school, and I did that. I mean, I went to the 90-day wonder school, but I came down with the German measles after 30 days, and I was hospitalized for a few days, and by the time I returned to the midshipman’s school, it was decided that… I was so far behind, losing a few days, that they decided I ought to go back into the regular part of the Navy as a seaman first class. Joshua Bell: Sure. When you were in high school, do you remember hearing about what was going on in Europe and in Asia? Dwight Smith: Well, I was in high school when December 7, 1941. Joshua Bell: And what was the general reaction to that? Dwight Smith: The whole nation went to war. I mean, the whole nation. It was everybody was immersed in World War II in some way, you know. My parents, my father was sailing still between West Africa and New York. And my mother, you know, had rations; butter, and meat, and whatever. Your tires; you couldn’t buy new tires for your cars. And, in fact, you couldn’t buy a new car. We all survived it. We all got behind the war effort, everyone. Joshua Bell: What do you remember thinking about the attack at Pearl Harbor? Dwight Smith: Oh, I remember thinking it was a terrible thing, and I went right back to… Let’s see, I was just 16, so I went back to Green Mount College, and after two years of… This is the junior college, two-year college, and as the time went by, more and more of our male students were either called up to service, or volunteered to go into the service. By the time I graduated in May of 1943, I was one of only four or five males left in the student body. Joshua Bell: What was that experience like? Dwight Smith: Well, it was pretty sad, seeing the guys going off to war. And, yes, it was, kind of, sad. Joshua Bell: Did the professors have any reaction to that? Dwight Smith: Yeah, some of them were drafted. Joshua Bell: Some of them were drafted. Dwight Smith: Yeah, because they were young enough to be drafted. Joshua Bell: What was your course of study? Dwight Smith: I majored in… what does my diploma say… Business Administration. Joshua Bell: Business Admin. Okay. Dwight Smith: Yeah. And, when I graduated, I was one of the few of the males left to graduate. In the following year, the school went 100% female. I was the final male student until a number of years later, they went back to both males and females. Joshua Bell: You must have… Dwight Smith: They’ve gone to… Joshua Bell: Oh, go ahead. Dwight Smith: They’ve gone to a four-year school, now, Green Mountain College has. When I went, it was a junior college –– two years. Joshua Bell: So, your dad was going back and forth to Africa at this time? Dwight Smith: Yes, his… He worked for a steamship company called the American West African Line, and his home port was pier 36 in Brooklyn, New York, Atlantic Basin. And, he sailed from there to the… Starting at the Azores and the Canary Islands, working down the coast of West Africa to the Belgian Congo, at that time, the Belgian Congo. And it was, you know, general cargo, and off-loading, and sometimes they have piers to tie up to and unload, but other times, he had to anchor well off shore, and they would come out in wooden carved canoes and pick up the cargo and row ashore with it. It was quite primitive, the ports he called on. Joshua Bell: There must… Was there any concern about German U-boats attacking? Dwight Smith: Let me tell you. In October of 1942, a German U-boat sank my father’s ship. Joshua Bell: Oh, dear. Dwight Smith: Oh, dear, yes. He survived the sinking, and he was the last one off the ship, and he got into a life boat, the capacity, written capacity of 24 people, but 34 men and one woman in his life boat. Joshua Bell: How long were they at sea? Dwight Smith: Ten days. They were not picked up. He navigated to Barbados Island. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: It took ten days to get there. He carried a sextant and a compass in a waterproof bag, with the chain around his neck, when he went over. And that enabled him, along with his knowledge of seafaring, he was able to navigate that life boat to Barbados Island. They were never picked up. He just hit the island. Wow. Joshua Bell: I can’t imagine you and your mother’s reaction to that, once you found out. Dwight Smith: Well, that was another big problem. This was October of 1942. Joshua Bell: Right. Dwight Smith: My mother and I didn’t know if he was dead or alive. And he wasn’t able to tell my mother that he was alive until December of ’42. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: I mean, he was on this British-held island, but… They just answered everything. You couldn’t send a message to home. Terrible. My mother did not know if he was dead or alive. Joshua Bell: But she knew the ship had gone down. Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. No. I’m not sure she knew that it went down. Yes. Because another… Somebody else got ashore sooner and told my mother that the ship went down. He didn’t know what happened to the Captain. Pretty sad. Now, again… Then I was out in the South Pacific in ’43; this was ’42, and my mother went through hell between her husband and her only son. Joshua Bell: So, what led you to choose the Navy? Dwight Smith: I was drafted. At Draft Board #1 in St. Johnsbury, Vermont said, “We have a choice today; you can choose the Navy, Marine Corp., Army, or Coast Guard.” And being as my father was a sea captain, I raised my hand for the Navy. Joshua Bell: So, it runs in the family. Dwight Smith: I guess so. No. My father ran away from home. He was a minister’s son. He ran away from home at the age of 16, and went to sea. What a story. And he was in the Navy in World War I as a lieutenant. Joshua Bell: He was? Dwight Smith: After sailing… He graduated from nautical school in 1907, New York Maritime Academy. And he was a graduate out of nautical school. His first berth was on a lighthouse-keeping ship on the East Coast, was headed for the Philippines, because we had just stole the Philippines from the Spanish, and so it was now our…our necessity to take care of sea in the Philippines Islands, so… It’s, like, the light ship keeping ship was shipped out to the Philippines, and by way of Cape… What’s the… Cape… Cape of South America. Joshua Bell: Oh, yes. Dwight Smith: The Panama Canal had not been built, and he was a junior officer on that ship. And once they reached Manilla, he stayed in the middle of the Philippines until World War II. I mean, World War I. He sailed on British-owned ships out of Manilla up to Indo-China, Japan, China. You name it, in the Pacific. [Unintelligible 00:13:37] islands. He worked his way up to finally becoming a first officer, and then later a captain. And then, when the British went into war in World War I, these ships that he was sailing on out of Manilla, were part of the British Admiralty, see. You know, they took over these cargo ships as British Navy. And, when the United States heard about him being out in the Philippines and working for the British, they brought him home to the United States and made him a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. And they stationed him at a desk job in Wales, which is the last thing he wanted. When he got out of World War I, he went back to sea as a merchant skipper, merchant ships, cargo ships. And he sailed around the world [unintelligible 00:14:38] of Europe and back and [unintelligible 00:14:40], and then he finally landed this job with the American West African Line around 1928, I think. He was torpedoed in 1942, and then he got a shore job. Joshua Bell: Then he was home? Dwight Smith: Yes. Yes, but he moved from Brooklyn, New York to New Orleans, Louisiana, because of his shore job. He was a surveyor for the insurance underwriters who… He inspected cargoes of ships before they sailed out of the United States, to make sure they were properly stowed, or not overweight, or whatever else. He’d give them assurance, the underwriters wanted to know about. So he was an official inspector, and he’d go aboard these ships and inspect the cargoes. And he really enjoyed it, because he got to meet a lot of old friends… Of course, you know, with fellow sea captains. Joshua Bell: I’m sure your mother was pleased with this development. Dwight Smith: Oh, yes indeed. I will say, though, that when he was transferred to New Orleans, my mother didn’t like summer in New Orleans, so she went back to Vermont to spend the summer in our home in Groton, Vermont. And then he’d come up when he had a vacation. Joshua Bell: Were you able to ? When did he get home after being torpedoed? Dwight Smith: December of 1942. Joshua Bell: It was December of ’42? And I’m sure there must have been a welcome home party? Dwight Smith: I forget the details. I do remember he came home alive. What my mother went through in World War II, with my father out there in the Atlantic, and me in the South Pacific in the following year, 1943. It wasn’t easy for her. Joshua Bell: Oh, not at all. Dwight Smith: That’s when my lady friend said, “The sea or me.” Because she knew what my mother went through. Joshua Bell: Oh, yes. Dwight Smith: So, I went into the railroad business two days after she said, “The sea or me.” Joshua Bell: You said you signed up in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Dwight Smith: Yeah. I was drafted then, and the Draft Board #1 in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, because that’s the county seat for our summer home in Groton, Vermont. Joshua Bell: For Caledonia County. Dwight Smith: Yes. I got my driver’s license and things when I was already in the Navy. Joshua Bell: Yeah. What was that day like? Dwight Smith: What about that? Joshua Bell: What was that day like? The draft board? Dwight Smith: Kind of scary. I didn’t know what I was going to be, but when they said I had an option to the four branches of the service, I said, quickly, I said, “Navy.” I wanted no part of… I wanted to have a roof over my head and three square meals a day. And you get that on a ship, and you don’t get that when you’re in the Army. Joshua Bell: That’s right. How did your dad and mom react to you getting drafted? Dwight Smith: Well, they just accepted it, because we were at war. I came home from boot camp, ten days leave. I went up to Groton, Vermont. My parents were up there, and my grandfather was still alive. He lived up there, my father’s father. And, I came home in my full uniform, and I went to see them, and they were quite pleased with that. Once I got back to report back after my leave from boot camp, I thought, you know, they’re going to send me to a technical school of some kind, or some kind of a… No. They sent me right down Norfolk, Virginia, and said, “Get aboard this U.S.S. South Dakota battleship –– We need you.” Right out of boot camp. Wow. Joshua Bell: How did you feel about that? Dwight Smith: Scared to death. They put me on this ship in Norfolk, Virginia, and it was in dry-dock. It had just come down from the North Atlantic. It was working with the British fleet, protecting the freighters headed for Murmansk. Murmansk, Russia, which is above the… It’s way, way, way up north. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: One tip of Norway and around into Murmansk. And the battleship South Dakota worked with the British fleet, protecting loose convoys, and also trying to entice German battleships, which were in the fjords in Norway, to come out and get shot. They stayed put. They did not come out. Joshua Bell: How many ships would go in your convoy? Dwight Smith: I have no idea. See, this was… I was in the Navy when the South Dakota was heading up. Joshua Bell: Oh, that’s right. That’s right. I wanted to ask –– What was basic training like? Dwight Smith: Boot camp? Oh, like Hell. I never knew how to fold sheets or make a bed, or I didn’t like to get up at 6:00 o’clock in the morning. I did not like boot camp. Joshua Bell: What do you remember about your superior officers? Dwight Smith: Well, they were usually not commissioned officers. They were chiefs, chief’s petty officers that were, you know, leading us, and they were very strict and very rough on us. I guess I was a mama’s boy, and there I was at the age of… How old was I? Eighteen. I had just turned 18, and I didn’t like boot camp. No. Joshua Bell: Did you make any friends while you were there? Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yep. But I’ve lost some over the years. Joshua Bell: Did any of them go with you to the South Dakota? Dwight Smith: Yeah. Two or three of them. Joshua Bell: Two or three of them? Dwight Smith: Two or three, actually. Yeah. And we were all lined up on the fantail in the dry-dock, on the ship, being assigned to our divisions. Now, that’s news to me, I didn’t know what divisions were, but they were where they put you to work on the ship. Well, they started calling off your names, and telling you you’re going to division twelve or division six, or you’re going to peel potatoes, or you’re going to be swabbing decks, or chipping paint. Things like that. And then manning a fleet, forty gauged anti-aircraft guns or throwing bags of powder into the 16-inch guns, and things like that. I didn’t really want to do things like that. So, one of the officers made an announcement. He said, “Anybody here have high school math? Raise your hand.” The guys next to me, “Don’t volunteer. Never, never volunteer.” I raised my hand. I got put in the Fire Control Division. Gunfire. Tried to get the bullets to be where that airplane is, at the same time. Joshua Bell: Oh. Dwight Smith: And wind velocity, and every little detail had to be cranked into this system to be accurate when you’re firing these 5-inch, twin 5-inch guns, the ones I was working with. And I was put down into the plotting room, which is in the bowels of the ship. And I had earphones on my head, and a hand crank on a computer down in the bowels of the ship. I’d been getting messages from the people who were working the optics parts of Fire Control Division, you know, the trainers, and whatever, using optics back topside, and following this information tube down to us guys in the bowels, because we had a computer in that portion of the ship. It was all vacuum tubes, hotter than Hell. But, the plotting room and the sick bay were the only two parts of the ship that were air conditioned. And then, when things were quiet, we were allowed to sleep on the floor in the plotting room at night, if you desired, when we’re out of danger. Joshua Bell: And how did you like that job? Dwight Smith: That job was okay, because I was… At sixteen inches of armor plate on both sides of me, you know. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: And, those guys topside with those 48-millimeter anti-aircraft guns, were totally exposed. I could hear the things going on, and I could feel them, but I never saw them. My watch station, I saw everything, because I was just sitting up on top of a twin 5-inch mount, the director, where the optics were. And my job was to sit there and read my manuals so I’d become a better fire control-man, eight hours a day. Joshua Bell: Not a bad gig. Dwight Smith: Yeah, I wish I’d had my camera with me, because sitting up there, and I’m watching… We’re in a task force, Task Force 58, and there’s ships as far as the eye can see. And our primary duty on the South Dakota was to protect those carriers. When the planes start flying over, shoot those planes down. That was our main duty. And our secondary duty was to shore bombard Japanese held islands before the Marines and the Army went ashore. Soften them up with our 16-inch guns. I don’t know how much damage we did, but we sure tried. I guess by the time I got out there in 1943, the Japanese Navy had been pretty well annihilated. There wasn’t much left. So we’re, basically, shore bombardments and anti-aircraft on my ship. We’re also within a sea of cruisers, and destroyers, and aircraft carriers as far as the eye can see. It was amazing. And then every so often, we would pull into an atoll somewhere, and, you know, restore our groceries and put the sick guys, and the guys who were injured onto the hospital ship, and things like that. And we would be able to go ashore, on the beach in these islands, under the palm trees. I must say that the women in those little islands got whiter every time we went ashore. And I didn’t drink beer at that point in my life, and… I do now, but I didn’t then. And, when we went ashore, they gave us a chit for two beers, and I got my chit for the two beers, and once I got ashore, I would auction them off. I did very well. There’s a light side to all this story, you know. There’s a light side to it. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. So… Dwight Smith: You’ve got to be… You’ve got to make it light because, otherwise, you’re going to go nuts. Joshua Bell: Did the South Dakota ever come under fire? Dwight Smith: Yes, but before I was on it, and after I was on it. We were under fire, in that, Kamikaze airplanes tried to sink us. But there was no physical intercourse with other ships, but we were always fighting off these Japanese airplanes. They’d try to drop bombs down our stack, and things like that. Kind of nerve-wracking. Joshua Bell: That must have been especially nerve-wracking because you couldn’t see what was going on. Dwight Smith: You know what was especially nerve-wracking, too? My mother. I mean, think about it. She’s already put up with the German U-boat situation, and there I was out there, her little boy. Joshua Bell: Did you stay in contact with your mom, and your parent…well, your parents? Dwight Smith: Yes. We’d write emails, they called them, I think, or something like that. Victory mails… Joshua Bell: Oh, yeah. The V-mails. Yeah. Dwight Smith: V-mails. Yeah. Oh, yes, we kept in touch. But I couldn’t tell them much about what was happening on the… Joshua Bell: Oh, right. Dwight Smith: …They censored our letters before they were mailed. It was pretty sad. Joshua Bell: So, when you signed up for the Navy, how did you…? Where did you hope to go? Or did you have any aspirations? Dwight Smith: I’d like to have been assigned to a tug boat in New York harbor. Let me tell you, though… Oh. I’m on the South Dakota. I got on there in about July of ’43, I believe, in Norfolk. And, eight or nine months later, I’m walking through the ship, and there’s this little notice on the bulletin board. “The U.S. South Dakota. You have been given a quota of five of your 2,500 passengers, you can send five of them back to the Navy V-12 College Training Program.” Five of that crew, 2,500 men. Again, “Don’t volunteer.” I said, “Yes. I’m going to volunteer.” I raised my hand, and I got a physical exam, and a conversation with an officer, and a written exam. But I failed the physical exam to go back to the Navy V-12 College Training Program. It was down in sick bay, and this young doctor was going through, and he said, “Uh oh, your blood pressure is too low.” And he could see that I was a bit broken up about that. But he said, “I tell you what, son. Go up topside, get out a pack of cigarettes, and start smoking one cigarette after the other, and run up and down the deck, and come back down at 2:00 pm,” which I did, and he said, “You passed. Your blood pressure has increased enough that you can go back.” Joshua Bell: Did it work? Dwight Smith: Did it work? Yes. I was assigned to the Navy V-12 College Training Program, and I went back home as a passenger on an aircraft carrier that was headed to Pearl Harbor. There was something, probably some repairs to make, or something. So, I was a passenger on the U.S.S. Princeton, a big aircraft carrier, and I was a passenger on it. And then, when we got to Pearl Harbor, they had me in a tent on some hillside in Hawaii. And I said, “Well, when am I going to know when I’m going to get from Pearl Harbor back to the States?” They said, “We’ll let you know when we have a vacancy on a ship going back.” And I said, “Well, how will I know when?” They said, “See that pole outside your tent? There’s a loud speaker on it. When we call your name, you better be ready.” So, thus, I never did become a tourist in the Hawaiian Islands, because I sat right by that pole for two or three days. And they sent me back. And I filled out an application for the Navy V-12 College Training Program. And there was three colleges I could apply to. Northwestern in Chicago, Columbia in New York City, and Dartmouth College in rural New Hampshire. Now I’m thinking, first of all, that most of these guys will want to go to New York or Chicago, not rural New Hampshire. So I applied for Dartmouth College, knowing I have a better chance. Not only that, but Dartmouth College was forty miles from our summer home in Groton, Vermont, 40 miles. Joshua Bell: Right. Dwight Smith: Well… Okay. They sent me my orders to go home for 10 days leave. So, I get on a train in Oakland, California, spend five days sitting up at a day coach to Woodsville, New Hampshire, and I finally got home to Groton, Vermont. My orders were –– “After your 10-day leave up there, we want you to come back to San Diego, California for further orders.” Joshua Bell: Oh, Jeez. Dwight Smith: Yes. Oh, Jeez. So back I go on a train and another route to San Diego, five days sitting on the day coach. I’m at this base in San Diego for three or four days. They hand me my orders to go to Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, 40 miles from where I was! I tell you, you’re looking back, you wonder how we won the war. Joshua Bell: So much for logistics. Dwight Smith: Oh, my God, yes. So, I crossed the country three times, by rail, in 30 days. Joshua Bell: Well, hey, that must have been an experience. Dwight Smith: Well, yes, but bear in mind that in my two years and eleven months in the Navy, I crossed the country 10 times. Joshua Bell: Ten times? Dwight Smith: Ten times, coast to coast. Whenever I was on the East Coast, they wanted me on the West Coast. Whenever I was on the West Coast, they wanted me on the East Coast, and I… Ten times. And once I… Not really crossed coast to coast, but I got from Norfolk, Virginia to Oakland, California by way of Panama Canal and the South Pacific. That’s my first coast to coast trip, was from Norfolk to Oakland, California. It took nine months to do the trip, but that’s what the first one was. Joshua Bell: I was going to say, you went the long way around. Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. And then this thing going down to San Diego and back. Also, though, I also… I crossed the country ten times, coast to coast, seven times by rail, once by the ship, South Dakota, and twice by thumb, hitchhiking. Joshua Bell: Twice by thumb? Dwight Smith: Yes. Twice. Joshua Bell: During your time in the Navy? Dwight Smith: Yes. Though, the last time was, I’d been discharged out in Bremerton, Washington, and I’m heading home, and I wanted to visit some friends along the way, so I hitchhiked. The first time was during the Christmas/New Years of ’45-’46 when everybody was on the West Coast trying to get to the East Coast, because the war in Japan was over. Oh, I tried, with a buddy, to see if we could get a bus, or train, or airplane, or something to go to the East Coast. We both wanted to get back to New York, as my lady friend was in New Jersey, and his friend was out there somewhere also. So, the two of gave up and we thumbed our way across, and in five days, we made it. Night and day, we got rides. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: And, I tell you, it was very interesting. Because when you were doing this, this hitchhiking, protocol was for the military people to line up along the highway, and the fellas first in line would get the first ride. And those guys who lined up way at the end of the line, they may sit there for six or eight hours before they get a ride. So, my friend and I, we overnighted at a bunk in the basement of the fire station of Winnemucca, Nevada. Got up in the morning, bright and early, and boy, what [a line up 00:35:20]. This was in November or December of ’45. The war with Japan was just over. And, we were standing there, just moping, because, “Jeez. We’re never going to get a ride.” Well, we’re really out in the desert. And we saw this cloud of dust. It was a car coming across a little dirt road in the desert, there. Guess where the car ended up? At the highway, right where we were standing. Never mind what protocol is, we jumped in that car and headed east. An old Indian was driving it, and every roadhouse we passed where he could get a drink, we, the two, my friend and I were sent into the roadhouse to buy him a bottle of beer, because he couldn’t buy it. The Indians were not allowed to drink alcohol. So, we kept feeding him the beers. I think we went 300 miles with him. Anyway, that’s how we got across country in five days. I’d say, you got to get a few breaks. Because I was… Now I had met this young lady, and she’s in New Jersey, and I’m in California, and I spent Christmas and New Year’s with her. Not New Year’s eve because I was headed back to the West Coast again, because that’s where I was supposed to be. I was sitting on the day coach again. I remember New Year’s Eve, we were crossing through Wyoming, and my mother put a little jigger of whiskey in my suitcase. And I got it out and celebrated the New Year away. Drank sitting on the day coach. Joshua Bell: Good ol’ mom looking out for you. Dwight Smith: Yep, in the wilds of Wyoming. So I have many a tale to tell, but I think I ought to condense this, because I started out on the South Dakota, I went through Navy V-12 College Training Program. I graduated from that. I took two semesters at Dartmouth, and, by the way, I was the… Our company… In the Navy, there were companies, and in these college programs, we all wore uniforms, and we all marched up and down the college green, and so forth and so on. Most, or 99.9% of the students, the V-12 students, were either right out of high school or were attending college. And I was the only one in that whole company that had battle stars on my ribbon on my uniform. And, it was quite unique. I get this picture of the whole company marching across the green, and there’s one guy holding something up, and I’m holding the flag in front of the team, because I’m a veteran already. Joshua Bell: How did the other guys feel about that? Dwight Smith: The other guys were amazed. They were, you know, awestruck. “How do you do this? How did you get into this college program?” I said, “I raised my hand and volunteered.” Joshua Bell: And you didn’t have to give up any of your rank to get in, did you? Dwight Smith: I was still seaman first class. Joshua Bell: Still seaman first class? Dwight Smith: Yeah, big deal. Joshua Bell: How many battle stars? Dwight Smith: Four. Joshua Bell: Four battle stars. Dwight Smith: And my Pacific ribbon, yeah. I had the Atlantic ribbon because I’m getting ahead of myself, here, but I had the Atlantic ribbon. I have five ribbons in all. And I would have had six ribbons if I got the Good Conduct Medal. But I had to be in the Navy for three years to get the Good Conduct ribbon, and I was in the Navy two years and eleven months. Joshua Bell: Oh, Jeez. Dwight Smith: So, by one month, I never got this Good Conduct ribbon. So, it was the South Dakota, then it was Dartmouth College. And then it was midshipman’s school in the Bronx, somewhere in the Bronx. New York Nautical Academy for my 90-day wonder school. It was going to make an ensign out of me, God willing. And, 30 days into the program –– and it’s an intense program. You’re up and about, and running here, there, and everywhere, and taking exams, and all of it was intense. And after 30 days of it, I came down with the German measles. I was sent over to the St. Alban’s, New York Naval Hospital. And I was there maybe four or five days. And, if you lose four or five days out of the 90-day wonder school, you’re lost. You’re never going to catch up. So, when I went back to Port Schuyler, my name was on the bulletin board that I’m dismissed from this program, along with several others. And, there I was, back into being a seaman first class, and sent to Great Lakes Training Center out of Chicago, for further orders. I was on the East Coast, of course, they had to send me out to Chicago for further orders, they can’t get me any in the east. So, here I am. Now, I have to backtrack on this story, because… Joshua Bell: Of course. Dwight Smith: …when I was on the South Dakota, and then I was moved to the States, as a passenger. I was a passenger on the U.S.S. Princeton, which is an aircraft carrier. And while I was on the Princeton, I was carrying my hammock and my mattress, and everything else, over my shoulder. You know, carrying this heavy thing over my shoulder, my bedding. I said to myself –– Jeez, if I go to college, I’m going to have bunk. I’m not going to need this stuff. So I stuffed it into an empty locker on the Princeton. And there were… You know, I left it there, and on I went on my journey. Several months later, the U.S.S. Princeton is torpedoed or bombed. It’s sunk by the Japanese, and it was sunk. The carrier went down. So, here I am at Great Lakes, Illinois, in this big receiving center. Out of college, which, of course, I didn’t need the hammock. I look at my quarters in this big building in Great Lakes, I see bunks with no mattresses on them. So, there’s a gnarled old quartermaster who’s in charge. He was probably in the Navy for 20 years, and he finally got a good job. And I went up to him and I said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any bedding.” “Why the hell don’t you?” I said, “It went down with the Princeton.” “Oh, fella, let me help you. I’ll go get you a mattress.” I mean, you had to tell a little, you know… Joshua Bell: Well, it was true. It did go down with the Princeton. Dwight Smith: That’s, that’s the God awful truth. I twisted the truth so it worked for me. And so, I got a bunk, and so forth. So… Oh, guess where I was on VJ Day? Joshua Bell: Oh, please tell me. Dwight Smith: You know that photograph of the sailor and the nurse in Times Square? Joshua Bell: Yes. Dwight Smith: Yes. Well, it could have been me. I was in Times Square on August 15, 1945, because, at that point, I was attached to the Brooklyn Armed Guards Center in Brooklyn, New York. And, I got a couple of babes together, and we… Nickel fare, we rode the subway into Times Square and had a great time. Joshua Bell: What do you remember thinking about VJ Day happening? Dwight Smith: Oh, very pleased, believe me. Very pleased. It meant I didn’t have to go back to the South Pacific. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: So, there I was in Brooklyn. Now, why was I in Brooklyn? Because when I got out of Great Lakes, they sent me to radar operator’s school. Finally, the Navy sends me to a school I can attend and graduate from. They sent me to a radar operator’s school in Point Loma in San Diego, California. The most beautiful place I have ever been, as far as climate was concerned. You get out on the water… A point of land in San Diego, and the cool ocean breezes, and the warm sun, 70 degrees and low humidity, and six weeks of studies to learn how to operate radar…which I did. And I got my certificate, and I needed to be reassigned. Of course, I’m in California, and so they have to reconsign me to somewhere on the East Coast, don’t they? They did. They sent me to the Brooklyn Armed Guard Center in Brooklyn, New York, where my parents were living, at that time. And, it was totally useless to do these things to me, but they did. And, so then, they finally put me on a ship. It was to operate the radar on a merchant ship, because the Merchant Marine companies didn’t have radar yet. Only the Navy had radar. So, they installed radar…little bits of radar were on these cargo ships. So, I was sent down, by train, to Jacksonville, Florida to board the S.S. Thomas W. Hyde, which was a Liberty ship loaded with kegs of tobacco and prefabricated houses, wooden prefabricated houses. We were headed to London, England. And we were both… Tobacco and housing was in need… They needed it. We sailed out of Jacksonville, Florida with this cargo, and I’m the radar operator, and I’m very proud of this. I got a private cabin, because they didn’t know where to put me. Even though I was still a seaman first class, they gave me a private cabin. It used to be the radio operator’s cabin. I dined with the officers. Joshua Bell: Wow. Dwight Smith: Yeah. I’m a seaman first class, but the only one on the ship who knew anything about the radar. Joshua Bell: Big time. Dwight Smith: Yeah, big time. So, I enjoyed that journey, because once I went topside, and I said to the skipper, “Do you want me to show you how this works?” He said, “Ah, I don’t believe in it. Don’t bother me.” Joshua Bell: Don’t believe in it. Dwight Smith: So, I had this trip over to London, England and back, at the Navy’s expense. Joshua Bell: Not bad. Dwight Smith: And once we got to London, we off-loaded our… This was November, September, October, yeah, September, October, it was ’45. The war in Japan was over. In fact, the whole war was over. We still had a Navy gun crew on the Thomas Hyde, but they didn’t have anything to do except polish their guns. And I didn’t have anything to do because the skipper didn’t believe in radar, so… He was a merchant seaman. So, I said, “Okay. I’ll enjoy this voyage.” And then we… I went ashore with some of the gun and crew buddies, and we saw London, the upside, and London and the downside of London. And we spent a few days there. And, finally, we headed back to Boston, and we had a cargo of troops, returning troops from the war in Europe returning to the United States. They put up bunks in the cargo holds, and we carried troops back with us. So, it was a nice round trip, and once we reached Boston, I think I’ll… maybe I’ll go out on the ship again. I hope so. [Unintelligible 00:47:27] Some officers come aboard with clipboards, and call me down, “Where are you?” And I just told them, “I’m up here.” And so, they came up and interviewed me. They said, “Were putting three men on to replace you. Two to operate it, and one to repair the radar. They are going to be Army men.” I said, “Okay. Whatever.” So, they put me back into, I don’t know, some receiving station somewhere. Oh, I know. I was on the East Coast, right? Well, guess where I’m sent? San Francisco. Joshua Bell: No way. Dwight Smith: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Nothing spectacular, but… So, I reached San Francisco, and I learned that I’m going to be a crew member on the LST-835 landing ship tank in San Francisco. It was anchored off of Alcatraz, there in San Francisco Bay. It had brought back… The war was over in Japan. The war was over, and they brought back on this LST a lot of military gear that was still usable. You know, trucks, and tractors, and other stuff that was over in the islands of the Pacific. And they put it all on this LST, and sent the LST to San Francisco, where they unloaded all this stuff. Now, the Navy said the LST… They used to go up to Portland, Oregon. It will be decommissioned, eventually. So, I’m put on the LST-835 as a radar operator. Again, no interest on the part of any other crew that we needed radar. So, again, I was just a passenger. And we went up the coast to Astoria, Oregon. We put up there for a while. And then we went up the Columbia River to Portland, Oregon, and we tied up there for the winter. This was 1945-46. And I am totally bored. Nothing to do. So, I said to the crew; there’s a yeoman and a storekeeper. Each went ashore everyday together in a Navy truck, not in a big truck, but a Navy truck to run errands. The storekeeper’s going to buy groceries so we can eat on the ship, and the yeoman has got paperwork to go to the Naval headquarters, back and forth. So, the two of them would go ashore every day in this truck. And I went up to them, and I said… They were nice guys, and I said to them, “Would you like to have a chauffeur take you every day?” “Oh, sure.” So, that was my job, to take them ashore, not ashore, we were tied up at a dock, but to take them downtown. And our first stop every day was Union Station in Portland, Oregon to have a… USO to have a coffee and a donut. And we ran our errands and came back. In the afternoon, we had nothing to do, but nonetheless, it was something for me to do, because I was on that LST for the whole winter of ’45-’46, and never saw the sun shine in Portland, Oregon in the winter. But it wasn’t cold or it wasn’t snowy, it was just gray. And, there I was in Portland, Oregon, and I’m about to be discharged. I finally have enough points to be discharged. And the yeoman says to me, “You have to discharged on the East Coast because that’s where you started out of.” I said, “Oh, Jeez. Another train ride, coast to coast.” I really wanted to hitchhike, because I just wanted to be out of the Navy, now. And I could stop along the way and visit some of my old Navy buddies, who lives in Texas, and lived in Louisiana, and Oregon, Eastern Washington, and so forth. I wanted to stop, you know, make a nice trip out of it. So, I said to the yeoman, “How do I get discharged out here instead of Boston?” “Well,” he says, “do you happen to have a job out here?” I said, “No, I don’t.” “Well, you have to have family out here.” I said, “No, I don’t.” “Or you could have a car out here.” Ah ha. I whipped out my [unintelligible 00:51:40] wallet, and there’s my registration from my Model-A Ford. Still good. A Vermont registration. The car was up on blocks in my garage in Groton, Vermont. The registration was still valid. So, the yeoman signs all of the paperwork, and I’m discharged in Bremerton, Washington, and I’m paid three cents a mile to drive my car back to Boston. And I pocketed the three cents a mile and hitchhiked. You know, I think my story almost sounds like I had too much fun. Joshua Bell: That’s fantastic. Dwight Smith: It is! It really is. Joshua Bell: It sounds like it was a little frustrating, though. Dwight Smith: Oh, yes. Oh, definitely. Joshua Bell: More [unintelligible 00:52:24], perhaps. Dwight Smith: Well, there were many places which would frustrate you. And, particularly when the Navy brass is making decisions for you, and you wonder where they got their brains from. We groused about it, you know, but, you know, in two years eleven months, I crossed the Atlantic Ocean, I crossed the Pacific, I mean, I went from California to Oregon by boat, and I was out in the South Pacific. And all that and a full college year at Dartmouth College. Two semesters of a regular college year. And radar school, and… To think about it, two years eleven months, I crammed all of that stuff in? Coast to coast and doing everything. And having met my lady friend. That was during…while I was in the Navy. I met her for two different weekends, and then I was off to the seas again, and we corresponded by mail. And, finally, when I hitchhiked back, Christmas of ’45, we were still… We hadn’t seen much of each other. And we made plans, and the following summer, I went back to college, and she had a summer job near, but I only… We got engaged and married, and now I’m the – we together, produced five children. And now, she’s passed away, but I have nine grandchildren now, and eleven great grandchildren, and it’s pretty amazing to me. I’m 91 years old, and I don’t feel it, and I don’t look it. Joshua Bell: No, you certainly don’t. Dwight Smith: I am thoroughly… Feel that I am fortunate, because I’ve got my health, I have a new lady friend who’s… We’re very close. We just enjoy each other’s company. I have a daughter and son-in-law whose very close to me, living five miles away from here, and where I live. And I have a son and his family living over in Bridgton, Maine, which is about 25 miles from here. And I have a son and family living in South Portland, Maine, which is about 60 miles from here. And I have a son and a daughter-in-law living out in Battleground, Washington, which is… They both work in the city of Portland, Oregon. But that’s all I have today, and I’m so pleased with it, that I’m here and the shape I’m in. I just feel fortunate. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. I wanted ask, what are you most proud of about your time in the service? Dwight Smith: I’m most proud of the fact that I served in… I’m a combat Naval veteran, and I did my, whatever I had to do, and I did it willingly. I didn’t have much choice, but I mean to say, though, that once I was in this dangerous situation, I held up very well. And I… I can’t say I didn’t really enjoy the ten trips across the country. There’s a tale in that one, too. Let me tell you. Joshua Bell: Oh, please, please. Dwight Smith: I chose… Because I’m a rail fan, and my whole working history was in the railroad business, that I took different routes every time I crossed the country by rail. The same rate fare, but I took different railroad company’s routes. And the most popular one was from New York to Chicago on either the New York Central or the Pennsylvania Railroad. And then, from Chicago to the West Coast, the usual route was Chicago and Northwestern to Omaha, Nebraska, and the Union Pacific to Ogden, Utah, and the Southern Pacific on to California. And that was the typical route for everything moving from Chicago to the West Coast. There are exceptions, of course, but, basically, that was the major one. My first time gong west on that route, like, we’re in the some railroad station in Chicago, ready to board this train that’s going to take us to California. And they said, “For you servicemen, we have a special deal for you today. We’re going to allow you to have your own coach, and you’ll get on now, before the public gets on the train.” Whoopee-doo. They put us on this old cattle car that had kerosene lamps, and no air conditioning, and stiff-back seats. And then they opened the rest of the train with streamline cars, with reclining seats, and the air conditioning in the [unintelligible 00:57:07], and that’s how they rode to the West Coast. I said, “This is bullshit. I’m not going to do this again.” So, the next two times I did, I was in that same station, and the same offer was made to me, I stayed with the civilians, and waited for them to be called to board the train, because they’re not going to sit in those comfortable cars. So, those three trips, I learned on the first trip what not to do, and the second two trips were just fine. It’s just you have to work the system as well as you can. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. Dwight Smith: And, yeah, I did, and I… Overall, it was not a bad situation that I had. I mean, yes, it was not very safe out in the South Pacific, but I… [End of recorded material 00:57:52] June 27, 2016 [Start of recorded material 00:00:00] Joshua Bell: Today is June 27, 2016. I’m Josh Bell, park ranger with the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area. I’m joined, again, by Dwight Smith, who has been telling us about his experiences in the Navy. How are you doing today, Mr. Smith? Dwight Smith: I’m doing fine. I’m in good health and good… I feel well. Joshua Bell: Excellent. And it’s all right if we record our conversations like we did last time. Dwight Smith: It is okay. Joshua Bell: All right. Excellent. So, we covered quite a lot the last time we talked, and I was wondering if there was anything that I didn’t ask you that you’d like to share with the Historic Area? Dwight Smith: Yes. I would like to discuss, briefly, each of the three ships I sailed on. What were they doing while I was on there? I mean, why was I on there, and what were they doing? I think I’ll start with the third one and work back, because it gets more exciting going back. Joshua Bell: Sure. Dwight Smith: The third ship that I sailed on was a LST-835, which is a landing ship tank. And I boarded it in… I got to look at my records, here. I boarded it in 1946 in San Francisco Bay. It was out in the Bay after it had come… The war in Japan was over, and LST was in San Francisco, and it brought back from Japan, retrievable U.S. military gear. They just loaded up the stuff that was still usable, and brought it into San Francisco. And they off-loaded it. And then it was empty, and it was going to head up the coast to Portland, Oregon to be decommissioned. They needed a crew to get on it, and I was…happened to be at a Navy waiting station, if you will, in Treasure Island. And they said, “We’re assigning you to be the radar operator on LST-835. Joshua Bell: Oh, I’m sorry, there was a blip there. What was your duty? Dwight Smith: Radar operator. Joshua Bell: Radar operator, okay. Dwight Smith: That’s the time I had a rating of radar operator third class. And so, I boarded the ship, and we sailed up the coast, first to Astoria, Oregon, and then to Portland, Oregon, where we tied up. I had absolutely nothing to do on the ship other than look at the radar while we were in route to Oregon. And we got into Portland, Oregon in the fall of 1945, and then we tied up there, and I sat on that LST, and I had absolutely nothing to do. I was awaiting another place to be discharged. You see, you had to earn so many points, based on time and other factors, to be discharged. So, I was waiting to be discharged, and I had nothing to do on this ship. And I noticed that we were tied up at a dock in Portland, Oregon –– Swan Island, Portland, Oregon. And the ship’s yeoman and the ship’s storekeeper went ashore every day to do errands in the downtown city of Portland. The yeoman had Navy paperwork to exchange with the Navy base in Portland. And the storekeeper had to go into town to buy groceries for the LST dining hall. And they went in…took a Navy truck adjacent to where we were tied up, took a Navy truck and went into town every day. And I said to them, “Would you like to have a chauffeur?” They said, “Sure.” So, I then drove them into town every day while they ran their errands. So it gave me something to do, and it gave them a little bit of help. And I said to them, I said, “Well, what do you do every day?” Well, they said, “First we go to the Portland Union Railroad Station, and the USO in there has coffee and donuts. So that was our daily routine, the coffee and donuts, and then we ran our errands and came back to the ship. Now, it’s getting close to my discharge time. There I was out on the West Coast, and my home is on the East Coast –– This is the way it was in the Navy. And they said to me, “We’re going to have send you back to Boston, on a troop train, for your discharge.” And I said, “I’ve already crossed the United States six times by train, seven times by train, coast to coast, and I would like… Joshua Bell: And this is when you hitchhiked. Dwight Smith: That’s correct. And this is when the ship’s yeoman said to me, “You ready to be sent off to Boston on the train?” I said, “No. I’d like to be discharged here, at Bremerton, Washington.” He said, “Well, you can’t unless you have one of these three things to pass. Do you have any family out here?” I said, “No.” “Do you have a job out here.?” I said, “No.” “Do you have a car out here?” And without a further word, I reached in my pocket, pulled out the current registration I had for my Model-A Ford, valid. I didn’t tell him that the Model-A Ford was in Groton, Vermont, up on concrete blocks, waiting for my return. So, I get discharged in Bremerton, Washington, and hitchhiked home. This time I took two weeks to return to the East Coast by my thumb, because I wanted to visit friends along the way. And I had a shipmate that had already been discharged down in Texas, and another one in Spokane, Washington, and Washington D.C. So, I made these stops when I was hitchhiking across the country, and it took me a full two weeks to do it. Joshua Bell: What were the names of your friends that you stopped to see? Dwight Smith: I don’t remember. They were shipmates of mine, and they were already discharged. So I visited them, and I saw the country, and it was a very nice trip. And that was it. I was out of the Navy. But my lady friend, back on the East Coast, was very interested in me, and I was very interested in her. And I said to her, “I may go back to sea.” And she pointed to me and said, “The sea or me.” That was the end of my naval career, and seagoing career, and I went into the railroad business, which I stayed in until 1999. Joshua Bell: What did you do in the railroad business? Dwight Smith: Well, I worked for the Boston and Maine Rail Road in New England for 26 years, in freight marketing, freight sales, freight traffic department. And they were spiraling downhill, so I quit. I was not downsized. I did not get fired. I just quit. And I said, “I can do better by myself running my own railroad.” Now, there’s a step. So after, I really fell into luck, and I ended up starting our first train on the Conway Scenic Railroad, 11 miles long, in 1974. It was called Passengers Only; a little, short, you know, one-hour round trip in the summer, in North Conway, New Hampshire, where I live now. And it was very successful. Joshua Bell: I have been on that train. Dwight Smith: Have you? Joshua Bell: Yeah. Dwight Smith: Well, good. Good. I hope you paid for your trip. Joshua Bell: I certainly did. Dwight Smith: Because I’m living off of my… I sold my last share of stock in it in 1999, and I’m now living off the income of my investment. It’s been… It was very, very fascinating job. That was a job I enjoyed having, and enjoyed the challenges of starting from ground zero on a business. My wife and I were side by side. She ran our gift shop, and I ran the railroad, and my son ran the snack bar, and it was just…And, mostly, summer employees were… Because we only ran in the summer and into October. And so, most of my help were either college students, or school teachers who had the summer off, or retirees. And every one of them, though, enjoyed the job, because they all liked to work for a railroad. From track workers to the conductor on the train. And people would ask me, “What is your job here? Are you a conductor or engineer?” I said, “No. I stay here, back in the office, and count the money.” But it was a fascinating career, and I really was very, very fortunate to be enabled to do it. But, back to the Navy. That was the reason I sailed on the LST-835 was because they had nothing else for me to do. But to go back to the next ship backwards, here. The next ship was the S.S. Thomas W. Hyde, which is a Liberty ship, and Liberty ships were made, by the dozens, in shipyards throughout the United States, during World War II to help balance out the number of merchant ships that were lost to German submarines, or Japanese submarines. So, I was assigned as a…I was now a radar operator, and I was assigned to the Thomas W. Hyde, which is a merchant ship with a merchant crew, but they still had onboard the Navy Armed Guard, which were some Navy personnel, and they had some guns mounted on these merchant ships. This was in the fall of 1945. The war is over in August of ’45 and I boarded this ship in September of ’45. I boarded it in Jacksonville, Florida, and it was really on a mercy trip, because they loaded the ship down to Florida with kegs of tobacco, and pre-fabricated houses, which we delivered to London, England. Of course, a lot of homes were bombed out over in England in 1943-44, and these pre-fabricated houses were very welcomed. So, it was a mercy trip, really. And, once we got to London, England, we tied up and stayed there for a while. And when we left, we had a cargo full of returning troops. In other words, when the cargo facilities were emptied, they put in metal bunks, three deep, probably, and we took, you know, several hundred troops back to the United States. And we came back to Boston. Again, here I was, I was a radar operator, and just as we were leaving Jacksonville, Florida, I said to the skipper, “You want me to start using this radar the Navy just installed on your merchant ship?” He said, “Oh, no. I don’t believe in it.” So, I had a cruise to London, England and back, with absolutely no duties, because he was not interested in… He was a merchant skipper, but not interested. But what had happened at this point in time was, the U.S. Navy had developed workable radar, but none of the merchant ships really had any of that. So, the Navy put these radar - fit machines on these merchant ships, along with a Navy personnel –– me. And it would have been great if we needed it, but I guess we didn’t. So, I enjoyed the tour to England and back. And, once we reached Boston, I said, “This is a good deal. I’d like to stay on this ship for a while.” Well, a couple of officers onboard the ship, called for me and told me that I would have to leave the ship because they’re putting on three people to replace me. Two to operate the radar, and one to repair it. Now, these were Army guys, not Navy. I said, “Oh, okay.” So, there I am in Boston, Massachusetts, a few miles, not many miles from my home, and the Navy decides that a better place for me would be back in California, again. Joshua Bell: Oh, naturally. Dwight Smith: Oh, naturally. Well, that’s how I ended up on the LST-835 in San Francisco, because it’s as far away from Boston as they could find to get me. Now, back to number one, the U.S.S. South Dakota. Battleship 57 –– BB 57. Its goal was to annihilate Japanese Navy, annihilate occupants of Japanese-held islands in the South Pacific, which they were quite good at doing. And I was just out of boot camp, ten days leave at the home, and just out of boot camp, and they shipped me down to Norfolk, Virginia. And there was this big battleship in dry-dock, it had just come back from the North Atlantic, because it was helping the British] fleet guard the merchant ships that were headed for Murmansk, Russia, which was above the… What’s the word? Above the Arctic Circle. If you go up the coast of Norway, and around the top of Norway, and you end up at a port in Russia –– Murmansk. And that was where tons and tons of ammunition and land tanks, and all kinds of stuff were delivered to the Russian people because they were on our side against Japan, and against Germany. So, the South Dakota was working with the British fleet for a while, and then they were discharged from that, and sent down to Norfolk, Virginia to be in the dry-dock for a little bit of work. And that’s when I boarded the South Dakota. And, mind you, I was just out of boot camp. I did at home for a ten-day leave. I didn’t know beans about Navy ships or whatever might happen next for me. But the South Dakota needed… They let about 200 of their seaman that had been on the ship up until…with the British fleet. Before that, the South Dakota had already been out in the South Pacific. And when they reached Norfolk, they let about 200 of them go onto other duties, and didn’t have to stay on that particular ship. So, I was one of about 200 who were assigned to the South Dakota. We lined up on the fantail, and one evening, as we arrived the first day we had on the ship. And officers were telling each one of us what department we were going to be in, what division we were going to be in. Are we going to be peeling potatoes, or swabbing the decks, or chipping paint, or manning those anti-aircraft guns, which were totally exposed to the weather, and the bombs, and so forth? And so, I was going to be assigned to one of those divisions. Then one of the officers said, “Anybody out there have any high school math?” “No,” the people around me, “Don’t volunteer. You never volunteer in the Navy.” I said, “Well, I’m going to.” I raised my hand, and I got assigned to the Fire Control Division, which is quite technical. And so, I spent nine months in the Fire Control Division as a Fire Control-man, striker, they called them. I was a seaman first class. Off we went through the Panama Canal and into the South Pacific. And, I entered a new part of my life, because here I was a crew member on a battleship in the South Pacific in 1943, when things were not going very well down there. There I was, a vital crew member on this ship. My battle station was down in the bowels of the ship, working with a computer. There was twin 5-inch mounts, and there were two of them manned by… They had the director up topside, and there is a room, a rotating room where you had the optics. You could look in the magnifying optics and see the airplanes, and so forth. And, down in the plotting room, where I was, we had a computer, which was all vacuum tubes. Hotter than Hell down there. And the guys with the optics up topside were feeding us information by phone. And I, you know, I had earphones on me, and I was listening to them telling me these facts, and I’m cranking data into the computer. So that was what I did when we were being attacked. Joshua Bell: And what did the computer compute? Dwight Smith: Damned if I know. Oh, how to aim those twin 5-inch guns. Joshua Bell: There you go. Dwight Smith: In other words, they feed in the temperature, and the humidity, and wind direction, and all these factors, so that when you pull the trigger on the gun, topside, you’re going to hit the target, because we entered all this data. Hopefully, you were going to hit the target that’s moving very swiftly. Joshua Bell: And what were…? Were the 5-inch guns anti-aircraft? Dwight Smith: Yes. Joshua Bell: Yeah. Okay. Dwight Smith: And they were bilingual, they were anti-aircraft and they could also do other ship-to-ship things. When I was out there, it was for anti-aircraft. Joshua Bell: Were there other people in the Fire Control room with you? Dwight Smith: Oh, yes. It was crowded. We had lots of guys doing the same thing for other guns. I had one…two sets of twin 5-inch guns that I was directing, helping to direct. And the ship had ten of these twin 5-inch gun facilities. Ten of them, I think. And then the ship also had nine 16-inch guns, which were not used for anti-aircraft but for shore bombardments, and they had their own plotting room. And it was noisy. I could hear things down there, and feel things down there, but I never saw anything really, during my battle station. But, the rest of the cruise, I was topside on one of those 5-inch directors, which are a piece of armor-plated machinery that has the optical finders up there. And my day, every 8-hour day, night, day or night, I was assigned to man one of those facilities. But, actually, when the battle station was called, you know, you got to go get to your battle station, I dropped from that site down into the bowels of the ship, where my battle station was. So, it means that I spent my work time, eight hours a day, sitting on top of that gun director topside, reading my manual on how to become an excellent Fire Control-man, and looking out over the Pacific Ocean, and there’s a… You look out from where my seat was… We were guarding primarily aircraft carriers. There were also cruisers out there, and destroyers, and destroyer escorts, and hundreds of ships, as far as the eye can see. There was… Well, it was entertaining, if nothing else. But, it was scary at times, because you were guiding these aircraft carriers, and you see these airplanes being launched off the carriers, and landing on the carriers, and some of them missing. They… All over the drink is dead, and that was, kind of, sad. But, nonetheless, we were doing a very, very… A very special phase of our battleship’s life was to protect, with our anti-aircraft guns, to protect those aircraft carriers. And the other thing we did while we were in the South Pacific, go to these little islands, offshore, those little Japanese-held islands. And with our 16-inch guns, we would fire 16- inch armor at the islands, just trying to blow up the Japanese quarters, or whatever, before our troops landed. In other words, our duty with those 16-inch guns, was to soften up the islands before our people landed on them. And that was a… That was interesting, and I was down, again, in the plotting room for that, because that’s where my battle station was, and we were at battle standards when we were bombarding these islands. So, that was the only…really part of the World War II that I really felt I’d done something. Joshua Bell: Mm-mmm. You mentioned that you have several battle stars. Dwight Smith: Four. Joshua Bell: Four. Which battles? Dwight Smith: Well, it says so on my… Just a minute, I’m going to let you [unintelligible 00:24:19] exactly. And I’m going to be sending you some of these documentations. Joshua Bell: Oh, that will be great. Dwight Smith: Okay. First history of the battleship... While I was aboard the ship. It departed Norfolk, August 21, 1943, and I departed from it in May of 1944 to come back to the college training program. In between… After I got onboard, we went through the Panama Canal, and we stopped at Pearl Harbor, and finally arrived at Havana Harbor at [unintelligible 00:25:27] Island in the New Hebrides Islands. And we went island hopping. Fiji Islands had started new campaign of island hopping. The next offensive for the Japanese included the South Dakota began with the attack and liberation of the vast Gilbert and Marshall Islands. Starting in November of ’43. Specific targets of the Marshall Islands include Kwajalein Atoll, Roi, R-O-I, Taromaaoelap T-A-R-O-A-M-A-O-E-L-A-P, and when that operation was secured, we steamed out to bombard the island of Namur, after which she escorted the carrier, Bunker Hill, back to Efate in the New Hebrides. Now that’s the balance of 1943. And in ’44, I’m on the ship until May. We were screening carriers. Then she took part in the mid-February upon the primary Japanese forward anchorage of Truk. It had devastating results for the Japanese Navy. The South Dakota would continue carrier screening duties during the raids on the Marianas, with strikes upon Tinian, Saipan, and Guam, and returned to Majuro by the end of February of ’44. In March of “44, we went on to the Caroline Islands of Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Walea. The battleship returned briefly to Majuro to resupply, and then departed to cover air strikes against various airfield targets, to cover U.S. troop landings on the Hollandia and along the points of the New Guinea coast. Later April, the South Dakota participated in a second strike upon the Japanese base at Truk. In May of ’44, the South Dakota was back in Majuro on the Marshall Islands for minor refits and to prepare for the invasion of the Mariana Islands. At Majuro, Dwight Smith left the South Dakota, and boarded the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Princeton for passage to Pearl Harbor, and the first leg of his journey back to the U.S.A. and the V-12 College Training Program. So that’s where I was. Joshua Bell: Excellent. You mentioned the V-12 program. What was your living situation like? Dwight Smith: It was at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and we V-12 all were in uniform, and we had college dorm rooms. I had three roommates. There were four of us in a two-bed… Normally, in peacetime, just a two-bed room. Put two double bunks in the room, and so there were four of us living in the room in the college, one of the college dormitories. And… Joshua Bell: You must have got up to some sort of antics. Dwight Smith: Well, it was a little bit cramped, but the other three guys and I got along very well. But I miss… In that entire battalion of V-12 students at Dartmouth College, everyone except me, is either right out of high school or college, directly into the V-12 Program wearing Navy uniforms, but this was their first Navy experience. I was the only one in the whole group that had four battle scars already. Joshua Bell: You were the old man. Dwight Smith: Yeah. I was the only one that had been to sea. I was the only one who was a seaman first class. Think about that. I mean, my God. Well, I have a picture I’m going to send you. It shows the whole battalion come to one dormitory, anyway. About a hundred marching across the green at Dartmouth College. And there, leading the pack, is one guy who was really there, and I’m second of line, carrying the flag. The rest of them are eight abreast, marching. And I was standing in front of this…parading in front of this group, holding the flag, and one of my roommates was appointed to be the boss. I mean, it’s just amazing to me. Joshua Bell: So, what did you do with your spare time, or did you have spare time, I guess would be a better question? Dwight Smith: Yes, we were college students, and we had weekends off. We didn’t have summer vacation, but we had weekends off. Let’s see, I had that car that was up on blocks when I got discharged. I had the car down at the V-12. And my home was 40 miles away. And my roommates and I would go down to Northampton, Massachusetts on one of our weekends to see the girls down at Smith College. And we’d go up to Montreal. We did real college-type stuff on the weekends. But we were in uniform, and we had to take certain courses. But we were also free to take elective courses, as well. And we were in uniform at all times. We were in the Navy. Joshua Bell: Did you find the program of study rigorous? Dwight Smith: Yes. We had… We all had to take… What’s the word? Physics I. That was where we met at a big amphitheater, and one professor is, you know, lecturing to about 50 of us, or so, in the room. And his name was Dr. Merch. And we finally began calling it, this class, Merch’s Mystery Hour, because Physics I, for most of us, was totally a different world. But we got through it okay. I got my diploma for my two semesters at Dartmouth College. Joshua Bell: So you finished the program? Dwight Smith: Yes, the V-12 Program. Joshua Bell: You finished the V-12 Program. Excellent. Dwight Smith: But that was… I had already had two years of junior college, which counted towards my full college. So, this is my third year of college. And then when the V-12 Program for us ended, I was assigned to a 90-day wonder school down in New York Maritime Academy at Fort Schuyler in the Bronx, New York. And that’s where you’re supposed to come out of that class as an ensign. Well, I was… It was a very, very intense course. Believe me, you were gone… I mean, there was hours of drilling, and classes, and studies, and, you know, like, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm. It was grueling. Well, I was doing okay for the first 30 days, when I came down with German measles. Now, I don’t know why I came down with German measles. I don’t know why they put me in a Navy hospital with German measles, but I was sent to a Navy hospital for… I think I was there for a week. And, of course, this was a very intense course. You lose a week, you’ve lost it. So, I came back to Fort Schuyler, the Navy nautical school, and found my name on the bulletin board as being no longer part of this class, along with several others who probably failed physically, mentally, I mean - They probably failed not because of German measles, but they failed because of the scholastic abilities. Joshua Bell: Did that ever happen in the V-12 Program where people were dropped out at Dartmouth? Dwight Smith: Yeah. This was… Yes. No, not the V-12 Program. I think most… Well, there could have been. I know, because we were…got a certificate that we had fulfilled out course requirements at the V-12. But this was the midshipman’s school… Joshua Bell: Right. Dwight Smith: … The 90-day wonder school, and I lasted 30 days. So, we were around the East Coast, so they sent me to Chicago, my next place in the Navy. And, let’s backtrack a little bit on this story, because I’ve told you earlier that I was a passenger on the U.S.S. Princeton from Majuro when I was on the South Dakota to… Joshua Bell: Oh, yes, yes. And it was… And then the Princeton was sunk. Dwight Smith: Yes. Joshua Bell: And you were issued new bedding. Dwight Smith: Yes. This was in Chicago after I… Yes. I left my bedding on the Princeton, and I got into the huge bedroom out at Great Lakes, Illinois. Great Lakes Naval Base. I see the bunks with no bedding on them. And I went up to the boatswain in charge. You know, they’re old time, longtime, tough old Navy men. And I said, “Sir, I don’t have any bedding.” “Why the hell don’t you?” That’s when I told him it went down with the Princeton. He threw his arms around me, he says, “Okay, fella. I’ll get you some bedding.” I didn’t lie. Joshua Bell: You didn’t lie. Dwight Smith: No, I didn’t lie. Joshua Bell: You didn’t lie. I’m trying to think of other questions I can ask you, but I think we might have… The only other thing I can think to ask you is if you…if you recall any of the guys you were with, or any stories from your time in Dartmouth? Dwight Smith: Stories? I think I was - only when I had real stories to tell. [Unintelligible 00:36:46] the V-12 Program, because they were all just out of high school or freshman college. But… No, I… Now, I’ve done programs with the local World War II Historical Museum at Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and I’ve done a program with a couple of them at the Conway Historical Society telling my tale. And I just did it for the local men’s… Congregational Church men’s Friday breakfast. They have different speakers every Friday morning, and I gave them a program the other day. Some of the other veterans there were quite interested in my little tales. I never go into one of these and give a program on how I won the war. I go into what it was like from the eyes of an 18-year-old. Joshua Bell: Absolutely. Dwight Smith: That’s what I’ve been telling you, is what I saw of the Navy as through my mind and through my eyes. Joshua Bell: Well, I appreciate that very much, and on behalf of the Aleutian World War II National Historic Area, I really have to thank you for sharing your story with us, and we’ll absolutely make sure that, you know, we preserve it and share it with future generations. Because what your generation did is quite large and significant, and… Dwight Smith: I’m fully aware of that, and I’m always… I’m sadly now aware of the fact that there are very few of us World War II veterans still around. That is sad. But I did what I had to do, and I did it because I felt I wanted to. And, I wasn’t a hero, but I was there doing what I was…they asked me to do. And, I also think that the nearly everyone in the United States was behind us. That is something that hasn’t happened in any of the wars subsequent to that. That one was 100% backed by everyone in our country. Joshua Bell: It was. Dwight Smith: And I’m proud of what I was able to do. Other than my father who was torpedoed and sunk in 1942, I have had no family members involved in any military activities. And, if this is… If I’ve answered all your questions, I’d like to say I’m going to send you these pictures I promised, and also some of the fact sheets. [End of recorded material 00:39:47]",

            "transcript": "(sound effects: baby crying) This small addition to the Friends Meetinghouse was the “retiring room” or what many would call today, “the crying room.” Here, women could bring restless or hungry infants and avoid disturbing the congregation. Ruthie Tippin: (music) “Children came from the time they were born, and were introduced to meeting for worship right away – they were babes in arms. And as they came to meeting, they would sit with their mothers, on the women's side of the meeting house, and if they were crying or disturbing others, the mother would have taken them out to the nursery area. But by and large, they remained in the meeting room. When they got of a certain age the boys would move over to sit with their fathers, and brothers, and grandfathers on the men's side of the meeting. But they were instructed in the ways to behave simply by watching the folk around them, and they were taught that this was a time not to just sit, but to sit in silence – an expectant silence. And that's a very hard thing for a young, squirmy child to learn, but over time they began this understanding of waiting.” For Herbert Hoover, those times made a lasting impression on the future President. Herbert Hoover: (actor) “Those acquainted with the Quaker faith, and who know the primitive furnishings of the Quaker meetinghouse, the solemnity of the long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone, will know the intense repression upon a ten-year old boy who might not even count his toes. All this may not have been recreation, but it was strong training in patience.”",

            "transcript": "Exhibit 1 of 2 The exhibits are mounted on a large metal kiosk. There is a flat metal silhouette of traders and pack mules with small shrubs on top of the kiosk. Each panel is 48 inches wide and 36 inches high. Title: A Frequented Route. The exhibit has black and gray topographic line banners along the top and bottom. There is text on the upper section of the exhibit along with a photograph and a map. A large photograph shows a clear blue sky in the background with a sandstone hill with shrubs and cottonwood trees at its base in the foreground. The photo has been stylized to look like an oil painting. Primary Text: We know from rock art, Native American artifacts, and post-Old Spanish Trail evidence and journals, that this route was used for different purposes at different times. Even though there are few written records from the Old Spanish Trail period, we know from the historic accounts of explorers afterward that they were following the trail. The John W. Gunnison expedition of 1853 came through here, as did pioneers of the Elk Mountain Mission of 1854 who used this route to settle southeastern Utah. Eventually, it became an established wagon road between Castle Dale and Green River. Secondary Text: From Expeditions to Route 6 Eventually, this frequently used path became Route 6. Before then, other projects such as a railroad grade and a completed transmission line corridor left their mark on the land as well. AD: A black and white photograph shows a small ditch extending into the distance between two vertical walls of sandstone. There are small puddles of water and vegetation at the bottom of the ditch. Outside the ditch, the landscape is dry, and sagebrush is abundant. A partial view of a cottonwood tree can be seen to the left, and on the right, there is a sandstone cliff in the background. Caption: An unfinished railroad grade located further north. Map to the right of secondary text: AD: The map shows the four routes of the Old Spanish Trail across the Western United States, spanning from New Mexico to California. The different routes, the Northern Route, the Armijo Route, the Northern Branch, and the Mojave Road, converge and separate at various places along the trail. Along the trail, major cities are labeled. A red square indicates that you are on the Northern Route section in Central Utah. Caption: The Upper Cottonwood Wash Trail only represents a tiny portion of the path travelers and traders crossed as they navigated the Old Spanish Trail. This national historic trail spans 2,700 miles with four main routes, and, at one time, was the fastest way to get from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Los Angeles, California. Exhibit 2 of 2 The background of the exhibit consists of black and gray topographic lines with two thin red banners along the top and bottom. There is a large map that takes up much of the space, with two blocks of text to the right. Map: This is a map of the Upper Cottonwood Wash trail. The trail stretches northwest to southeast starting at the Cottonwood Canyon trailhead, continuing to the Upper Cottonwood Wash trailhead, and ending at the Mid Cottonwood Wash Trailhead. A ‘YOU ARE HERE’ placard indicates that the reader is at the Upper Cottonwood Wash trailhead. Along the trail, dots indicate the locations of historic inscriptions that have been written on the walls of the wash. Several dots have callouts with pictures of the inscription at the given location. Primary Text: Hike the Trail! Upper Cottonwood Wash takes you through a beautiful riparian area full of historic inscriptions and rock art. The trail begins on actual historic trail trace, allowing you to walk and experience the landscape as past travelers did. This trail is 5 miles long, moderately difficult, and undeveloped. Most sections have high sun exposure and are fairly level. Secondary Text: Respect and Protect • Travel responsibly • Respect the rights of others • Educate yourself • Avoid sensitive areas • Do your part For more information, visit treadlightly.org Protect cultural resources by staying on the trail. • Be Respectful • Do not touch the rock art or historic structures. Features for more information: Beneath the secondary text there are two blocks containing text and QR codes. Text block 1 with QR code: Learn more and plan trips to these sites. https://www.nps.gov/olsp/index.htm Text block 2 with QR code: Audio description available go.nps.gov/UpperCottonwoodWashTH Bottom Red Banner: Text Block 3 with QR code: Travel the trail with the Explorer app to go on a self-guiding adventure! Maps can be downloaded and used offline. A black silhouette is set to the right of the text block. It shows a man with a cowboy hat sitting on top of a pack mule, with two other mules behind him in line attached by ropes.",

            "transcript": "Stop 14. Chaos Crags Vista The stark domes of jagged rock before you are the aptly named Chaos Crags. These are lava domes, like Lassen Peak, and are some of the youngest volcanoes in this part of the park. Imagine being here 1,100 years ago and watching them slowly rise out of the ground. It would be an awesome sight as pasty lava oozed upward, accompanied by explosions of steam. The massive eruptions formed six lava domes which sat quietly steaming for centuries. Then, 700 years ago, one of the domes collapsed creating a violent high-speed rock avalanche that raced across what is now the park highway and part way up Table Mountain to your north. The rockfall dammed Manzanita Creek, forming Manzanita Lake. Since then, a dwarf forest has grown over the waves of broken rock. Their stunted size is a testimony to their resilience as they slowly reclaim the Chaos Jumbles. This jumbled landscape is evidence of the unstable nature of lava domes. In the 1970s, two scientists became concerned about the potential for future landslides in the Manzanita Lake area. To ensure visitor safety, the park closed its Manzanita Lake facilities. In the following decades, additional research helped scientists determine that while rockfall hazards were possible, it was unlikely that a future avalanche would reach the developed area. Scientists have been monitoring this area since the dramatic eruption of Lassen Peak in 1915. You can see the first seismic station in the stone building adjacent to the Loomis Museum. Today, staff at the Cascade Volcano Observatory watch for indicators of increased volcanic activity. Stop by the Loomis Museum or go online to view a real-time map of seismicity in the park. Scientists in Menlo Park, California are using the same information to monitor the earthquakes that continuously rock this region and remind us that this is indeed a restless land.",

            "transcript": "DESCRIBING: A black and white photograph of the Vancouver Barracks Spruce Mill. SYNOPSIS: A black and white photograph of the Vancouver Barracks Spruce Mill as it appeared in 1918. The mill complex includes a railroad line, industrial buildings, and rows of white canvas tents. Vancouver Barracks can be seen in the distance. The photograph has a label written on it that reads \"A Section of the World's Largest Spruce 'Cut-Up' Plant, Vancouver Barracks, Wash. 1918\" and a signature and logo for the photographer, Marcell. The weather appears foggy. IN-DEPTH DESCRIPTION: The photograph is panoramic. In the 10 to 11 o'clock position of the photograph, eight white two- and three-story buildings of Vancouver Barracks can be seen in the distance, with evergreen trees just barely visible behind. In the foreground is a block of 36 white canvas tents in three rows, bordered by paths made of wooden planks. The tents are square with partial walls and come to a tall peak in the center with a canvas doorway on one side, leading out to a wooden plank pathway. There are some simple, one-story wooden buildings among the tents. To the left of this block of tents, in the 10 o'clock position, is a tall, square, two-story building with a covered porch. A single tall evergreen tree nearby separates the block of tents from the more permanent buildings of Vancouver Barracks behind. In the 12 o'clock position is a long warehouse, painted white with a dark roof. It is positioned in the photograph at an angle, with one end and one side visible. The warehouse has small, square windows along its side and chimneys along the peak of its gabled roof. Six rows of white square canvas tents extend in rows at a 45 degree angle from the camera in sets of six tents per row. Among the tents are three long buildings with roofs made of wooden slats and small windows along their sides. These buildings are raised from the ground with wooden beams. Wooden pathways connect the tents and buildings to keep workers at the mill off of the muddy ground below. In the 1 o'clock position is a set of two railroad tracks with two trains sitting on them. A road runs along the left side of the railroad tracks. This road is lined by utility poles connected by power lines. A car driving on this road appears as a blur in this photograph. To the left of the railroad line are two cranes used for lifting cargo and stacks of wood and supplies. A railroad crossing can be seen along the lower edge of the photograph, with gates to stop traffic when trains pass. Beyond the railroad track are a row of white, long, industrial mill buildings with barn-style roofs. Five smokestacks rise out of these industrial buildings. Smoke or steam rises from the buildings beyond it. In the hazy background is a flat landscape and the Columbia River. In the 2 o'clock position, at the far right of the photograph, are a collection of one-story administrative buildings. CAPTION: Spruce Mill workers lived in tents beside the mill where they turned trees into lumber for planes. This push for wood in the first world war revolutionized the lumber industry.

In fact, some teachers found having a kid with a disability in their class objectionable. They were convinced– not the majority, but I had more than one teacher– that was convinced that I was going to require extra help, that my presence might be disruptive. One of my teachers early on was so upset that, because of me, the classroom didn’t get outdoors fast enough during a fire drill. So it wasn’t a nice welcome back. And the desks were challenging, stairs were challenging. The only accommodation I got, I was allowed to leave class five minutes before the end so that I had time to try and get to the next class because I was pretty vulnerable trying to walk in hallways with other kids rushing by.",

            "transcript": "DEANO: Aloha, I'm Ranger Dean and welcome to the podcast today. He's been respected and ridiculed, loved and loathed, revered and reviled. Yet, nearly 250 years after his death, he still evokes emotions in the hearts of many. I'm talking about the enigma that was Captain James Cook. The British explorer made three historic voyages that would forever change our perceptions of the planet. There is no doubt about his skills in seamanship, navigation and cartography or mapmaking, but it was his third and final voyage that would forever link his legacy to the islands of Hawaii. My guest today is well known local historian and tour guide Rob Kitsell. His well-researched programs attract a wide range of people seeking a deeper connection to our local landmarks, including Pu'uhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park, Puʻukoholā Heiau National Historic Site, and even the famous Saint Benedict's Painted Catholic Church of Hōnaunau. Welcome to our podcast studio Rob! It is so good to see you. I know you're a busy man so thanks for taking the time to talk with us. ROB: Well, thanks for inviting me, Dean, delighted to be here, and chat about Captain Cook, which we get a lot of questions on our tours. And there's a lot of interest in there. Australians seem to be particularly passionate about Captain Cook with their close connections with him. It's easy to criticize people when we look at the breadth of history and judging things by today's standards. DEANO: Okay, so I remember first meeting you several years ago, you were bringing people into Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, and I was struck by your depth of knowledge and the attention to detail as you've just shared, so I just wanted a little background on you. What brings an Englishman to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to help share these Hawaiian stories? ROB: Well, when I was a developer in Georgia Dean, I used to come over here in the winter and fell in love with the place immediately. To top all that in 2007, I met Jody here in Kona and which is my wife now, the rest is history. I decided that I would do private tours which really took off and now with the way things are, private tours really are, are the way to go. DEANO: Yeah, I know you get to spend time in some of these stories that maybe as rangers we don't always get that opportunity. We have very short contact with the public sometimes. So, before we get into details about Captain James Cook's third and final voyage, in the introduction, I mentioned that Cook made three historic voyages from England. And that first one started in August of 1768 on the HM Bark Endeavour, and I read he had a crew of nearly 100. What was he looking for on that first voyage? ROB: Well, he was looking for a couple of things, but the official cover provided to him by the Royal Navy, was he was going to look for the transit of Venus as it was in the southern hemisphere. What they managed to do is they got a team up of astronomers where they had to get to Tahiti, and it was Cook's mission to get them there. He also had some other interesting people who went with him, a botanist called Joseph Banks, who he became very, very close friends with so they achieved the mission to see Venus cover the sun. And the importance for this was, the British believed that they could calculate the distance the earth was from the sun, if they could use Venus as a datum point. That was their reason for doing it. And they got there in time, set up all the equipment and that part of the mission was a big success. And then they had, you know, Banks there with a few other botanists who got an amazing amount of sample on this trip that he did with Cook. And of course, then they were also looking for what they believed; and it was theory at the time, but they were looking for Terra Australis, and they believed the balance of the Earth would be upset if there wasn't a corresponding land mass that was like in the Northern Hemisphere. There wasn't a corresponding mass in the southern hemisphere. So that was the theory and they would like Cook to go and find it. DEANO: Yeah, I understand that he actually sailed all the way to the 40th parallel but finding no continent he turned west and then ended up circling and mapping New Zealand as two separate islands. I read on June 11, this would be 1770 of the first voyage, he slams into the Great Barrier Reef off Australia and he nearly loses the ship. How did they manage to save it? ROB: That's an interesting one there and I don't think they realized the enormity of the barrier reef and also, what happened with it was they were bailing the ship constantly, even the officers trying to save it. Cook then immediately had to take some drastic measures because he felt like that bailing the ship was not working. They ended up throwing some of the cannons overboard, but they jettisoned the cannons because they were trying to lose weight. They also threw lots of other things overboard. Then somebody else mentioned to Cook where the hole was pierced, they would put an old sail over it; they wedge this sail in and made it tighter. Now, this is where Cook was very fortunate in his choice of vessel which is known as a Whitby Cat. And it's called that because the vessel was made in Whitby very close to where Captain Cook was born. So, these Whitby Cats were flat bottomed and wide. Now the interesting thing about that was unlike a regular ship, if you run it up on a beach, it would roll over sideways. With these cats being flat bottom, after they'd managed to facilitate somewhat of a repair, they were able then to land it on a beach and made more concrete repairs because they were still a very long way from home. DEAN: And then, even with this, because even after this near catastrophe, Cook agrees to captain a second voyage, and this time he searches even further for this mysterious, Great Southern continent. What happens on the second voyage? ROB: They decided that they would get a little bit safer on the second book voyage, and they would have two ships, as opposed to just one ship. The idea being, if one ran aground like he did with the Endeavor, the other ship would be able to rescue with his, with the second expedition, they wanted to go further. And they felt like they could find this Great Southern continent, he had some criticism going on from various people. Alexander Dalrymple, really an arch nemesis of Cook, this man had been denied going on the mission with Cook. He thought the Royal Navy should allow him to go and try and find the Great Southern continent because it was like one of his big theory. When they put Cook in command, it made him very upset. So, after the first mission, Dalrymple was very critical of Captain Cook. Hence, the second mission went ahead, and Cook was determined that he would map everything, go further than any man before. And that's where he got very, very close to Antarctica. But you have to realize the type of equipment they had back then must have been very, very perilous indeed. You got to realize these ships were only about 100 feet long, you know, the conditions must have been horrific. The men were very, very hardy, referred to by the likes of the hierarchy and Cook himself as “The People.” DEANO: It's an amazing story. And those seas in that area are incredibly difficult even by modern ship standards. So, you're right, using the equipment they had, it's phenomenal. And that brings us up to his third and final voyage. I know he departs England in 1776, when he's 47 years old, and he's out on this third trip. Tell us about the two ships he uses this time. ROB: Well, he goes back to the faithful Whitbys. Again, they have been changed with the rigging. Traditionally, they had light rigging. Cook had them created with heavier rigging so they could take larger sails. But this is where the problem comes in. When he agreed to do this, he was basically hanging out with really high rollers and people like the Earl of Sandwich who was actually bankrolling this expedition. Hugh Pallister, who was the, he was a big proponent of Captain Cook. Basically, Pallister and the Earl of Sandwich took Cook to this third mission. Now Cook was still writing memoirs and books and doing other deals from his second voyage. Now in his previous voyages, he had been all over Deptford. Deptford was the British military industrial complex shipyard set up actually all the way back by Henry the Eighth. Unfortunately, Deptford, if they were not monitored would be very slapdash, to turn a phrase, in their work. Initially, with his earlier voyages, Cook spent hours and hours at Deptford making sure the work was done to his satisfaction including even making sure all the caulking was correct on these vessels. The rigging was all correct. On this one, Cook apparently did not have the same attention for detail and I think this is where, like in many things in life, it isn't one thing that catches you out, it's a number of things. And I think it's important to point out Cook, not having the same attention to detail as he had in the past, really ended up biting him in the end and was one of the key reasons why he ended up coming back to Kealakekua Bay. DEANO: Yeah, let's… we're gonna get into that. So, these two…well, for lack of a better term, these two working vessels are the HMS Resolution and the HMS Discovery. So officially, what was the purpose of the third voyage? ROB: Well, the third voyage, this was the other reason why Cook, in the meeting with Pallister and the Earl of Sandwich. If Cook could find what they believed was a Northwest Passage to connect the Atlantic to the Pacific and facilitate trade between England and through to China. And it could obviously create massive trade routes for them. DEANO: Yeah, I think that's what a lot of people don't realize is today, we have the, you know, the benefit of viewing the world as we view it. But at Cooks time, people didn't really have that, and that Northwest Passage would have connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the top. I think it's January 18, 1778. Cook happens upon the Hawaiian Islands. He's not really searching for them. He just comes upon them and he anchors in the mouth of the Waimea river over on Kauai’s west side on January 20. And then I understand he brings gifts with him of three goats, two English pigs, and I read the seeds of melons, pumpkins and onions. The Hawaiians in turn, and this is interesting, I was reading the journals, the Hawaiians offered Cook and his crew, “the skins of bright red ʻIʻiwi birds”, and they record that they were “tied up in bunches of 20 or more.” ROB: Very high honor that. And you know, because they obviously were giving him same respect as high chiefs. DEANO: Yeah, we should point out that these feathers would be extremely valuable. So yeah, that's… that's a great insight. ROB: Well, he was very intrigued to see these islands and was very shocked to…to find them, because obviously, he was a student of history. He knew that Magellan had gone across the Pacific some 200 years before, and there's no mention of these islands anywhere. And then all of a sudden, he's heading from Tahiti, up to what is now Alaska and Canada's West Coast and he ends up bumping into Niʻihau, and Kauai. So, he meets the people there, he didn't spend an amazing amount of time there due to the fact that he was really thinking about this Northwest Passage. So, he did take on supplies, but of course, he mapped where they were. I think he considered this in the back of his mind, a great asset in the fact that he could winter here and then go back to the Northwest Passage. Because I think he did believe it may take some finding for them to do, and of course, a very short season up there, where they could map and work their way through there. So, Cook could make 20,000 pounds, which 20,000 pounds back then probably somewhere near 50, 60 million now. DEANO: I think those maps that he was making where he has the Hawaiian Islands, by the way, I should point out Cook was actually phenomenal mapmaker. Some of his maps he made were still in use right up into the mid-20th century, which is it's just phenomenal. But those maps would play a crucial role in Hawaii's history after Cook's death. So, he leaves the Hawaiian Islands and he's resupplied. He sails north in search of this famous Northwest Passage that would have provided this direct route. But I understand that the ridiculously horrible seas and weather, he has a near mutiny on his hands, and he has to turn back. ROB: Also, they were very fortunate with the massive tides they get in Alaska where it can change 20 feet within hours, you know, when they went in these inlets, you realize these guys are on the sailing ships. They're not very maneuverable, and especially when you're in mountainous terrain in an inlet, and then the tide changes on you. And also, massive changes of current. That, and the very bad weather, really caused the problem and they did run aground. A lot of the men had had enough. I think they could feel like they were all going to get killed. The areas they were going, and Cook was quickly finding out all these inlets - they didn't go anywhere. They weren't going through to the Atlantic, it just wasn't happening. Of course, people also have to realize that Cook had the ability to do longitude and latitude because of Harrison's chronometer. That's what's not really talked about. This is how he was able to do such precise maps. Because when John Harrison, who was commissioned by the Royal Navy to create this chronometer, also paid a great deal of money to do so. He was able to tell what time it was in Greenwich, hence we had GMT. So, this very reliable ships clock, Harrison's chronometer, could tell Cook where he could transpose with his other equipment, you know, sextants and compasses, exactly where they were. And obviously, they could tell also how far they were from the Atlantic when they're up there. And they could tell they're in this inlet and they're over 2000 miles away. Deano: So, Cook does sail back to Hawaii. He now knows where it is, and his plans are to overwinter in warmer weather, but he doesn't come back to the same spot. This has been almost a year since he visited the islands. Where did he land this time? Rob: That was another issue that he had with his men. He was mapping the island. You've got to realize he came back here in the winter, and we get these very large swells. So, he mapped the Big Island, and he mapped part of Maui, and he was looking for an area where he could have a safe harbor. For those people who are very familiar with Kealakekua Bay. It is one of the most protected areas in all of Hawaii. And that is because it's protected by not only Mauna Loa and Maunakea from the trade winds, but also by Hualālai, lots of protection for ships like this. So, Cook after going round, basically mapping the Big Island. He decides that finally he'll come into Kealakekua Bay and they were very keen after all this time to get on land. Just experience lots of fresh food which, in the meantime, trading with locals, locals would come up, offer them fruit, pork and other things. A lot of the men on these ships also were very interested in having some sort of relationship with the local women. Deano: Yes, the beauty of Polynesian women is just legendary. You can see how it was recorded. So, I can only imagine what this first contact was like. So, he does anchor in Kealakekua Bay on January 17, but he anchors during these Makahiki celebrations. And I understand he actually welcomes aboard Kalaniʻōpuʻu who is the aliʻi nui of Hawaii, a very respected chief and the two men even exchange gifts, right? Cook offers this English steel dagger and then Kalaniʻōpuʻu presents Cook with an ʻAhu ʻula, which we should point out is a feathered cloak, and a brightly colored mahiole, which is a feathered ceremonial helmet. What was the significance of these gifts? Rob: The people actually were in belief they, being in Makahiki, they believed Lono would come and visit them. Cook shows up in the ships, obviously he has this uniform on, and it's like a prophecy. They treated him, some people I believe, on the side of the aliʻi , was somewhat skeptical that this was not Lono. But enough people were in belief that it was Lono. Now they decided to bestow these honors of him which would be that of the highest aliʻi with the feathered cape and the helmet. And I do believe Dean that these were returned eventually to Hawaii in 2016. I know they obviously went back to England, and then they were in a museum in…in New Zealand. And then somehow the Bishop Museum I believe, and Hawaiian Airlines were even involved where they able to retrieve these and now they're, I believe at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu? Is that correct? Deano: Yes, I believe so. And that's and that's a really fascinating story, because it makes this history so real and so and so tangible, that you know how these two great men facing each other, what happened. Then he leaves Hawaii once again after this relatively pleasant exchange, this initial time. Some accounts I read said he left on February 4, and others say he didn't leave until the sixth, but he is only out at sea for a week. What happened? Deano: Well, I think we need to go back to a couple of other things. Just briefly, first of what happened. Obviously, the people that had seen the British, and had seen the technology they had - cannons, the guns, various other aspects and of course they were very amazed by certain things. Why they wanted iron work, they wanted metal objects. They wanted them I think to make their life easier, also to maybe fashion weapons. Now they thought he could possibly be Lono, but a couple of incidents happen. And one of the big ones was when Seaman Walkman died. When you think somebody is like godlike or some form of you know, is immortal, and then you see them die just like your people die, maybe the luster is wearing off. Also, I think the other thing that's important to bring to people's notion here. The Hawaiians are incredibly generous with the amount of food and provisions that they were giving the British on this visit here. Even though they were giving them massive amounts, they still appear to want more. So, I think after a certain amount of time, they're probably looking at their depleted reserves themselves probably thinking these people are somewhat selfish. After the three-week initial, shall we say love fest that they had together, the British seem to have a problem with the Hawaiians taking what they wanted off their vessel. So, there was some theft issues of tools and various other things which created a friction. And I think that built up to this and then of course, Cook realized he was quickly wearing out his welcome at Kealakekua Bay. But he wasn't ready to head back up to find the Northwest Passage again because don't forget, we're still in the winter. I think he was… his thoughts were to try and find an equivocal place in Maui and hang out there for a while before he wore out their welcome in the area. I think somewhere probably not far from Waikoloa; “Waikablowa” as is known here. That's where their mast failed, you know, could that be because of Deptford and the military industrial complex’s bad work in England? I think very possibly it could. And that came back to bite Cook because that's when he turned around, went back to Kealakekua Bay. Deano: But it's a very different reception now. Right, because he's like you said, they'd sort of over, they've worn out their welcome. Rob: They have. Kalaniʻōpuʻu was not pleased to see them. There was no welcoming committee for them or anything. He did agree, after speaking to Cook, to provide a few people to help cut down a tree. Shall we say things, there was definitely friction there. A number of people's diaries and men on the ship said there was a very, very different atmosphere when they re-entered Kealakekua Bay, I believe on February the 11th. Deano: Absolutely. Rob: When they got back. Deano: Yeah, February 11. So, and I know for listeners, many people are listening to this podcast just to get to this point. I think we're gonna do this as diplomatically as possible because this brings us to February 14, 1779, and that is a painful day of remembrance for all involved. Fortunately for historians, there were numerous eyewitnesses and multiple firsthand accounts recorded to what happened. And while those small details differ, the general unfolding of events is the same. So, what touched off the unfortunate events of specifically February 14, Deano: Well, the British had been somewhat slack in security. So, they had these skiffs, these rowing boats, that they would come ashore on. One of them was stolen. He told his other men; we have to get this skiff back. And he went in, made the mistake of not really understanding the system these people lived under, and that is the system of the kapu. Now a lot of people don't realize this, but the kapu system was if you offended the Chief, you offended the god. Now, people were not meant to cast a shadow on the Chief. They were not meant to stare at them in the eyes. The very ground the Chief walked on, carried their mana. So, Captain Cook, he's furious that he's lost this rowboat. He thinks that, well in a European way of doing things, Kalaniʻōpuʻu is responsible. So, he's going to go there and kidnap him and take him hostage until the rest of the Hawaiians come back with his boat. Well, this is where it all goes terribly wrong. He goes up to Kalaniʻōpuʻu’s house and he says he wants him to come with him. Well, the other Chiefs, some other aliʻi, he and his wife say no, no, he's not going with you and his wife thinks that the British might potentially want to kill him. So, the other aliʻi, they hold on to him and say he's not going with you. Kalaniʻōpuʻu ends up sitting down and it seems evident to Cook, this is not working out very well. Then I believe it gets worse because word comes in that the British have shot another aliʻi out in Kealakekua Bay. This tends to enrage them, and it starts going downhill from there Dean. Deano: Yeah, I should point out that worldwide at various universities, they still study these events as examples of first contact, cultural differences and the failure of diplomacy. When two cultures that do not understand each other collide. And this is really an example of that when you see how Cook’s strategy was so poorly thought out. And when you see what he was trying to achieve. Also Cook, I was reading accounts, he had a legendary short temper - very much so. So, he wouldn't be exactly the diplomat you would be wanting to send out. So, I understand he took four Marines with him and during this altercation, what happens? Rob: He has the Marines with him. I believe there was a backup vessel as well with other Marines on and of course, they have guns, but we're talking about Revolutionary War day weapons. He's surrounded by a large amount of Hawaiian warriors, aliʻi, etc, who were very perplexed about what's going on there. Unfortunately, things turn for the worst. One of the British Marines opens fire on someone that causes the incident. Also, one of the other chiefs starts coming up to Cook and prodding him, actually with one of the daggers that was gifted to them. So, Cook is not liking being prodded with a…with a dagger. So, he uses a pistol that he has with him and fires; well he's firing birdshot. And some people say he had a shield, some people say he was wearing something else. Anyway, it doesn't have any effect. I think more people are closing in on Cook. And he's getting prodded a bit more and he's feeling people closing in on him. So, he fires a second shot that hits one of the people approaching him, not the man who was prodding him by the way, and he hits him and kills him. Then it becomes too much. Apparently Cook then starts to wave at the other vessel. Some accounts say he was waving it off and trying to de-escalate things, other people have an explanation that he was trying to tell them to open fire. I don't think any of us really can honestly say we know, but what did happen was as Cook had his back turned, he was stabbed, then clubbed on the head, and then he went down. Now we have to realize another couple of things about Captain Cook. Even though he's a great seafarer, the man could not swim. So even though he was like, stuck there very close to the ocean, he wasn't going to be swimming himself. Of course, the other Marines had opened fire. But these four Marines were killed with Cook. I believe 15 Hawaiian warriors were killed and may have been possibly more casualties because the British opened fire with cannon as well. Deano: That it … it's just so strange today. Looking back on these horrible events Rob, and I see these events today trivialized on T-shirts and websites usually accompanied by some sort of inaccurate statement. This was no victorious battle for anyone, not only did Cook and his men die, but like you mentioned, many, many Hawaiians died as well. It was a horrible day for all involved. When I visit the cook Memorial at Kealakekua Bay, I feel a tremendous sense of sadness. It's a somber place. It's not just a memorial for Cook, it's really a memorial for all those that lost their lives that day and the days that would follow. I wanted to get to this point in our interview today and that is, tell us a little bit about the aftermath of these events. How did these amazing two great seafaring nations and monarchies, how did they move past these events, and eventually not only became good friends but close allies? And we see that later on in Hawaii's history. Rob: We do, and I think what happened is there's a number of people who were with Cook that really saw the potential here. After two days standoff, some of Cookʻs remains were rowed out by canoe and handed over, as whether you would call it, a peace conciliation. Anyway they did receive some of Cook's body and the British were able to give him a burial in Kealakekua Bay, where they formed a coffin, put his remains in it and some cannonballs and as a conciliation with the service they did, they actually had the Hawaiians agree to clear the bay. So, the only people were there with the service onboard ship, were the British. I think that was the sign of some healing. Right then and there, two days after these very sad events. You know, that brings us then to obviously, Cookʻs maps, then led lots of other people here, including people like George Vancouver, who came over, bearing gifts and formed a very profitable relationship for him and Kamehameha. Deano: It's just an amazing, amazing story. And that is all the time we have for today. But I really want to thank our guest, local historian and guide Rob Kitsell. You can tell just from this interview that that's what has made him a highly sought-after guide is that depth of knowledge to get the background of the stories. If you are planning on visiting the island of Hawaii, I would encourage you to please take time to visit beautiful Kealakekua Bay and the Captain Cook Memorial. It's a great way to remember these events and to heal and move forward. It's Hawaiian history and it's well worth remembering. Thank you so much for coming out Rob. Rob: You're most welcome, Dean.",

            "transcript": "Sue: Um, what, what interested you about running the Hope Race in the very beginning? Kate: I’d always wanted to see what it was like on the other side, for years and years — really ever since I came to Alaska — and I never dreamed it would be possible. And I guess it must have been in, uh, when was it that I first heard about it … It was first advertised as being this very exclusive event, and only the winners, winners of the Quest and Iditarod were going to be invited. It must have been in um, maybe, maybe in the fall of ’89. And I’d run the Quest twice and had finished sixth and fifth, and I really thought that I could maybe win the Quest. And the reason I wanted so much to win the Quest was to get an invitation to participate in the Hope Race! I mean, I wanted to win it anyway, [laughter] but um when I didn’t win it, it wasn’t so much that I was really disappointed about not winning, it was that I thought I’d lost a chance to participate in this Hope Race. And then, um, sometime after, I guess it was the next fall, it would have been the fall of ’90, um, I got a call um from Nancy Wright who was helping to organize the first race, and she asked if I’d be interested in participating, and it just made my day, it was just one of the most exciting things that had ever happened. And, um, and it was just amazing to me that more mushers weren’t interested in going. But when, and when the racing crowd found out that I was planning to go, um, gosh, everyone was so skeptical about it, and they said, “Oh, I … they’re gonna turn your dogs into hats, you’ll never get out of there with your dogs – unless you have $40,000 to pay your way out, don’t dare go!” [laugh] Sue: Really! Kate: Yeah, there was just, um, really a lot of skepticism about it being a safe thing to do. And feelings that if I wasn’t jeopardizing my own safety, then at least I was jeopardizing the safety of my dogs. But I don’t know, maybe [laugh] maybe I’m foolish, I don’t know – it never even, it just never even would have occurred to me to have those concerns, it just didn’t worry me, at all. I mean it was just too grand of an adventure to turn my back on then. Sue: Yeah. I felt the same way when I had the offer to go. You had to — I mean I did sleep in my sled with all my dogs tied to it one night, with a shotgun in my lap — in Lorena. Because that was the town where these drunks were trying to get at our dogs. I mean it really was true, but, no I — Kate: Maybe it was the rumors from, from that trip of yours that, that prompted people to, to have these concerns … Sue: Well, it is a consideration. I mean, it was a consideration, it remains a consideration – that you still meet people who will tell you on this trip, oh yeah, I had a dog team but somebody killed them for their coats. So it did happen and it still does happen. But there’s ways, you know, to prevent it and prepare for it. [laugh] Kate: Yeah, they probably wouldn’t be interested in our short-haired American dogs for fur coats! Sue: I should show you a slide of mine cuz, mine weren’t so short-haired. I didn’t have racing dogs, you know, I had just more traveling dogs, and a few of them had, you know, some nice coats on them. And all of our dogs are clean. Whereas theirs have been rolling around in coal soot. And I have this one picture, this real idiot dog of mine with this lustrous coat, sitting there on my dogs sled, just smiling away, and this guy standing next to him, petting it, with, with this great big dog hair hat on! [laughter] [phone rings] Kate: And the weather was terrible when we got there, and we waited there for, for about a week, and none of us really knew whether those helicopters were going to materialize or not! [laughter] And, and it, it was, it was really quite moving when they finally did come whopping out of the fog. I mean it still wasn’t great weather, but when they really did show up in Wales, it was, it was just grand. Sue: Did a cheer go up and everyone – Kate: Oh yeah, oh yeah, and everyone—I mean the houses in Wales just emptied out. Everybody, you know, came out to watch these things land. And they are such huge machines. They’re very impressive. It took two trips to get us all over there. And then they just shove you inside the helicopters. Nothing is tied down, there are no seats, let alone seatbelts [laughter]. Sue: And there’s fuel tanks strapped in there on the side [laughter] Kate: And these hydraulic lines, you know, just exposed, and people tying their dogs off to the lines and [laughter]. Yeah, safety doesn’t have a high priority. [laugh] And safety precautions. Sue: Did some, other than Nicolai Ettynye, who’d won Iditarod, did any Russian mushers come over to start the race, or was that not till the next year? Kate: Not until the next year. And then there was, there was that fellow Sasha, who had run the Iditarod, who was supposed to have participated, but for some reason he did not. And I’m kinda hazy, there was some controversy surrounding his decision not to participate. Sue: Oh. He was a, a, a white Russian? Kate: Yeah. Sue: Something to do with the sports committee? Kate: Yeah. Sue: Well what was your reception like when you got off the helicopters in Uelen? Kate: [Laugh.] That actually was amazing. The whole town was out on the ice to welcome us. And, um, you know, we’d had no idea, of course, what to expect when we got there, and what accommodations would be made for us and for the dogs. And there was a lot of snow that year, um, out on the ice, in front of town, where the dogs were to be parked. And they had shoveled by hand these trenches for the dogs, and each team had its own trench where it was protected, um, you know all this done by hand, and it was just this huge maze of lanes, cuz there weren’t only our teams but there were all these Russian teams that were waiting there to join us. Um, and it was very well set up that we stayed in the school, and they had, um, guards that were stationed all night to watch over the teams, and it was lighted, there were spotlights that shined down on this compound, with these guards, watching everything, and all of our …. Sue: The Russians had a lot of stake that nobody’s race dogs became hats! Kate: Right, right! [laughter] And that was the case in a number of the villages. Not all of them had such protected surroundings for the dogs, but they certainly did there. And then, also we worried a lot about whether we were really going to find our supplies and food drops at all these villages, and there was not I think a thing missing anywhere. Kate: Um, actually, after we left Provideniya, it was our first day out of Provideniya, I was ahead of everybody else, following the trail breaker who had a sled upon which the cinematographer was riding. And the trail wasn’t marked, so I was relying on following their distinctive snowmachine track to know where to go. And they took a wrong turn, and they ended up going a long ways from the trail where we were supposed to go, and I followed them off, way up a valley to a reindeer herding camp. And it wasn’t until the end of the day that they realized that they had gone the wrong way, I mean it was dark when they finally stopped at this reindeer camp. Neither of them spoke a word of English. [laughter] Sue: Were the other mushers following — Kate: No. No. Um, after I had taken the wrong turn, the vizdahode that had carried the race officials had passed all the other mushers, and that driver knew the correct way to go. And everyone else had then followed the vizdahode driver and arrived at the next, um, camp, which was, um, it wasn’t a village that night, it was one of the few places where, um, where we stayed at an, um, I think it was a weather observation station on the, the shore of a large lake. And so everyone else arrived that night, and I wasn’t there. And they were just beside themselves with worry because the trailbreaker and this, the, um, filmmaker and I never showed up. Sue: Oh gee. Kate: But they figured out, well, she just took a wrong turn. And then, the next day, the helicopter from Provideniya arrived at that camp and told them about what had happened with the people who had gotten into our food-drop bags and drank the Heet. And died. And … the race officials and participants in the race were afraid that my disappearance had something to do with this incident that had occurred in Provideniya. They thought perhaps I had been taken back to Provideniya and was being held because these people had died. And the helicopter also was not willing to go and search for us. So meanwhile, I was at this camp with these two guys that didn’t speak English, and I realized, I mean, I had some sort of general idea from looking at a map that we were not where we were supposed to be, and they made it clear to me that we had gone the wrong direction. Sue: Were there reindeer herders out at — Kate: No, there was no one else there. Sue: Just an empty camp. Kate: A nice, nice cabin. Sue: Oh cabin, not one of the yurongas. Kate: No. No, it was a corral, and there was actually a cabin there. And then the next morning, it was really windy — I mean so windy that you just could not even stand up. And to get there we’d traveled along a river with a lot of overflow and it was just glare ice, and so there was just no possibility of backtracking. And, and at one point that next morning, the trailbreaker and the filmer got into this heated argument and they grabbed each other by the lapels and they were just red in the face, just screaming and shaking each other, and I was scared to death cuz I thought they were going to kill each other or at least get into a bloody fight! And then, they just like dropped it, and patted each other on the back, and everything was OK! [laughter] And I never really did know exactly what they were arguing about. But I sorta suspect that it was the filmmaker giving the trailbreaker a hard time for having gone the wrong direction. But I don’t, I don’t exactly know … Sue: So when did you finally get out of there? Kate: And so then late that afternoon, the wind died down enough that we back-tracked and found the place where we had gone wrong, and then followed the vizdahode and dog team tracks, um, towards the, the place where we were supposed to go, and we were met about halfway by the vizdahode and race officials, who were very relieved to see us! [laughter] Sue: I bet! Oh, god. Were you, were you—I’m sort of backing up to Uelen now—were you excited to see, um, the Chukchi-style sleds and the reindeer skin clothing and all the different, the really different cultural things? Kate: Oh yeah. Oh certainly, and it was almost like going back in time to, I don’t know, maybe even before I was born [laughter]. Um, but yeah, they just, they rely entirely just on natural materials that they get from the land for their clothing and, um, for the harnesses for their dogs, for a lot of, their sleds were just cobbled together with what looked like pallets and driftwood. Sue: Wow, what a - Kate: And the mushers were dressed entirely in fur clothing. And, um, they were really skeptical about our nylon clothing. And one of the guys, actually Gana, the guy in that photograph that you have — Sue: Oh, Gani Anaquez … Kate: Yeah, um, he said that, um, if he had to dress in the clothing that we wear, he probably would never dare go outside! He just couldn’t imagine it could possibly keep us warm. [laughter] Sue: It doesn’t keep me warm! [laughter] Does it keep you warm? Kate: Well, what I have keeps me warm. Yeah. [laughter] Sue: Interesting. What was their reaction to, um, you know, to bags of dog food and watering dogs and, you know, just the kind of care? Kate: Well initially they thought it was just silly and fussy, and, um, they really didn’t understand the concept of watering dogs. Um, their dogs were simply fed chunks of meat or fish. And the idea of cooking dog food and especially brothing dogs just didn’t make sense to them at all. But by the end of the Hope Race in ’92, some of them, anyway, were experimenting with that. Sue: Even then. Kate: Yeah, uh huh. Yeah, yeah. They were amazed at, at how much more endurance our dogs had, and through interpreters they asked a lot of questions. I mean, they understood that it wasn’t entirely just that our dogs were just superior to theirs. They could see that it had, that we had some secrets that they, um, weren’t aware of. And they were anxious to learn. Sue: That’s neat. I think it would be real interesting now, with ten years of them applying those secrets, to do this again, see what’s — what did you think of their dogs? Kate: Well, a lot of them, um, they’re beautifully trained. Of course they use them for practical purposes, for hunting and reindeer herding, and so they were, they had just, um, they were incredibly well disciplined. They didn’t need any kind of a hook or hardly a brake. And, you know, when they told those dogs to sit and stay, they were planted. And, um, but a lot of the teams had, were a mixture of breeds, many of which had come from other parts of Russia. They weren’t the original Russian sled dogs for the most part. But there were a couple teams that came from, um, villages way up on the north coast that probably were the original Russian dogs, and they were absolutely beautiful animals. Their conformation, their size, their power, um, those teams really, with the proper care, I’m sure could have competed with the very best of ours. But a lot of the others had very long hair coats, not good conformation for, um, running, would never be really fast dogs. But steady and really dependable. Sue: I’ll have to get out my photo album. I’ve took, the last page has got some dog pictures from that recent trip, there’s some you’ll, you’ll get a chuckle out of! Kate: Yeah. Sue: So. Well do you have any, any, uh, favorite villages along the way that you stopped in, or anything memorable that stood out, meeting, people — gosh, women in the villages, must just — and the men—been fascinated with women mushers, and leading — Kate: Yeah, women mushers were a novelty. [laughter] Sue: How was that expressed? Kate: But for the most part, they were just really interested and, and at least the women were really supportive and excited by the fact that, that in this country, women do things like run dogs. Sue: Um, so what, how was the race, I mean, the country that you saw, was it, you know what were the things that you saw that you hadn’t anticipated at all, and did you have any expectations? Kate: Um, I guess I didn’t really have a lot of expectations. I expected the country to be beautiful and it is. Um, it’s a lot more rugged than I was expecting and I was amazed at, um, how much more barren and stark it is from, um, what it is on this side. But what surprised me the most really was the people and that wasn’t even something I was, um, particularly interested in to begin with. I mean mostly, I was interested in seeing the country and, um, what wildlife there was over there, and having this experience with my dogs. But in the end, really, it was the people that captivated me more than anything. Sue: Right. What stood out about the people, I mean in what ways …. Kate: Well, everyone was just so incredibly friendly, and generous, and clearly pleased that we were there and excited, um, to have visitors from a foreign place, and, um, I think we were all a little frustrated that we couldn’t communicate. Because both sides, we just had so many questions that just couldn’t be asked or answered. Um, but you could just read the spirit of their feelings and, um, it was just a very, very positive experience. Sue: Did you stay in people’s homes? Kate: Yeah. In many places we did, not everywhere. In some places we stayed in schools. Sue: Wow. Well, um, you won the race. What kind of reception did you get in Anadyr? Kate: Well there were, it seemed like, several thousand people waiting on the edge of town, um, and there were fireworks, and [laughter]— Sue: Oh you’re kidding! Kate: You could hardly get the dogs through the crowd of people. The dogs were I think a little bit overwhelmed and intimidated, although it was that way to a lesser degree in all the villages that it was hard to just get through the, the crowds of people. And then, um, people were just so curious about, like, what was in your sled. And so as soon as you’d stop, you’d just be surrounded by this throng of people, I mean just shoulder to shoulder to where you couldn’t even move. And then when you’d open up your sled bag they would just all lean over and you’d just hear these gasps and just sounds of amazement at all this stuff that we were carrying with us. [laughter] Sue: Did you, did the Russian mushers carry — all the Russian mushers were Native, right? Kate: They were. Yeah. Sue: And did they carry a lot less stuff? Kate: Oh they carried almost nothing. They just had a little bedroll on their sled with, um, just the bare minimum. Sue: Wow. Well what kind of a, I mean what was the celebrations and the awards and honors and all that, and gosh you went through all that without translation at the end of the race? The awards banquet and all …. Kate: Oh no, in Anadyr there were some translators. Yeah. Yeah. No they put on, in every village that we went to, um, we spent at least one night, in some places we spent a couple nights, and they had tremendous feasts for us, and entertainment, um, a lot of the entertainment was put on by school children. And I was just amazed you know these schools have—the facilities are just terrible. I mean there’s just so little in the way of just physical, um, what’s the word, just, just stuff. But yet they’ve done so much — Sue: Teaching aids. Kate: But yet they’ve done so much with these kids. Um, the kids are so creative and they put on these incredible dance performances. And their skills as musicians are just amazing. And it makes you realize you don’t really need all this high-faluting technology and teaching aids to, um, provide a really good education. Sue: What do you feel, for you personally, was of the most value out of the Hope Race? You know, where, where did it touch your life? Kate: Well it’s funny. It’s, for a number of years afterwards it just, it really was a big part of my life. Keeping in touch with people over there and learning Russian, and I actually thought that, that probably the next, for a while, that the next thing that I would do with my life would have something to do with, um, the Russian Far East—I didn’t know exactly what. But circumstances changed and I moved into other things, and in the long term I guess it’s just a lot of good, wonderful memories. Sue: What do you feel has been the value of the race, of having held this international race? Kate: I supposed just the main thing is just opening the eyes of people on both sides to what life is like for our neighbors. Sue: Would you like to go again? Kate: Oh I’d love to go again. I’m not sure that it’s going to be possible but, um, at least in the near future, but no, I’d love to go again. Sue: Can you get your team trained up by spring? Kate: There’s no way I can go anywhere in the spring Sue: Oh, because of work. Kate: Yeah. There’s just no way. I hear talk about perhaps there being another Hope Race and it would be a heartbreaker to miss it, but the reality of it is, as long as I’m doing what I’m doing now, I won’t be part of it.",

            "transcript": "As the Army of the Potomac marched and the Fredericksburg Campaign got underway, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia was spread out, covering the city of Culpeper and the approaches to the Shenandoah Valley. Robert E. Lee, commanding the army, waited to see what his Federal opponents would do. When he received word that the U.S. forces were marching towards Fredericksburg, Lee set out to counter the move. The delay faced by Union forces in getting across the Rappahannock River, allowed Confederates to arrive on the outskirts of the city by November 20, 1862. The Confederates assigned to defend Marye’s Heights came upon the Sunken Road and the stone wall when they arrived. It was a nearly perfect position: one they did not have to build or create. From here, they could take up positions and be ready to fight at a moment’s notice. Some Confederates dug into the roadbed, creating an even deeper trench to stand in; others used their free time to construct a theatre on the back slope of the heights and put on amateur plays to fill the time. Fighting broke out on December 11, 1862, when Union engineers finally began building pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock River. Though delayed by Confederates in the town of Fredericksburg, Union soldiers eventually captured the city and finished the bridges. On December 12, Ambrose Burnside funneled men, cannons, wagons, and supplies across the river. Burnside’s plan called for simultaneous attacks against the Confederate left, here at Marye’s Heights, and the Confederate right, at Prospect Hill. By controlling Marye’s Heights, the Confederate army also defended the Telegraph Road, which traveled south towards Richmond. Realizing the importance of their position, the Confederate defenders here braced for the impending attacks. Initially defending the stone wall were roughly 1,500 Georgians under the command of Brigadier General Thomas R.R. Cobb. A staunch secessionist, Cobb was a well-known lawyer in Georgia before the war and had published a two-volume set of books defending slavery that ran almost 600 pages long. Just a few months shy of his 40th birthday, Fredericksburg would be Cobb’s first battle as a general, and defending the Sunken Road his first test. He embraced the challenge, and had written to his wife late in November, “We hear their drums and bands plainly and my blood boils whenever I hear them.” On the morning of December 13, Confederates from positions here observed almost 800 yards of open ground in front of them stretching to the edge of Fredericksburg as Federal forces prepared their attacks. One Confederate wrote of the scene that the Federals’ “infantry with waving banners, accompanied by magnificent artillery and superb cavalry. . . made an imposing panoramic display of the glorious pride and pomp of war.” The first Union attacks of the day began around noontime and started towards the Sunken Road. Confederate artillery atop the hill began to fire, but the infantry waited, intentionally allowing their enemy to get closer. “Our men did not pull a trigger until they got within easy range,” one Georgian wrote, “And then taking deliberate aim, they gave them volley after volley right in their faces.” The Union attacks all melted away from the stone wall in the face of such unrelenting fire. More Confederates poured into the Sunken Road, adding their musketry to the din. Again and again the Federals came, and each time Confederates repulsed them. Shortly after the first Union attack against the stone wall, Thomas Cobb was mortally wounded. Cobb had earlier made the Stephens’ House his headquarters, and he was standing in the road near here when a Union artillery shell exploded, sending shrapnel into his left leg, and severing his femoral artery. He bled out within the hour. In the 1880s, this small stone monument was erected to commemorate Cobb’s death. Even with Cobb’s death and other officers wounded, the Confederate line never buckled. Hour after hour, the Union attacks kept coming, leading one Virginian to write, “As I witnessed one line swept away by one fearful blast. . . I forgot they were enemies and only remembered that they were men, and it is hard to see in cold blood brave men die.” When the shooting finally came to a stop in front of the Sunken Road, the Confederates here had suffered almost 1,000 casualties—dead, wounded, and captured. The wall, however, had not been reached by a single Union soldier, and nearly 8,000 Federals had been shot trying to reach the wall. Their bodies laid out in front of the Sunken Road as a testament to the continued attacks. What motivated the Federal forces to keep attacking? How did the fighting here figure into the overall plan? From here, the next stop on the tour is up Marye’s Heights. Follow the trail next to the Cobb Memorial and stop once you reach the first interpretive panels at the top of the hill. ",

            "transcript": "We are now at stop #8 on the self-guided auto tour-Sheridan’s Arrival. We are along Kline’s Mill Road on the north end of the battlefield. Looking south, downstream along Meadow Brook. This is the same Meadow Brook that runs straight down through the middle of the battlefield before flowing into Cedar Creek. And we have seen it at different points on the battlefield. It was in this area where General Sheridan would arrive back from Winchester and would greet his retreating and rallying army. As we have talked about previously, Sheridan was not here when the battle began. He had spent the previous night in Winchester, having no idea that his army would come under attack on the morning of the 19th of October. He gets up that morning having no idea that his army has been attacked and defeated. Starts riding back to his army, hearing the distance thunder of artillery, thinking maybe it is a skirmish, or a reconnaissance by his forces. Only to be told that his army is under attack, is retreating, as he rides south along the Valley Pike. The Valley Pike would be off to your east, or to your left. You are looking south downstream along Meadow Brook. He soon is greeted by retreating Union soldiers from the battlefield, having come over 10 miles, spreading rumors of defeat and disaster. They start to cheer Sheridan, realizing he is coming back to the battlefield. In typical Sheridan fashion, he tells them stop cheering me, if you love your country follow me back to the battlefield. And many do, they turn and follow him. This begins what would become as Sheridan start to pick up his pace and ride back to the battlefield - Sheridan’s Ride. He will ride over 10 miles up the Valley Pike, which is now Route 11 today, US Route 11. Rallying more and more soldiers along the way, and finally where Kline’s Mill Road greets or intersects with Route 11 today, the Valley Pike back then, he will greet his rallying Union army north of Middletown. He later left a vivid account of the first sight that greeted him upon seeing his shattered army, north of Middletown that morning. He wrote, “There burst upon our view an appalling spectacle of panic. I stared down upon our stricken army, hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs of others not hurt but utterly demoralized and baggage wagons by the score all pressing to the rear in hopeless confusion. Telling only too plainly that a disaster had occurred at the front.” His officers greeted him. They were now rallying his army south of Kline’s Mill road in the fields you have been passing by. One of his officers told him I think we are in good enough shape to retreat back to Winchester, his main base of operations. Of course Sheridan did not want to hear anything of retreating. Once his forces were in good enough shape he was going to immediately counterattack. This battle could not go down as a Union defeat here in the Shenandoah Valley he realized so close to the upcoming Presidential election in early November. One of his staff officers suggested, “Show yourself to your men General, let them know you are back on the battlefield.” And that is exactly what Sheridan would do. He would start riding along his rallying lines and the effect was instantaneous, his demoralized men instantly rallied to his presence. One of his men later talked about this, writing, “The men sprang to their feet and cheered only as men under such circumstances can. Hope and confidence returned and abound. No longer did we merely hope that the worst was over. That we could hold our ground till night, or worse to make an orderly retreat to Winchester. Now all burned to avenge and attack the enemy, to drive him back, retrieve our honor, and sleep in our old campground that night. And every man knew that Sheridan would do it.” The attack wouldn’t start immediately however, it would take several hours to straighten his lines and make final adjustments, but eventually the Union counterattack would begin that afternoon at 4:00 and that attack we will discuss at the final stop on our tour, stop 9.",

            "transcript": "Emily Ward (0:20) - Welcome to Castillo conversations. My name is Emily Ward and I'm a Public History major at Flagler College and I've been interning at the Castillo de San Marcos. I'm joined today by a special friend and a fellow resident of St. Augustine, Bobby Batson. We are going to talk to you about some of the most commonly asked questions about the history of the Castillo. So Bobby, what do you want to talk about today? Bobby Batson (0:41) - So how on earth did the Spanish manage to mix and make the stone blocks for the fort? Emily Ward (0:46) - Well, they didn't mix the material. Coquina is a naturally occurring stone made of shell sand and limestone. It could be cut and quarried. Bobby Batson (0:54) - But where did they get the coquina from? Emily Ward (0:56) - The Spanish had access to the quarry on Anastasia Island and labor from local Native American tribes and both free and enslaved Africans. They were able to collect the stone, cut it, and build the Castillo. Bobby Batson (1:07) - Really, where else could you find it? Emily Ward (1:09) - It's pretty unique to our area. Other forts may be made from coral or shell but it wouldn't be the same shell, the tiny coquina clam that lived here thousands of years ago that fossilized into the coquina we know today. Bobby Batson (1:21) - Well, I've also heard of tabby. How does Tabby differ from coquina? Emily Ward (1:26) - Tabby is a mixture of crushed shells, water and sand it could be poured for flooring. In fact, the original fourth floors were made of Tabby and many of the buildings in town are Tabby structures. Bobby Batson (1:37) - So did the cannonballs actually get stuck in the coquina? Emily Ward (1:40) - Yes, the coquina stone has millions of teeny tiny air pockets. So when a cannonball hits it, it's like sticking a knife into cheese. Bobby Batson (1:48) - Well, in that case, then the Spanish just were able to take the cannonballs out and reuse them right? Emily Ward (1:53) - After a cannonball hit the fort, it would have not been able to be reused. The cannon ball would have been much too damaged. So the Spanish would scoop out the fired cannon balls, but that was just because they took such great care of the fort and wanted to repair damages, not to fire the cannonballs again, and because of that visitors today should not expect to see old cannonballs stuck in the walls. Bobby Batson (2:13) - Well are the holes on the side of the fort today from cannonballs? Emily Ward (2:17) - The holes are not from cannonballs. The Spanish really did take great care of the Castillo. Whenever it was damaged, they would fix the coquina and redo the plaster. The fort was a symbol of status and power. So trust me the Spanish wanted it to look good. Bobby Batson (2:30) - Well then what are the holes from? Emily Ward (2:32) - Some were caused by the other owners, the British and the U.S. who adapted the fort to fit their own needs, and some of the holes are also from natural erosion of the coquina. Bobby Batson (2:42) - Hmm. So sticking a knife into cheese. I'm sure taking a bite out of coquina would be much rougher though. But, thank you for answering my questions today. That's all my time. Emily Ward (2:51) - Thank you for asking, and thanks to everyone for listening to this episode of Castillo Conversations, The Secret Ingredient.",

            "transcript": "Solar Power for Parks and People Wayside Description A photograph of a large solar array with the caption, “Close-up view of Whiskeytown National Recreation Area’s Grizzly Gulch Solar Farm.” There are two text blocks on the wayside. The top left block reads as follows. What do sunshine and water have in common at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area? Answer: both of these abundant natural resources get utilized to make renewable energy inside the park! Importantly, unlike coal, natural gas, and oil-fired power plants, solar power and hydropower create electricity without polluting our communal air and atmosphere. Beginning with the Arab Oil Embargos of the 1970s, the federal government and specifically the National Park Service was mandated to serve as a role model in terms of energy conservation and clean energy. Whiskeytown National Recreation Area takes this mandate seriously. Solar panels power most of the streetlights in the park. Solar panels also power part of the Visitor Center (the building just to your right), the park’s wastewater treatment facilities and the maintenance building. There is a green recycle logo next to the lower right text block. The text reads as follows. Be Clean and Green in the Park! During your visit here at Whiskeytown, help us protect the environment... 1. If parked or at a construction stop, turn your vehicle off instead of idling the engine. This helps save you gasoline and also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. 2. Dispose of all litter in the brown, bear-proof trash cans and dispose of all aluminum cans and glass or plastic bottles in the recycling cans. How else can you conserve energy whether in the park or at home?!",

            "transcript": "Emily Ward (0:19) - Welcome to Castillo conversations. My name is Emily Ward and I'm a Public History major at Flagler College and I've been interning at the Castillo de San Marcos. I am joined today by a special friend and a fellow resident of St. Augustine, Bobby Batson. We are going to talk to you about some of the most commonly asked questions about the history of the Castillo. So, Bobby, what do you want to talk about today? Bobby Batson (0:41) - Well, so you know how I'm from Tallahassee, I'm a diehard FSU fan. And I was curious about, you know, the Seminole Tribe and Chief Osceola. Is it true that Osceola and the other Seminoles were held as prisoners at the Castillo? Emily Ward (0:57) - Yes, in 1837, the United States Army captured and held many Seminole prisoners at the Castillo, which at the time would have been referred to as Fort Marion. Bobby Batson (1:07) - Yeah. And then there was escape. Can you tell me about how the Seminole escape that Osceola led like how that happened, how to go down? Emily Ward (1:14) - I can certainly tell you about the Seminole escape, but Osceola was not the one who led it. Bobby Batson (1:19) - Really then how did they escape? Or why wouldn't he have led it? Emily Ward (1:24) - Osceola was very sick with malaria when he was here at Fort Marion, and he was too ill to leave. The escape was led by another warrior named Wildcat, he and 19 others slipped out on the night of November 29th. Bobby Batson (1:36) - And how did they escape? Emily Ward (1:38) - We're not really sure. The US Army report says who escaped, when they escaped, but does not go into great detail on how they escaped. Wildcat's account goes into greater details. He describes waiting until there was no moon to have the cover of darkness, climbing on each other's shoulders and using ropes and more to go out the windows. What we know for sure, is that they were held in the rooms on the southwest corner of the fort. Most of the fort rooms do not have windows, but those ones do. So Wildcat's story is possible. Bobby Batson (2:10) - And then what happened after they escaped? Emily Ward (2:12) - A month later Osceola and the remaining Seminoles were transferred up to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina, and Wildcat was leading troops against the US Army at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee in December. Osceola died of his illness in January of 1838, and they buried him right outside of Fort Moultrie. Bobby Batson (2:31) - Do you think that we're ever going to discover all the details of that daring escape? Emily Ward (2:36) - The details of the escape may be less important than the fact that it happened at all. After Wildcat escaped from Fort Marion he continued to fight with Seminole forces and led many victories in battle. Some historians argue that his escape helped to rally weary fighters to continue their efforts and that his leadership changed the course of the war. If Wildcat had not escaped, the outcome of the war, and the future of the tribe could have been very different. Even today, most members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida trace their heritage back to those 20 prisoners who escaped. The war between the Seminole tribe and the US Army concluded in 1842, but there was never an official treaty ending the conflict. In 1842, many of the surviving Seminoles in Florida fled South seeking refuge in the Everglades, and the Army gave up their effort to remove them from the territory. To this day, the Seminoles still call themselves the unconquered people. Bobby Batson (3:27) - Well, I definitely wish that was true for our football team, but I'm glad the tribe went undefeated. Anyways, thank you for answering the questions. That was actually really great to finally learn so thank you for that. Emily Ward (3:40) - Thank you for asking, and thank you to everyone for listening to this episode of Castillo Conversations, The Great Escape.",

            "transcript": "IMAGE and TEXT: The Mission's Last Day DESCRIBING: Rudimentary, faded line pencil sketch of Whitman Mission SYNOPSIS: A cluster of several small buildings with peaked roofs, small windows, a few chimneys, and a clump of what might be small shrubs in front. Looping lines on the left and right suggest trees. A few straight lines suggest fences on the left and right sides. In front of the rightmost building, a person with two horses stands next to a fence. In the foreground a person holds the reigns of a small horse. CAPTION: Irish-Canadian artist Paul Kane sketched the Whitman Mission three months before the missionaries’ deaths. CREDIT: Oregon Historical Society RELATED TEXT: Trained as a physician, Marcus Whitman believed that ministering to the physical health of his followers was an important complement to his ministry of their spiritual health. Similarly, tıwáat (weyíıletpuu doctors) drew upon their spiritual connections for healing power. When Whitman assumed the role of tıwáat, he knew he had to abide by tıwáat ethics, which recognized those with the power to heal also have the power to kill. The weyíıletpuu penalty for malpractice was death. The night of November 28, 1847, a small group of men led by tílewkeyˀkt met near the mission. They discussed options to halt the spread of death and concluded Whitman was the problem. The next day, Whitman received warnings of a plan to kill him but did not react. By evening, he and Narcissa lay dead. Within days 11 more men were dead. Forty-seven other people, including children, were held hostage until December 24. Newspaper editors soon reacted: “For the barbarian murderers . . . let them be pursued with unrelenting hostility, until their lifeblood has atoned for their infamous deeds; let them be hunted as beasts of prey; let their name and race be blotted from the face of the earth, and the place that once knew them, know them no more forever.”—Oregon Spectator, January 20, 1848",

            "transcript": "Today, Prospect Hill is one of the most popular spots in the park to walk and enjoy the peaceful green space where a battle once dominated the surroundings. Observe the rolling hills and tree line in the distance. Think about how the natural features here would have helped or hindered an attacking army. How would you defend these heights? The Confederate 2nd Corps, led by Stonewall Jackson, occupied the defenses on this side of the battlefield. Confederate artillerists positioned cannons within the tree line, close to where the park road is today. The significantly larger artillery force in the United States Army would have difficulty locating and taking out Confederate cannons concealed at the edge of the woods. The same woods that provided protection also limited the ability of Confederate cannons to move. Troops here had to wait for Union soldiers to get close enough so that they could fire with maximum impact, hoping that the damage they inflicted would be worth revealing their position to a superior force. When US General George Gordon Meade’s division broke through a weak spot in the line, chaos and confusion swept over Confederate ranks. Sergeant William A. McClendon serving in the 15th Alabama Infantry, was a part of the Confederate counterattack that turned Meade’s forces back. He wrote, “When everything got right, Hoke ordered us forward, with orders not to fire until we had passed our men in front. We soon came upon them when we halted and was ordered to fire, and immediately we raised the ‘Rebel Yell’ and rushed on to the Yankees with the bayonet. They could not stand. They were not expecting such a deadly volley. They broke and we after them down the hill to the cut in the railroad where we overhauled a goodly number of them crouched down, waving white handkerchiefs to surrender.” Over the next few hours Confederate and Union troops would each cross the open field, trying to gain ground on either side of the railroad tracks, only to be repelled by the force of their opponent’s artillery. As twilight loomed, an uneasy peace overtook the battlefield. Unanswered questions lingered: Was the battle over, or would there be more fighting tomorrow? Despite Jackson's desire to conduct a counterattack, the terrain only worked in his favor so far as his own defenses. In the words of Sergeant William McClendon, “It would have been a suicidal policy for us to have advanced on them in the day time, for they had at least one hundred guns planted on Stafford Heights on the opposite side of the river that commanded the entire battlefield.” Instead, Confederate and Union soldiers waited in anticipation on December 14, 1862. Sporadic gunfire shook the nerves of men recovering from the previous day's ordeal. The dead and wounded stayed where they fell. In isolated incidences, soldiers from both sides made unofficial truces to bury the dead or trade goods. Sometimes they traded insults. Union high command debated whether they should renew attacks. Ultimately, Burnside’s commanders convinced him that the cost would be too high. The Army of the Potomac retreated. It was not until several days later that a burial truce allowed Union parties to revisit the fields to safely gather and bury their dead. With an army on either side of the river, the stage was set for a long winter. The US Army of the Potomac was demoralized and dejected. Many felt that they’d been used by Generals only trying to prove themselves or advance their political agendas. The Confederates, on the other hand, were overjoyed. In the face of a much larger force, they stood their ground and persevered. After the battle in the cold December night, soldiers reported seeing the Northern Lights, an unusual and rare occurrence this far south. Some Confederates viewed the sighting as Divine approval. However, all was not well in the Confederacy. Over the winter food became scare and the army foraged from the surrounding countryside. This intensified a food shortage triggered by inflation, poor transportation networks, and unregulated speculation of the available food supply. Discontented citizens, mostly women, took to the streets and led riots, looting governments food stockpiles and local stores. The war which both sides had expected to win quickly was taking longer than anyone had thought and was about to shift to a much more difficult affair. On January 1st, 1863, President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. After nearly 2 years of war, President Lincoln officially recognized that the United States would not succeed without acknowledging and defeating, once and for all, the issue at the heart of Southern secession: slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation declared all persons enslaved in rebelling states to be free and authorized the enlistment of black men into US military service. With this proclamation, the war took on new meaning, no longer simply a war to preserve the Union as it was, the United States Army would now be fighting to build a Union without slavery. In 1863, a new phase of the war began, but the bloodshed was far from over. In May, 1863, the two armies that had fought here at Fredericksburg would re-engage 12 miles west of town at the Battle of Chancellorsville.",

            "transcript": "[Audio: water splashing noises] Bob We’re walking upstream in the little gorge below the barrier fall at Shinumo to our second net in a pool in a tight, dog-like turn where yesterday we saw at least four humpback chub. Hopefully, some of those fish will be in the net. Kate Hidden forces shape our ideas, beliefs, and experiences of Grand Canyon. Join us as we uncover the stories between the canyon’s colorful walls. Add your voice for what happens next at Grand Canyon!  Kate Hello and welcome. My name is Kate. You are listening to Behind the Scenery. Welcome to the water world at the bottom of a mile-high desert. Tributaries and streams flow down steep cliffs and side canyons to meet at the river. The Colorado River in Grand Canyon is sandwiched between dams at both ends of the park, Glen Canyon Dam at the top and Hoover Dam at the bottom.  After Glen Canyon Dam blocked the river in 1963, people started noticing that it impacted the community of animals and plants at the bottom of the canyon. The dam altered the riparian world downstream. A wave of change hit the aquatic environment– that’s home to water bugs and fish! It changed the river for people too. In today’s episode we are going to explore how the Glen Canyon Dam changed the Colorado River. We’ll share one story about the struggles of wildlife to survive in a damned world. Bob So let's talk about what the River was like prior to dams, just to draw the contrast.  Kate This is Bob Schelly. He is a fisheries biologist for the Native Fish Ecology and Conservation Program at Grand Canyon. Bob So the Colorado River, which is a big desert river draining pretty arid landscapes. Pre-dam is characterized by really large snowmelt-driven spring runoff events and so it was typical in a spring runoff to see flows through Grand Canyon in excess of 120,000 CFS, so that's a cubic feet per second… Kate A cubic foot is about the size of a basketball. So imagine 120,000 basketballs flooding past you every second. Bob So you have these big sediment-laden spring floods and then during the summer the river levels would drop to comparatively low base flows of 5000 CFS or less. And in addition, those floods would carry lots of driftwood, woody debris, they would build enormous sandbars and create backwater habitats related to the deposition of sediment and there would be a temperature difference. You have very warm water in summer and of course in winter at base flows, the coldest temperatures, close to freezing. Kate A flood that big was like flushing the toilet, a big whoosh down the canyon...It purged things, but also brought nutrients into the canyon body... It was like a seasonal detox. Bob  Post-dam pretty much all those details have changed. So now the reservoir upstream, Lake Powell, behind Glen Canyon Glen Canyon Dam, captures big spring runoff so you don't see a pulse. So it's in effect it's flattened that hydrograph. You no longer have the big floods through the Grand Canyon, and the base flows don’t get as low as they did historically.   Kate The canyon used to have a pulse, a heartbeat that ran with the seasons. The dam flatlined that pulse....if the river is the heart of the canyon, the dam changed how that heart beats.    Bob But you see more daily fluctuations because the dam is generating power and at peak power demand they increase the release. So over a 24-hour cycle, you see rise and fall of the River, which in the in the years right after dam closure, was quite extreme.   Kate And it was extreme for humans too. There are people on the river in Grand Canyon, floating on rafts and kayaks, navigating rapids all the time! At night, they tie in their boats, big enough to carry 15 people, to stakes on the beach and settle in to sleep to the sound of the river.  Bob You hear stories about people boating through Grand Canyon and waking up after a night’s sleep and finding their enormous S-rig 10 feet up on the beach, just stranded. These days that daily fluctuation is less. It might be on the order of 1 1/2 or two feet but you have daily fluctuations and a more constant hydrograph throughout the year. And it's a cold clear release because it comes out of the bottom of the reservoir, so in summer now the river is very cold which didn't used to be the case, and in winter the water is actually warmer than it would have been pre-dam Kate The River is so cold, it's really hard to swim in! The changes that happened to the Colorado after the dam changed many aspects of the corridor in Grand Canyon from the size of beaches to the experience of voters to the lives of the plants and animals that depended on that watershed. So today's story goes underwater with the fish. Let's meet Rebecca Koller who has a long career at Grand Canyon, extending back over 20 years. She had her start in the vegetation program and began with fisheries in 2016. Rebecca is now the natural resource specialist for the Native Fish Ecology and Conservation Program. Rebecca So yeah in Grand Canyon originally there were eight native fish in the Grand Canyon river and six of those are endemic Kate Endemic means that creature only lives in that geographical location. So these endemic fish are special because they only live in the Colorado River watershed that's around the Canyon.   Rebecca And four of them have been extirpated and two of them are now endangered.   Kate Let’s look at that word extirpated. It's similar to extinction in that they have disappeared, but instead of disappearing from the entire world, they've been rooted out of a local area, similar to how grizzly bears, which are on the state flag of California, are extirpated from California today. Rebecca So I might have mentioned the Colorado pikeminnow has been extirpated from the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. It does still exist I think in pretty low numbers, huh Bob, in the upper basin. Yeah, they’re declining. And that was that was one of the one of the large predatory fish and the other ones that have been extirpated from Grand Canyon is the bonytail chubs, the round-tailed chubs and is that it? Yeah. And the pike minnow. Rite, rite. So and then the other two that are endangered or the humpback chub and razorback suckers. Kate Out of the eight original native fish, the humpback chub is a crowd favorite.  Bob the humpback chub is special within this group in that they’re long lived fish, 40 plus years, and they’re, they’re habitat specialists in canyon-bound regions. So pre-dam humpback chub were not widespread throughout the basin. They were found in canyon reaches that have would have big rapids and deep water within gorges that have this pool-rapid kind of morphology.  Kate Within the mile-deep gorge of Grand Canyon, the river pools into eddies after going through rapids with waves taller than people. It was the perfect habitat for the humpback chub! What else is cool about the chub? When you look at it, it has a face kind of like the canyon mules. This narrow, rounded face, and above that face rise a big hump. Bob And large adults develop this weird fleshy hump that sticks out above the head and there have been a number of theories why because its not just humpback chub, it’s the razorback sucker, you can tell by the name, that feature above the head that makes them deep-bodied. And the theory that I like most, and I think there is some experimental evidence to support it, so why multiple lineages evolve this feature this humpback like feature is that Colorado pikeminnow which was the one big predator prior to invasives gaining a foothold in the basin, are gape-limited. So they can't open, even though they get very big, pikeminnows can get 6 feet long, at least they did historically, physically opening their mouth is surprisingly limited for as big a fish as they are. And it turns out that humpback chub and razorback sucker, once they reach a certain size and the hump starts to develop they become invulnerable to predation. They don't fit into the mouth of pikeminnow except the very largest pikeminnow.  Kate These fish evolved, especially to interact with each other, in this specific place. This doesn’t happen everywhere! So we are looking at a predator and prey relationship that went on for centuries before the river was dammed....time enough for our chub to evolve one mean hump that was too big, and too tough for the shark of the Colorado to swallow!  Now that the dam is here, the entire population is completely caught in the Grand Canyon between the two dams. Rebecca Sure, yeah, so as Bob mentioned earlier, the humpback chub is the largest population of that chub remaining in Grand Canyon and it's centered around the little Colorado River and it's sort of thought of as the center of the humpback chub universe. And so as a result of the dam operation, it was identified as a conservation measure to establish another second spawning aggregation of humpback chub within Grand Canyon, recognizing that that little Colorado River population is, you know, it's still vulnerable to catastrophic events. Say weather events, flooding or contamination or whatnot. So, so it was identified that that was important to establish that second spawning aggregation and so I think in the 2000s or around 2000 there was a study published looking at potential other locations for translocation, other tributary locations, and in that study it was identified, three sites were identified. They identified Havasu Creek, Shinumo Creek and Bright Angel Creek as potential translocation areas that would support humpback chub population. And they were looking at like water quality, temperature and then also the presence of non-natives  Kate Remember this? Bob We’re walking upstream in the little gorge below the barrier fall at Shinumo to our second net in a pool in a tight, dog-like turn where yesterday we saw at least four humpback chub. Hopefully, some of those fish will be in the net. Kate Between 2009-2014, a fish crew at Grand Canyon began pro-actively reintroducing humpback chub to Shinnumo Creek, giving them another home to recover from the dam.  Rebecca And all indicators up to that point where that the fish were doing well, they were, they were growing and surviving in Shinumo Creek. And then in 2014 there was a fire on the North Rim and subsequent flooding into that Shinumo drainage which essentially wiped out all of the all of the fish population in that Creek including the humpback chub, bluehead suckers,  speckled dace and all other fish species there so, so it was, it was I think what is interesting about that whole project was again we learned that you know these populations of humpback chubs continue to be vulnerable to those catastrophic events. Fortunately, we've done work in Havasu Canyon and Bright Angel. Kate When you have an endangered species like the humpback chub that only lives in a small area, a catastrophic event like a fire or flood could cause them to go extinct. In order to increase the habitat range of the humpback chub, the fisheries crew would have to tackle another problem, the fact that invasive species are outcompeting the humpback chubs in the creeks they once called home. Rebecca So we started electrofishing the entire reach of Bright Angel Creek, which is about 13 miles, in 2012. And that effort involves backpack electrofishing with crews of, you know, 6 to 10 people. Kate I met fish crew down in the backcountry at Bright Angel campground and joined them in the water as they pounded in a weir that would keep non-native trout out of the creek. Afterward, we met back in a roundtable at the employee cabin so that we could get the scoop on non-native fish removal. Nick Ok, my name is Nick. I've been involved with this project for quite awhile now. I forget how many years, but I guess my favorite part about this is you're in this pretty magical place. In my opinion, you're doing really good work. Work like I mentioned earlier, we're restoring these native fish or we’re trying to restore their habitat. Yeah and I guess get to outreach to people and explain what we're doing and especially having those people, some of them have come and volunteered on our crew, and just, I guess over the years we've seen people with a negative outlook kind of switch to a positive outlook and we're seeing more native fish and more people that are on board with this. Mike Uh, my name is Mike. I've helped out with this project on and off since 2012, and I've also done fisheries work throughout the Colorado River with similar fish as down here. And it's just kind of cool working on this project which is, you know, it's the same goal as projects elsewhere that I've worked, with the same species, different place. And I don't know, it's just it's cool being a part of the project that has gone on for this long and is really great people working here. Ray My name is Ray. I have been a technician here for this week is my sixth season on the Bright Angel crew and what I really like about this job, in this position, is that you know, this being my sixth year, and working the last five years you actually notice a difference every year as you work down from the source all the way down the Colorado River 13 miles of electrofishing, you can see a difference in less and less nonnative fish and more and more native fish. So I think the biggest thing for me is just being able to see that difference over a period of five years. It's pretty awesome! Makes you want to keep coming back keep doing this work, and another thing is just in terms of the job, the place you get to work in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. That's pretty awesome! People you work with are pretty great, so my best friends I met on this job. And it doesn't help that my supervisor is in the room but the people you work for us agree and not just saying that 'cause he's in the room here, but I really do think that yeah, you work for great people with great people, in a great place. It's pretty awesome. Nick So I guess we're down here I the main goal is to create a habitat friendly for the humpback chub which historically lived in bright Angel Creek or at least it's assumed at least down in the River like Delta area of right Angel and there are lots of Brown and rainbow trout in it now thanks to some people back in the early 1900s stocking it who worked for the Park Service.   Kate Yes, Rangers were stocking creeks in the 1920s with sport fish from Europe like brown trout and rainbow trout. There are pictures of rangers on mules slung with old milk cans full of non-native fish. In Bright Angel canyon, rangers were even operating a fish hatchery to actively stock the creek with lots of non-native babies. The non-natives flourished after the dam was put in, out-competing local fish and interrupting the river food chain. Today’s fisheries crew had a lot of work to do, or undo, in Bright Angel Creek.  Nick I guess the whole goal of the project is to protect the resources within the park for future generations and unfortunately our predecessors did put nonnative fish into the creeks, but now we're restoring those native fish that are here or at least making it making the habitat available for them so they can potentially persist into the future for future generations to come experience. Ray Nick that was beautiful! Nick Thank you, Ray. Mike I guess we can talk about how the tributaries within Grand Canyon are kind of like a stronghold for the native fish. Well, could be. I guess the River is highly modified. You know Glen Canyon dam is up there releasing cold, clear water that's super unnatural for this river’s historical flows and sediment load and so the tributaries are really important to the native fish for spawning and for, you know, the like rearing of younger fish and so this is like just one little piece of a larger effort to like restoring the chubs as there's other projects in another tributary or two restoring the shed. Ray Well I may not be as qualified discussed this, but just from personal observation from talking to people who have been coming to Phantom ranch for 10s of years, one observation it could be from trout removal or not but trout kind of prey on macroinvertebrates and so I think people notice more birds entering the area that are feeding upon flying insects that may be where otherwise have been consumed from trout. But now that niche has opened, more insects maybe include some more birds. Coming to think, the last Christmas bird count they got a high species richness count. Kate One of the concerns about the brown trout is they aren't just outcompeting native fish, they are eating everything in the creek, from the small native fish like speckled dace to those aquatic insects which start their lives underwater but become flying insects like caddis flies and mayflies. They are the base of the food chain for a lot of birds. One of the neat things that I've observed in my time down by Bright Angel Creek is over the past couple years, I'll never forget the first time I saw a great blue heron going through the creek and catching those little speckled dace minnows. The amazing thing is you likely would not have seen a heron there five years ago because the trout had eaten out their traditional food source. Bob I would say a benefit of trout removal is this expansion and really increasing numbers of native fish is an although some of these natives are endangered and still can't be angled in sportfish yet. I think one day that should be an ultimate goal because fish like the humpback chubs and round tail in the upper basin and maybe one day in Grand Canyon, the large native predator pikeminnow which could grow up to six feet long. I think that one day those fish could be very appealing to people to angle the native fish that evolved in this system. And for people who are trout enthusiasts I think there are plenty of places to go and fish for trout in their native range but one day I'd like to see Grand Canyon as a destination for anglers who are interested in fish diversity where it's found naturally and it would be the experience of a lifetime to catch a large pikeminnow in the Grand Canyon. For me that would be angling gold. Nick It is about 13 miles from the source all the way to the confluence of the Colorado River so it's pretty cool we get to start up in October basically starting at the source Rangel Creek actually consists of Roaring Springs and Angel Springs and we were fortunate enough to be able to shock up the entire length of Roaring Springs an Angel Springs in October and then by around February ish mid January we make it closer to the confluence and it's pretty cool because as we start up at the top at Angel Springs it's the leaves are starting to change and then throughout the season's working or wait downstream we dropped elevation chasing fall all the way down to confluence since it's kind of cool that you know we just work with the leaves as they change.  Kate As I went out on my winter backcountry patrols, I would look down on a team of women and men and waiters in their hands were yellow human sized ones that they would jab into the water. Nick excited about that the description just because anytime were shocking in the stream is 2 Electro Fishers so there's a it's a backpack base that you wear and there's two of 'em so they'll be two people wearing them should have followed by netters people getting fishes or shocked up in bucket or his people bucking fish that are netted anyway long story short people when they walk past us on the trail they make the job you probably hear this joke you know once a day twice a day but at least once a day that looks like we're Ghostbusters big square backpacks watching ghosts down there nude talk with them or tell about little bit about the project and what we're doing is really good public outreach Mike I feel like like we're walking on bowling balls. Bob What’s that show? American ninja warrior. Climbing over cascades, through overhanging vegetation and climbing up over waterfalls. It's pretty arduous getting up the creek and sometimes people can slip and top their waiders and you know, need to take 5 but it's it is an adventure getting up the creek.  Kate Working in fish crew requires a blend of wilderness skills and meticulous data collection. [Sound clip of collecting data with splashes and Enya playing in the background] Mike and Bob and Nick Well everyone, the whole teams in in the creek. You’ve got your two shockers up front and when the whole team's down there, you say, “Ok, everyone ready?” and then you say, “OK shocking!” You check your time and the shockers put their thumbs on the on the anodes button and we're off and any any trout that are within like an 8 foot radius of the the wand will be drawn into that anode ring at the end of the wand. And after, if they reached a distance from that they'll go…What's the word? Techne. But they just just like when they're knocked out. What’s a scientist word for knocked out can sort of pretend to understand. OK so they’re stunned once they get close enough and thankfully the creek is really clear and sometimes they might get stunned deep down or sometimes they shoot across the field but usually you can see them 'cause they got a white belly and they kind of flash and netters Test will scoop them up. Sometimes if you're in a big cloud of dace they'll just be flowing downstream like they look like leaves or something they just keep coming and coming and coming. But yeah, we're mostly just scooping every single fish we see and putting them into buckets filled with water. At least the natives get the buckets with fresh water and then next we dispatched the the trout and put them in the dead bucket for processing later. Yeah it's pretty exciting sometimes when the water is flowing pretty fast and in a group of there's five to eight of us in the stream and we're trying not to fall, we’re slipping around and then shout and Fisher shooting like 3 legs the waters fans were trying to net fish and or like hey  Kate For the past decade, fish crew would return each fall. Over time, what they found in their studies started to change. Bob So when this project was initiated in about 2012 trout both Brown and rainbow trout were the predominant fish species in the Creek and they were very dense so that over the course of a whole season more than 10,000 trout were removed whereas today we've succeeded in reducing trout by more than 95% and last winter we removed only around 300 Brown trout so that's very successful suppression effort and the other side of that coin is that we've seen a real rebound of native fish is both in numbers and in their range.  Kate 10,000 trout in the creek meant buckets of non-natives lined the creek. This is a huge success story in Grand Canyon. In today’s world, isn’t good to hear about a species coming back from the brink? Now finding a non-native fish can be it’s own challenge. It’s a big deal!  Ray It's pretty exciting sometimes when the water is flowing pretty fast and in a group of there's five to eight of us in the stream and we're trying not to fall. We’re slipping around and then trout and fish are shooting like through our legs. The waters running fast. We’re trying to net fish and or like, “Hey Mike!” is officially over there. Gets it. Jumps, jumps across the channel, scoops up the fish! I got that trout! I got that trout! And then it's pretty exciting, and then if we're up top like around Cottonwood, we maybe we haven't seen any native fish yet and where, you know, the water is flowing super-fast and we're trying not to fall again and, you know, these trout going between our legs. We’re netting. All of a sudden someone pulls up the net and there's a, there's a maybe a flannel mouth or bluehead sucker in there and we're like, “Yeah! first sucker of the season this is awesome and just kind of very exciting very exhilarating it's almost like it's almost like we're ghostbusting separate trout busting. Mike Trademark! Yeah, the trout are very, they're quick, so you can't. It takes awhile for you to hone in on like, just where do you stick your net when you see them? It's kind of, it's like a game almost, like tennis. I don't know, go for the head. Nick Or hockey, a lot of people who play hockey are pretty good at netting. Another thing too is with larger trout especially for entering a pool they can feel that electrical field before hand and it's often that they'll charge at us to try and break that field, so sometimes they won't actually. You have to bring you’re A-game if you want to catch those trout, and that's what our goal is. Mike Yeah, the big trout are the ones we're after because we're going in during spawning season and so we want to get the big ones that are carrying the most the eggs, you know, and the ones that are going to produce a lot of offspring. And so if we catch a big trout, that's that's a big deal that we're cutting out possibly hundreds of offspring that could be, you know, raised in the creek the following year. But also getting little ones is just as important. Mike Which brings us to the end of the day. So we're removing brown trout and rainbow trout from the creek and this kind of ugly part of the creek or the project, but also kind of cool. Every trout that is removed from the stream is used for beneficial use. We don't just, a lot of other removal projects you just throw the fish along the bank or sink 'em but every single trout that we take out of the creek either goes to human consumption or to aviaries at the Hopi and Zuni reservations. And so every fish we catch we are cleaning or bagging them and we're carrying them all the way back to the bunkhouse and putting in in vacuum sealed bags and freezing 'em and the next time the helicopter comes down we send them out. Kate What makes this fish program unique is that none of the trout are wasted. Each trout is used for beneficial use for people or other animals, and this was brought about in collaboration with Grand Canyon’s Traditionally Associated tribes. These are people groups that have called the canyon home for thousands of years. Many of the tribes expressed concerns about how the program was operating in a sacred space. Kate At this point, we're going to explore an oral history conducted by Paul Hirt of Arizona State University. We're going to listen to clips from his interview with Kurt Dongoske who has been involved with the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management program since 1991. Kurt was the director and principal investigator for the Zuni Cultural Resource Enterprise and often represents the Zuni tribe on issues related to River management. Kurt Anyways, so when I was at Zuni in 2008, um, a Zuni religious leader came in and asked me, “Are they still killing fish and the Grand Canyon?”…………….I said, yeah. He said, “That’s not right. They should stop that.” And I said, “Well, why?” And he explained to me, well he explained to me this story…..  Clip from Zuni in the Grand Canyon film The Eastern travelers came to the Little Colorado River where the Haiyutas warned them that as they crossed, they must hold their children tight. Then in the middle of the river, they children began to turn into water creatures. Fish, turtles, frogs, and snakes. Some parents dropped there children into the water where they were lost. They mourned but when they came to the place of the Co Co they heard singing. They were the spirits of their children. Thus all aquatic life are the ancestors and kin to the Zuni People. Kurt That event: that all aquatic beings are Zuni children, are viewed as Zuni children, whether they’re native or not native doesn’t matter. And so from a Zuni perspective, you are killing these fish, you are killing Zuni children. You’re killing beings that Zuni has a special relationship to.     Kurt I think there’s a lot of, a lot of benefit that western science could take from the Zuni perspective of this sense of stewardship in the sense that the environment that you’re dealing with is composed of multiple sentient beings and that your actions on that environment have consequences, long-term consequences. I think it would make scientists much more respectful of the animals they handle, how they treat them, how they deal with them, what sorts of projects they want to design.    Kate Let's hear from another oral history of Leigh Kuwanwisiwma who was director of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office for thirty years. He is the leader of the Hopi Tribe and has been involved in the Adaptive Management Plan in Grand Canyon on the river since around 1989. Leigh The big one is the electrocution of those trout. That was a big controversy initially to Hopi cause we were the only one who commented on that proposal. So our record stands that one the initial area that they were going to zap those trouts by the thousands was right at the Confluence, you know, a sacred site. A very sacred site to us. You know. And it encompasses this kind of concept of the spiritual domain. So, well, it’s our finality, as I told you, it was also the beginning of our spiritual life. I one day hope to become a Cloud Person to visit all of you people. That’s how we believe. So it’s the beginning of life for us. So, our [road noise]– I said to Kurt, you know how I would best explain it? Is that they kill all these fish. They’re taking life away from living creatures. And Hopi, when they do their prayer feathers and prayer offerings, it’s for the perpetuation of life. It’s not for the end of life. Nah. So even though that proposal had a purpose, because the effect on the humpback chub, and overpopulation, you know, it just didn’t sit well with me (road noise and wind noise). If they dare do that, it’s going to create this aura of death. That was our argument. Rebecca As many people know, Grand Canyon is sacred to a number of native tribes in the area. And our work was, you know, it, it has significant impact to, to non-native fish in Grand Canyon and that was of concern particularly to the Zuni tribe. The work that we're doing in Bright Angel Creek which is removing the brown and rainbow trout, was of concern to the Zuni Tribe. Their, a very sacred place to them is Ribbon Falls. And so it was through lots of consultation with them and other tribes that it was decided that all, all fish that we remove from, from Bright Angel Creek or, or otherwise, will be safe for human consumption. So all of the fish that we take out of Bright Angel Creek we clean and freezer seal and then we'll take that fish and it becomes, we’ll fly it out and it's available for, for others, you know to, for human consumption. We've delivered fish to Zuni as well as Hopi and Navajo. Some of the smaller fish that we remove from the creek that's not easily cleaned we’ll freeze and we’ll give that to tribes for their ceremonial eagles. And so we delivered fish to Zuni to their aviary, we've also delivered fish to Navajo to the zoo there. So we try you know, as much as it's feasibly possible, to, to save any of the fish that we, we take from the creek or the river and give, you know make it available for people or, or animals, other animals. So I think that's really important component of the work we do. You know there's just a lot a lot to consider when we do any kind of conservation or restoration work in Grand Canyon, and there's I think it's important to recognize the other, the tribes that hold it sacred. Kate The damage caused by Glen Canyon Dam is done. So now what do we do after the fact? How do we manage a degraded ecosystem? How do we protect the resulting endangered species and how do we do so as human beings with a respect for life? These are the negotiations we face. In December 2020, National Geographic published an article “Human Made Materials Now Equal Weight of All Life on Earth.” A quote from the article reads, “The total weight of everything made by humans from concrete bridges and glass buildings, to computers and clothes is about to surpass the weight of all living things on the planet.” Many theorize we are about to enter a new era, the Anthropocene, where humans are the dominant force shaping the planet. At the start of the 20th century, the mass of human created stuff weighed about 35 billion tons; today it's 1.1 trillion tons. That means every person generates more than their own body weight of manufactured stuff in one week. As countries across the world continue to develop in a global economy, over the next 20 years that stuff is predicted to double. Projects like Glen Canyon dam are exponentially growing all over the world. Creatures like the humpback chubs are being driven to the brink of extinction. Places like Grand Canyon National Park are some of the only safe havens left on earth for plants and animals, places they don't have to worry about crossing the road or having a house built in their backyard. Let's wrap up with a question we can all ask ourselves. How do you balance the stuff you need with cultivating a richer life?

            "transcript": "BOND: It came shortly after the Voting Rights Act was passed, when people began to push their politicians to enforce the law, to let people vote. We had several industrial plants in town that were unionized and completely segregated. Which is really hard for me to think of. Separate cafeterias, separate restrooms, separate lines that they worked on. The KKK had infiltrated these plants. Some of the leaders in the NAACP worked in these plants. When George Metcalf was the first who was advanced, the members of the KKK thought that an African American should not have that job. It should be a white man’s job. They blew up his truck in the parking lot. He was not killed. But that sparked protests of people meeting and marching to the city hall with lists of demands. Demands as radical as being called “Mrs. Smith” instead of “Jane.” As radical as being hired onto the police department and fire department and put on the school board. It was, you know, in fifty years retrospect completely reasonable, but radical at the time. <br><br> The governor sent in the National Guard to keep order. The African American community raised up a chapter of the Deacons for Defense and Justice to protect African American lives. There was real fear that there was going to be serious violence breaking out.<br><br> So, the first week in October, locals determined to march, even though the mayor had-- there was an ordinance that banned it. They left from African American churches. Didn’t even get down the street. They were put onto public school buses and taken to the city auditorium as a holding pen. And then in the dark of night, they were put back on buses. If they were older than twelve, they were driven more than five hours through the darkness to Parchman Penitentiary and kept in horrible, abusive conditions for three or four days, and then told that if someone could come get them, they could—they were never charged with a crime. It was a horrible, abusive—and when their families were going up to get them, some of them were stopped and threatened with their lives. Horrible thing.",

They'd last about a week, the batteries would, maybe they'd be fifteen, twenty batteries, all hooked together and they would last probably a week, and then you had an outfit that would charge the batteries. And you'd start that up and it would run all day long and then them batteries could last for another week. You had a telephone. They had what they called \"party lines\" and maybe they'd be twelve people on one party. Maybe they'd be two or three or four wanted to use it at the same time. Them women would get in a squabble over that, you know. They'd lie about they needed the phone to call a doctor or somethin’, in order to get on it you know, and all they wanted to do was talk to the neighbor or somethin’. And you had a bell on it and a little crank. You could call the people that was on your line. You could call them yourself. You didn't have to have an operator. If you had long distance, well then, you had to get ahold of the operator. And what you did, if it was a twelve party line, maybe they was twelve rings for that . . . to get that party to talk to 'em, you know. With this crank you'd make them rings. If they had twelve rings, you had a list of all of 'em. So that's the way the telephone worked at that time. Ronnie: Also, a twelve-party line, there were very few secrets in the community because whoever was talking, anyone could pick that receiver up and listen in.",

            "transcript": "Like the other clearings in the Wilderness, the fields around the farm of Widow Catherine Tapp were important ground for an army. While combat broke out at Saunders’ Field and the Higgerson Farm, and Union troops occupied the Chewning farm, Lee set up his headquarters for the coming fight here in Tapp’s fields. Situated along the Orange Plank Road, it was as good a place as any for Lee to lead his Army. Lee’s first objective for the area was the Brock Road intersection with the Orange Plank Road just a mile to the east of Widow Tapp’s. He was unaware of Crawford’s presence thanks to his inaction. Unfortunately for Lee, Meade realized the same thing as he gained a more complete picture of the battlefield into the late morning. While Hancock turned his Corps around and marched north to hook up with the rest of the Army, Meade also rushed George Washington Getty’s division of the US 6th Corps south to hold the intersection while Hancock reoriented. Shockingly stiff resistance from the 5th New York cavalry slowed the Confederate advance long enough for Getty to arrive, and Lee's golden opportunity started melting away. Lee pushed the lead division of AP Hill’s Confederate 3rd Corps to take the intersection, but Getty held firm. As reinforcements poured in, the Federals counter attacked. However, the fighting here devolved into the same bloody back and forth as at Saunder’s Field, neither army able to gain ground on the other before the setting sun put an end to the fighting on May 5th. Most importantly though, the Army of the Potomac was now reunited, and in control of both vital intersections. The Confederates were spread thin and disorganized. Overnight they choose not to reinforce their positions or reorganize their units. Assuming that Longstreet's Corps would arrive before the fighting renewed that morning, there seemed no need to worry. But when the sun rose on May 6th, Longstreet was nowhere to be seen. Instead, at 5:00 am, 20,000 Federal soldiers burst from the woods along the Brock Road and slammed like a hammer into the poorly prepared Confederates. Even worse for the Confederates, overnight, Meade had repositioned Wadsworth's division of the 5th Corps on the Confederate 3rd Corps' unprotected left flank. In concert with Hancock, the two groups were closing on the Confederates like a vice. Lee was forced to stand at his headquarters here on Tapp Field and watch as a third of his army disintegrated in front of him. Desperately trying to rally a defense before his entire army was lost, Lee lost his composure, yelling to one Confederate general as his men fled in disarray, \"My God, General McGowan, is this splendid brigade of yours running like a flock of geese?\" Before long, Federal troops began to appear on the edge of the Tapp Field clearing. The Confederate 3rd Corps was still in a general retreat; AP Hill became so desperate that he ordered Confederate artillery in the clearing to begin firing on the US troops, with Confederates still in the way. Twelve cannon forced to fire through their own men were now all that stood between the Confederate army and complete disaster. Lee had chosen to engage the US forces in the Wilderness, betting he could stop the Federal campaign much as he had done the year before on similar ground at the battle of Chancellorsville. Now it looked like he had led his Army to its doom. Just as all seemed lost Lee noticed a column of troops confidently marching up the Plank Road. An infusion of fresh infantry was exactly what he needed, so Lee rode up to them and asked who they were. “The Texas Brigade” came the answer from their commanding officer, General Gregg. Lee immediately ordered the Texans to charge, waving his hat in the air yelling “Texans always move them!” Caught up in the moment, Lee followed them as they advanced and prepared to charge into the Union onslaught. Noticing the army commander in their midst, the Texans stopped and called out “Go back General Lee go back!” The Confederacy lost one of its most famous generals, Stonewall Jackson, in these same woods a year ago, and the thought of losing another, worst of all Lee himself, was unacceptable. The Texans slowed their advance, and several tried to grab the reins of Lee’s horse and take him to the rear. But it was only when General Gregg requested Lee to retire that he left the front. As Lee turned to the rear he met with Longstreet, who was informed of Lee’s attempt to join the counterattack personally. Longstreet assured Lee that if left alone and given a free hand he would blunt the US assault and restore the Confederate lines. Finally convinced his presence was no longer needed, Lee moved further to the rear, leaving the details to his subordinates. Those details, it turned out, were simple but effective. Lining up his command on either side of the Orange Plank Road, Longstreet launched them against the US attackers in unrelenting waves. The first brigades to charge took horrific losses. Gregg’s Texas Brigade, whom Lee almost followed into the fight, went in with 800 men and came out with less than 250.",

            "transcript": "\"A disease of devastating proportions has swept the nation!\" Such were the headlines in the early 1900's as the chestnut blight fungus worked its way across eastern North America, leaving only the dead and dying of its tree victims behind. The fungus was accidentally introduced to the forest through Japanese chestnut tree shipments to the United States. This deadly fungus dramatically transformed the composition of eastern and mid-Atlantic forests. Native to Rock Creek Park, the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is now rare as a mature tree due to this disease. Previously a dominant tree in the forests of the eastern United States, the American chestnut was known for its rot-resistant lumber and production of wildlife-supporting chestnuts. It was an essential component of eastern U.S. forest ecosystems, providing food for a wide variety of wildlife, like bears, deer, and the now extinct passenger pigeon. People harvested the chestnuts for food and built cabins from the logs. It is even speculated that chestnuts were eaten at the first Thanksgiving! It's estimated that the chestnut blight killed about 4 billion trees. Because the root system of the tree has some resistance against the infection and there are viruses that attack the fungus, you may see the American chestnut as a young shoot growing from root crowns or bases in Rock Creek Park. Unfortunately, few of these shoots reach the reproductive stage to produce chestnuts before being killed by the fungus. While the restoration of the American chestnut to our forests is still a far-off goal, some organizations like the American Chestnut Foundation work to seek out and create hybrid, blight-resistant American chestnut trees. Maybe one day, this proud tree will thrive in our nation's parks once again.",

Today, black bears and other wildlife congregate along the creek to feast on the first sprouts of spring. As early as April, visitors with binoculars may be able to spot feeding bears from the highway overlooks. Gazing up at the surrounding peaks, you can follow snowmelt as it cascades down their weathered slopes before racing through the colorful chasm. Although no trails enter Little Hot Springs Valley, you can enjoy the cool mist of the rushing creek as it tumbles 70 feet over Mill Creek Falls. The 3.2-mile round-trip trail can be easily accessed from the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center.",

            "transcript": "Ranger: Welcome to We Will Rise: National Parks and Civil Rights. Close your eyes and imagine a National Park. Are you picturing waterfalls and mountains, or do you think of Dr. King's childhood home, Japanese internment camps, or a school that became a battleground for racial integration? National Parks aren't just wilderness. They are spaces of remembrance founded to preserve the stories of who we are and how we came to be. National parks inspire us to do better, be better. To climb mountains both physical and figurative. Join park rangers, researchers, authors and activists as we discuss what liberty and justice for all means on our public lands. The following episode features an interview with Dr. Glenn Eskew, author of the book, But for Birmingham. The first 30 minutes are detailed synopsis of the book. If you haven't read it, this is a great opportunity for a deep dive. If you have read it or just want to listen to the author interview, skip to minute 30. Ranger Kat: So I'm so thrilled to be speaking with you about your book, But for Birmingham: the Local and National Movements in the Civil Rights Struggle. And I have to say just a couple of days ago, an uncle of mine teaches African American history at a college in Michigan, and he and his wife sent us a bunch of books about African American history in the region. And one of the books he sent us was your book wonderful? Dr. Eskew: Wonderful! Ranger Kat: Yeah. And I haven't spoken to him about it yet, but I can't wait to message him and say, guess who I spoke to today? Your book has traveled far and wide and is one of the books that really, I think, does an incredible job of explaining the movement in Birmingham, a really overall incredible, incredible summary, but also really gets into the details. And I've had the good fortune of reading it. But I'm wondering for those who haven't read it, if you could give us a couple of minutes of a synopsis of the book? Dr. Eskew: Sure. And what I would do and sketching out the story is begin by setting the stage of looking at Birmingham. Most people are aware that it's a city rooted in industry, that was founded after the Civil War. So it has no Antebellum past, no official history with quote the enslavement of people, and was rather born of the brash New South, with foreign capital coming in to invest and extract the mineral wealth from the region. And that aspect of that, that story is accurate up through really the civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 60s. And so it helps to frame the story within the context of the iron and steel industry. Because the iron and steel industry, while it was not premised in enslavement, it used a racially divisive bifurcated wage to exploit labor for the benefit of the industrialists. White people ended up earning about twice as much as Black people. That goes back to after the war, all the way up to the civil rights era. And so if you begin to comprehend that the story is rooted in economic exploitation that used race to divide people and to take advantage of them economically, then you can see how folks got so vested in maintaining segregation. White people who saw it is their only way to get an advantage, and African Americans as the barrier that's keeping them from gaining access. And it's within that framework that we find the civil rights struggle itself. Now the movement comes about in the post-World War II era. It's led by, the modern civil rights movement is led by ministers, people in churches who are, by virtue of that, independent of white authorities and white business owners. So they're able to speak with that kind of independent voice. And these Church leaders were articulating the goals and aspirations of their members, members who wanted in the post-World War II period to gain access to the system, to get the better things in America that were being mass produced, now that the country had defeated the Nazis and Japan and created American hegemony. And to get that, they recognize the need for education, the need to get into schools that were adequately supported. And the civil rights movement then clearly reflects this expression of desire to gain access to the system across the board, both economically and politically and socially, all lumped into the notion of integration. In Birmingham, that movement, which was really kind of a new reflection, was symbolized by the work of the Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, a group formed in 1956 that brought together the activist members of the city's NAACP chapter that had really been kind of moribund. Shuttlesworth, when he moved to the city, he was a native of the city, well, he had grown up in Birmingham, he had left, but came back after the Second World War when he was brought in as pastor at Bethel Baptist Church in Collegeville, which was a prominent Black church in Birmingham. And as pastor of that congregation, he became active in the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as its membership chairman, working to recruit people into the organization. But the state of Alabama in 1956 hands down a ruling trying to get the membership records of the NAACP. And in the process, the organization decided to close its doors in Alabama rather than identify the people who were in it, knowing that they would be the targets then of white supremist violence. And so when the NAACP got outlawed, Shuttlesworth decided to create a new group. Well, in many ways, there had already been pushing within the NAACP to reflect this kind of activism. But Shuttlesworth was particularly charismatic man, and he believed that God was helping him fight segregation and that he was, in a sense, especially after he survived the bombing of the Church, Bethel Baptist and the Parsonage on Christmas night of 1956, believed that God had saved him to fight against segregation. Now, he had attended Alabama State University in Montgomery. He was friends with Ralph David Abernathy. Abernathy is a key pastor involved with the Montgomery bus boycott. He's the one who encouraged his friend at that point, Martin Luther King, Jr. to get involved in the bus boycott. King, of course, gets selected to lead the MIA. And Shuttlesworth was actually in Montgomery witnessing all of this taking place in 1955 when the organization is formed. Consequently, he takes that idea with him up to Birmingham in 1956. And it's through his Alabama Christian Movement that we see the nascent civil rights movement in the city accomplish its successes, challenging segregation at the railroad depot, challenging Birmingham Terminal station it was called, challenging segregation with the effort to desegregate the public schools, this occurring during the height of the Little Rock crisis in 1957. When the bus boycott decision is handed down the year before in Montgomery, in December of 56, Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement announced they're going to ride the buses in Birmingham in a desegregated fashion because the courts have ruled that legal, and it's on that night that the Klan bombs the Church and Parsonage and nearly killed Shuttlesworth. He really reflected that desire for change, and as a charismatic leader, was willing to risk his life to achieve those goals of gaining equal access to the American system, ending segregation and achieving first class citizenship, as it was called. The movement, though, kind of runs along. Because of its emergence in 1957, Bull Connor, who had been the city Commissioner since the 1930s and had gained a reputation for at first preventing biracial unionism and then resisting desegregation, had been able to come back into political power just barely by something like 110 votes. He beat the incumbent who had replaced him in office and Connor returned to power as the Commissioner of Public Safety basically vowing to defeat Shuttlesworth in the Alabama Christian movement. The larger, one of the larger arguments in the book is to contrast this local struggle with the national movement. Now, when I started the research back in the 1980s, there was a general assumption about the Birmingham story that Dr. King had come to Birmingham, created a movement, and had a strategy that played out as he envisioned, forcing the hand of the federal government to then declare desegregation. And that general narrative, written by journalists and by some of the early scholars, never really looked at what happened on the local level, downplayed the significance of Reverend Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement and really kind of misinterpreted the story, seeing civil rights as an external thing that came into communities, a national movement brought into local protests. In that sense, it played into the old arguments of the white supremists who tried to dismiss the civil rights struggle as one of outside agitators. But the reality was, of course, that no, there had been a local movement, this local movement demanding change had existed before Montgomery and had really come about in tandem with the effort there with the bus boycott, so that there were a series of these local movements that came together to create what will be called the Southern Christian Leadership Conference SCLC and select Dr. King to lead it. And that effort by Dr. King was to coordinate these local protest groups. Now there had already been a national movement in what you would call the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It had existed since 1910 and had focused on voting rights and other kinds of reform, pushing legislation with the federal government. And it had chapters in Birmingham and elsewhere, that’s what the state had outlawed. But those were really tightly controlled by the external organization in New York, and they largely worked within the framework of segregation. They kind of compromised with a larger segregated social structure to accommodate the interests of the Black elite that ran the organization. What Shuttlesworth does is challenge that and the Black elite in Birmingham, what was called at the time the Negro leadership class. The traditional Negro leadership class didn't control Shuttlesworth or these ministers of these congregations of these Black working class people who were demanding a more activist approach. That's the organization, the Alabama Christian Movement, that invites King and the SCLC to come to Birmingham in the spring of 1963. They created the great event we know of as the Birmingham Demonstrations, where Bull Connor brings out the police dogs at first and tries to use violence to suppress the demonstrations, ultimately turning to fire hoses to blast the youth who get involved in the demonstrations and tip the scale in the end to achieve the victory won in the streets of Birmingham. And that larger story that we know of also points to something fundamental that I argue in the book. And just quite simply, that is, the old iron and steel industry was in decline. The political economy of the south has been changing since the 1930s and 40s. The Great Depression and the Second World War: those 2 global events had brought about the end to the industrial paternalism that was the basis of the bifurcated race wage, the segregated system. And once that industrial economy began to collapse, that segregated social structure no longer made sense. And the bifurcated race wage that justified paying white people a little more than Black was increasingly impractical. What was replacing it was a potentially new economy, one rooted in the service sector that saw racism as a kind of irrationality on capitalism, and as a result, was willing to sacrifice segregation for the benefit of a larger, integrated economy. There was more to be gained. “Money is green,” as A.G. Gaston, the Black millionaire in Birmingham, liked to say. And there were representatives of that new political economy, recognizing what was going on in Birmingham and seeing how a defensive racism was really holding the city down, limiting its evolution and development and mobilized against it. That effort was led by a man named Sidney Smyer, who was the head of the Birmingham Realty Company, real estate being one of the key elements of the service sector, where you rent space for your business or commercial enterprise. And Smyer mobilized likeminded progressives, people, many of whom were inspired by John F. Kennedy in this era of the space age and opportunity. Smyer mobilized them to at first change the form of government to try to get rid of Bull Connor. And this was accomplished by adopting legislation to replace the City Commission with the Mayor Council form of government. Connor challenged that defeat of his election as Mayor by filing a lawsuit against the very change of government that he had just run for Mayor off. But it tied it up in the courts, and it left two governments in charge of Birmingham at the height of the demonstrations. One, the old City Commission, with Connor still in charge of the police and the fire departments, and the other, the new City Government of a Mayor and City Council. They kind of duplicated their actions day after day. And so you see, Birmingham itself was undergoing a very significant transformation. And then finally, what the book looks at that was distinctive about it, too, is how the Black community was no more monolithic than the white community. White people had long seen the Black community is kind of monolithic, meaning that there weren't really distinctions or divisions within it per se. Rather than seeing the Black community as divided as the white one with an elite Black class kind of dominating institutions, and the Black masses of people working in these menial jobs, and the two not necessarily having the same interest at heart. Such was the case, certainly, with the white community. There was a white elite in Birmingham. There was the white working class in Birmingham, and there was a middle class and a kind of petty bourgeoisie between the working class and the middle class in Birmingham. And they all had different interests in seeing the city function. The white elite, as residents of the city know full well, live in the privately incorporated communities of Mountain Brook and Vestavia Hills, and Homewood. And that's where they lived at the time of the civil rights struggle. The white working class was scattered across the entire industrial sector of Birmingham, the Birmingham district it's called. And there was a kind of middle class that if it didn't live over the mountain, it lived in the city proper, but had vested interests in maintaining segregation. That was the electorate of Bull Connor, and he would pull a majority of it. These were people who held their jobs as firemen or policemen or clerks in the city government or staff at a local store because they were white, because they were given that privilege, and so they had a vested interest in maintaining it. Now, looking back, we can see how this all came together in the demonstrations of 1963, and through federal intervention, we get desegregation, which brings about an end to the legal white supremacy that required the separation of Black and white, got rid of justifying the bifurcated race wage that allowed legal payment of white people more than Black people for the same job. That got rid of disenfranchisement, preventing African Americans from voting, and enabled them to gain Black political empowerment. We can see how all that played out. But what we also can see now is that the service economy emerged full blown, that that transformation allowed for things like the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the medical school to expand and become the dominant employer in the city, bringing with it those dynamic jobs in the medical industries that employed people regardless of their race and still exploited labor. But did it through different means. It wasn't simply rooted in race, and that transfer information becomes more clear. And the economy then became in sync with really the national economy that had evolved by the time of the Second World War and was the case across the nation by the Sixties and and Seventies. The protest in Birmingham also brought to a head this clash between local and national interests. And one thing my book argues that some people agree with and others disagree with is the idea that the local movement led by Shuttlesworth did not appear to receive its objectives in the immediate outcome of the demonstration. And then, in fact, as the protests were playing out in May of 1963, it looked as if Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC had been able to wrestle out of a snatch victory at the very last moment by convincing the federal government to intervene and therefore achieve desegregation. And Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement had been holding out for a wider transformation of the system. In some ways, that argument is rooted in the notion of the protests, really, in the even in the 1930s, when during the unionization drives the Great Depression, there were calls for what was known as industrial democracy, getting better jobs that paid living wages, economic change in the system with a redistribution of wealth. And yet, as things evolved by the 1950s and 60s, the economic issues have been pushed off the table, and reform has really kind of centered on the idea of civil rights, meaning an end to discrimination in the public sphere. Getting rid of the white and colored signs, having a seat at the lunch counter. But as Ella Baker would note, you know, if you don't have the money to buy the hamburger, it doesn't do you a lot of good to get the seat, right? And so Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement had been pushing for getting African Americans hired as policemen, getting them hired as clerks in the local stores, gaining economic change in addition to removing the signs. But it appeared in ‘63 that King was able to end the demonstrations with the promise that something was going to change. And so that feeling of shortcoming became very real. And the book’s epilogue points to this shortcoming in its persistence. And this is what we're hearing today. It's all about the failure of the movement to have addressed the fundamental issue of economic inequality. To be fair to the Movement, that wasn't always part of the effort. The local and national movements struggled because the national movement claimed the victory of change and left Birmingham, King did, and as it happens, he kind of left in charge people like AG Gaston or Lucius Pitts at Miles and certainly Arthur Shores, members of the Black elite and kind of left Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement out of that leadership, Black leadership that was working with the white one. And we'll see Attorney Shores then become the first African American on the city Council. And we see the Black elite having been able to work within the desegregated framework that emerges of political leadership in the city that's in the 19, latter Sixties and Seventies. But the issue of economic reforms became more ambiguous. And the epilogue of the book kind of points to that. When the logic of how the civil rights movement occurs, removing the signs, gaining equal access, desegregating the space, plays out at Shoal Creek, an exclusive white country club south of the city that not only didn't let black folk in, didn't let Jewish people in, wouldn't let you were me in or anybody else who's just white and happens to maybe you're a nice guy, but if you're not a millionaire, you can't join my club. Right. And the logic for the movement was, well, until you let some African American in and treat them as equal, then your not, of course, it's not an equal set up. It's a class thing. And it really pointed to instead, we have gross inequality in this nation. It persists. It existed back then, and the movement didn't really mobilize to tackle it like it might have. There had been an effort in the 1930s, but it had failed. Nevertheless, the changes that occurred in Birmingham in 1963 were of not only national significance but global significance, because those demonstrations, those nonviolent protests that kept going because of a handful of people committed for weeks and ultimately tipping the scale with the thousands of people who filled the streets and filled the jails. That transformation did bring about the end legal white supremacy in the nation through the implementation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that required desegregation of public space, the right to sit at a lunch counter or a restaurant, assuming you have the money, the right to vote and participate in the political system, of the right to go to the school that you want to go to. That change happened. And it happened because of Birmingham. Ranger Kat: Thank you. And you brought up a lot of things that hopefully will have time to discuss later. But before we go into some of the details of the book, I want to ask you a personal question. I did some Googling and looked into you as a person. And I know you've been working and living in Georgia for a number of years as a College Professor and researcher and author, of course. And I'm curious if you're from the south, and just in general, what spurred this deep interest in looking so in depth at the story in Birmingham? Dr. Eskew: Sure. Yes. I'm a native Southerner, although I was born in 1960, so these events happened when I was in diapers, and I was not aware of any of it when it was taking place. But I became fascinated with the idea of Southern history and the transformation of it. And so I wanted to explore that story. And my approach was to find somewhere that would allow me to consider how the south went from being the region of agricultural production of cotton, the old plantation, labored on by the enslaved. How did that change into the dynamic south that we saw in the 80s when I was in graduate school in a place like Atlanta, o,r as my major professor encouraged me, to look at Birmingham, and so I did. And looking at Birmingham was able to not only explore that transformation, because in many ways, Sloss furnaces, the Alice furnaces, and the housing near it on the south side, those were industrial plantations. This is not that different from what you would find in Dallas County, outside Selma or anywhere else in the Deep South. And indeed, the culture of industrial paternalism that developed in Birmingham was very similar to the culture of the plantation itself. And so finding that and then seeing how it was completely transformed by the 1980s was the challenge for me. And Atlanta offered a great contrast with Birmingham, because Birmingham was a company town and the big horse, not the only horse, but it was the main horse in town, was the United States Steel Corporation, locally, the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. And as a result of that, it controlled town like any small Southern County seat that has a textile mill in it. The mill would control town. Here we find the industry being controlled by this entity, and it was externally owned. It was owned by shareholders in New York and in Pennsylvania and around the world. And that undue influence of external forces, this outside control, created its own dynamic of inferiority among the white elite in Birmingham who, you know, they didn't really control their destiny. They were trapped within it. Unlike in Atlanta, where Atlanta, you had this interesting mix. It had manufacturing. It also had service. It had transportation, and those elements were all in kind of balance. And so there wasn't a single economic structure or entity or industry or political economy that dominated Atlanta. The diversity allowed for a greater influence of local people and Atlanta had the good fortune of indigenous capital, that is, money generated in the region that was put in local banks and control by local people that could then benefit the local community. Unlike Birmingham, where the money was really externally brought in and then taken right back out with interest through profits. Ranger Kat: I want to ask you a question about money and the role that money plays in racism. One of the things that I found incredibly well researched in your book was the economic disadvantage that's woven into racism. And you mentioned just a moment ago, it's one thing to take down signs that delineate where African Americans can go and where white people can go. It's another to be able to access a system that is financially just out of your league. You mentioned the quote by Ella Baker, and you know how she said, there's no use at gaining a seat at the table if you don't have any money to buy anything at the restaurant, which I think is an excellent quote. And you also mentioned, too, how obvious that disparity was if you look back at what salaries were like. And in your book, for example, in 1950, the average annual salary for a white man was $2274, and the average for a black man was $1,087. These are annual salaries. I'm wondering, why is it important to remind people that racism isn't about signs? It's not about name calling. It's about economic disenfranchisement. Why is that important? And why is that often not discussed? Dr. Eskew: Oh, that's an excellent question and a hard one. And I'll begin by also emphasizing Ella Baker observation that it's bigger than a hamburger. Right? So it's more than just economic. These gains in the sense that civil rights reform and an end to racial discrimination, of course, has all kinds of implication for reflection of self-worth and value and just the whole notion of equality among people and freedom. True freedom. So I don't want to sound like it's simply a matter of economic issues or that it's simply a matter of spatial issues, of gaining actual space to something like being able to sit at the lunch counter. However, the reality is that political economies often use divisions for purposes of exploitation. One of the maximum principles of capitalism is you reduce cost and you can increase profits. And one of the easiest ways to reduce cost is to lower wages. And this could be, in the case we're looking at with the struggle in Birmingham it's over race, but it's also seen in gender, with gender discrimination in employment. We're still trying to get the Equal Rights Amendment past to pay women the same wage as men. And as we've seen in this pandemic, the gross inequalities in wages that women earn and the terrible situation in which they find themselves so vulnerable because of the pandemic as a result of the employment opportunities that they confront. So it could be written from the perspective of these industrialists, places like Pittsburgh were rife with ethnic discrimination. And you had had some of that in Birmingham with Italians who had been brought in to work in the iron and steel industry in the Birmingham district being discriminated kind of in between Asians, same way, in between Black and white. But the bigger crux in the bigger point is simply that economies often use tactics such as racism to divide workers. And I think it's no surprise that we can apply many of these lessons that I discovered, so clearly evident in the Birmingham of the 1950s and 60s to the recent past we've just experienced. ow racism is used to divide workers. I think we could even go so far as to see our nation currently confronting a declining old economy like the iron and steel one in in Birmingham, only today, it's the Petroleum based economy, which is not just the gas pump, mind you, it's the banks that finance all of that. It's the insurance companies that prop it all up. It's the plastic industries and then the use of plastics by consumers and manufacturers, all that's coming out of petroleum, all of that reflective of this economy that is no longer sustainable in our changing environmental situation. We see evidence of that being propped up. And yet we also see a new economy that's proposed that is transnational or global, if you like, that is driving a different kind of focus, that being one of renewable energies that creates its own dynamic for jobs and opportunities in progress. Those two political economies are currently at war. And the question is, in the end, which is going to win out. And we know deep down the petroleum one's going to die. We're going to run out of petroleum. Well, likewise, the use of race can be used in that old political economy. And I think that's why, in part, we've seen efforts to emphasize racial division and our recent political climate. Ranger Kat: I'd like to ask you about the role of women, the LGBTQ+ community, differently-abled folks, in both the local and the national movement. I think, especially in the Birmingham campaign, where you have these really charismatic leaders like Shuttlesworth and Dr King, it's easy to focus the Movement and what they accomplished on their ability to lead. But through reading your book and understanding more of the movement, it really was this diverse movement of many. I mean, you mentioned the Children's Crusade and how that was sort of the tipping point, an inflection point in the Movement. How seeing these foot soldiers, some as young as six years old marching in the streets, really sort of shifted federal policy. But there were also folks like Ella Baker who we've quoted now a couple times, and students at Miles College who were really sort of encouraging this direct action campaign rather than the rhetoric that was more common among national leaders. And I'm wondering if you could maybe mention some women or some other diverse individuals who feel really contributed to the Movement that maybe we don't hear about, and maybe we should talk about more and hear about more. Dr. Eskew: Well, Ranger Gardiner, you just pointed out the big flaw in the book, I'm afraid. I did not give women enough credit in the narrative and that I fully believe is a result of being attracted to the charisma of Reverend Shuttlesworth and other African American male leaders, particularly in the church, who are the typical ones we seem to think of in this period of the Movement. But Ella Baker was very familiar with Alabama, having for years worked with the NAACP, mobilizing chapters and running voter registration campaigns in the state. And I would really call out several names, number one, for the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, it's true success, it wasn't just Reverend Shuttlesworth in his charisma or his, quote, lieutenants like Bishop Calvin Woods and his brother Abraham or some of the other pastors. But it was Miss Lola Hendrix, an African American woman who helped keep the records and who ran the telephone tree that was integral to the Movement’s success. She would be tipped off by Reverend Shuttlesworth that he wanted to hold a meeting or that there would be someone at a mass meeting that he wanted the community to hear. And she would get on the phone and use that phone to contact other women who contacted other women who contacted other women. And everyone then materialized, at Shuttlesworth’s request, but it was a role of the women that accomplished that. And it's the women who are demonstrating as well as the men. Men might have led the March, but they're women participating in it. And I think of young women students during the Children's Crusade of 1963. Myra Carter Jackson was one of the great one of the great foot soldiers of this effort. And yet her family had gotten involved years before with the Alabama Christian Movement, before the Children's Crusade came about. And she had been participating in these mass meetings. And then when the children marched, she was right out there marching, as was Janice Wesley Kelsey. She, too, was a student who got recruited into the Children's Crusade and then demonstrated. And I have in the book there are a couple of white people, like Martha Turnipseed, a white woman who was a student at Birmingham-Southern who was interested in the idea of what's going on here with this civil rights protest. She attends a demonstration. Tommy Reeves, a seminarian, gets involved and just shows sympathy, and white Methodist authorities run him out of town. I think Turnipseed got expelled from Birmingham-Southern. So young people and women are really the key to the success. And in the end, it really is that crowd of young folk in the Children's Crusade that forces the change. But I would add, if it hadn't been for Reverend Shuttlesworth and that Alabama Christian Movement, that group of churches scattered around the Birmingham District that met on Monday nights, week after week after week in mass meetings since 1956, had he not kept that going, there never would have been a Birmingham demonstration to attract all those students and protesting in May of ‘63 to begin with. And I believe it was Andrew Young who, coming into Birmingham and confronting this really shocked that Dr King discovered when he got there in April, that not all of the Black ministerial leadership was behind Reverend Shuttlesworth, that the Black community was not united in support of the demonstrations, as had been the case in Montgomery with the bus boycott. Young would say that it was only about 10% of the churches, Black churches in Birmingham, that were actively in the movement, and that's the reality of it. But what that tells me and should tell everyone is it never will be everybody getting involved. It's always that committed core, that dedicated few who don't give up, who keep fighting, who make the change. And I think we see that time and again in history. Ranger Kat: So I thought to ask you more in depth questions about that push and pull between the national and the local movement. But I think you did a really excellent job summarizing that initially, as well also as the ambiguity of the ending of the Birmingham campaign. But I'm wondering, there's a moment in the epilogue, which you titled Ambiguous Resolution, which I think kind of says it all, where you mention the story of the integration of Birmingham's Shoal Creek Country Club in 1990. I believe I'm calling it the right name, and you mentioned it briefly in your summary. But I'm wondering if you could go more into detail as to what happened and why, for you, that's kind of emblematic of the source of changes it actually took place in Birmingham and how, for the Black masses, a lot of those changes were more symbolic rather than material. So I'm wondering if you could explain that one case study and may be connect it to the larger story of what happened as a result of the movement in Birmingham. Dr. Eskew: I'll try if I don't get it right, ask me again on another day, and I'll, I'll actually get through reading that epilogue again. Ranger Kat: [laughter] Fair enough. Dr. Eskew: And get to that. But Ambiguous Resolution, I think, points to why we're still having problems today. And for a lot of people, certainly in the white community, I believe their attitude has been, “we solved this already with the civil rights movement,” and the reality is the movement was successful. I don't want to suggest anything else in the sense that, as Congressman John Lewis was oft to say, “all you have to do is go back and look and see what it was like when we started and see what things are like today. And you'll see the change.” There has been dramatic change in the 50 years since the demonstration. We no longer have spaces that are demarcated white and colored. We no longer have laws that are designed to project onto society white supremacy. All of that was removed through the Civil Rights Act 1964, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and we received a great deal of support through Black political empowerment accomplished by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Yet what we've seen is the erosion of those rights in voting by new strategies of disfranchisement and voter suppression that are rampant today. And yet taking away the vote of someone is not the same thing as forcing them to sit on the back of a bus. Right? Those are separate things. Alright. So ambiguous resolution really points to the fact that the civil rights movement didn't address because, quite frankly, it was outside the purview of it economic inequalities, the persistence of that. It did try to resolve the problem of vested racism and white supremacy in institutions. And yet I would suggest your readers if they make it through the chapter on Bull’s Birmingham, and they discover how horrific police brutality was in Birmingham with the legal lynchings, they were called. The justifiable homicides of unarmed Black men by white policemen in 1950s Birmingham. How's that different than today? Right? This is nothing new. And of course, the violence is used just to really kind of prop up law and order. The law and order designed to protect private property and economic interests. Only today it's not denying someone access to the shopping mall. Everybody can go in the mall. Right? Doesn’t d you any good if you don't have any money. And so in the ambiguous resolution epilogue, I kind of point to, and in some ways it's unfair of me to, suggest that Abraham Woods and the local Black leadership is up in arms over the need to have an African American millionaire admitted to a private white country club on the outskirts of town as a symbolic gesture that yes, indeed, we are all equal. I understand why they did it. And I understand the logic that led them to that point, being the logic of the civil rights struggle, gaining equal access to the system. Now, to be fair, in the civil rights era, that meant the public sphere, things that were open to the public in general, private places were left out of the realm of this sphere. What you do in your private community is your business. If you want to be a Church that does not allow Black people in your Church because you believe in the Church of white supremacy. And somehow you can rationalize that with your, quote, Christianity. It's a private entity. Right? But it pointed to the hypocrisy that was the reason Kneel-Ins were held at white churches during the civil rights movement. How dare you express Christian belief and not extend the welcoming hand to your Black brothers and sisters? Well, Shoal Creek was a country club which still exists south of Birmingham, a beautiful space that had an outstanding golf course that was so impressive it had been able to attract the PGA, the international golfing competition. And this too points to the kind of the contradictions of the larger transformation. It pointed to Birmingham's success. The success of having weathered ‘63, undergone racial change, created a brand new dynamic service economy that was no longer rooted in the filthy, racist iron and steel industry, but now expressive of a dynamic medical industry and education and progress and thinking and the whole consumption and all of that stretch from 65 to 280 and in between that you can see south of town suggested that. Economic growth, progress, the change that the city had experienced and slap in the middle of it: Shoal Creek. And here it was hosting this international spotlight, and the founder of the country club, Hall Thompson, made the mistake of saying that, “well, we let everybody in here except the Blacks,” right? And consequently, the protests began and understandably so. And in the end, Shoal Creek desegregates by allowing an African American member, a member of the Black elite in Birmingham, to become a member of the Country Club. And through that, desegregation really provided a similar kind of resolution to what had occurred initially in ‘63. It didn't change the lives of any of the Black masses of folk trapped in the inner city of Birmingham in public housing that was increasingly being bull-dozed in slum areas with limited opportunities, in schools that were struggling to to educate the students, and in a new dynamic political economy that without an education, left you with limited job opportunities. And I would dare say that one could suggest we still confront these problems today. Ranger Kat: I think many would agree with that. So I wanted to ask you a question about the role of children in the Birmingham campaign and segue into a question about a message to young people today. And I think that your conversation around this ambiguous resolution is a good segue in that there's more work to do, there's more work to be done, and that's kind of how the book ends. When I finished the book, I'll admit I felt sad. I felt frustrated. I felt like I wasn't given the resolution that we’re often given and more simplistic narratives about the civil rights movement. And I both appreciated you for that and also felt, again, that sense of frustration and like, wow, what was it, what truly was accomplished materially, economically, because it still seemed in your appraisal that the financial political situation in Birmingham remained very fraught. So, something that is, I think, really inspiring about the Birmingham Campaign is the role that children played in the Children's Crusade predominantly. And today we're seeing another resurgence of young people who are incredibly involved in trying to make the world a better place, whether that's racial justice, climate change, etcetera. And I'm curious, based on your deep historic knowledge of social movements, specifically civil rights in the South, would you say that the involvement of young people is critical to that success. And then, given that there is obviously still work to be done, what is your message to young people today who want to make changes for the better? Dr. Eskew: Young people hold the key. They're the ones who have the most to gain. If you consider the role of the youth in Birmingham, coming in at just the right moment, the crucial time with the Children's Crusade in May of ‘63, and they were brought in in part because of the leaders of the struggle, Dorothy Cotton, one of Dr. King's key staff members, James Bevel, Isaac Reynolds, Ike Reynolds. These folks worked with those young people, training them in nonviolence. But young folks are committed, and they're willing to work and put their necks out to gain change. And we see that in the Black Lives Matter effort today. It's young people who are driving the demand for change in race relations in America today, who are pushing to force reconciliation with the past, to come to terms with America's legacy as a white supremacy nation, and to address those inequalities that persist, recognizing how racism has functioned for so long, to hurt so many people. And if we look at the civil rights struggle as a whole, the real push at key moments that kept it moving forward was that of young people. We often think of the Brown versus Board of Education case with Linda Brown. It's her father who files the lawsuit. But I like to point to Moton High School in Virginia, which is also one of the five cases that made up the Brown decision. There we find the students themselves walking out of their school because of the inequality that they experienced in that facility, the failure of the local community, the white school board, to provide African American youth with educational facilities that would enable them to be prepared for the future. It's the Little Rock students who confront the violence and hostility of the white mob as they bravely continue to participate in the year-long process of desegregating Central High. And while after Montgomery, Dr. King and other civil rights leaders in local communities like Reverend Shuttlesworth and elsewhere across the south mobilized the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It really kind of spun its wheels, this national movement, looking at replicating what the NAACP had been doing, holding voter registration drives, waiting to come to the aid of a demonstration or protest like Montgomery had been, something that erupted organically, in a sense, out of a local community. And it's the students who are the ones, the young people who create those opportunities. They do it with the sit-in movement in Greensboro, North Carolina, on February 1, 1960, when four black men from North Carolina A&T sit down at a Woolworths and refuse to leave, demanding equal access to service. It's young people like John Lewis, who is a seminarian in Nashville, volunteers to participate in the first Freedom Ride that it is civil rights organizations that mobilize it, CORE, Congress Of Racial Equality, but it's young people like John Lewis who volunteers and gets on that Freedom Ride and gets beat up on that Freedom Ride. And when the original ride is called off after Birmingham, it's young people from Nashville who had organized to sit-in movement led by Diane Nash and others, who come to Birmingham to continue the Freedom Ride and to maintain that dynamic. It's young people from around the nation who to join in Freedom Fides and get arrested, white and black, and be sent up to Parchment Prison in Mississippi, it’s young people that bring in that demand for change time and again. And it's the same story we see today. I think it's clear not just in Black Lives Matter, but Greta Thunberg and others who are pushing the demand for change on the environment. They're doing so because they know full well that world they're inheriting, and either it's going to be scorched or or it's going to be livable. And similarly, America has to come to grips with its history and address the wrongs of the past. That was really the final outgrowth of Dr. King's strategy of nonviolence. It wasn't just to have a demonstration and then to affect change at the local level. It was also to accomplish a reconciliation, to come to terms with the past and to create what he called the beloved community, a world in which we all can live. And humanity has lots of examples of the need to come together or confront annihilation. We used to hear more frequently about nuclear weapons and disarmament, and that's been pushed aside. But it's still very much a reality in our society, but it's been displaced by the greater needs of the need to address the environment. But we also have to address gross inequality, or we're going to see the masses of the people pushed to the limit and rise up and challenge the handful of one percenters out there who seem to be benefiting from the system. Ranger Kat: I'd like to close on the question about World Heritage Sites, and I know that you've been working to add many civil rights sites to be a part of UNESCO's World Heritage Site roster. So I was looking into a little bit about what it takes to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site and what the mission statement is. So I'll read just the small portion. The mission statement of the World Heritage Sites is “to preserve and protect sites around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity.” What is the value that the story of Birmingham and the sites in this region, what is the value that they bring to humanity? And why do you feel they deserve to be recognized on a global scale? Dr. Eskew: Thank you for that question, too, because, yes, I've been hard at work with colleagues on developing a serial nomination of US civil rights movement sites to be proposed for potential inscription on the World Heritage list. And Birmingham, I think, and to go back just to say about young people again. Young people hold the key, but it does no good if they don't get involved. Whenever I meet with students and talk about what occurred in Birmingham during the civil rights era, I encourage them to get involved for change for the change that they believe in, to get registered, to be able to vote so they can vote change in with politicians. If you don't get involved, if the children hadn’t marched in the Children's Crusade, there would not have been the changes we see coming out of Birmingham. And it's that very change. It's that outgrowth of those young people, Black folk standing up against Bull Connor’s fire hoses in Kelly Ingram Park, those six year old little kids who marched down the street and then on to a city bus to go off to the Stockade at the state fair ground and be locked up. It’s those young people who were spun down the street like a tumble weed through the force of the water of the hoses or got bitten by the dogs. Those young people point to why Birmingham is globally significant. It's globally significant because it demonstrated the power of nonviolent protest to force a nation to address injustice. As a result of the demonstrations in Birmingham, the federal government, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, required desegregation, required an end to legal white supremacy in American society. If you consider that within the framework of the world and you think about how around the globe there's always been discrimination, it might not be racial, might be ethnic, might be based in rooted in religion. It might be gender discrimination or sexuality might be against the aging or against people with issues of ability. There's so much evidence of discrimination written into and built into the fabric of societies. And here, for the first time, a federal government said, no longer. We're going to require the space be open to all people equally. Public space accessible all. And as it has come to be interpreted, well, initially, it was the issue of race. When the Civil Rights Act was being prepared in the Congress and debated, a slick legislator put in the word gender, thinking it would kill it, because who's going to give women the same spaces they give men? It got passed instead. And suddenly we see among the greatest beneficiaries of this are women. We since interpreted it to mean equality over sexuality issues for gays and lesbians, queer, transgendered people. It was applied to the needs of folks with disabilities so that they would have access to public space, too. We've seen it writ large across the board. Nowhere else in the world had that occurred. And it comes out of the demonstrations and protests that happened in Birmingham. It's a glorious story. It's one of which to be proud. And it's one to celebrate. That here, local people, young people mobilized, came together, demanded change. And through that demand ultimately forced the federal government power to answer. And it's the only way we're ever going to get change on any of these other issues is if people mobilize and demand it. Ranger Kat: Thank you so much. This has been such an amazing conversation. I really appreciate not only your knowledge about the story, but the passion with which you speak about it. It will be a conversation I return to for many, many years to come, and hopefully we can have others, too. Dr. Eskew: Well, thank you. It's wonderful to get to write about the brave people who made the difference. Certainly, it's driven by a desire to see us also deal with the problems in our own societies and accomplish the change we need for us all to be able to live together.

            "transcript": "Just around the completion of the Santa Fe Railway, brothers Ellsworth and Emery Kolb arrived at the Grand Canyon. Ellsworth was always eager to explore, and while Emery would often join him, he was a more practical man. In order to make a living, they started a photography business. [1920s camera flash] While they made most of their money from photographing tourists on mules and selling them as souvenirs, the brothers were known for their death defying photographs of Grand Canyon. They also, became famous for being the first to film a river trip on the Colorado River. In 1904, they started to build the home and studio you see today. When the El Tovar opened in 1905 the Fred Harvey Company, which operated the hotel, didn’t like other businesses in the area as they created competition. To contend with the Kolb brother’s they started selling their own photos of the canyon and wouldn’t tell visitors about Kolb Studio. The construction of Lookout Studio in 1914 made tensions worse with the Fred Harvey company. When Emery learned that the Fred Harvey company was trying to run him out of business he wrote a letter to the owner Ford Harvey. Emery stated that El Tovar employees were intentionally harming the Kolb’s business. Mr. Harvey’s response was the opposite that \"Emery's lecturing was helping to promote Canyon business”. By this time in 1915 Emery was able to expand the studio to include a theater where he narrated and played the river trip film, which attracted visitors from all over. Ellsworth helped promote the business by writing a book titled: “Through the Grand Canyon from Wyoming to Mexico”. The introduction incidentally helped with the Kolb’s relationship with their competition. It brought awareness to how the Fred Harvey Company employees talked about Kolb Studio. This created enough bad press for the Fred Harvey company that they agreed to only tell accurate information about Kolb studio if that section of the forward was removed from future editions. The Fred Harvey Company was never able to put Kolb Studio out of business. Up until his death, Emery showed and sometimes still narrated the film he and his brother made, making it the longest running movie in history. When Emery died in 1976, The National Park Service acquired the building. Today, thanks to renovations, the building has been beautifully restored. A visit inside will allow you to learn more about the Kolb family and their crazy adventures here in the Canyon. You’ll also see some of their photographs and the river trip film that made them a lasting presence in at the canyon, despite the constant competition and challenges they faced many years ago.",

            "transcript": "Chapter 4 Native Americans and settlers in the area knew about the coal in the gorge, because it was so visible, and they may have gathered it for their own use. However, the large coal seams in this remote region lay basically undisturbed until 1873, when the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway completed a railroad through the gorge, opening a gateway to the rugged wilderness and untapped coalfields. Suddenly, the eastern seaports of the mid-Atlantic states were connected—via the gorge—to the industrial cities of the Midwest—Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago. Astute businessmen seized this golden opportunity and immediately started setting up coal mining operations. Now there was a way for New River gorge coal to reach its market! The railroad literally became a highway through New River Gorge, connecting towns that were relatively inaccessible by any other means. The population increased dramatically. African Americans migrated from the South, and thousands of poor European immigrants streamed into southern West Virginia in search of work, riches, and a better life. The railroad pulsed life into the area as mining companies built towns with houses, stores, hotels, and railroad depots. Residents could easily get the morning paper from Richmond or Cincinnati the same day it was printed because of the number of trains that ran through the gorge each day. In 1910, for example, more than 200 people a day traveled through Thurmond’s new train station, which made more money for the C & O Railroad than any other place on the line. The rush was on!

            "transcript": "[00:00:00] Brenna: Greetings from white sands national park. Thank you for tuning into our Mothapalooza podcast episode. Mothapalooza is our annual community exploration of insect diversity and research conducted in the world's largest gypsum dunefield. So here you can join local moth expert, Eric Metzler and myself park guide Brenna Rodriguez for a discussion of White Sands' very unique ecology. Welcome Eric. Thank you for joining our podcast today. You're a research associate and a volunteer here at White Sands National Park. What research are you currently involved in? Eric: Okay. My research involves moths, and right now I'm focusing on the moth populations and communities in White Sands National Park. [00:01:00] Brenna: Very cool. What exactly is it that in your experience makes white sands so unique to the research that you do? Eric: There are two primary things. The first is that it's dunes. There are very specialized insects that live in dunes habitats and they don't live outside the dunes habitats. The second thing is the gypsum soils of white sands. It's the largest, as you mentioned, the largest geologic formation of its kind in the world and because of the soils are so different, that means that the plants are going to be different. And the moths that rely on those plants for their food are also going to be different. Brenna: Just, this is a curiosity question from my standpoint, have you done moth research in other types of dune fields? Eric: I have. I researched moths in the sand dunes, what we think typically think of sand dunes, like lake shore sand dunes in the Toledo, Ohio area, when I lived in Ohio, and I did the same kind of research in my hometown [00:02:00] of Hart, Michigan, where I grew up as a young boy. And there were lots of dunes there as well. And as a young boy growing up and collecting moths, I could quickly determine that the moths that lived in the dunes were different than the moths that lived outside the dunes. I knew that when I worked for the Ohio department of natural resources, the sand dunes along Lake shore Michigan, or the Lake shore of Lake Erie were all, the moths that lived there were all so different and they lived no place else in Ohio. So the, knowing that the moths that live in dunes are different than the moths that live elsewhere was already known to me. So the opportunity to do research here was already exciting and then to learn about the soils and the impact that that would have was even more exciting. Brenna: Well, here's another curiosity question just from my standpoint, are some species of moths migratory, and others are not? Eric: There are no species of moths that are truly migratory. The closest one that comes is what we call the Monarch butterfly. Um, actually butterflies and moths [00:03:00] are exactly the same. Butterflies are just moths in fancy dress. So the Monarch butterfly comes the closest in that it goes to Mexico. And starts to come back, but they never make it all the way back. So it's not a true migration. It's one way movement to Mexico. And then those adults start to come back where they lay their eggs, but they never make it all the way back. There are mass movements of moths and butterflies up here in New Mexico. We frequently see painted ladies come through in mass numbers. In Santa Fe this year, there were huge numbers of painted lady butterflies that came into the city. So much so that people reported it to the newspaper and the news as baby monarchs coming into the city. That's a well known phenomenon worldwide where these butterflies live in the tropical areas, and then they reach height population densities, and they move in vast numbers. Brenna: Okay. I remember seeing some articles about that. I definitely saw a great deal of moths in my house over the last couple [00:04:00] months of the early summer. Eric: Yes. This year has been phenomenal for moths. The moths that you saw in your house are a moth called Euxoa auxiliaris, a cutworm moth and these particular moths were super abundant this year. And in normal years, farther North in the Rocky mountains, these moths amass large numbers and they fly up into the mountains and land in the scree at the base of the mountains where the grizzly bears depend on them as a source of protein, it's an important source of protein for grizzly bears. The Euxoa auxiliaris, every so often they amass in large numbers in the bigger cities. A few years ago, they amassed in Albuquerque. They were on the evening news and the resolution of the television cameras was so good that I could identify the moths on the news. Brenna: That's incredible. What, I mean, I'm sure there are a great many environmental factors that play into these, particular eruptions of moths in the [00:05:00] summertime. Do you, are you able to tell me a few of them? Eric: For the most part, unless it's an economic pest and agricultural pest, it's not known because unless there's money coming from agriculture industry to support research to the department of agriculture and the various universities like New Mexico State University that are primarily tied to agriculture, there's generally no support for that kind of research. I can guess, this year that we had a lot of rain in the spring and the Euxoa auxiliaris came out in large numbers this year. And I can only guess, but my house is also full of them. Brenna: I'm still finding them. Eric: Even though all the doors and windows were closed. Every day there were these specimens were flying around the house. I collected every one of them just to make sure, because this particular genus, there are many species that are very look very much alike, and this particular species has many forms. So it's extremely confusing to be able to identify it accurately. Brenna: I am not as keen on identifying them right now. [00:06:00] I'm still training myself. So the first thing I noticed was that they were mostly brown and that they were probably the size of a silver dollar. Eric: Yes, that's right. And every once in a while, you'll find one that has kind of like silver stripes on the wings from head to tail. That's the same species. It's just a different form. They're quite varied. This particular species is quite variable. The first time I encountered it was in Wyoming at a high elevation. And I put up my traps and there were hundreds and hundreds of these moths, but they were so variable. I thought I had several different species and I already knew the genus Euxoa is very difficult. So I pinned hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these things. I took them to the Smithsonian in Washington. They said, you idiot. Actually. That's not the word they use, but they said, we don't want all these. You can't give them away. Brenna: Wow. Eric: So I ended up recycling the pins. I gave some of them to as many museums as I could, and then ended up scraping them off the pins and recycling the pins because it's just such an abundant moth. Brenna: Right. Eric: Like I said, billions and billions over in the Northern Rocky mountains. And [00:07:00] there's another moth in Australia called the bogong moth that does the same thing. And they amass in large, large numbers and move in large quantities. But it's, they don't return. So it's another not true migration. It's a mass movement. Brenna: Very cool to learn the distinction. Eric: It's very similar to what's going on in Africa right now with the locusts. Brenna: What is happening right now in Africa with locusts? Eric: Right now in Africa for the last two years, there are millions and millions of billions of locusts that are devastating the landscape. They're eating everything, all the crops, everything. Brenna: What brings a mass movement like that to an end? Eric: Eventually they just die. Brenna: Okay. Eric: That used to happen in the United States. But the locusts, the so called Rocky mountain locusts went extinct in the United States. Brenna: Wow. Eric: If you want to read a good book, read the book Locusts. It will tell you about extinction. It will tell you about the Rocky mountain locusts. It will tell you about government policy related to religion and agriculture. Public health, [00:08:00] and a whole host of other things, all because of the Rocky mountain locusts. Brenna: Fascinating. Eric: It is, it's a great book. Brenna: Was there an attempt made to eradicate them? And that's why they went extinct? Eric: Nope, but people did want to eradicate them. And that's why all these other bits of all this other, all this other policy came into effect. Social policy came into effect in an effort to eradicate them. In fact, I don't know if you've heard the stories about the locusts at Salt Lake with the Mormons? Brenna: I have not. Eric: Okay. Well do read about that. There was a time when the locusts invaded Great Salt Lake, and they were eating everything and the seagulls came and saved the Mormons at the Great Salt Lake. And part of that is true because these Rocky mountain locusts would amass in the Great Salt Lake to the point where the waves would wash them up on the shore. Six feet high. Brenna: Wow. Eric: Can you imagine how bad that smelled? Brenna: It's like a snow drift, but it's insects! Eric: Yeah, it was just, the odor was unbelievably bad. And when these, when these locusts would get all the way to St. Louis, Missouri, [00:09:00] And during their swarms, it was so bad that everybody had to move out of the city and they had to pay people to come in with shovels and horse and wagon to scoop them up and take them out. It was just an enor-, it was a public health problem. It was a social problem. Unbelievable. And they did, when they swarm, they ate everything. They ate all the crops, in fact, they were, they were so voracious that they would eat shovel handles. They seemed to be eating shovel handles. And children, again stories probably exaggerated, where the children weren't safe. Brenna: Right. That's fascinating. There's so much that you don't hear about insects. Eric: Yeah. So look up, the locusts in Western North America. The Rocky mountain locust. Get a hold of the book Locusts. It's very inexpensive paperback. You buy used copies online, and it's a read that once you get started, you wont put it down and it's like an Agatha Christie novel, the guy who wrote it, just is a genius writer, as well as an amazing investigator. Brenna: Well, I will be excited to check that out. I know there's also [00:10:00] some research of yours that I would really like to read into. How long have you been conducting research at the park? Eric: I started the research here in 2007 was the first year of the research. The permit was approved in 2006 in December of 2006. And my first ventures into the park were in February, January and February of 2007. Brenna: Okay. That's been, that's been a fair piece. Eric: It's been a long time. Brenna: Has it been pretty exciting research so far? Does it have lulls? Eric: It's been more exciting than I ever would have imagined. Brenna: So how long do you hope to continue doing research at the park? Eric: Well, the field research has eventually wound up because I keep finding new species every time I go out, and that can apparently can go on forever. Brenna: Wow. Eric: When I first started, I picked out this little place where I was going to collect. I figured, well, after a couple of years, I'll move on to the rest of the park. 10 years later, I'm still in that same place, finding six new species every year. So eventually it's got to end because the paperwork has to be done, the [00:11:00] descriptive work has to be done. So now of the laboratory and the descriptive work and the library research is going to go on probably until I'm gone. Brenna: Now am I right in remembering that you actually have a few moths named after you? Eric: I have one moth named after me by another person. Brenna: And that's the way it works, right? You can't name it after yourself? Eric: You can't name it for yourself. It's unethical. Brenna: Ok, that is pretty cool. So what is the moth that's named after you? Eric: Yeah, Eucosma metzleri. Brenna: Can you describe it for me? Eric: It's a very tiny, yellowish white blonde. It is only found in one spot in the dunes. And of course I collected it but, there was a friend of mine who is an expert in this particular group, the genius Eucosma, was working on a book about Eucosma at the time. And so I, of course I was sitting on one of my specimens of this particular genus and he described it after me. Brenna: That seems like a pretty exciting career goal. Eric: Well for me, it's a nice pat on the back. [00:12:00] That's not what I strive for. I strive for the research and the information. I like information and data. Brenna: Absolutely. Since you've been doing this extensive research at the park for a significant piece of your career, what are you looking forward to finding at the conclusion of your research? Eric: My goal right now is to write up as many scientific descriptions of the ones that we know are new as I can while I'm still here and available to do it. My goal right now is to leave as big a mark on the map as I can so that other researchers will want to come and follow up. When I'm done, there will be a great many undescribed specimens that will not have names, that will be, that will go to the Smithsonian. So other researchers can follow in and do the descriptive work. I love collaboration and the fact that this man in Cincinnati described this one. And I'm working with a couple of guys in Ottawa, Ontario at the Canadian National Collection, which unfortunately is closed right now because of covid, so it's brought all [00:13:00] research to a halt. He's an expert on another group that I'm collaborating with and there's one group of moths that only he can do. So he borrowed those specimens. And there's another man at the Smithsonian, he's the only one who can do those. So he borrowed those and he will get, he will write those up when he can come back to work. Brenna: Is the Smithsonian pretty much the heart of moth research in the United States? Eric: The Smithsonian and the Canadian National Collection are the, they share, they combined share the bulk of the research. But I don't know that I could pick one over the other. I'm a research associate at the Smothsonian, and collaborate with my colleagues there all the time. I also collaborate with my colleagues at the Canadian National Collection all the time. One of my very best friends in the world is a recently retired scientist at the Canadian National Collection. And he and I collaborate all the time. Brenna: That's a great connection to have, especially [00:14:00] because moths travel. Eric: Although they don't travel across the border very easily at hand of human, human kind, because the Fish and Wildlife service is deadly on moving dead specimens back and forth across the border. Even though they could fly all by themselves were they alive, carrying dead ones back and forth is, is a bureaucratic nightmare. Brenna: I never thought about that. Well, let me delve back into your research for a moment. So you were mentioning that you get to discover about six new species a year. How many new species have you discovered during your research? Eric: Approximately, 60 species out of the 600 named species. That's about 10% are new to science. Brenna: Wow. Eric: In other words, unknown to science prior to my research, the beginning of 2007 Brenna: Is diversity like that typical to wild areas? Eric: Generally not. In fact, this White Sands National Park has the highest percentage of endemic species of [00:15:00] moths of any place in North America. In terms of a single location. There are regions, different regions of North America, like the Pine Barrens in New Jersey that have a great many endemic species, but that's a region in New Jersey. That's a system, an ecological system. This is unique in the fact it's a single location. Brenna: Wow. I feel awfully lucky to get to see some of that diversity. Eric: I couldn't agree with you more and that's exactly, that's the way exactly the way I felt when I got here and was invited to do the research. Brenna: Well, I actually will have some moths to show you later. We had two black witch moths enter the visitor center and then die and they've left some beautiful specimens of themselves behind. Eric: That's terrific. Yeah. That's an extremely impressive moth. Brenna: Yeah. They are. So the moths that you find at white sands, are they mostly all white? Eric: No. No. Most of the moths are not all white, there are many white moths that live here. In fact, the new ones that I'm naming, [00:16:00] some of them are white and some of them are not. Three of the ones. One of the ones that I named is kind of gray. It flies in the wintertime and I suggest, I don't know how anybody would prove it, that it is dark in the wintertime so that it can absorb solar radiation on the short winter days to get enough energy so that it can fly at night when the days are very short because they have to fly at night to mate and lay their eggs. And they fly even when the temperature reaches below freezing, they have obtained enough energy to do that. Brenna: That's incredible. Eric: And I'm working on two more species, undescribed species from the dunes, but it got halted because of COVID-19 that are also dark colored and they only fly in the winter time in the dunes. I described one other dark colored one from the dunes probably is not endemic to the dunes, but it's never been found any place else. So who knows. And there are other white pieces that live here that are just here because it works and there are white species of [00:17:00] moth everywhere. Brenna: Okay. Very interesting. These moths, do they have, at least in this park, in this place, do they have an average life span or it just totally just depends on the species. Eric: When we talk about the moth, we're generally talking about the adult life form, but the moth as an animal, starts out as an egg, as a caterpillar, as a pupa, and then the adult, the adult lays the eggs, and then it continues. In terms of the insect world and the moth world, 100% of the adults die every year. Brenna: Interesting. Okay. Eric: So you cannot harm the population of moths by killing an adult. Their fecundity, their ability to reproduce, is thousands of times greater than the individual moth that you see. A female will lay 500 to a thousand eggs, and only two of them have to survive to perpetuate the species: one male and one female. All the rest of them provide food for birds and lizards and parasites [00:18:00] and a whole host of other things. Brenna: And bears. Eric: And bears, if you're in Montana and Northern Wyoming. We don't worry so much about bears at white sands, except for polar bears. Brenna: Exactly. Eric: Which are, which are white, but there are none of those here. So, only two of all those thousand eggs have to survive. So killing a single adult moth is not going to harm a population. It's not like taking, killing a bird, where you have killed a bird that's going to live for years and years and years. And then an adult moth generally lives at most, a few weeks. Brenna: I actually recently, a friend of mine traveled to Australia in her undergraduate years and told me a story about how she, she met a moth that was about the size of both hands. Eric: A hercules moth! Brenna: Yeah! So they don't live very long at all! Eric: No, they don't. As adults, they cannot eat. They have no, as adults, they have no mouth parts. [00:19:00] We have a couple of species here in the dunes that as adults have no mouth parts. Brenna: Are they also quite large like the hercules moth? Eric: Well, the one moth that you probably heard or may have heard about the buckmoth. Black and white and flies in the summer, the artemis buckmoth has no mouth parts. And there's another buckmoth that flies across the dunes, doesn't live in the dunes as caterpillars: the juno buckmoth. And it'll be some, it's a dark moth that has white on the wings, but is the same size as the artemis buckmoth, and it also does not eat as an adult. The so-called silk moths are one group of moths that do not eat as adults. Brenna: Okay. Now are those buckmoths, we do see a lot of caterpillars on the cottonwood trees, would that happen to be the caterpillar of the buckmoth? Eric: That's exactly right. And here again is where many, many, many caterpillars are there, only two of them [00:20:00] have to turn into moths. One male and one female. Brenna: That's a wild thought. Eric: Yes, it is. Brenna: What do these, all of these findings you've made so far, all these many species and how they behave in the dunes. Do those behaviors and that diversity have any specific implication for other biodiversity here at the park? Eric: It probably does, but we know so little. In fact, we know nothing about the life histories of the new species, that those implications still have to be discovered. I think what we're going to find is that the caterpillars of those species are using unique plants as local hosts. And the unique plants that they're using may appear to be exactly the same as the other plants outside the dunes. But when we get into it, we're going to find that the chemistry of the plants are different or the endophytes. Endophytes are little organisms that go with the plants that help, the plant development. So the endophytes that are in the plants may be different. Some research has already been done here to [00:21:00] show them the genetics of the plant, the species of the plant changes from outside the dunes to inside the dunes. And so we're going to find that things are impacting the distributions of the moths and the species of the moths. We just don't know what they are yet. A lot more research has to occur. Brenna: It sounds like this is a premier destination for researchers. Eric: It is. I found one moth here in the dunes in June, that was yellow, no markings at all. Yellow, almost twice. Some individuals were pure, almost pure white and, this moth was unknown to anybody before. It was very common in June. And there was another moth in the same genus that lived in Mesilla and it was Brown. It had Brown markings on the wings. So I went to Mesilla and I found caterpillars there. And I raised that moth. It was exactly what I expected it to be. And I came to the park here and I found caterpillars of the same [00:22:00] genus, on the same species of plant here, except they were a month later, and so the caterpillars here a month later we're producing the moths that were white, and the caterpillars in Mesilla we're producing brown moths. As I continued to rear these, I discovered that the caterpillars that I found here when they pupated in the fall, some of them emerged in the spring as white moths, some of them emerged in the fall as brown moths, typical brown moths, just like the ones in Mesilla, but they never met in space and time. They were separated by a hundred miles and they were a month different in time, so they could not see each other or talk or meet each other to breed. But in terms of the current thinking, this particular genus has many, many species complexes and there's absolutely no proof yet that the ones in white sands is a different species than the one in Mesilla. So right now they have the same name. I believe that is evolution where [00:23:00] we have, we're having a snapshot of evolution right in front of our eyes. So we are seeing, eventually the one that it has some white ones in the spring, they will make and start a new species of white ones. Brenna: Just in one year? Eric: Well, it's going to take many, many years for this to happen, but I have seen this repeated now, even when I did it and in my laboratory at home where I reared them at home in my laboratory and the white ones came out in the spring. And the same caterpillars, their pupae waited until the fall, and the same ones that came out in the fall from the same female were brown. So it's going to require a lot more research just to show anything that's going on there for sure. But for me, the excitement is here is a snapshot of evolution! Brenna: Right! That's that's the most exciting implication of all! Eric: For me, those are the discoveries that make this all worthwhile for me. So that's much more exciting to have a moth named after me. [00:24:00] Brenna: Totally understandable. Eric: And what I just reported, just what I just told you about this particular moth. A book was just published last year, which showed many pictures of the moth from white sands and wrote about the differences between the one in white sands and the one in Mesilla. Brenna: What is it called? What's the book called? Eric: Well, the book is called The Moths of America, The Moths of North America. And it's fascicle 22.1A. This is a series of books. I'm the president and managing director of the nonprofit company that publishes these books. I'm not writing any of the books, but I get to contribute a lot of information and data to the authors of the books. And so my pictures and the information that I found here was being used. Were it not for that, nobody would know. Brenna: So these research findings. These publications. Do you see their impact on the community that's [00:25:00] aiming for species preservation and habitat preservation? Eric: I surely hope so! Because of the specialized nature of the dunes here, it's the only geologic formation of its size in the world. And because we're finding all this incredible endemism, rate of endemism, and about 10%. 60 of 600 species, named species. It's a, to me, it should draw attention worldwide attention on the resource here. And I've heard the National Park Service referred to this as the Galapagos of North America. I couldn't agree more. So it is unique in the world and some people say that evolution can't happen that fast. Well, we know in the insect world, it can! When we look at mammals and other things that don't have this amazing ability to reproduce, lay these tremendous number of eggs in one year. The chances for mutation and insects is far greater than, than other animals. So I, [00:26:00] and we know that from other experiments, that evolution happens very rapidly and insects. That's why insects are great animals for studying evolution. Brenna: Well, and they're also more diverse. Eric: They're more diverse. That's exactly right. So the fact that all this evolution's occurring here in the dunes, in a period of approximately 8,000 years just does not surprise me at all because the evolutionary biologists are highly skeptical. So it's going to require continued work, continued research. It's, now it's going to require going out and finding the caterpillars for these moths, finding out what they eat, and look at possible genetic differences in the plants that might influence the moths. I know from my own research in Ohio, the caterpillars are very fussy about where they'll make their pupae, where they'll make their cocoons. If the soil morphology, the structure of the soil is not correct, or the chemistry of the soil is not correct, it doesn't matter whether the plant grows there or not. When that caterpillar goes down to the ground to make its cocoon, it has to find conditions that are absolutely perfect. Brenna: Wow. [00:27:00] Eric: I ran those empirical observations at Ohio when I worked for the department of natural resources. Brenna: Would you give me a brief walkthrough of a caterpillar's, or I shouldn't say that, a moth's lifecycle here in the dunes. Eric: Sure. From my rearing observations, the species that I reared, the one that I mentioned to you, Niditinea verspicula is the scientific name. The moth comes out in the spring, mates, she usually doesn't fly until she mates, so she'll come out and just sit still. And she'll put out a chemical pheromone, like perfume to attract the males. And I kid my wife about perfumes, but anyway, so she will attract the males and then the males will come and mate, and then she will lay eggs and she usually she'll lay most of her eggs before she moves, because it's a guaranteed position for the caterpillars to survive. Then she will fly and they some more eggs and the very [00:28:00] adventuresome females will move far away from the habitat to lay eggs, always trying to find, expand the territory, expand the range. So this summer I collected females of two moths in my back porch, right. That shouldn't, that shouldn't belong there. They should belong way up on the mountain, but they had not made any eggs yet. So I theororize that they are females, that were out looking for other places to lay eggs, that, to expand the range. Both of them are species that specialize in pine trees, conifers, which up in the mountains makes perfect sense, down in Alamogordo, not much of a chance. Nonetheless, there they were on my back porch. So most of the females will lay their eggs right where they came out because that's safety for their, for their, for their babies. The babies have the best chance of survival right there at home. And most moths do not wander far from home because if they do, they risk losing their lives, it's unproductive behavior. So the [00:29:00] males will stay very, very close to home to find females to mate with. There's no advantage to a male to leave home because the chance of finding a female away from him are extremely remote. So the males will stay close to home. They'll find the females, mate with the females, the females will lay their eggs. Some females will wander off, very few. Then the caterpillars hatch out of the eggs and some eggs made last for months before the caterpillars hatch. Other eggs will hatch almost immediately. It depends on the species. It's impossible to generalize. Then the caterpillars come out. The caterpillars will usually very slowly at first until they build up the need, they've got to rush through to development. And they'll just eat eat almost nonstop until they make their pupae or spin their cocoons. When they go into the pupil stage, then that can last from just a few days to months. And again, it's impossible to generalize. [00:30:00] Some species know that they have to have a few individuals that last more than a season because if they all come out at the wrong time and I say, they know it's, they don't think it's just the way they made their habits. Because if they all came out at the same time and it was the wrong time they were, they would, they would go extinct. So they have a few individuals have to wait for periods of time to come up later when conditions might be better. Now they risk losing their lives by doing that. But it's a guarantee. It helps the survival of the species. So out here in the dunes, for example, there's another species that was just described called Eucosma gypsumana, same genus as the one that was named after me. And the student who helped me describe it, Savannah Porter, was a student at New Mexico State when she worked with me on it and she picked the name and it can only be identified to genus by looking at a female. So [00:31:00] over the first eight years of my work research out here, I found 11 males no more than three a year. So someplace down under the ground were these pupae, waiting to come out. Then, on the eighth year, more than a hundred individuals, all at once. So from 2007 to 2015, 11 individuals, all males. In 2015, over a hundred individuals, three females, finally, we decided the genus. Brenna: That's a pretty incredible story. So if I were walking on the dunes and I found kind of a, almost like a shell made out of gypsum about the size of the end of one of my fingers, is that the remains of like a, where or how the moths pupate? Eric: Could be, could be, very well could be. So we have no idea why it took so many years for all of these moths to come up, but they all came out at the same time. Brenna: Right. Eric: So the other ones were kind of testing the waters, so to speak. My language not theirs, [00:32:00] just to see and the conditions weren't right. And we have no idea what changed in 2015 to allow this mass emergence of more than a hundred individuals and in the dunes. And fortunately there were three females. So Savannah very carefully dissected two females to make sure that one wasn't a fluke. And cause you never wanna put all your eggs in one basket. But after the second one and they were identical, we left the third one intact and we illustrated it and proved that it was a different species. Brenna: That's an exciting year! You said 2015? Eric: It was an exciting year! And we, when Savannah does a slideshow about this and she just gets so excited about this female aspect of it because, hey, women make the world go round. All of us men need to be really humbled by all of that. Brenna: That's pretty cool! You know, Savannah is now working as part of our night sky team, and I guess I have a question for you about that. How important is [00:33:00] the night sky to a moth? Eric: Well, the night sky is very important for moth collectors. For the moths themselves, we don't know. Now we use artificial lights to attract moths so that we can collect them. And we know now that moths do not come well to lights when the moon, when there's a bright sky with a full moon, we don't know why, but I know from my own empirical observations, collecting in Ohio on a full moon, that as soon as the cloud came over and blocked the moon, all the moths immediately came to the sheet. As soon as the clouds moved, and the moon came back out all the moths left. The reasons for that are unknown. And there's statistical evidence to show that the phase of the moon has no impact at all. People have collected, they recorded the moonphase and moth catches, and it makes no difference at all. But what we're not recording is the visible moon, whether there's a cloud, whether there's a cloud in the sky or not. So that needs to be recorded along with the other statistical data. [00:34:00] So the people who are doing this research are not evaluating the entire system. So. We do know that moths do not come to the light when there's a full moon visible. When, people ask me why are moths attracted to lights, and nobody knows. So preface that when I give you my guess. Every month, collector will give you their ideas, even though the answer is completely unknown. So my idea is they're trying to reach the moon. They're flying towards the moon. Now I personally believe that very few of them ever make it Brenna: But what a dream, Eric: It's as good an explanation as any because there are no explanations. We know what kind of lights are more effective in attracting them. We know that some species are attracted to the white lights. Some species are attracted to blue lights. So species that are attracted to so-called black lights. There are all different ways things attract different species. We know that. But why, we still don't know. Brenna: What an exciting [00:35:00] open avenue for Eric: research! Yes, it is. Yes, it is. This research is all funded by the department of agriculture, of course, because they have to attract pest species and have discovered pest species. If it's not an agricultural pest, there's no money to support the research. Brenna: It's a little bit of a catch 22. Eric: Yes it is. Brenna: Well, what, this is probably an extensive and difficult question to answer since you've spent your life doing it, but what originally drew you to the world of moths. Eric: That is a very good question. It's very simple actually, but long and involved. When I was in high school, like most kids in high school, I had to have a job, part time job to buy the things that I wanted to buy. Those jobs were during the daytime. I started out collecting, chasing butterflies and all the other insects. But when you work during the day, the only time to go is at night. Moths: that's what's left. It was very, very simple. Brenna: I love that. It's a kind of happy [00:36:00] coincidence. Eric: It was. And then later I learned that of all the butterflies and moths in the world, 96% of them are moths. So if you really want to know what's going on in the moth and butterfly world, you study moths. So, it just, it was one of those, one of those things. Brenna: Now, if we're on the subject of moths, like we have been, of course, if you had to pick three things that you would want to visitor to know about moths, would you be able to narrow it down or is it just too-? Eric: No, I couldn't narrow it down very quickly. The first thing is that most of them are small. We look at the black witches out here and we realized that if the, if there were as many black witches as there were other moths, the moths would be like 10 to 12 feet deep at any given moment. So most moths are quite small. The second thing is that moths and butterflies are almost one in 10 species of every plant and animal on earth. Almost 10% of all plants and animals on earth is a moth. [00:37:00] It's just mind boggling. When you look out across the environment, you don't see them. They're hiding. Most of them come out at night and they're very well hidden there they're cryptic. So they're extremely good at hiding and they're small. And you mentioned, we talked earlier about the white moths. One of the white moths that was described from out here is a very tiny moth about the size of the large mosquito, crawls around on the sand. During the early morning, people see them all the time. They don't know what it is. If people would go down to the boardwalk area between eight and noon on any given morning. And either with binoculars scanning the dunes or they want to get adventuresome and take, make sure they take water with them and just walk up under those low dunes near the boardwalk. They'll see these little white animals scurrying around, down in the sand. Those are moths. Brenna: I never knew I've seen them myself. Now we've talked a lot about [00:38:00] moths in general, but there there's a moth that we kind of use as our mascot because we have so many soaptree yucca plants in our park. So I've heard tell of a yucca moth, but I've come to be aware that it's not just one species. Eric: Yes. Each species of yucca tree or yucca plant has its own species of yucca moth that pollinates the plant. And there are other species of moths that depend on that plant for their survival. There are species of moths that lay their eggs in the stem and the little tiny caterpillars, they go down into the stem and eat the tissue in the stem and the moths that come out of that are little white moths and they're out here. And then the moths that actually do the pollinating, the ones that live in the blossoms. There's one, there's about four species of moths that are almost identical that live in the blossoms. And of those that are there, only one of them actually pollinates the plant. The other ones just are cheaters. So it's like [00:39:00] life in general, the females do the pollinating. The males that are just there. So like life in general, the females do all the work and like life in general, there's one that does all the work and everybody else just hangs on for the ride. We all know we all have examples of it. Brenna: I think so. So really moths are a pretty key pollinator out in the desert Eric: Moths are key pollinators in the desert. The yucca plants would go extinct almost immediately if it weren't for the yucca moths. The, because there are so many moths flying at night, busy pollinating plants, we tend to think of butterflies or bees or flies as pollinators, and of course they are critical to pollination, but the moths are doing just as good a job of pollenating at night. I observed this when I did my research in Ohio, I would go along woodland trails at night with a flashlight, with a piece of red cellophane covering the lens, so as not to disturb the moths and the same flowers that had lots and lots of bees and other things on them during the [00:40:00] day, were actively being pollinated by moths at night. And a big research study just came out of England that shows of agricultural conditions, moths do as much pollinating as all the other insects do, at night. They do it at night. And around here, of course we have flowers that are only open at night. We have the datura plant, which is generally blossomed, only open at night. There are other plant flowers that are only open at night and generally they're pollinated by moths. Not always, there are night flying bees, there are night flying flies as well. There are transparent bees, that fly at night that do pollinating. Very few compared to the moths. Brenna: So much to learn about that insects at this park. Eric: Moths have an amazing impact on pollination and here in the desert here in white sands, as well as around the world. Brenna: Well, that really leads me to my last question. Now that.. Eric: Sorry, primrose was the name of the plant. Evening primrose back East. There are many, many [00:41:00] primroses out here. Evening primrose back East is pollinated by a yellow moth. And if you go back East, if you open up the primrose during the daytime, you'll find this little yellow moth in there. And you know, the ends of the petals on the Primrose are kind of pinkish. So are the tips of the wings of the moth. So when they're hiding in there, they’re actually identical to the primrose flower. Brenna: That's so cool. Eric: And out here, the primroses are also pollinated by night flying moths. Brenna: But do they, is coloring as important for the moths out here? Eric: Absolutely coloring is, is critical because of the moths rest inside the flower. They have to resemble the flower exactly. Brenna: That's a good point. Eric: And there's a, there's one of the species of moths that I described out here as new, the flower moth, Schinia poguei, and Schinia poguei is the flower moth with the caterpillars that only eat the flower parts. And the moth during the daytime, either rests on the flower or [00:42:00] at the base of the flower or on the foliage of the very same plant where the caterpillar lives. But in this case, the moth has yellow and white wings. So I'm guessing that the moth actually rests on the flower. We don't know which one. That still has to be discovered. Brenna: You just gotta keep coming back. Eric: It just keeps going and going and going. Brenna: Well my, I guess that's really a second to last question. Through all your years of research. I know you've seen many moths come and go. Is there one species that really stands out to you? Eric: Well, probably the one that is most important to me individually is the, well, there are three. The first one is the cecropia. It's the equivalent, it's a big reddish moth. You may have seen it when you lived back East. We have one here that's clearly closely related to those, up in the Sacramento mountains called Columbia and people who go up there where the lights are, will find them at porch lights up there. It's a big reddish Brown moth like that. Brenna: Wow. So about the size of maybe two of my hands. Eric: [00:43:00] Yep. Like that, maybe six inches across the biggest ones. You mentioned Savannah earlier. She found one in town. And it apparently had been blown down by the wind or came down to the grill pickup truck because they don't live down here. The caterpillars eat conifers. Brenna: So it wouldn't really make any sense for it to be down here. Eric: It wouldn't make any sense for it to be down here as an individual, but there was, so it’s at home now and I'm going to send some legs to a friend of mine at the Carnegie museum when they opened back up. And he's going to do genetic studies on that moth. Brenna: Ok, why just the legs? Eric: Because they extract the DNA from the legs, and don't have to destroy the moth. So you can extract the DNA from the legs without destroying the moth. Brenna: Never thought about that. Eric: That’s how we do our DNA studies on all these animals. The smaller the moth, obviously the smaller the legs. Brenna: Sometimes you have use two? Eric: Yup. Brenna: Okay. Um, so you said there were three, so that's the first one. Eric: That’s the first one, the second one is the Luna moth, big, beautiful green moth [00:44:00] with tails. We don't have it here. Nobody in the west has seen it. But people from the east know what the Luna moth is. Brenna: Oh yes, I remember seeing them. Eric: And I knew Luna moths ever since I was a little kid interested in butterflies and moths. I finally got my first one on the same week I graduated high school. Brenna: Yeah, no wonder it's got some personal significance. Eric: So it was just because it was such a beautiful moth. The third one of course is the one I named after my wife. Brenna: So what is it? What's the description of this moth? Eric: it's not a very big moth. It's a small moth. It's restricted to prairies in the midwest, upper midwest. And the name of it is Aethes patricia. Brenna: It's a beautiful name. Eric: Thank you. Brenna: So I've always been curious about the Luna moth. Does the name have any particular connection to them? Eric: Other than word Luna means moon, Linnaeus named it. And I guess there was something when Linnaeus named moths, he gave most of them names that had some kind of a scientific meaning [00:45:00] except the giant silk moth. He gave them names that were kind of fanciful. So promethia after the God Prometheus, cecropia, after the god Cecrops or whatever that is, luna after moon, all of these giants, silk moths received, and the giant butterflies received names that had nothing to do with science. So there is, I can’t think of all of them. I can’t think of all the names of the large butterflies. I don't study large butterflies, but most of them are named after. After there's homers, which lives only in the Caribbean. It's very rare, very rare swallowtail butterfly in the Caribbean. And so around the world Homer's, or Linnaeus picked out these large, charismatic animals to receive these names. So there's the Goliath beetle, which is a very large beetle. Goliath means obviously that's a large beetle, but that's not the derivation of the name [00:46:00] necessarily. Brenna: Wow. What a cool world of insects, what hugely diverse world. Eric: It is more than half of all plants and animals on the world are insects. It's a mind boggling thing. Brenna: Well, I hope that you continue to come back and celebrate Mothapalooza with us for as many years as you want and keep sharing all these discoveries because every time I meet you and get to talk to you about moths, I always learn something new and incredible. Okay. Eric: Thank you. It is, it's one of the things that keeps me going. The discoveries just never end. I just keep learning. Brenna: Well, making these discoveries in this place, you've been here over and over. You know, we spend a lot of our time as park personnel, creating messages and posts and programs that encourage visitors to try and see this place as more than just a giant sandbox. This is another heavy [00:47:00] question, but what do you see when you come to white sands? Eric: What I see when I come to white sand dunes, is these dunes, and I see an amazing habitat. And when I first came here, I saw what appeared to be a fairly barren space and the diversity of moths, I never expected. In one very short, less than two miles stretch of road, more than 600 named species of moths. And I'm not counting the little tiny ones that are a 16th of an inch long. So far I'm ignoring all of those because I'm spending all my time on the bigger ones. So if the diversity of those little tiny ones continues to be as great as the bigger ones that I'm focusing on. It's just. You can see I’m raising my arms again, it’s just mind boggling. So that's the stuff. Brenna: Well, thanks for bringing some of the hidden things to light during this [00:48:00] interview today. Are there any last words you want to put out to, help people celebrate national moth week? Eric: I think just remembering how many moths there are, almost one in 10 of every species of plant and animal on earth is a moth. And remembering how important they are because of their, because there are great numbers of food for birds or food for lizards, only two eggs out of a thousand have to survive all the rest of them provide food for other animals. So they're critically important to the environment. They are. Well, the relationships between plants and animals, just, just doesn't end. If we can, we can do that for another time. Brenna: And I would love to! Eric: How do caterpillars help plants, when they eat when they're eating leaves. They do. So we'll leave that for people to ponder. Brenna: Yeah, absolutely. Well, hopefully everyone who's listening will at least take a few moments during national moth week to look outside or even look indoors at some of the moths that [00:49:00] come in this summer. I myself will certainly be looking at some black witch moths this afternoon with Eric after this interview is over. So thanks for tuning in and catch us on our social media platforms to find out more about national moth week. All right, Eric. Thank you. Eric: Thank you very much, Brenna. Brenna: Absolutely.",

            "transcript": "Some of this house’s earliest residents survived slavery and worked for freedom. Slavery was a racist system in which white people treated Black people like property. Enslavers forced the people they enslaved to work, and could split up their families at any time. Enslaved people resisted their enslavers and wanted freedom. From 1759-1774, John Vassall enslaved at least seven people at this house: Dinah, Malcolm, William, and a woman named Cuba Vassall and her children. During that time, there were about 90 enslaved people in Cambridge. As the Revolutionary War approached, John Vassall fled this house, and the people he had enslaved seized their freedom. Enslavers often took children away from their parents. Their enslavers gave Cuba Vassall’s daughter Flora and son Darby away to other enslavers when they were very young. How do you think the kids might have felt being separated from their parents? Many enslaved parents were never able to find their children – but Cuba Vassall and her husband Tony were. They eventually got 6-year-old Darby and 5-year-old Flora back and reunited their family in freedom. How do you think the kids might have felt when they returned to their family?",

We submit proposals every year to the National Park Service so they will know what we're doing. I mean, there's other aspects of sustainable we could be talking about. Are these farms going to be economically sustainable? Will we be able to make enough money to stay in business for years? I think that's the one with the biggest question mark. It's hard to be a small-scale farmer and make money. I think we have a certain advantage here in that we're in a great location. We're in a national park, so we can be destination farms. We're halfway between Cleveland and Akron, so we're very accessible to large communities, and there's a lot of promise there.",

It explores the history of the park, some of its highlights, and information for planning your visit. This audio version lasts about 40 minutes, and is divided into 16 sections, as a way to improve the listening experience. Sections three through nine cover the front of the brochure and include information regarding the four different historical periods of the fort, as well as a timeline highlighting important events throughout these periods, which runs along the bottom of the front side. Sections 10 through 16 cover the back of the brochure which has an illustrated map of what the park looks like today.",

Spanish moss, sometimes called “old man’s beard” is the curly pale green or gray plant hanging from the live oak trees. Though not really a moss, this air plant has been utilized by island residents for centuries.",

            "transcript": "Emily Ward (0:18)- Welcome to Castillo conversations. My name is Emily Ward and I'm a Public History major at Flagler College and I've been interning at the Castillo de San Marcos. I'm joined today by a special friend and a fellow resident of St. Augustine, Bobby Batson. We are going to talk to you about some of the most commonly asked questions about the history of the Castillo. So Bobby, what do you want to talk about today? Bobby Batson (0:39)- Well, today I had a couple of questions actually regarding the moat that's around the Castillo fort. Is it true that the Spanish in order to fight off invaders and keep them from climbing the walls they actually put sharks and alligators inside the moat with all the water? Emily Ward (0:55)- No, so there actually were no sharks or alligators in the moat. There actually wasn't even water in the moat to put sharks and alligators in Bobby Batson (1:04)- But I thought most moats had water in them. Emily Ward (1:07)- Typically water in the moat is to prevent the enemy from being able to dig underneath the walls, getting their ladders close enough to climb the walls. But they didn't really have to worry about those problems at the Castillo, because in Florida, the sea level so low, the tunnel would flood anyway. Plus, the Spanish didn't have to worry about enemies climbing the walls of the fort because the cannons at the top could shoot enemies from about a mile away. So you see the Spanish shouldn't really need water in the moat. Bobby Batson (1:34)- Well, then what was the moat even good for? Emily Ward (1:36)- That's a really good question. So the Spanish needed a safe place to keep their livestock corralled close by as a food source. The Spanish would store barrels of rice beans, corn flour and dried and salted meats inside the rooms, but if they wanted fresh meat, they needed live animals. Bobby Batson (1:52)- But why would they need to stockpile so much food for the fort? Emily Ward (1:56)- So the Castillo was a siege fortress. So when an enemy attacked, they would surround the fort to cut off the Spanish supply lines to try to starve them into giving up. See, they didn't really have many other options. They couldn't tunnel under the walls. They couldn't climb over them, and they couldn't knock them down, either. The coquina stone the fort is made of has millions of teeny tiny air pockets. So when a cannonball hits, it's like sticking a knife into cheese, the stone doesn't shatter, and the walls do not fall. So the only option left is for the enemy to try and starve out who's inside. Bobby Batson (2:29)- Okay, but then, if the British was smart, wouldn't they just shoot out the livestock from the moat and wipe out their food supply? Emily Ward (2:36)- Well, the livestock actually would have been pretty protected from enemy fire because of the moat wall and the walls of the covered way. See, the Castillo is tucked down inside a gigantic foxhole and everything at the moat level is hidden and protected. Much more useful that way. Bobby Batson (2:51)- Okay, but then how come I've seen pictures from the 1990s of the moat with water inside of it? Emily Ward (2:58)- Well, that's because you weren't the only person who thought the Spanish had water in the moat. For a long time the national park service thought there was supposed to be water in the moat too. So for about sixty years from the 1930s to the 1990s they had water in the moat. That was before people realized the water was causing damage to the coquina. But that's a whole other story. Bobby Batson (3:19)- Huh? I wonder how many people like me thought there was actually water in the moat. Well, that's about all for my questions today. Thank you for answering them for me. Emily Ward (3:27)- Thank you for asking. I'm glad we got that all cleared up, and now everyone knows the Castillo had a dry moat. Thanks to everyone for listening to this episode of Castillo Conversations, Sharks in the Moat.",

            "transcript": "MARKER #4 – POINT ISABEL You are looking at the path that leads to Point Isabel, also known as Blue’s Point. If you were to follow the path on foot for about 15 minutes, you would reach a rectangular bay on the Fort George River stabilized with concrete block from the 1920’s. In the 18th and 19th century it was a wharfing facility for the plantations that were in the area. It was later used as a marina. The name Isabel is actually a Kingsley family name. It is also the name of a specific variety of grape that was once grown and marketed on Fort George Island. The game of golf was an important part of the island’s identity for over 63 years. In 1928, the clearing ahead of you was a portion of the 5th and 6th fairways, part of a 9 hole Scottish style course. Scottish style courses were characterized by longer grass, less manicured and more rugged landscapes. In 1968, 9 holes were expanded to 18 holes. The fairways were maintained up until 1991, but left to naturalize after that. The naturalization gives us an interesting opportunity to watch the succession of areas take place naturally; note the younger pine trees growing on this fairway clearing. The old fairways along with ponds, open woodlands and oak hammocks, can be further experienced on foot or bicycle on a trail maintained by the Florida Park Service. Trail maps for this 3 mile trail are available at the Ribault Club and the Ranger Station.",

He wears a round flat cap with fur trimming, only a hint of his shoulder and clothing is suggested with light pencil lines. CAPTION: táwatoy CREDIT: Washington State Historical Society IMAGE 2 of 2: Large group of people DESCRIBING: Detailed color pencil sketch of large group of people SYNOPSIS: A mostly black-and-white pencil sketch with orange and yellow highlights to accent skin tone and clothing. A circular gathering showing the back of a large group of native people with long dark hair sitting close together and facing toward the middle. Over the center of the gathering is a large, raised tent canopy held up by six thin poles. Under the canopy, men wearing formal European-style attire stand in a line intermingled with native people with long dark hair. Around the outside of the group, in the background, are four triangular shaped tents and a few horses on the left next to one of the tents, in a clearing defined by the edge of a forested area. CAPTION: German-American artist Gustavas Sohon sketched the crowd at the 1855 treaty council CREDIT: Washington State Historical Society RELATED TEXT: In March 1848, immigrant settlers organized a militia to seek revenge for the November killings. For several years they waged what is known as the Cayuse War. They seized horses and cattle, cut off weyíıletpuu from their gardens, and disrupted their seasonal harvest. The weyíıletpuu faced famine. To preserve any future for their people, they surrendered five men for the killings at Whitman Mission: tílewkeyˀkt, ˀıcıyéeye šıléq̉ıš, k̉oỷam̉á šamqíın, tamáx̣aš, and ƚókomut. The trial began May 21, 1850. The men were quickly convicted despite lack of evidence and disagreements over jurisdiction and applicable law. They were hanged June 3. All five men were buried in one unmarked grave. Their descendants still search for them. “Our Cayuse people were labeled terrorists and murderers because of the events at Whitman Mission. While it is true that people should be held accountable, it disregards the jurisdiction that we had over our own country and our own people.” — sᵻsáawıpam (Roberta Conner), 2019 In 1855, the US met with leaders of the weyíıletpuu and other area tribes to negotiate a treaty. The tribes ensured some of their most important lands were reserved for their exclusive use before they agreed to share some lands with the growing United States. In 1859, the US Senate ratified the treaty. The weyíıletpuu homeland was now part of the United States. “It is good for the old people to talk together good and straight on account of our children on both sides to take care of each other. . . . Think for year after year for a far way ahead.” — tıwíıteq̉ıš (Old Joseph) at the 1855 treaty council “The land where my forefathers are buried should be mine. That is the place I am speaking for . . . that is what I love—the place we get our roots to live upon.” — táwatoy (Young Chief) at the 1855 treaty council",

So I oftentimes during my days off would take these hikes. Oftentimes by myself. Yosemite is about the size of Vermont, okay? So you can go on hikes into the mountains, you can go across the deserts, across the plains. I just had a chance to see beauty that I never knew even existed, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And you can tell, though, that I was from South Carolina because I always hiked with the wrong kind of shoes on. I didn’t know anything about hiking boots. My whole world was All Star Converse shoes. (laughter) Can you imagine, a young Black boy from South Carolina walking down the John Muir Trail in a pair of All Star Converse? (laughs) So it took me a while to learn hey, no, you don’t wear those kind of shoes out here. Listen, it was a learning experience. I had to learn a whole lot of things. I had never heard of rock climbing. And I learned how to do that when I was out there.",

CAPTION: James Montgomery CREDIT: Kansas State Historical Society RELATED TEXT: Slavery divided the nation during its turbulent adolescent years. Conflict arose over whether to allow slavery in the new western territories. Under the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), Congress created Kansas and Nebraska territories, opening these lands for settlement. It declared that the residents of these territories could decide by popular vote whether their state would be free or slave. In Kansas, people on both sides of this controversial issue flooded in, trying to influence the vote in their favor. Three distinct political groups occupied Kansas—proslavers, free-staters, and abolitionists. Proslavery advocates, as the name implies, supported slavery, regardless of whether they personally owned slaves. Abolitionists wanted to rid the nation of the “peculiar institution” altogether. Free-staters didn’t particularly care about slavery where it already existed, but were opposed to its extension westward. Conflict between these opposing factions soon turned violent. As a result, this era became forever known as “Bleeding Kansas,” an era when violence, destruction, and psychological warfare prevailed in the region. Fort Scott and the surrounding area were not immune from the turmoil. Sold at auction in 1855, the fort buildings became the new town of Fort Scott. The townspeople were primarily proslavery, while free-staters and abolitionists dominated the surrounding countryside. This division of opposing factions was illustrated on the grounds of the “old fort” by the existence of two hotels. One, a former officers’ quarters, became the Fort Scott Hotel, nicknamed the “Free State” Hotel due to the political leanings of many of its guests. Directly across the square, an infantry barracks was now the Western Hotel, a headquarters for proslavery men. By 1858, radical elements from both factions converged on the area. James Montgomery, an ardent abolitionist, became a leader of free-state forces that invaded Fort Scott, a haven for Border Ruffians (extreme proslavery men). During one raid, Montgomery tried to burn the Western Hotel; another raid took the life of John Little, a former deputy marshal. During this era, soldiers returned periodically to Fort Scott to restore law and order, staying each time until violence abated, only to have conflict resume on their departure. By the time the territorial strife waned in 1859, nearly 60 people had died and hundreds were terrorized throughout Kansas in the struggle over slavery. Antislavery forces finally prevailed. Kansas entered the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861, but by then the fighting and violence, once contained to this area, threatened to engulf the entire country.",

            "transcript": "Interviewer: So, can you explain the process of how you restore a marsh? Is that complicated? Dr. George W. Frame: Well, the critical thing is elevation. If you just came out here and planted new plants in bare spots, they wouldn’t do any better than the plants you see now. This is not a bad elevation here. If we were lower down, in that marsh over there, which is lower elevation, the control site, it has to have new sand placed on it to make it higher. And when you get the right elevation, then the plants will thrive. And that’s the whole point behind bringing sand from the channel deepening projects and elsewhere. The sand is cleaner than any other kind of mixture of sands, silts, sediments, clay. All those fine particle things have a lot of contaminants bound to them but the sand is relatively free of contaminants, so you’re bringing clean sand, like 95% sand and you raise the elevation. And it’s kind of mimicking the natural process because in the natural salt marshes, the waves during storms or full-moon tides wash up sand in the piles that are higher than normal. And those high spots are where grass takes root and you see it starts growing and then it keeps expanding over the years to make new salt marshes. Bigger and bigger every year. And also, in the process, it makes an ideal nesting site for horseshoe crabs because they like that elevation that is optimal for marsh plants. And then placing sand on top of these lower marshes, it contains the contaminants that are there. It excludes them from the current environment. It just puts them in “cold storage” for future centuries. So all these projects in restoring marshes in the bay is actually improving the quality of the bay bottom and the marshes by covering the contaminated materials with cleaner materials all the time. Cleaner and cleaner and cleaner. The big restorations that the Army Corps of Engineers does have a much thicker layer of sand than we have here and it really keeps the—oh this willet over there has a nest over there. Anyway, it keeps the sediments contained so that they don’t wash out into the present environment. But it’s inevitable some time in the future a century from now, more or less, that there will be some kind of a change in the environment that allows sediments to liberate some of the contaminants. But for us, and for the next few generations, it makes everything cleaner and better.",
