Various pieces of equipment are on display within the complex. Buildings within the city of Scranton can be seen in the backdrop. Turntables were primarily used by railroads during the steam era. Locomotives awaiting light-duty maintenance and repairs were moved from yard tracks onto the turntable. The turntable operator would then use controls to operate the electric motors that powered the turntable to rotate, aligning the turntable tracks with those for an available maintenance bay in the roundhouse. When servicing and minor repairs were complete, the locomotive would back onto the aligned turntable, and be rotated to return to revenue service or await a new assignment.",

In 2017, park staff installed a camera to monitor this source lake to better understand the dynamics of this cycle and reoccurring event. This camera provides a daily image that allows Kenai Fjords National Park researchers to monitor the behavior of this lake and, by analyzing the photos, we are working to better understand the timing and frequency of the drainage events that lead to flooding in the proglacial lake at Bear Glacier's terminus. This camera was purchased with NPS recreational fee funds and is maintained and monitored by Kenai Fjords National Park. Updated 09/02/2020",

Parking Lot 3 is one of four large parking lots at Grand Canyon Visitor Center. If the lot appears full on the webcam, it is an indication that parking is limited at the visitor center. Continue driving and be directed by the white A-frame, \"sandwich board\" signs to find parking at one of the nearby village lots. Free shuttle buses make stops at all parking lots and can transport you around the village to lodges, shops, campgrounds, Market Plaza, the visitor center, trailheads, and scenic viewpoints.",
